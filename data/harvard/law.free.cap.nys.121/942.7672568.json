This is a claim for board at a sanitorium and for medical services. The claimant, Wallace E. Brown, was a physician, specializing in cases of cancer, and maintaining a sanitorium in Massachusetts. Decedent was a lady with a separate estate of about $20,000 and an annual income of about $12,000. She was afflicted with what was believed to be cancer in the breast, and after treatment by her family physician decided to go to claimant\u2019s sanitorium for treatment. She went twice. On the first occasion it is conceded that she paid her own board. The present claim is in part for board on her second visit, and in part for professional services.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-17\">The amount is not seriously questioned. The only question is whether she contracted the indebtedness, or her husband did. He is president of a savings bank, with a salary of $5,000 per annum, and as against him the statute of limitation has run. There is no doubt of the rule that the primary liability for medical treatment furnished to a wife rests, upon her husband, and that the wife is not personally liable therefor, in the absence of a special agreement by her to make herself responsible. Such an agreement, however, need not be shown by direct evidence, but\" may be found upon evidence of surrounding circumstances, including acts after the service, indicating an acknowledgment of liability for the service. In the present case decedent\u2019s husband accompanied her to claimant\u2019s sanitorium and made arrangements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>for the price to be paid for board. The husband says that he made these arrangements \u201cacting for\u201d his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\">We do not attach as much importance to this as appellant^ does; but it has some significance, in view of the fact that the wife herself actually paid the board thus arranged for. The most significant evidence, however, is as to the wife\u2019s subsequent recognition of her liability. On September 13, 1903, claimant sent decedent a bill, in her name, for his services. To this she replied in a letter written by her husband, but in her name and by her authority, demurring at the amount of the bill, but expressing a willingness to pay a fair compensation. To this claimant replied, expressing a willingness to satisfy her as to amount, but requesting a payment of $100 \u201con account, thus protecting his rights.\u201d Thereupon she did send him her check for $100. All this seems to us to indicate a recognition by the decedent of the fact that she was personally indebted to claimant, and sufficiently establishes the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The claimant asks for interest. The claim was unliquidated, and, as now appears, was for .much too large a sum. We do not think that interest should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">The decree, in so far as appealed from, must be reversed, and the proceeding remitted to the Surrogate\u2019s Court for the entry of a decree in accordance with this opinion. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
