As described by the witnesses, Long was standing on the dock, with his right foot on the stringpiece thereof and his left on the ground, with his back towards the cart and facing the scow. He had hold of the tail board of his cart, seeking to remove the same preparatory to discharging the contents. While thus engaged, a cart belonging to defendants, driven by one of its employ\u00e9s, was backed into place at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>the same stringpiece, where it was also to be discharged. There was a distance of 35 to 40 feet between Long\u2019s cart and the end of the dock; the dock being 28 feet 3 inches wide, over 100 feet long, with a stringpiece 11 inches high.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\">The carts which went upon the dock to discharge their contents into the scow were required to occupy points opposite that part of the scow in which ashes were dumped. This part was 38 feet long. Long\u2019s cart was about in the center of this space. The city\u2019s inspector gave the order when to dump the load, and as he gave the order to the driver of the city\u2019s cart the same was backed into the space to the east of Long\u2019s cart and about one foot therefrom. As the city\u2019s cart began to back in, the horse backed too rapidly, although the driver did everything possible to make the horse go ahead and cease backing, by calling to him and hitting him with the reins; but the horse still continued backing rapidly, and Long was caught between the city\u2019s cart and the stringpiece, and, when finally released, fell to and upon the scow, whence he was removed to a hospital, where he died on August 3d.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">There is no evidence in the case to show that the space into which the city\u2019s cart was sought to be backed would have been too close to Long\u2019s person for safety, had the horse backed in properly. It affirmatively appears that the horse belonging to the defendant was a gentle animal, obedient and responsive to the reins, and had never before been fractious or unruly. It appears as well that, while Long kept working at the tail board of his cart, a number of persons upon the \u2022dock, including the city\u2019s inspector, called out \u201cLook out!\u201d and the inspector shouted, \u201cLook out, Mike!\u201d the decedent being the only person of that name then on the dock. Despite this, the decedent did \u2022nothing, so far as the evidence shows, to escape from his position of \u2022danger, which he might easily have done by jumping upon the string-piece back of his cart, or by jumping to the deck'of the scow below. 'There is naturally much confusion in the testimony as to the length \u2022of time during which these shouts continued and before Long was struck, some of the witnesses making it as much as five or six minutes; but it is clear that he had time to change his position, had he \u25a0chosen to do so. Upon the whole case, it is impossible to predicate any charge of negligence against the defendant, and the verdict is \u2022clearly against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new .trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
