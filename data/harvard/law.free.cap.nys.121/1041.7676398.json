Said note was thereafter for value duly indorsed by the said rubber company, and discounted for its benefit by the National City Bank of Akron, Ohio, which became the owner and holder thereof before maturity. The proceeds of the note were placed to the account of the rubber company, and duly checked out. Shortly before maturity the National City Bank of Akron sent said note to its correspondent, the First National Bank of Cleveland, Ohio, for collection. The First National Bank of Cleveland acknowledged receipt of samei\u00f1 a letter containing the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-5\">\u201cIn receiving and forwarding paper outside of this city, this bank acts only as your agent, using its best efforts in selecting its correspondents, and will assume no responsibility except for its own acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">It was in evidence that an agreement had been made between the two banks in 1903 which was still existing, under which the First National Bank agreed to use the same judgment in selecting correspondents to collect the items as they would if the items were their own, and, in view of the fact that the National City Bank would keep a substantial credit balance with the First National, that bank would receive no compensation for its services, and the National City would hold it to no liability other than to use due diligence in selecting first-class bank correspondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">The First National Bank of Cleveland forwarded the note to the Commercial National Bank of Chicago, 111. Said bank forwarded said note to the Illinois National Bank of Peoria, 111. Said bank thereupon forwarded the note to the People\u2019s Trust &amp; Savings Bank of Gales-burg, 111. The letter of transmissal from the Illinois National Bank, the defendant, to the People\u2019s Trust &amp; Savings Bank, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-8\">\u201cPlease find enclosed for collection and returns 8463 Western Tool Works 6432.44. Please do not hold this collection for any reason or excuse. Return . at once if not paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">By mistake of a clerk it also contained the words \u201cno protest.\u201d The clerk of the People\u2019s Trust Savings Bank of Galesburg testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-10\">\u201cI was the collection clerk of that bank. * * * On the day before maturity I called up the Western Tool Works, and notified them that we held this note for collection, and it would be due the following day, and that same would be presented at their office the day of maturity. That was the 10th day of September. I presented this note for payment at the office of the Western Tool Works to the bookkeeper. She took the note to an apartment in the rear that was part of the main office. She brought the note back to me with the information that they would report on this at our bank in the afternoon. I then took the note back to our bank. By closing time I 'had received no word from the Western Tool Works with regard to the note, and I then took it up with the assistant cashier, and he called the firm up with a last demand for payment. I mean the Western Tool Works. Payment was not made and I attached this slip here (indicating) to the note. On the slip I marked opposite for explanation why the note was being returned. I marked \u2018No attention* with just a check mark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">This exhibit reads: \u201cReturned unpaid. Reason checked, if known.\u201d Alongside are a number of items in a column \u201cCheck sent,\u201d \u201cHas been paid,\u201d \u201cWill remit,\u201d \u201cWill Write,\u201d \u201cAs requested,\u201d \u201cPayment stopped,\u201d \u201cNever pays drafts,\u201d \u201cNot correct,\u201d \u201cNo attention,\u201d \u201cFor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>signature,\u201d \u201cFor endorsement,\u201d \u201cNot enough funds,\u201d- \u201cRefused,\u201d and this check mark was opposite the words, \u201cNo attention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\">The-following day, September 11th, the defendant sent the note back to the Commercial Bank of Chicago,\u2019 with a letter reading as follows: \u201cReturned reasons, if any given, endorsed Note Galesburg, $6,432.44.\u201d No reasons were indorsed or stated. The defendant sent no other notice in regard to this note to any one at that time or for several days thereafter. The Commercial National Bank of Chicago received this letter from the defendant on September 12th, and on the same day returned the note to the defendant with the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-4\">\u201cWe return herewith note for $6,432.44 payable at Galesburg, 111. We regret to inform you that we cannot accept the item in its present condition. It was sent you subject to protest and should have been protested, if not paid at maturity. We will thank you to secure a remittance of this note and advise us at your earliest convenience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">On the same day the Commercial National of Chicago telegraphed the First National of Cleveland, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-6\">\u201cGalesburg No. 15S15 returned without protest, we forward again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">And on the same day wrote to said First National Bank of Cleveland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-8\">\u201cReferring to your collection No. 15815, a note for $6432.44, payable at Galesburg, Illinois. Our correspondent has returned this item to us unpaid, stating that parties pay no attention to their notices. We have returned same instructing them to present again and if not paid to protest and return.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">The First National of Cleveland received this telegram and letter September 13th, and on the same day wrote to the National City Bank of Akron, plaintiff\u2019s assignor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-10\">\u201cWe are to-day in receipt of a collect telegraph from the Commercial National Bank, Chicago, reading as follows: \u2018Galesburg No. 15815 returned without protest we forward again.\u2019 On looking into the matter we find it is your number 5755 on the Western Tool Works, Galesburg, for $6,432.44. We are not at present in receipt of any further information, but will keep you advised when things progress. Up to this time we seem to be out the telegraph \u00bfcharges and the item does not seem to have been paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-11\">So that on the 14th of September the National City Bank of Akron received notice in due course of mail that the note had not been paid.. It did not, however, notify the rubber company or demand payment from it as indorser. The defendant received the letter of the Commercial National of Chicago dated September 12th returning the note for protest on September 13th, and on the same day sent it back to the People\u2019s Trust &amp; Savings Bank of Galesburg, which received it on September 14th, and on that day caused the same to be presented to the maker, the Western Tool Works, but not at the Galesburg National Bank where the note was payable, and demanded payment, which was refused, and thereupon caused it to be protested and notice of dishonor and protest to be sent to all of the parties whose names appeared on the note, including the plaintiff\u2019s assignor and the original payee and indorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-12\">The evidence shows that the first notice which the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company received of the dishonor of this note was on Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>tember 17th. Because of these facts the rubber company has refused to pay the note, although solvent, and financially able to do so, and claims that it cannot be held responsible therefor. It is admitted that the Western Tool Works, the maker of the note, is insolvent and unable to pay. The plaintiff claims that, by the mistake and negligence of the defendant in inserting in its letter of transmissal to the People\u2019s Trust &amp; Savings Bank the words \u201cNo protest,\u201d the note was not properly presented and protested, and that thereby the indorser was relieved of liability, and that it has a right of action against the defendant to recover its damages thereby incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">In Montgomery County Bank v. Albany City Bank, 7 N. Y. 459, the plaintiff was the owner and holder of a draft which it transmitted for collection to the Albany City Bank, which, in turn, transmitted it to the Bank of the State of New York, at New York City. That bank did not present the draft for payment on the day it was due or give notice of nonpayment thereof to the drawers or indorsers, by means of which neglect plaintiff sustained damages to the amount of the draft. A verdict under the instructions of the court was returned against both of the defendants. The Court of Appeals reversed as to the Bank of the State of New York, and dismissed the complaint as to it, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-5\">\u201cWhen a bank receives from the owner a bill, for collection, payable either at the place where such bank carries on its business or at some distant place, it thereby becomes agent of the owner for the collection, and in the discharge of its obligations as such, if the bill has not been accepted, it is bound to present the same for acceptance, without unreasonable delay, as well as to present the same for payment, when it becomes payable; and if not accepted when presented for that purpose, or not paid, when presented for payment, it must take such steps by protest and notice as are necessary to Charge the drawer and indorser, or it will be liable to its principal, the owner, for the damages which the latter sustains by any neglect to perform such duties, unless there be some agreement to the contrary, express or implied. And, if it be necessary or convenient for the bank to employ some other bank or individual to collect the bill, either at the place of its location or at a distant place, where the bill is payable, and it does employ another bank or individual to whom it transmits the bill for that purpose, the latter, on receiving the bill and entering upon the discharge of the trust, becomes the agent of the former bank and not of the owner, and, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, is answerable to it for any neglect in the discharge of its duties as agent, whereby the former bank sustains any loss or damage. The principle is that when a trust is confided to an agent, and he whose interest is entrusted is damnified by the neglect of one whom the agent employs in the discharge of the trust, the agent employed shall answer to the person damnified. * * * The New York State Bank was the agent directly guilty of the neglect. That bank was employed to do the service by the plaintiffs agent, the Albany City Bank, as its agent, to which it was alone responsible for its acts and neglects, and for which the latter, according to the settled rule, was alone responsible to the plaintiff; there being no agreement to the contrary, express or implied. The gist of this action is the breach of duty arising out of an employment for hire, considering that breach of duty as tortious negligence, instead of considering the same circumstances as forming a breach of promise, implied from the same considerations of hire. The Bank of the State of New York, not having been employed by the bank as its agent, owed it no duty in respect to the draft, and therefore is not liable to the plaintiff for any neglect of duty which it owed to its principal, the Albany City Bank, under its contract with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">The rule laid down is still the settled law of the state of New York (Commercial Bank v. Union Bank, 11 N. Y. 203; Ayrault v. Pacific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>Bank, 47 N. Y. 570, 7 Am. Rep. 489; Naser v. First National Bank, 116 N. Y. 492, 22 N. E. 1077; St. Nicholas Bank v. State National Bank, 128 N. Y. 26, 27 N. E. 849, 13 L. R. A. 241; Revere Bank v. National Bank of Republic, 172 N. Y. 102, 64 N. E. 799), and is the rule adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States (Exchange National Bank v. Third National Bank, 112 U. S. 276, 5 Sup. Ct. 141, 28 L. Ed. 722).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">It having been established by the evidence that there was a special arrangement or agreement between the Akron National Bank and the First National Bank of Cleveland, under which the obligation of the Cleveland Bank was confined to due care in the choice of its correspondents, it follows that no cause of action by reason of the acts complained of accrued against the First National of Cleveland. The cases which we have examined have considered the liability of the first collecting bank. We have in the case at bar a chain of banks. The responsibility of the Cleveland bank was limited to the proper choice of a collecting agent. It chose the Commercial National of Chicago. Under the doctrine of the Montgomery County Bank Case, by the special agreement between the Akron Bank and the Cleveland Bank, the Commercial Bank of Chicago became the agent of the Akron Bank, and, if the loss had occurred through its negligence, would have been responsible over. It must be borne in mind that the note which had been indorsed to the order of the First National of Cleveland was by it delivered to the Commercial of Chicago with the indorsement, \u201cPay to the order of any bank, bankers, brokers or trust company; all previous indorsements guaranteed\u201d by the First National of Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">-The agreement was that the Cleveland Bank should be only held liable for due care in its choice of its correspondents. Its choice was made when it sent the note to the Chicago bank. What relations existed between.it and the Chicago bank does not appear from the record. In the absence of proof of a special agreement, we must assume that the commercial rule laid down in the Montgomery County Bank Case applies, and that it was responsible to the Cleveland bank, from whom it received the note, for negligence upon its part or that of its agent. But there was no agreement between it and the Akron Bank, and there was no authority from the Akron Bank to it, or from the Cleveland bank to it, to choose as the agent of the Akron bank a proper person, and thereby be exempted from all liability to either of said banks for any neglect or default of said agent.' The Chicago bank, in turn, sent the note to the defendant, and again there is in the record no evidence of any special agreement between the Chicago bank and the Peoria bank which affected the general rule of law heretofore indicated. The Peoria bank in its turn sent the note to the People\u2019s Savings &amp; Trust Company at Galesburg, and there is no evidence of any special contract or arrangement between those two banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">The note was by its terms made payable at the Galesburg National Bank. It was not presented at said bank for payment, either upon the first occasion of its transmissal to the People\u2019s Savings &amp; Trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>Company, nor upon the second time when it was protested. The rule of law in this state is that to hold an indorser the bill or note must be presented at the time and place where made payable. Parker v. Stroud, 98 N. Y. 379, 50 Am. Rep. 685; National Hudson River Bank v. Kinderhook &amp; H. R. Co., 17 App. Div. 232, 45 N. Y. Supp. 588, affirmed 162 N. Y. 623, 57 N. E. 1118. Formal protest by a notary public is not essential to hold an indorser. It is mere proof. What is essential is presentment and demand at the time and place provided for in the instrument, followed by notice to the indorser of such presentment, demand, and nonpayment. So, notwithstanding the words \u201cno protest\u201d in the letter of transmissal from the defendant to the People\u2019s Savings &amp; Trust Bank, it was still the duty of the said bank, having in its possession an indorsed note for collection, to have presented it upon the due day at the Galesburg National Bank where made payable. If it had been so presented and a notice of such presentation had been sent back down through the line of banks, the rubber company would have been held upon its obligation, irrespective of the fact that the note had not been protested, and it was the failure to present and notify which relieved the indorser, if it has been relieved. That failure was the failure of the Galesburg bank, and not of the Peoria bank, and it seems to us it cannot be said, in view of the facts of this case, that the words \u201cno protest\u201d in the defendant\u2019s letter constituted the proximate cause of the release of the indorser. So, if we assume that the special agreement between the Akron bank and the Cleveland bank had the force and effect of constituting each of the banks in the chain the agents of the Akron bank, then, each being responsible for its defaults and only its own defaults, it follows that the wrong party has been sued, the right of action, if any, being against the People\u2019s Savings &amp; Trust Company of Galesburg for its failure to properly present the note at the tim\u00e9 and place where and when made payable. If, on the other hand, the special agreement was exhausted when the Cleveland bank exercised its power to choose an agent and did not confer a similar power upon the Chicago bank, why then the Chicago bank, under the rule in the Montgomery County Bank Case, must be considered to be the collecting bank and responsible for any subsequent default. \"The bank of the state of New York not having been employed by the (plaintiff) bank as its agent owed it no duty in respect to the draft, and therefore is not liable to the plaintiff for .any neglect of duty which it owed to its principal, the Albany City Bank, under its contract with it.\u201d Montgomery Bank Case, supra. The Supreme Court of the United States, adopting the rule of the Montgomery County Bank Case, in the Exchange National Bank Case, supra, did so upon the ground that it was a general rule of commercial law. It seems to us that the banking community have a right to rely upon it. To sustain the judgment in this case would be to hold that the defendant without knowledge of the special agreement, though with knowledge of the general rule, was liable not to its immediate predecessor, but to a remote principal upon the doctrine of agency of an undisclosed principal and for a negligence not of its own but of its correspondent. If the plaintiff is right, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>chain once broken all the links fall apart, and it has the right to sue any one, it should have proceeded against the People\u2019s Savings &amp; Trust Company. If it is not right and the rule has only been affected so far as the Cleveland and the Chicago banks are concerned, it has no privity with the defendant, or right to sue it, even assuming, which we do not at all concede, that its act in allowing the words \u201cno protest\u201d to appear upon its letter of transmissal was the proximate cause of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">It follows, therefore, that the judgment- appealed from should be reversed and a new trial ordered before another referee, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
