The court found that the complaint should be dismissed as toFromson, McGuire, and Friedman, and that no cause of action in equity was established as to any other defendants, and that the plaintiff have an order placing the case as to Feiering upon the calendar for the trial of issues by jury. The judgment embodies the finding, except as to the permission for a jury trial as regards Feiering. The appeal is from the judgment only. It was found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u201cThat there was no assumption on the part of the plaintiff herein of the obligation to purchase the real property described in the complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The evidence is not returned. As there is no evidence or finding that the assignee assumed any personal liability for the performance of the contract, he cannot maintain this action. Hugel v. Habel (First Department, 1909) 132 App. Div. 327, 117 N. Y. Supp. 78. There is an entire absence of mutuality between the assignee and the vendor, which precludes the relief plaintiff seeks. Wadick v. Mace, 191 N. Y. 1, 83 N. E. 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
