Snyder, wife of a realty man of No. 312 West 109th Street in an embarrassing situation several days ago. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>A process server was permitted to enter Mrs. Snyder\u2019s bath room when she was in the tub. That enabled him to serve on her a subpoena in supplementary proceedings on a judgment of $40 obtained by butcher against her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b975-3\">\u201cThat horrid process server,\u201d Mrs. Snyder blushingly explained in court, \u201cwalked right into my bath room to serve his subpoena, and I was in the bath tub.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b975-4\">. The case before the court was to have been a motion to have the subpoena vacated on the ground that it was impossible for the process server to identify Mrs. Snyder in the circumstances. It was shown that the man had retreated when he saw Mrs. Snyder in the tub because she started to scream. He served the paper, however, by giving it to a hand which was extended from the bath room. The fact that the hand was attached to a naked arm led the man to believe he was giving the paper to the woman whom he surprised in the tub, and he was sure that woman was Mrs. Snyder. Thompson &amp; Ballantine of No. 27 William' Street, counsel for Emil Oppemheimer, the judgment creditor, refused to tell the name of the process server, suggesting it would be harmful to the man- in his business if his identity were revealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b975-5\">As the lawyers told the story to Judge La Fetra, the subpoena server reached the Snyder home shortly after Snyder had gone down town to. business. Mrs. \"Snyder was taking her morning bath when the bell rang. Her Irish maid, mentioned in court only as Bridget, opened the door. The process server walked into the flat, and insisted on seeing Mrs. Snyder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b975-6\">\u201cBut, sir,\u201d the girl said, \u201cshe\u2019s in the bath tub.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any difference,\u201d the man replied, \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s anxious to see me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b975-7\">The maid took him at his word, led him to the bath room, and threw open the door. The man stepped in and then saw his predicament. Mrs. Snyder impressed it on him further by screaming excitedly. The man dodged out of the room, pulling the door after him, but insisted that Mrs. Snyder come out of the tub and get the paper. She was only too willing to do that, so she 'could slam the door and lock it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b975-8\">She alleged said article to be wholly false.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b975-9\">Argued before INGRAHAM, P.

See Lamberti v. Sun Printing &amp; Publishing Co., 111 App. Div. 437, 97 N. Y. Supp. 694. The point of the story, if it have a point, seems to be the ability of the process server to identify her. She is made to appear in court and relate the story of the service of the subpoena upon her in a proceeding to test that question, which the article says.\u201cwas to have been a motion to have the subpoena vacated on the ground that it was impossible for the process server to identify her in the circumstances.\u201d Whether any covert meaning was intended by the use of the past tense is not plain. The article stated that the process server was sure that the woman he surprised was the plaintiff. Her maid is said to have admitted a man to her bath room- while she was taking a bath, upon his assurance that she was very anxious to see him. The sting of that is not taken out by calling it the mistake of a \u201cnaive\u201d maid, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>by saying-that the'plaintiff resented the intrusion. \u2022 Servants in many ways reflect the character of their master or mistress.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\">An article may be libelous, though it does not impute immoral conduct. The whole tenor of this article is to ridicule the plaintiff. It has a direct tendency to lower her in the estimation of the community, though it may not charge immoral conduct, or impute immoral character. It is unnecessary to cite authority for the general definition of libel; but see Triggs v. Sun Printing &amp; Publishing Co., 179 N. Y. 144, 71 N. E. 739, 66 L. R. A. 612, 103 Am. St. Rep. 841, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The defendant contends that the article is innocent, and belongs to a class generally recognized as having a \u201cnews value.\u201d It is difficult to perceive what news value it can have, and impossible to discover its literary value. If newspapers see fit to give their readers fiction as news, they do so at their peril. Such an article should not be held harmless, unless, in the language of Judge Martin in the Triggs Case, it is \u201cperfectly manifest\u201d that it is. .</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The interlocutory judgment should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer overruled, with the usual leave to plead over on payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
