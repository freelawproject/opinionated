The complaint served with the summons sets forth that the defendant appellant is a corporation. The appellant\u2019s' affidavits show that the person who was served with the summons and complaint was not an officer, managing agent, or director, but was only a pharmacist employed by the defendant corporation. Whether or not the action against \u201cJ. Jung7 mann\u201d was against a natural person or a corporation does not appear in the summons; but it is sufficiently clear from the affidavits of the appellant that J. Jungmann neither as a natural person nor as a corporation was properly served.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-18\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed.
