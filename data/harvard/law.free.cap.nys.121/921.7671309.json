On December 1, 1909, the defendant\u2019s attorney signed a consent, at the request of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, to the entry of an order naming a Mr. Warren as referee to hear and determine the issues herein. Mr. Warren refused to serve, and suggested that Mr. Grossman be substituted instead. This was consented to by the attorneys for both of the parties. On December 14, 1909, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney sent to the defendant\u2019s attorney a proposed order appointing Mr. Gross-man referee and a consent to the entry thereof. The attorney for the defendant signed this consent and mailed it to the attorney for the plaintiff on December 18, 1909. On December 17, 1909, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney served a notice of motion upon the defendant\u2019s attorney, returnable December 21, 1909, for the appointment of a referee in the place of Mr. Warren. Upon the return day of the motion the defendant did not appear, and the motion was granted on default. As the plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not at this time call to the attention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>court' the consent which the defendant\u2019s attorney had signed to the appointment of Mr. Grossman as referee, the court appointed some one else.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">We think that the defendant\u2019s attorney was misled, and that he was justified in believing that, if he did not appear upon the return' day of the motion, the order, to\" which he had consented, appointing Mr. Grossman referee, would be presented to the court by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The action' was not referable without the consent of the parties, and the defendant, by consenting to the entry of an order to refer the cause to a particular referee, did not waive his right to a trial by the court, dr by a jury, if for any reason the person consented to was not named as referee. Preston v. Morrow, 66 N. Y. 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to vacate the order of reference is granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
