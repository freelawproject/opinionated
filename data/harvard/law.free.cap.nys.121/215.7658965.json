(dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"A1s\">Plaintiff sues on a written contract signed by defendant\u2019s alleged agent. Under plaintiff\u2019s promise to connect the testimony, and over objection, the court allowed evidence to be introduced about the possession of defendant\u2019s business card by the alleged agent, about his presence in the defendant\u2019s office, and about orders or directions given by him to some employ\u00e9s in defendant\u2019s store. This testimony was not connected, but the court denied defendant\u2019s motion to strike it out. As the trial was before a jury, all this testimony was clearly prejudicial, and for this error judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
