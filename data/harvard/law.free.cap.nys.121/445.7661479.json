The plaintiff\u2019s theory of action is a breach of contract of carriage. Before he can rely upon a breach of contract, he must establish the contract. He failed to do so. He did not produce the transfer ticket or give secondary evidence of its character or of its validity for the use that he attempted to make of it. The conductor was not bound to accept a transfer ticket because the plaintiff thought it was good. If the \u25a0conductor refused carriage for a valid transfer'ticket, then there would have been a breach of the contract. When the transfer was refused, the plaintiff should have paid his fare or should have left the car; for, if the conductor was wrong, the passenger would have had his remedy \u25a0against the defendant. He could not enforce his contract by force. Until the plaintiff proved that the defendant was obligated to carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>him for the transfer ticket which he tendered, his action is for battery, in that excessive force was used to eject him from a car which he had refused to leave upon the demand of the defendant, and which refusal was followed by resistance to expulsion. But the Municipal Court has not jurisdiction of actions for assault or battery. Miller v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 127 App. Div. 197, 111 N. Y. Supp. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial is ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
