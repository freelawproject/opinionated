Section 3268 of the Code authorizes the defendant to require security for costs when the plaintiff resides without \u201cthe city or county * * * wherein the court is located.\u201d In so far as this section applies to the City Court of the city of New York, residence in the borough of Brooklyn is not residence within the city or county where the City Court is-located.
