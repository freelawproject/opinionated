It was agreed that the lessee should have the option to renew the lease at its expiration for the period of three years, and that a written lease should be executed to contain that stipulation. No written agreement was executed, and because of this the municipal justice dismissed the complaint at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case. The evidence of the plaintiff shows the oral letting to have been for the period of three months, and that a payment was made at the time on account of the rent to become due. This constituted a legal renting, and cannot be influenced by the fact that the plaintiff made a further unenforceable agreement with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">The judgment of the Municipal Court must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
