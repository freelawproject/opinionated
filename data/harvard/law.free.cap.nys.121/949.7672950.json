This action was begun by publication extending from August to December, 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-19\">The plaintiff is obviously a resident of Nassau county. On January 27, 1909, she made an affidavit, to avoid taxation in New York county, that she then resided in and had for 15 years been a resident of Nassau county. On or about May 15, 1909, she executed a deed of real estate in this county, in which she described herself as of \u201cthe village of Glen Cove, New York,\u201d which is in Nassau county. She does not deny that she .is a resident of Nassau county, but merely says that during her husband\u2019s lifetime she \u201cspent the winter months in New York City and the summer months at my country place in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Glen Cove.\u201d She also says that at the time the cause of action arose she owned a house No. 3 East Sixty-Seventh street, \u201cand lived there, and for many years prior thereto.\u201d This is the same house that she sold in May, 1909, before the commencement of this action. The plaintiff is beyond dispute a resident of Nassau county, and it sufficiently appears that the defendant'also resides in Nassau county.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
