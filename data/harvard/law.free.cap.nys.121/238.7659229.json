Sweet v. Tuttle, 14 N. Y. 465, 471-472; Knapp v. Smith, 27 N. Y. 277, 281; De Wolf v. Williams, 69 N. Y. 621, 622; Kelly v. Doody, 116 N. Y. 575, 583, 22 N. E. 1084; Frear v. Sweet, 118 N. Y. 454, 459-460, 23 N. E. 910; Pichler v. Reese, 171 N. Y. 577, 578, 64 N. E. 441; People v. Mingey, 190 N. Y. 51, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>64, 66, 82 N. E. 728. And the rule was followed in Levy v. Huwer, 80 App. Div. 499, 81 N. Y. Supp. 191. In but one case, Nicolay v. Unger, 80 N. Y. 54, 56, has the Court of Appeals approved the exclusion of such a question. It has, however, often said that it is but a narrow dividing line which separates the permissible from the obnoxious questions of this character\u2014a line to be drawn according to the circumstances of the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\">In the case at bar, the correctness of the ruling of the trial judge in excluding the question is confirmed by the fact that, after the exclusion, plaintiff endeavored to prove Ruble\u2019s agency by other testimony, but failed to do so, thus demonstrating that the answer to the question, had it been allowed, would have been a statement of a mere conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
