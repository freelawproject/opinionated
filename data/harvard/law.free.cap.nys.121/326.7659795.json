The lease, among other things, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-18\">\u201cThat in case of the failure to pay the rent or any part thereof, * * * or if the premises shall become vacant during the term, * * * it shall be lawful for the landlord, or the landlord\u2019s agents or assigns, either to re-enter upon the demised premises and remove all persons therefrom, or to dispossess the tenant, * * * or to re-enter the same and use such force for the purpose as the landlord or his agents or assigns shall deem proper, without being liable to any prosecution by civil or criminal action or proceeding therefor.\u2019\u2019 .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-19\">It was contended on the trial by the defendant that this provision of the lease was illegal, as against public policy; that it furnished part of the consideration, and, therefore, the lease could not be enforced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>by the plaintiff, as against the defendant. The court sustained the contention of the defendant, and directed judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\">We are of the opinion that, while the clause providing that the landlord should not be liable to any prosecution by criminal action or proceeding was illegal and void, the contract as an entirety _ was for a legal purpose and is enforceable, irrespective of the clause in question. The consideration for the lease was the rent reserved. The provision for re-entry, aside from the objectionable clause, was the ordinary provision contained in leases of this character. The defendant, haying entered into possession of the premises under the contract, was in a position to maintain his right to continued occupancy of the premises during the term of the lease. It does not appear, and cannot be presumed, that it was the intent of the parties that the law should be violated. Lorillard v. Clyde, 86 N. Y. 384; Shedlinsky v. Budweiser Brewing Company, 163 N. Y. 437, 57 N. E. 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
