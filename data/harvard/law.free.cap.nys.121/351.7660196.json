Both, the plaintiff and the defendant were members of the Musical Mutual Protective Union. The union\u2019s by-laws provided that: \u201cIt shall be the duty of every member to refuse to perform in any orchestra or band in which any person or persons are engaged who are not members in good standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In July the plaintiff had some trouble with the union, and according to his own story the defendant said: \u201cYou are suspended from the union.\u201d The plaintiff then said he didn\u2019t know anything \u2022 about it, and defendant said: \u201cI am very sorry; from this day your services are not required.\u201d Later plaintiff testified that defendant added:. \u201cUnless you fix with the union.\u201d Plaintiff claims that he never was notified that he was expelled from the union, and defendant\u2019s evidence on that point was incompetent; but plaintiff stated that: \u201cBefore I was suspended, he asked me if .he would not\u2019pay for me that fine, and I said: \u2018No; because I am right. I don\u2019t want to have any obligation 'to anybody.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Disregarding the defendant\u2019s testimony, we have the plaintiff\u2019s admission that he was fined by the union, that defendant offered to pay the fine, that he was thereafter suspended from the union, and that defendant then told him that he would not require his services until he arranged his trouble with the union. The trial justice held that this constituted a wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">It seems to me that, where two members of a protective union enter into a contract of employment, there is a presumption that the contract is to be read in the light of the union\u2019s by-laws, in so far as these bylaws attempt tb regulate the terms of employment of its members, and that the defendant could properly discharge the plaintiff when under the by-laws of the union the plaintiff was precluded from performing his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with, costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
