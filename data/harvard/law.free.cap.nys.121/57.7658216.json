Said order provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-21\">\u201cOrdered, that until such service all proceedings on the part of the plaintiff or his attorney to force this action to trial be and the same are hereby stayed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-22\">On December 31, 1909, this order was resettled so as to provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-23\">\u201cOrdered, that until such service all proceedings on the part of the plaintiff and his attorneys be and the same are hereby stayed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-24\">From said order, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-25\">This order must be reversed for these reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-26\">First. It was improper to 'resettle an order, over two months after it had been entered, by providing for a stay of all proceedings, and thereby attempt to invalidate or make ineffective such proceedings as had been taken ad interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-27\">Second. Under no circumstances should an order providing for the service of a bill of particulars provide for the stay of all proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ings in an action. There may be many proceedings advisable or necessary to be taken in an action, having no possible relation to the service of a bill of particulars, which should not be interfered with. Such provision was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Third. The remedy for noncompliance with an order for the service of a bill of particulars is to be determined when the failure to \u2022comply has been established; and a provision in an order providing for the service of a bill of particulars imposing a penalty for failure to obey said order is improper. Foster v. Curtis, 121 App. Div. 689, 106 N. Y. Supp. 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and \u2022disbursements, and the motion to resettle the order of October 22, 1909, denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
