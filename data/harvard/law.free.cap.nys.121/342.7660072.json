It is charged in the complaint that the defendant Boross, in violation of his trust and duty to the plaintiff, caused such contract to be procured for the benefit of said defendant corporation, instead of the plaintiff, for which wrongful act damages are asked. The order vacated limits the examination to circumstances relating to the change in the draft cablegram before it was transmitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">The defendant is charged with a violation of fiduciary duties. \u25a0 The plaintiff desires to examine him relative to a matter which he alone can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>explain. It is made plain that this examination is desired for the purpose of procuring testimony which it is necessary for the plaintiff to have to establish its case.. If ever a proper case was presented for the examination of a party before trial, this would seem to be such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
