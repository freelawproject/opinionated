Estimating the total cost of the building as completed to be $150,765, plaintiff sued for $8,293.65, as the damages caused by the breach, and recovered a verdict of $5,002.65.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The defendant denied that any contract had been made, but averred that, at the plaintiff\u2019s solicitation, he allowed him to make sketches for a proposed residence, upon defendant\u2019s written agreement that, if defendant would give the plaintiff a trial, the former would be under no obligation to the latter until such sketches had met with the defendant\u2019s, approval, and that, should plaintiff\u2019s services at any time before such approval prove in any way unsatisfactory, he would retire as architect, with claim of no kind whatsoever for services, upon the return to him of the sketches. The defendant further claimed that plaintiff\u2019s services were limited to the making of certain pencil sketches and drawings, that they were performed entirely within the terms of the letter hereinafter set forth, and that no further services were rendered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">There was produced a letter, whose authenticity is not questioned, and which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">Abner J. Haydel, 156 Fifth Ave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-11\">New York, June 3, 1904. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-12\">Dear Mr. Gould: After making various sketches for your proposed residence, I really feel that, at best, it is merely guessing at what you desire, and consequently I beg to suggest that in order that I might give you a house that will suit your taste and requirements that we go over the premises more fully and then try various sketches in line with your ideas, and if you will kindly give me such a trial, I hereby agree that in no way will you be under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>obligation to me till the said sketches meet your approval, and should at any time before said approval I become in any way unsatisfactory, I will retire, on \u25a0return to me of all the sketches, without claim on you for such services performed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">Hoping I may be given the desired opportunity, I am</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">Very truly yours, \u00b0 Abner J. Haydel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">To Mr. Charles A. Gould, 1 West 34th Street.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">It was defendant\u2019s contention that this letter contained the full agreement of the parties, while plaintiff urged it was but a portion of the entire agreement. Defendant denies that he ever accepted or approved the sketches furnished, as he claims, in accordance \"with this letter. There were, then, two issues presented for the consideration of the jury: (1) The terms of the agreement between the plaintiff and defendant; (2) the acceptance or rejection of the preliminary sketches.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">During the course of the trial, certain exhibits were received in evidence which were outside of any issue in the case, and the reception of which was undoubtedly prejudicial to defendant. The questions submitted depended for their determination upon the view which the jury might take of the relative weight to be given to the testimony of the plaintiff and the defendant, who were the sole witnesses both to the making of the contract and to the disposition made of the plans. The terms of the original agreement were of the utmost importance, and plaintiff by his complaint had set forth at length what he claimed them to be. There was offered in evidence an article published in the Scientific American, describing a building theretofore erected at Newport, R. I. by plaintiff, together with an editorial in the same issue favorably commenting upon the plaintiff\u2019s professional services in connection therewith. Objection was made to the receipt of this paper, the sole connection of which with the defendant was to be found in plaintiff\u2019s testimony that_ he had shown this paper to defendant, having brought it with him, because it contained practically all the photographs of Gray Crag, which he had previously shown him; that plaintiff talked over the article with the defendant; that defendant looked over the plans; and that plaintiff thought that defendant looked over the printed editorial matter in regard to Gray Crag. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel contended that, if defendant read the editorial and commented upon it, the same was made a part of the contract between them. Upon this statement, the entire paper was received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">It is obvious that this was error, for it was not the plaintiff\u2019s \u25a0contention that he was employed to make plans and sketches of a building which should be identical with or conform to those of Gray Crag; on the contrary, he admits that his undertaking was to furnish sketches which should be satisfaqtory to and approved by the defendant. Therefore the plans of Gray Crag could have no possible bearing upon this controversy, nor could the editorial be admitted in evidence from any point of view. It was what the plaintiff himself characterized it, \u201ca little puff for myself.\u201d Appearing in a well-known paper, its effect was doubtless to fortify the plaintiff\u2019s position by indirectly vouching for his professional skill. It may be said that later in the trial the claim was abandoned by plaintiff that this editorial was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>any part of the contract, although it had been received in evidence upon that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">It was error as well to receive in evidence two letters, plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits Nos. 16 and 17, which are simply self-serving declarations, having no bearing upon any issue in the case, and whose sole effect would be to demonstrate plaintiff\u2019s willingness to do anything within reason to meet defendant\u2019s views or to amicably settle the matters in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Judgment and order appealed, from reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
