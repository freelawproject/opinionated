Keeler, 53 N. Y. 114, 121), and there is nothing in the power of attorney to indicate the contrary, but much that is confirmatory. Eor this reason, as well as that stated in Kind v. Cortis (decided herewith) 121 N. Y. Supp. 323, the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
