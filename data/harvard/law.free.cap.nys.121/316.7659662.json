Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-19\">The undisputed testimony shows plaintiff\u2019s salary $2,000, the fur-nishing of transcripts ordered as alleged, the reasonableness of the .charge per folio, demand upon the city, and refusal of payment. He admits that he can make no extra charge for furnishing \u201can abstract of the testimony\u201d (vide section 1777, Consolidation Act [Laws 1882, c. 410]), but urges that when, upon request of the district attorney, he furnishes a \u201ctranscript\u201d of the minutes of testimony, he may require the city to compensate him therefor in addition to his salary. A \u201ctran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u25a0script\u201d doubtless involves more labor than an \u201cabstract\u201d; but we are furnished with no authority holding that the district attorney may bind the city to any expense not within or beyond the appropriation allowed \"by the board of estimate and apportionment for the conduct of his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">No recovery here may be had unless upon section 1768 of the consolidation act, which provides that the coroners\u2019 stenographers shall receive a salary and six cents per folio for all transcripts made for the use of the district attorney\u2019s office by direction of said board. That provision was not superseded by the charter act (Laws 1897, c. 378, \u00a7 1571), because the provision there, for the appointment of coroners\u2019 \u25a0stenographers was silent as to salary and compensation. Baker v. New York, 56 App. Div. 350, 67 N. Y. Supp. 814. And by sections 1608, 1610, the consolidation act was preserved in effect as to the subject-matter of provisions not revised nor included in the charter act and not inconsistent therewith. Since the decision in Baker v. New York, supra, the matter of the salary of the coroners\u2019 stenographers has been the subj ect of legislation, one result of which is that the salary is fixed by the board of estimate and apportionment, and not by the consolidation act. Revised Charter 1901 (Laws 1901, c. 466), as amended by Laws 1902, cc. 435, 436; Hamburger v. Board of Estimate, 109 App. Div. 427, 96 N. Y. Supp. 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The amendatory provisions here involved relate only to the fixing of salary. The compensation for transcripts furnished the district attorney\u2019s office covered by section 1768 of the consolidation act is not the same thing as salary. Benedict v. United States, 176 U. S. 360, 20 Sup. Ct. 458, 44 L. Ed. 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Judgment reversed, and complaint dismissed, with costs in this court .and in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">GIEGERICH, J., concurs. LEHMAN, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
