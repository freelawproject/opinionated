The action is for damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, who was a laborer employed in cleaning defendant\u2019s locomotives at its yard at Wakefield.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-19\">This yard was the connecting point between defendant\u2019s electric service and its steam service, where the electric motors used to draw trains in and out of the city of New York are substituted for steam locomotives used on other parts of defendant\u2019s line. There are, of course, a number of tracks in the yard, most of which are electrically equipped, although some are without such equipment. The electrical equipment was what is known as the \u201cthird- rail\u201d system, consisting of a rail charged with electricity, fastened to the ties at the same level as the rails of the track, and distant 18 or 20 inches from one of the traction rails. Thig \u201clive\u201d rail was covered on the top and on the side furthest from the track by a wooden covering held in place by a series of earthenware clamps. The purpose of this covering was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>to protect persons walking in the yard from coming in contact with the \u201clive\u201d rail. There was evidence that the \u201clive\u201d rail was not completely covered at the point where the deceased met his death, and also evidence that there was a hole or depression of some 6 inches under the third rail at that point, which was full of water that had apparently overflowed from a water tank standing opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The deceased, an Italian, who spoke no English and understood but little, was engaged in wiping off and cleaning a steam locomotive which had recently come into the yard. It was standing on an electrified track, taking in water from the tank. The deceased had wiped off the driving wheels, sitting, while doing so, upon the wooden covering of the third rail as upon a bench. He then arose to a standing position, placing his hands while doing so upon the side rod connecting the two driving wheels. He had straightened up into a standing position, when he was instantly killed by a shock, of electricity, undoubtedly resulting from a contact between the back of his leg and the third rail. Although it may have been a careless act for the deceased to sit on the wooden covering of the third rail, it seems to be clear that no harm resulted from that act alone. It might, perhaps, be inferred from the evidence that the contact between his leg and the rail took place while he was rising; but the plaintiff, on this appeal, is entitled to the most favorable deductions that can be drawn from the evidence, and there is evidence to support a finding that the deceased had entirely completed the act of rising before he came into contact with the \u201clive\u201d rail.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">It was the defendant\u2019s duty to use reasonable care to provide the deceased, its servant, with a safe place to work, and, if necessary, to establish and enforce proper rules for his protection while engaged in his work, and a failure to establish such rules, or a laxity in their enforcement, constituted negligence. Morgan v. Hudson River Ore &amp; Iron Co., 133 N. Y. 666, 31 N. E. 234; Wood on Master and Servant, p. 794, \u00a7 403. In making rules for the government of its employes, a railroad corporation is bound to use ordinary care, and to anticipate and guard against such accidents and casualties as may be reasonably foreseen by its managers in the exercise of such ordinary care. Berrigan v. N. Y., Lake Erie &amp; W. R. Co., 131 N. Y. 582, 30 N. E. 57. The duty of the master and the degree of care which he is called upon' to exercise is measured by the law of ordinary diligence, having regard to the danger to be apprehended, and whether or not the cas\u00e9 is one calling for the establishment and enforcement of rules is usually a question for the jury. Devoe v. N. Y. Cent. &amp; Hudson River R. Co., 174 N. Y. 1, 66 N. E. 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">It is only where it is clear beyond dispute that the situation was not one calling for rules, or one in which no rule could have prevented the accident, that the court' is justified in holding as matter of law that the master was under no obligation to have established rules. This, in our opinion, was not such a case. A railroad yard, is, at best, a dangerous place to work in, and the courts have frequently held that a duty rested upon the master to adopt proper rules for the protection of its employ\u00e9s who are required to work therein. In the defendant\u2019s Wakefield yard there was added to other sources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>of danger the \u201clive\u201d rails carrying charges of electricity sufficient to produce instant death. The existence of this danger is, of course, patent, and it would seem that it should not be difficult to establish rules which would at least minimize the danger to. those employed as the decedent was. At all events, it was a fair question for the jury, and should have been submitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">So, too, the evidence as to a depression under the third rail suggests a question as to whether the defendant had performed its full duty of providing a safe place to work. Ordinarily, such a depression would perhaps be too trivial to notice; but when taken in conjunction with the \u201clive\u201d rail, and the protrusion of an unguarded part of the rail, or an iron attachment, it might reasonably he held to assume a serious aspect. We think that the evidence as it stood warranted a submission of the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The judgment and order appealed from must therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
