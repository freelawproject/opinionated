The system of signals adopted was that in common use for years in similar works, and under it one bell was \u2022an order to raise the elevator, one bell to stop it, two bells to lower it, \u25a0and three bells to lower it slowly. There was a signalman at the bottom of the shaft, whose duty it was to see that the material was properly placed on the elevator, and then to notify the engineer thereof, and another at the top of the shaft, whose duty it was to direct its movements for the two upper floors only. There was no \u25a0one in sole charge of the operation of the elevator on the other floors, and any person might give a signal for its raising or lowering on any \u2022one of 9 stories out of th(e <em>1%, </em>which would be obeyed by the engineer, regardless of what the position of the elevator might then be, or of who might be working about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The bell rope which gave the signals was exposed and could be bandied and used by any one in the building, whether an employ\u00e9 \u2022or not. What might well have been foreseen as the inevitable result \u25a0of such a condition actually happened in this case, as it must have happened in many others. No one was expected to go upon the elevator ; but the laborers, in wheeling the \u2022 barrows on or off its platform, were liable to be dragged down or up, while holding onto the handles of the barrows, through the sudden dropping or raising of the elevator, which ran as rapidly as 550 feet a minute. Plaintiff was working on the fifth floor, had doubled up two barrows on the platform, and was putting on two more, when in response to a signal from some unknown source the elevator was suddenly started upwards, and plaintiff, who still had hold of the handles of one of the barrows, was lifted to and on his toes, and when the barrow fell from the elevator was precipitated to the ground floor. The elevator was then stopped within two feet of the sixth floor; but there is no proof of who gave the signal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">It would have been perfectly proper to have submitted the question \u25a0of defendant\u2019s liability under the common law to the jury, upon the theory that the accident had been caused solely by the failure to establish and enforce proper rules for the operation of the elevator, and for the protection of its employ\u00e9s from injury while working in loading or unloading it, upon proof that the necessity for such precaution should, in the exercise of reasonable care, have been foreseen and anticipated. It would seem that provision could well have been made for a warning to all the floors of any intended change in its position, even if no one were specially detailed to each floor with \u25a0sole control of the giving of signals. But -this trial was conducted upon the theory that liability ,was created under the employer\u2019s liability act (Consol. Laws, c. 31). The notice under the act was offered in evidence, and the various motions made, as well as the charge of the learned court and its decision in denying the motion for a new trial, all demonstrate that this was the sole theory of the trial. This being so, this judgment cannot stand. After having once charged the jury as to defendant\u2019s liability to furnish a safe and proper place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>in which plaintiff was to do his work, counsel for defendant requested the court to charge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-3\">\u201cI also ask your honor to charge the jury that the rule of safe place has no \"application to this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">To which the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">\u201cI think that is so, because the accident, if occasioned by the negligence of the defendant, was by the starting of the hoist, which, if properly managed, was safe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The only remaining theory, then, upon which the cause of action came within the act, was that upon which the jury was charged\u2014that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u201cIf any. of the defendant\u2019s employes charged with the duty gave the signal [i. e., to start the elevator] it was the act of superintendence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">To this exception was duly taken. There was no evidence given as to who gave the signal, nor that any one whatever was charged with the duty of giving the signal. In fact, the very absence of such a person so charged with the duty of signaling is one of plaintiff\u2019s assignments of negligence on defendant\u2019s part. Nor can it be said, under such conditions, that the mere act of giving the signal would constitute an act of superintendence, if given by an employ\u00e9, when every employ\u00e9 was at liberty to give it, and when it did not c,ome within the assigned duty of a superintendent. In addition to which the notice given under the' act made no claim that the accident was due to any default upon the part of any person intrusted with and exercising superintendence.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">MCLAUGHLIN and LAUGHLIN, JJ., concur.
