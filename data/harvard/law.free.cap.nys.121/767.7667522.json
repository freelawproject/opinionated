Baker against the Citizens\u2019 Trust Company of Brooklyn. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AIf\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b798-8\">The opinion of Justice Blackmar at Special Term is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b798-9\">Although the evidence is very meager, yet I think it requires the finding of the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b798-10\">On April 24, 1907, the premises No. 198 Montague street were conveyed to Charles Cooper and Vennette F. Pelletreau. On the same day Cooper and Pelletreau conveyed the premises to the City Real Estate Company. The deed was given as security for a debt due from Cooper and Pelletreau, and under the understanding that the company should convey to nominees of Cooper and Pelletreau when the debt was discharged or the security released. On May 8, 1907, Cooper and Pelletreau by an instrument under seal leased the property to the defendant for a term of 10 years, to commence on the 1st day of August, 1907, at a rental of $7,580 per year payable quarterly. The lease contained a privilege to the lessee to terminate the same on giving a year\u2019s notice on or after May 1, 1912, but this clause has no bearing on the controversy before the court. The defendant took possession under the lease at the beginning of the term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b798-11\">On August 1st the City Real Estate Company, at the request of Cooper and Pelletreau, conveyed the premises to Julia B. Reeve, who held the same for Cooper and Pelletreau, and who on August 2, 1907, at their request, conveyed to Benjamin May and Leo N. Levy. When May and Levy took title, they received the lease in question from Mr. Pelletreau, and thereafter the defendant paid rent under the lease to May and Levy by crediting it to them quarterly on an account which they kept in the defendant bank. On April 3, 1908, May and Levy conveyed the premises to the plaintiff, and handed the lease to him. The defendant was notified of the transfer, and thereafter paid rent to the plaintiff up to and including the quarter ending February 1, 1909. The defendant having abandoned the premises claiming that the lease was not binding on it, this action is brought to recover $1,895.56, being the rent for the quarter beginning February 1, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b798-12\">Whether the deed given by Cooper and Pelletreau to the City Real Estate Company was a mortgage leaving them the owner of the premises or whether the legal title passed to the company, yet, when the defendant obtained possession under the lease, it could not dispute the title of Cooper and Pelletreau nor their rights as landlords under the lease. The estoppel ceases when the premises are surrendered to the landlord. But I think this means a physical surrender on the expiration of the term or a surrender accepted by the landlord which terminates the term. It does not mean that the tenant may abandon the premises and repudiate the existing obligations of the lease by denying the landlord\u2019s title. Jones v. Reilly, 174 N. Y. 97, 66 N. E. 649; Rowland v. Dillingham, 83 App. Div. 156, 82 N. Y. Supp. 470; Meleher v. Kreiser, 28 App. Div. 362, 51 N. Y. Supp. 249; Steuber v. Huber, 107 App. Div. 599, 95 N. Y. Supp. 348. The defendant therefore held as lessee of Cooper and Pelletreau under a lease with a 10-year term, and not as a tenant at will, as its counsel claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b798-13\">When the legal title at the request of Cooper and Pelletreau was conveyed through Julia B. Reeve to May and Levy and Mr. Pelletreau handed the lease to them, it evidenced an intent that they should thereafter be entitled to the rent as landlords. And the payment of the rent to May and Levy by the defendant constituted an attornment. Even if May and Levy were strangers in title to Cooper and Pelletreau, the tenant could attorn to them with Cooper and Pelletreau\u2019s consent. Section 194, Real Property Law (Laws 1896, c. 547). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>The effect of the attornment was the acceptance of Mlay and Levy as new landlords under the written lease with all its terms and conditions unchanged. Austin v. Ahearne, 61 N. Y. 6. If the lease was valid between May and Levy and the defendant, it follows that it was valid between the plaintiff and the defendant because the defendant attorned to- the plaintiff with May and Levy\u2019s consent and also by virtue of section 193 of the real property law. It seems to me, also, that the delivery of the lease from Cooper and Pelletreau to May and Levy and from them to the plaintiff under the circumstances Was equivalent to an assignment of the rents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b799-6\">Judgment for plaintiff, with costs.
