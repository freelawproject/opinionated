The plaintiff\u2019s husband was a member of the defendant. Under the constitution and by-laws of the defendant it was required to pay, upon the death of one of its members in good standing, an endowment of $250. It appears that on March 1, 1909, there was due from the plaintiff to the defendant the sum of $9.10. The husband was in arrears for over eight months. Article 21 of the defendant\u2019s constitution provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-16\">\u201cA member who does not pay bis regular monthly dues or fines for two months, and at the regular meeting of the third month fails to put himself into good standing, is considered in arrears. This arrearage continuing for three months more, the member will be declared suspended from the society.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-17\">On March 18, 1909, the husband of the plaintiff died. The other facts in the case were disputed; and, the court having rendered judgment for the plaintiff, we assume that the facts testified to by the plaintiff were true. From this evidence it appears that on March 1, 1909, the plaintiff paid the financial secretary of the defendant $9.10 and received a receipt for the same, and that 15 days later the financial secretary called on the plaintiff and offered to return this money to her, and upon her refusal to accept it threw the money on the floor and went away.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-18\">The first question to be determined is whether the fact that the deceased was in arrears for eight months operated ipso facto, and without any further action on the part of the defendant, as a suspen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>sion of the deceased from membership in the defendant. We think the question sh\u00f3uld be answered in the affirmative. Paster v. Nagelsmith, 50 Misc. Rep. 791, 63 N. Y. Supp. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The only other question requiring discussion is whether the acceptance of the $9.10' by the financial secretary was a waiver of the default of the plaintiff\u2019s husband in the payment of his dues and ejected his reinstatement. We think that - the facts proved failed to establish such a waiver on the part of the defendant, or that the financial secretary had power to waive the provision of the defendant\u2019s constitution and by-laws. Hart v. Adams Cylinder Web Press Printing Association, 69 App. Div. 578, 75 N. Y. Supp. 110. The plaintiff having failed to establish a waiver, the deceased had not at the time of his-death been reinstated as a member of the defendant, and the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to -the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
