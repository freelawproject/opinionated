The defendant, \u201cfor a separate and further defense,\u201d pleaded in one-paragraph that Rifici never retained the plaintiff as her attorney to-prosecute this action against the defendant, and in another paragraph-that upon the settlement of said action with Rifici by the defendant the said defendant did not agree to pay the plaintiff for his services-as attorney in said case, and in another paragraph that an agreement, if any, made by the defendant for payment of the attorney\u2019s fees, was-void under the statute of frauds. This appeal is from an order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike out such first and second paragraphs on the ground that they do not constitute new matter, that they are unauthorized as new matter, and that defendant be compelled to specifically state the allegations contained in each of the paragraphs as a. separate defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Examination of the pleadings shows that the defendant in its strict answer to the complaint denied both of the allegations now denied in-the further separate and distinct defense. It is well settled that a specific denial cannot be included in an affirmative defense, unless essential to make that defense complete and available; otherwise, it may be stricken out on motion. Haffen v. Tribune Association, 126 App. Div. 675, 111 N. Y. Supp. 225, and authorities cited. I think that under these authorities, and also that of Stieffel v. Tolhurst, 55 App. Div. 532, 67 N. Y. Supp. 274, the order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to strike out granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
