The proceeding is a statutory one, and all the requirements of the statute must be complied with before jurisdiction to make the order existed. If, therefore, the affidavit was lacking in any of the details required by the statute, the appellant\u2019s motion to vacate and set aside the order should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">A judgment creditor is the only person entitled to such an order, and the affidavit, if made by a person other than himself, must show authority to act for the judgment creditor, so that the application will show upon its face that the proceeding was authorized by the owner of the judgment unless the affidavit is made by the attorney for a party, when authority will be presumed. Miller v. Adams, 52 N. Y. 409. The affidavit in the case at bar is made by Sidney A. Clarkson, who sets, forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-6\">\u201cThat he is an attorney connected with the office of Albert A. Hovell, the attorney for the above-named plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">Mr. Clarkson was not the attorney for the judgment creditor. He says that Mr. Hovell was. No authority is shown in him to act for the judgment creditor in making the affidavit or instituting the proceeding. The moving papers are not signed or indorsed by Mr. Hovell, and there is no evidence that the owner of.the judgment authorized the proceeding. The case is directly within the rule stated in Brown v. Walker, 54 Hun, 639, 8 N. Y. Supp. 59, affirmed without opinion 121 N. Y. 717, 24 N. E. 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate and set aside the order granted, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">HIRSCHBERG, P.
