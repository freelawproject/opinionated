The trial court found that Lighthouse, who alone defended, was a stockholder in the corporation and the owner and holder of 50 shares of capital stock, of the par value of. $100 a share, as to the creditors of the corporation, and directed an interlocutory judgment against the stockholders, in favor of the plaintiff and all other creditors who shall come in and prove their debts, share in the expenses, and whose debts are payable within two years from the date they were contracted, and due within two years prior to the commencement of the action, and answer the other descriptions of the statute; for the appointment of a referee to take proof of the claims and solvency of the defendant stockholders, the amount unpaid by them, the expenses that will be incurred, and the amount to be paid to the several creditors by the stockholders, or such of them as shall be found solvent and within the jurisdiction of the court; and that, upon the coming in of the report, final judgment be entered fixing the several amounts for which the several defendants are liable, and the amount which such as are solvent and within the jurisdiction of the court shall in the first instance contribute, and the ultimate liability of each of such defendants, in case any contributions cannot be collected, and also fixing the proportion of said fund to which the several creditors of the Hotel Company are entitled, and other provisions incident to the primary relief, which need not be set forth here.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b833-18\">Argued before McLENNAN, P.

I think the evidence supports the finding that he was. While he did not sign the certificate incorporating the State Hotel Company, he subscribed a preliminary subscription paper to the effect that the subscribers would organize a corporation under the laws of this state, to be known as the State Hotel Company, to purchase certain real estate therein named, and thereafter conduct and carry on a hotel, the capital stock of which was to be $100,000, consisting of 100 shares, and the real estate to be put into the company at $5,500 by the present owners thereof, and paid-up stock issued to them therefor. The real estate belonged to Lighthouse. He conveyed it to some of his associates in the enterprise, who gave back a mortgage for $40,000, but paid nothing down. It was expected the corporation would take over the property and pay for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The corporation has all the power, according to its certificate of incorporation, that was contemplated by the subscription paper, and more than that. The objection now made on behalf of Lighthouse, that he is not a stockholder in the corporation because the certificate is more comprehensive in its terms, as regards the purpose and business of the corporation, than was contemplated by the subscription paper, I think is untenable. While there is no direct evidence to show that he had personal knowledge of the contents of the certificate, he knew that a corporation had been formed. He was the owner of the real property referred to in the subscription paper, and expected to be paid therefor from the proceeds of the sale of bonds of the corporation. He made loans to the company for the purpose of improving the property for a hotel. The lumber for which the judgment was obtained against the defendant, and which forms the basis of this suit, was used in improving the property. He stated to the plaintiff\u2019s agent that he was a stockholder in the corporation, and that the plaintiff would be paid for the lumber. He gave a proxy, and was represented by the holder thereof at a meeting of the stockholders of the company, which latter fact was expressly found by the trial court at the request of the defendant\u2019s attorney. In short, the evidence shows he was interested in the enterprise from the beginning, took an active part in its management, and regarded himself as a stockholder in the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">In this connection, however, it should be stated, and the trial court finds, that Lighthouse signed the subscription paper upon an oral condition, made at the time of signing, that the subscription should not be binding unless and until the company had $40,000 with which to pay the mortgage given to him. The trial judge decided, however, that the oral condition was ineffectual to defeat the legal effect of his subscription ; and I think he was right in so deciding.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">The appellant also contends that no corporation was ever formed,\" because the incorporators did not sign the certificate at the end, and therefore he never became a stockholder. The certificate was signed by the incorporators above the attestation clause, and they acknowledged the execution thereof, and the certificate of acknowledgment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>subjoined thereto. The filing of the certificate as required by law, and what was thereafter done by the incorporators, was at least sufficient to form a de facto corporation; and Lighthouse, having held himself out as a stockholder, acted as such, and taken part in the affairs of the corporation, cannot now question the legal existence of the corporation in that respect, or his liability as a stockholder, upon the ground that his written subscription was conditional. Ph\u0153nix Warehousing Co. v. Badger, 6 Hun, 293; Yonkers Gazette Co. v. Jones, 30 App. Div. 316, 51 N. Y. Supp. 973; Beals v. Buffalo Expanded Metal Construction Co., 49 App. Div. 589, 63 N. Y. Supp. 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">. Appellant further urges that the \u00e1ction is not maintainable by the plaintiff for the reason that the corporation has been dissolved, and a receiver appointed; that all the assets of the corporation are in custodia legis; that the receiver, if any one, should bring the action. It is only necessary to say that the liability here arises upon the statute itself, and that the question has been quite recently decided adversely to the appellant in this court. Ford v. Chase, 118 App. Div. 605, 103 N. Y. Supp. 30, affirmed 189 N. Y. 504, 81 N. E. 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The other objections urged by the learned counsel for the appellant have been considered, but are insufficient, as I think, to justify a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">I think the case was correctly decided, and that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
