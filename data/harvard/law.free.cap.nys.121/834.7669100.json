It does not appear that any writing by way of agreement or lease was ever executed. The defendant admitted that the plaintiff introduced Mr. Hurley to him as a proposed lessee, but denied the other allegations of the complaint. The plaintiff sought to make out his case,, aside from his own testimony, by proof of certain admissions of the defendant to the witness Mr. Preble, and by the testimony of Mr. Hurley -and of Dr. Clarke. The defendant sought to show that he had put Mr. Hurley in the hotel as manager with the common view that he ultimately might become lessee, but that Mr. Hurley thereafter declined. There was a sharp conflict of witnesses, of whom some were confronted with serious inconsistencies of statement, if not positive self-contradictions under oath,' and their versions are so wide apart as almost to be irre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>concilable with the idea that each strove to speak the whole truth and nothing but it. Of the witnesses for the plaintiff the plaintiff himself was an interested party. Mr. Hurley, it appeared, had been involved in dispossession proceedings brought against him by the defendant, and Mr. Preble was a co-broker with the plaintiff. The jury might naturally regard Dr. Clarke as of a different status. Dr. Clarke testified that the defendant about June 1, 1908, admitted to him that he had entered into a lease with Mr. Hurley for 15 years, said.that he would send Mr. Hurley to Dr. Clarke to corroborate this fact, and that Mr. Hurley came. And he also testified that it was said that with this lease there was to be a purchase of the furniture by Mr. Hurley and the delivery of a chattel mortgage thereon for $7,500 as security for the rent. On cross-examination he further testified that before June 10, 1908, at the law office of James, Schell &amp; Elkus, Mr. Hurley discussed the lease in the presence of Mr. Randall; that the defendant confirmed Mr. Hurley; that this was a few days before the witness\u2019 contract to purchase this property was executed; and that he had no doubt but that there was an arrangement made that the defendant was to execute a lease for 15 years to Mr. Hurley before the witness took title. The defendant thereupon offered in evidence the contract between the witness and the defendant for the purchase of the property, and particularly the specific parts that refer to the lease and the furniture. This was excluded under the objection, incompetent, irrelevant, and not within the issues, and that no reference was made to the lease in question, and the defendant excepted. The learned counsel for the defendant then remarked: \u201cI wish to put on the record that I desire to call attention to specific portions of this paper.\u201d The court then replied, \u201cAsk questions.\u201d The counsel then asked, \u201cI call your attention to this provision in this paper marked \u2018Exhibit C\u2019 for identification, \u2018Said premises to be sold\u2019 \u201d\u2014but was cut off by an objection, whereupon the court said: \u201cThe whole contract has been marked for identification and is part of the record.\u201d Later an inquiry was made whether the witness had not initialed certain leases on the property, but this was excluded on the objection that there was no contract in evidence, and on general grounds, to which exception was taken. The defendant during the delivery of his evidence again offered this contract in evidence to call attention to \u201ccertain portions which we claim affect the credibility of Dr. Clarke.\u201d That was objected to, and the court remarked, \u201cIt does not say anything about a fifteen years\u2019 lease to this man,\u201d and the learned counsel for the defendant replied: \u201cThat is our contention, that it doesn\u2019t contain it.\u201d Examination of this rejected contract shows that it includes all of the furniture on the premises belonging to the defendant, which is represented to be sufficient to furnish about 10 apartments, and that the said premises are to be conveyed subject to certain specified incumbrances, among them certain mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The contract also contains these provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">\u201cSaid premises to be sold by the party of the first part, subject to leases of the stores, which have been exhibited and initialed by the parties; and to leases of the apartments, none of which extend beyond October 1st, 1908. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>* * * Each of the parties to these presents hereby agrees to convey the property above described, as sold by that party, free from all incumbrances, except as above specified, and to execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be executed, acknowledged and delivered to the other party, or to the assigns of the other party (the deed to be drawn in each case at the cost of the vendor), a proper warranty deed containing full covenants, duly executed and acknowledged, to convey and assure to the grantees an absolute fee of said premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The importance of this written evidence as bearing upon the testimony of the witness is almost obvious. The witness said that there was to be a 15-year lease made and executed between these parties before he took title that involved the purchase of the furniture, and yet he agreed to purchase the premises by contract which made no mention <em>o\u00ed </em>any such lease, and which covered the furniture or a large part of it, and yet which expressly named certain other leases. But this contract finally was admitted upon the offer of the defendant, and therefore the learned counsel for the- respondent contends the exception is not available to the appellant. It is true that the general rule is that the error in the rejection of evidence is cured by the subsequent offer of the evidence by the same party and its admission. Neil v. Thorn, 88 N. Y. 270. But the reason for the rule rests in the fact that the order of proof rests in the discretion' of the court, and the party by the reception of the evidence receives the full benefit thereof. Id. It appears that the learned court offered to change its ruling at a time when the counsel for the defendant was summing up. The counsel then said that, when he offered the paper, he desired to cross- , examine the witness with reference to it. The court replied that it was \u201cnot possible to modify the record, so far as any cross-examination, which you say you desired to make of Dr. Clarke, based on the paper itself. I say now I will admit that paper in evidence for any purpose with reference to the issues in the case, if you desire to have it in the record.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then stated that Dr. Clarke was in court. But the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-6\">\u201cYou cannot be placed In the same position you were before, if you desire to examine Dr. Clarke, but, so far as the paper is concerned, it was excluded on the objection of counsel, and now I will let the paper in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-8\">\u201cI don\u2019t think the paper would have its full effect, unless I could cross-examine Dr. Clarke.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">The Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-10\">\u201cIf you do not want to accept that\u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">Defendant\u2019s counsel then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-12\">\u201cVery well, I will put it in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">It is to be noted, first, that the defendant did not initiate the offer cf the contract in evidence at this time; and, second, that he called attention to the fact that its admission at that time would not accomplish the purpose, namely, that of cross-examination; and, third, that the court in effect refused to permit the use of the paper in cross-examination, although it might in its discretion have done so, for the witness was still in court, and, further, that the offer was made under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>limitations prescribed by the court that prevented the use of the evidence for the primary purpose for which it was originally offered, namely, cross-examination. The counsel was in a dilemma. If he did not offer the contract at all, it might well have prejudiced him in the eyes of the jury, and, if he did offer it at the suggestion of the court, he was barred from the full use thereof. The headnote in Neil v. Thorn, supra, is as follows: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-5\">\u201cWhen evidence is erroneously rejected, the error is cured by the subsequent offer by the same party of the same evidence and the admission thereof, in case it appears that the error was so corrected under circumstances which worked no injury to the party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">As I have said, the theory of waiver of an exception rests upon the principle that the party has received the full benefit by the subsequent admission of the evidence at his instance. Such is the reason given in the authorities cited in support of the rule laid down in Neil v. Thorn, supra. After the contract was in evidence, the counsel could, of course, comment upon it as a contradiction of Dr. Clarke, but his testimony remained unchanged. If Dr. Clarke had been confronted with the contract in the course of cross-examination, can it be assumed that his testimony would have remained unchanged? He did not testify to acts but to conversations, representations, or admissions, as to which the mind of man is fallible indeed. Might not this written evidence of his acts have caused him to qualify or modify his evidence or have refreshed and have corrected his memory of what had been said by others ? Might he not have been convinced that he was testifying to his inferences rather than to others\u2019 utterances, or that he had assumed that the parties were in accord, when, in fact, they were in discussion? On the other hand, if the witness had still maintained the correctness and the'certainty of his testimony, he would have been confronted by his contract whose terms appeared inconsistent with obligations of the parties which trenched upon his rights. His demeanor and bearing under such circumstances, or his attempt at explanation or reconciliation, or possibly his self-entanglement, might have stamped his testimony as unreliable or as unworthy of credence. Cross-examination is not confined to the baring of falsity. It may test the memory; it may elicit the whole truth; it may resolve impression from recollection, or inference from reproduction; it may suggest facts that lead to correction or recantation; it may demonstrate that a statement made was wrong; it may convince the judges that-the witness was imaginative, biased, forgetful, eager, or unreliable mentally or morally. See Moore on Facts, \u00a7 1274, Gray, J., speaking for the Court of Appeals (People v. Giblin, 115 N. Y. 196, 21 N. E. 1062, 4 L. R. A. 757), says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-7\">\u201cIt is an office of cross-examination to exhibit the improbabilities of the witness\u2019 story.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Starkie, whom a great judge (Peckham, J., in Becker v. Koch, 104 N. Y. 394, 10 N. E. 701, 58 Am. Rep. 515) has pronounced \u201cone of the ablest and most philosophical of English writers\u201d on Evidence, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-9\">\u201cBy this means the situation of the witness with respect to the parties and the subject of litigation, his interest, his motives, his inclination and preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>dices, his means of obtaining a correct and certain knowledge of the facts to-which he bears testimony, the manner in which he had used those means, his powers of discerning facts in the first instance, and his capacity for retaining and describing them, are fully investigated, and ascertained, and submitted to the consideration of the jury, who have an opportunity of observing the manner and demeanor of the witness; circumstances which are often of as high importance as the answers themselves.\u201d Starkie on Evidence (10th Ed.) p. 195.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Prof. Wigmore in his work on Evidence (section 1367) writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-6\">\u201cCross-Examination as a Distinctive and Vital Feature of out Law. For two centuries past the policy of the Anglo-American system of evidence,has been to regard the necessity of testing by cross-examination as a vital feature of the law. The belief that no safeguard for testing the value of human statements is comparable to that furnished by cross-examination, and the conviction that no statement (unless by special exception) should be used as testimony until it has been probed and sublimated by that test, has found increasing strength in lengthening experience. * * * Nevertheless, it is beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth. * * * If we omit political considerations of broader range, cross-examination, not trial by jury, is the great and permanent contribution of the Anglo-American system of law to improved methods of trial procedure. Striking illustrations of its power to expose inaccuracies and falsehoods are plentiful in our records;' and it is apparent enough in some of the great failures of justice in Continental trials that they could not have occurred under the practice of effective cross-examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The writer then cites many instances. Unless we can be assured that the defendant benefited as much by the proof of the contract as he could have benefited by proof and cross-examination upon it, I think that his exception remained well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">I also think that the court erred in limitation of the inquiry as to the alleged contract of brokerage between the defendant, Dr. Clarke, and the brokers who acted in the proposed purchase of the premises by Dr. Clarke. So far as the record shows, such contract might not have been admissible as evidence against Dr. Clarke, but inquiry based upon it was entirely legitimate bejmnd the range permitted by the learned court.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial must be granted, costs to abide the event. All concur, except HIRSCHBERG, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
