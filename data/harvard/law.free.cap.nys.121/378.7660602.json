Section 2437 authorizes a warrant of arrest upon proof entitling a judgment creditor to an order under either of the last two sec: tions, and also by affidavit that the judgment debtor will leave the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>or conceal himself, and that there is a reason to believe that he has property which he unjustly refuses to apply to the judgment, and that a warrant may issue \u201creciting the facts\u201d and requiring the sheriff to arrest him, etc. Section 2458 provides that the judgment must have been rendered upon the judgment debtor\u2019s appearance and execution issued to the sheriff, etc. <em>Held, </em>that the warrant must contain a recital of the facts, conferring jurisdiction upon the court to entertain proceedings, as required by section 2458.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-5\">[Ed.

The section further provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-3\">\u201cThe judge may, instead of making an order, issue a warrant under his hand, rec-iting the facts, and requiring the sheriff of any county, where the judgment debtor may be found, to arrest him, and bring him before the same judge, or before another judge, if the case is one where the warrant must be returnable to another judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">From this it appears that the warrant of arrest must contain, among other things, a recital of the facts conferring jurisdiction upon the court to entertain the proceedings, namely, the facts sufficient to bring the proceedings within the requirements of section 2458 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The warrant of arrest is peculiar in another respect. It requires that the judgment debtor shall be arrested and brought \u201cforthwith before the court.\u201d It fails, however, to specify for what purpose he is to be brought. A man arrested should be informed why he is taken into custody, and not merely referred to a section of the Code of Civil Procedure. The warrant, in directing the sheriff \u201cto bring him forthwith before the court or judge thereof,\u201d should state that it is for the purpose of examination about his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The warrant further directed the sheriff to \u201chold him in bail in the sum of $500, to be given by one or more sureties, before his release according to section 2440 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d Language in a warrant of arrest should be clear. If for any reason the judgment debtor, when arrested, cannot practically be brought before one of the judges of the court within a few hours, it has been customary to release him upon bail. The security provided by section 2440, however, is security not to be given until after \u201chis examination or other proof.\u201d If possible, he is to be brought directly before a judge, and examined, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the security provided for by section 2440 is to be required of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The affidavits upon which the warrant was granted are of very doubtful sufficiency; but, without passing upon them, the order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, the warrant of arrest is vacated, and the judgment debtor discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
