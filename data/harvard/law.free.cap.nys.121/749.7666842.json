The plaintiff was a motorman upon one of defendant\u2019s cars, and ran the car into an oil tank wagon on the track ahead of him, breaking the vestibule of the car, and injuring the plaintiff. It was a dark, rainy night. There was a glass window in front of the vestibule, and it was \u25a0covered with raindrops. There was no curtain on the glass door between the body of the car and the vestibule, so that the light from the \u2022car came into the vestibule, and interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s seeing ahead. He kept the window in front of the vestibule nearly closed, open only 2% or 3 inches, when he might have kept it open wide, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>thus had a better opportunity to see ahead. As it- was, he could see out into the darkness ahead only a few feet from the car, not more than 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">It is claimed that the defendant was negligent in not having a curtain \u25a0 on the front door, and that the accident was caused thereby. I do not bare to consider the questions raised as to this branch of the case, because I think plaintiff\u2019s right to recover was lost by his own contributory negligence. He knew the condition of things surrounding him, that the curtain was absent, that it was dark and rainy, and the light in the vestibule and the substantially closed window, with the raindrops upon it, prevented his seeing further* than 10 feet ahead, and yet he left the window as it was, and ran the car without the curtain so fast that he could not stop it and save a collision with the wagon after it came within his line of vision. He should have fixed a curtain, or opened the vestibule window, and thus secured a better vision ahead, or else he should have run his car so slowly as to have been able to avoid the collision. It would be a mockery of justice to permit him to recover of the defendant for injuries which he brought upon himself, and which his own exercise of reasonable care would have avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, upon the ground of contributory negligence. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
