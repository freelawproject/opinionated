It appears that the witness referred to was one of plaintiff\u2019s assignors, who at the time of the trial of this case was absent in Chicago. No evidence was introduced showing that his testimony would be material, or that he was in any way under the control of the plaintiff at the time of the trial, or could be produced by him. On the contrary, the evidence was that he was without the jurisdiction of the court. It appeared that he was called as a witness on the trial of the same cause in a Municipal Court, but the character of his testimony at that time was not disclosed. The charge was clearly erroneous, and the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-20\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
