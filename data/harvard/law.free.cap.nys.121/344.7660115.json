Appellant was payee and indorser. The offices of both were in the borough of Manhattan. The note was dishonored, and protested Eebruary 9, 1909. Appellant claims that the notice of protest was insufficient in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The first objection is that the notice was addressed on its face, by mistake, to the maker, instead 'of the indorsee. It described the note correctly. The envelope was correctly addressed, and was personally received and opened by appellant. By section 166 of the negotiable instruments law (Consol. Laws, c. 38) a misdescription of the instrument does not vitiate the notice, unless the party \u201cis in fact misled thereby.\u201d This but states the law as previously settled. Mills v. Bank of the United States, 11 Wheat. 431, 6 L. Ed. 512; Gates v. Beecher, 60 N. Y. 518, 19 Am. Rep. 207. By analogy, we think that the same rule should be applied where the instrument is misdirected, instead of being misdescribed. Carter v. Bradley, 19 Me. 62, 36 Am. Dec. 735. Whether Marshall v. Sonneman, 216 Pa. 65, 64 Atl. 874, where the misdirection-was on the envelope as well as on the face of the notice, would be followed in this state, it is unnecessary to discuss. Appellant was a lawyer. He knew that he had indorsed a note for that maker for that amount, which was outstanding. He knew the-notary, and knew that the notary was the indorsee\u2019s attorney. He made no claim on the witness stand of having been misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The second objection is to the time when the notice was mailed. The notary testifies that he put it in the mail chute on the day of protest. The envelope is postmarked at the Madison Square post office on the following day at noon, and directed to appellant at 141 Broadway. No testimony is given as to what the postmark signifies as to the hour when the letter was deposited in the chute. The chute-was a letter box under the control of the Post Office Department, and therefore equivalent to the post office itself. Negotiable Instruments Law, \u00a7 177. The notice is only required by the statute to be deposited \u201cin time to reach him [the addressee] in usual course on the day following\u201d the dishonor; and the context shows that he is to be deemed reached if the notice arrives \u201cbefore the close of business hours.\u201d Id. \u00a7 174. This should certainly allow until 5 o\u2019clock in the winter season and in the absence of evidence to the contrary the court properly presumed that it arrived in time. Appellant swears that he did not get it until the following day, but does not testify that he was at his office-on the day when it was mailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
