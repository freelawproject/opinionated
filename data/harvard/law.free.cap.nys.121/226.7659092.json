Moreover, one of the purposes of the section of the Code is to allow the appellant to obtain information as to the true character of the instrument sued upon, and if it appears from the instrument that there is any defense, even technical, which the law recognizes, he should be given the opportunity to plead such defense. The order must therefore be reversed, and the motion granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">SEABURY, J., talcing no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
