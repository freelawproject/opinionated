Plaintiff also testified to conversations had with defendant, in which the latter apparently fully confirmed the janitor\u2019s authority in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">Defendant, who took the stand on his own behalf, merely denied having one of these conversations with the plaintiff about this particular coal in suit. No motion to dismiss was made at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, and defendant\u2019s testimony certainly did not negative plaintiff\u2019s proofs. A dismissal, therefore, on the merits, was not only unwarranted, but a dismissal under any circumstances was error. Clark v. Scovill, 133 App. Div. 821, 118 N. Y. Supp. 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
