The action is to recover rent alleged to be due on April 1, $150, pursuant to the lease between the parties. The plaintiff set forth the execution of the lease, her performance thereof, that the defendant had not paid the rent due April 1, $150, and further alleged that on August 1, 1908, $11 was due for water rents which had not been paid. The defendant denied* the plaintiff\u2019s performance, and denied that the rent \u201cwas strictly due and payable on April 1, 1909,\u201d and for a separate defense pleaded dispossession proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-20\">The plaintiff contended that the defendant had the affirmative, and the defendant then went f orward .to prove that he had received a paper from a marshal on April 1, 1909, between the hours of 4 and 4:30 p. m. The paper was read in evidence, and is a precept. The defendant testified that he started to move the same night, he moved out within a few days, and that no warrant was ever served. The precept was read in evidence, under the plaintiff\u2019s objection (and exception) that it was incompetent, immaterial, and irrelevant, not within the issues, and not binding on the plaintiff. We think that the exception was well taken, because the precept shows that the proceedings were instituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>by an alleged agent, and before such proceedings could be held to constitute a demand there should have been proof of the agency. Such proceedings could be entitled and the precept issued in the name of the agent. Case v. Porterfield, 54 App. Div. 109, 66 N. Y. Supp. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">This rent seemed payable in advance. The issue of a precept and the removal of the tenant in compliance therewith constitute a surrender, and the tenant cannot be held for rent accruing after the issue of the precept. McAdam on Landlord and Tenant (2d Ed.) p. 1273, citing Boehm v. Rich, 13 Daly, 62, and other cases. If the rent were payable on April 1st, it was not strictly payable until the last minute of that day (McAdam, supra, 929); and hence it was not payable when the precept was issued, so as to save to the plaintiff the right of recovery afforded by section 2253 of the Code of Civil Procedure. But, as I have said, there was a failure of proof, as indicated, that made the exception fatal to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial is ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
