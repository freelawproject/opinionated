As to the right to enjoin defendant\u2019s use of the name \u201cWhite Lily,\u201d disassociated from the labels which defendant has recently adopted, we are unwilling to decide upon the papers now before us. That question may well wait upon the trial of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-19\">As to the labels, however, we entertain no doubt at all. They are an obvious, palpable imitation of plaintiffs\u2019 label, unquestionably adopted with a view to deceiving purchasers and stealing plaintiffs\u2019 trade. It may be, as defendant claims, that the new tariff act, which reaches out in many directions, compels the use of paper packages, instead of tin; but it certainly does not compel a simulation of plaintiffs\u2019 wrappers.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>.The order appealed from will therefore be so modified as to forbid the use of the wrappers now in use by defendant, or of any other wrappers simulating the wrappers in use by plaintiffs, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs to either party, leaving all other questions to be determined upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Settle order on notice. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
