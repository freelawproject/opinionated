The complaint, however, with defendant\u2019s consent, was amended so as to change the cause of action to one for work, labor, and material furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-18\">It is unnecessary to analyze the voluminous testimony adduced on the trial, in view of the erroneous judgment ultimately rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-19\">At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, defendant\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss, which motion was granted. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel inquired on what ground, and the reply of the court was, \u201cFailure of proof.\u201d Thereafter defendant\u2019s counsel moved for the direction of a verdict in his favor. That motion was also granted, and such verdict directed; plaintiffs\u2019 counsel excepting. Regardless of what view we may take of the propriety of submitting the evidence to the jury, the judgment as rendered was unwarranted. Where plaintiff fails to prove his cause of action, \"the complaint may be dismissed, with costs, without prejudice to a new action.
