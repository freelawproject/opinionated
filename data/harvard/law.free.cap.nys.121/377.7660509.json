The pleadings were oral. It was stipulated between the parties, as part of the minutes on the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-18\">\u201cThat thereafter, on or about April 6, 1909, plaintiff and defendant met for the purpose of closing upon the purchase of the store specified in said receipt, but that the plaintiff \u2018backed out\u2019 or defaulted in purchasing said store without reason, and that, by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s default, defendant was damaged as set forth in his pleadings\u2014i. e., answer and counterclaim\u2014therein, but that the amount of damage sustained by defendant was $50, instead of $300, as claimed in defendant\u2019s answer and counterclaim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-19\">The court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. In Weinberg v. Greenberger, 47 Misc. Rep. 117, 93 N. Y. Supp. 530, the court held that a deposit of money under like conditions was \u201ca deposit as security for actual damages, if any, suffered by reason of plaintiff\u2019s default.\u201d Plaintiff concedes his default, and that defendant was dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>aged to the extent of $50; and, as such damage was pleaded by-defendant, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the amount of the deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
