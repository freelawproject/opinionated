Answer a general denial. Jury rendered a verdict for defendant. The court granted motion for new trial; Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-29\">The evidence clearly shows that Mr. Welch and defendant met through the introduction of plaintiffs, and that all the substantial terms of a contract for the exchange were agreed upon; that such contract was drawn. Mr. Welch was ready to execute it, but defendant declined. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim was sought to be defeated on the ground that they claimed c\u00f3mmissions from both sides without defendant\u2019s knowledge. Plaintiffs\u2019 testimony showed that defendant knew of this. Defendant denied such knowledge, but, as plaintiffs were middlemen in the transaction, they were not bound to inform defendant of their employment by Mr. Welch. Krauss v. K. B. Co., 142 N. Y. 70, 36 N. E. 867. Indeed, it may be said that defendant might reasonably assume that in an exchange of property a broker receives commissions from both sides. In his elaborate memorandum the trial court comments upon his charge on this point as conflicting with the rule in Krauss v. K. B. Co., supra. Where the broker receives commissions from the buyer as well as the seller in the purchase of a piece of real estate, without the knowledge of both parties, he cannot recover, but that is not the question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-30\">Another ground stated by the trial judge was the commission of possible error in allowing defendant to show that he had no knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>edge that Mr. Welch was to pay commissions under a general denial, citing Duryee v. Lester, 75 N. Y. 442. In a measure this involves the former proposition, but, if erroneous, it may have influenced the jury against plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The order granting the motion for a new trial should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">GIEGERICH and LEHMAN, JJ., concur in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
