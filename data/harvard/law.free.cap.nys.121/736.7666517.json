Smith,\u201d on described property. Following the description the instrument contains the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>\u201cI hereby authorize Mr. Michael Furst to procure for me the above loan, on obtaining which I agree to pay him $1,000, to cover all commissions and expenses for title insurance, lawyers\u2019 fees, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">\u201c[Signed] Cynthia E. Smith, Ex\u2019x.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Furst caused an application for the loan to be made to the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank of New York, which, after appraisal, approved the loan for the amount of $75,000 in writing, and sent the matter to the Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Company\" for search and report on title. This acceptance was based upon a valid title, and legal authority and right in the applicant to execute a valid mortgage securing such loan. The search, when made, disclosed the fact that the power of the applicant to mortgage the property of her testator was limited to such sum as represented existing mortgages thereon, viz., $63,000 with a small amount of accumulated interest, and the bank thereupon canceled its approval and declined to make the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Plaintiff claims, however, that the application for the loan was subsequently reduced to $65,000 by defendant\u2019s son, and that his assign- or procured a corporation ready, able, and willing to make the loan of this amount; but it is not made to appear that the son had authority to act for his mother in this respect, or that she personally authorized a loan of $65,000. Until this is shown by Satisfactory evidence, the plaintiff is not entitled to a judgment against her personally. He is not entitled to recover against her in her representative capacity, because the estate of her testator was not bound by her contract to Furst, and could not be compelled to pay the sum she had undertaken in her contract to pay to him. Austin v. Munro et al., 47 N. Y. 360, 366; Parker v. Day, 155 N. Y. 383, 387, 49 N. E. 1046, and cited cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">After the jury rendered a general verdict for the plaintiff, the record shows the following to have occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">\u201cCounsel for defendant moves for a new trial on the further ground that it is not definitely stated by the jury whether the. verdict is against the defendant individually or in her capacity as executrix.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-10\">\u201cMotion denied. Defendant excepts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-11\">\u201cThe Court: The verdict is received and filed as a verdict in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant, Cynthia E. Smith, as she is described, individually and as executrix and 'trustee under the last will and testament of Josiah T. Smith, deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-12\">\u201cDefendant excepts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-13\">\u201cMr. Williams: May I ask your honor to put that in the form of a charge to the jury\u2014that, if they find a verdict against the defendant, they must find it against her in that capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-14\">\u201cMr. Manne: I object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-15\">\u201cThe Court: I direct the jury to find a verdict in accordance with the instruction of the court. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-16\">\u201cThe jury thereupon return\u00e9d a verdict against Cynthia E. Smith, individually and as executrix and trustee under the last will and testament of \u2022 Josiah T. Smith, deceased, for $1,250.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-17\">\u201cDefendant excepts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-18\">These exceptions present reversible error, and the judgment, together with the order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, must be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
