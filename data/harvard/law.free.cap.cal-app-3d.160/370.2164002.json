R. Tomson and the Family of Faith Foundation (individually, Tomson and the Foundation, and collectively, appellants), charging violations of three California statutes which prohibit religious discrimination (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 51, 51.5; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16721; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u00a7 17200 et seq.). The trial court found for respondents and issued a wide-ranging judgment for injunctive and monetary relief. We affirm in part and reverse in part for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Since 1976, Tomson and his successor-in-interest, the Foundation, have owned and operated a business telephone directory called the \u201cChristian Yellow Pages\u201d (the CYP), which will only accept advertisements placed by a person who affirms orally and in writing that he has accepted Jesus Christ as his personal savior and is a \u201cborn-again\u201d Christian.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Each CYP directory contains a full page message from the publishers of CYP, denominated \u201cThe Christian Yellow Pages Concept,\u201d which states: \u201cThe publishers of Christian Yellow Pages hold the Bible to be the Inspired Word of God, the Rule Book for Life which presents Jesus Christ, God\u2019s only begotten Son, whose death and bodily resurrection provide forgiveness from sin and eternal life. His indwelling presence through the Holy Spirit gives power and purpose to our living. It is the Christian\u2019s duty and privilege to give this message of hope to the whole world until the return of Jesus Christ for the establishment of His Kingdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\u201cIn publishing the CYP directory we are often asked \u2018Who is a Christian?\u2019 By Christian we mean those who have accepted the fact that Jesus came to this earth\u2014died on the cross of Calvary to pay for Our sins\u2014 was resurrected\u2014and lives Now in the hearts of those who believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\u201cThose whose advertisements appear in the CYP directory have declared orally and in writing that this is their position in Christ\u2014and are standing up and being counted as Christians in our community.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">\u201cOne of the primary purposes of the CYP directory is to strengthen the Christian community in which it is being published by pointing out some of the many businesses operated by Christians\u2014therefore offering the entire community the opportunity to do business with Christian business people.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">\u201cPlease recognize the fact that a Christian businessman advertising [&gt;zc] in the CYP directory does not mean that all of his employees are Christians\u2014nor does it mean that a Christian employee placing an ad in the directory imply [szc] that his employer is a Christian\u2014so we urge the user <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>to contact the individual Christian listed wherever possible, and if indeed the user is a Christian we urge him to identify himself as a fellow Christian\u2014thereby further uniting the Body of Christ.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u201cAdvertising in the CYP directory does not mean that the advertiser is any cheaper in his prices, nor does it necessarily mean that the quality of his work is any better than his competitor\u2014what it does mean is that his stand in Christ should guarantee that he is doing his level best\u2014that he is honest and fair in his prices\u2014and that the purchaser should be entitled to and receive courteous\u2014considerate and Christian treatment in all transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u201cIf we have missed you in this edition and you would like to! have been included\u2014please forgive us\u2014we tried to contact all Christian people whose names we were able to obtain. Please call or write and you will be contacted before the next edition is published.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u201cOur prayer is that this directory will be accepted in the Spirit in which it has been published. We ask the Christian community to patronize these Christian advertisers\u2014and any other Christian business people that they are able to locate.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u201cAs we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. (Gal: 6:10.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Tomson was the sole owner of the CYP logo and federally registered trademark until August 15, 1977, when he transferred to the Foundation all of his rights, interests, duties and obligations in the CYP, including the logo, the trademark and the right to receive royalties from the sale of CYP advertisements or listings. Thereafter, on August 29, 1977, the Foundation was incorporated under the laws of California as a nonprofit religious corporation, with its \u201cNational\u201d or home office in Modesto, California. Tom-son is president of the Foundation and a member of its board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The CYP is modeled after the \u201cYellow Pages\u201d of a telephone company and contains primarily advertisements and listings paid for by business or professional people and offers for sale secular or commercial goods and services. Christian adages and symbols and Biblical quotations occur on most pages of the directories. Each directory is published for one of nine separate geographical regions in the United States and the advertisements and listings are grouped according to region.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">The \u201cContract of Appointment of Regional Director\u201d between Tomson, as the national director of the CYP, and the CYP regional director for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>region which includes California, requires that the regional director accept orders for advertising space only from persons who qualify as \u201cborn-again\u201d Christians.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Respondents Pines and Aronek are partners in Grecian Art Tiles, which imports tiles from Greece, some of which depict Christian images and scenes. On August 15, 1977, Pines and Aronek attempted to place an advertisement of their wares in the CYP. Because they are of the Jewish faith, Pines and Aronek could not and would not sign nor utter the \u201cborn-again\u201d Christian oath. For that reason, they were not allowed to place their advertisement in the CYP. Pines and Aronek, joined by the ADL, acting as a private attorney general, brought the instant action against appellants, seeking damages and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The trial court determined, inter alia, that publication and distribution by Tomson and the Foundation of \u201cThe Christian Yellow Pages Concept\u201d in the CYP were acts of discriminatory business conduct on the basis of religion and acts which aid or incite discriminatory business conduct on the basis of religion; that their refusal to accept advertisements or listings from any person who refused to affirm he is a \u201cborn-again\u201d Christian was arbitrary and discriminatory business conduct on the basis of religion; that their conduct and activity in producing, publishing and distributing the CYP and soliciting and selling advertisements and listings was secular commercial conduct performed for profit and, thus, the CYP was a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d within the meaning of Civil Code sections 51, 51.5 and 52; that their conduct in aiding and inciting discriminatory business conduct on the basis of religion violated Civil Code sections 51, 51.5 and 52; that their required exclusion of persons from \u201cbusiness transactions\u201d on the basis of religion, by means of a policy expressed in a written document, violated Business and Professions Code section 16721; that their conduct constituted \u201cunlawful and unfair business practices and unfair competition\u201d which violated Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq.; that their discriminatory conduct \u201cis not protected activity under the freedom of speech, press, association, or free exercise of religion provisions of the United States Constitution or the California State Constitution; and that their discriminatory conduct caused Pines and Aronek to suffer actual injury and damages in the amount of $250.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The trial court\u2019s judgment awarded Pines and Aronek $250 each in damages, awarded Pines, Aronek and the ADL costs and reasonable attorneys fees and enjoined appellants from (1) requiring advertisers or listers in the CYP to affirm they are \u201cborn-again\u201d Christians, (2) publishing in the CYP any \u201cconcept\u201d statement or editorial policy, as exemplified by \u201cThe Christian Yellow Pages Concept,\u201d <em>supra, </em>and (3) publishing advertisements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>or material in the CYP which requires direct or indirect identification of the advertisers\u2019 or listers\u2019 religious affiliation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants timely appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Appellant contends:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">I. There is insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination that appellants\u2019 conduct and activities violated California statutory law (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 51, 51.5, 52; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16721, 16750; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">A.

Respondents lacked standing to sue for alleged violations of Business and Professions Code section 16721 since they suffered no demonstrable injury to their \u201cbusiness or property\u201d as required by Business and Professions Code section 16750.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">C. A private nonprofit religious corporation which publishes directories of \u201cborn-again\u201d Christian business and professional people is not a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d within the meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civil Code sections 51, 51.5 and 52, nor a \u201cbusiness\u201d within the meaning of the \u201cconspiracy against trade\u201d statute, Business and Professions Code section 16721, or the \u201cunfair competition\u201d statute, Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">D. Even if a private nonprofit religious corporation which publishes directories of \u201cborn-again\u201d Christian business and professional people is a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d within the meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civil Code sections 51, 51.5 and 52, for reasons of public policy, the act does not apply to its activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">II. The trial court\u2019s judgment, applying the California antidiscrimination statutes (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 51, 51.5, 52 and Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16721 and 17200 et seq.) to regulate the content of appellants\u2019 directories, violates appellants\u2019 rights to freedom of speech, press, religion and association under the federal and state Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">III. The trial court\u2019s judgment must be reversed as it is void for vagueness and overbreadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A86\">I. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">\n<em>Respondents had standing to sue appellants for alleged violations of \u201cthe unfair competition\u201d statute, Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">In the fourth cause of action of their complaint, respondents Pines, Aronek and the ADL sought injunctive relief under the \u201cunfair competition\u201d statute, Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. (formerly Civ. Code, \u00a7 3369, subds. 2-6). Appellants contend respondents lacked standing to sue for alleged violations of that statute because (1) they were not com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>petitors of the appellants and (2) they did not allege the consuming public has been injured by appellants\u2019 conduct. Appellants have misstated both the law and the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Business and Professions Code section 17200 provides: \u201cAs used in this chapter, <em>unfair competition </em>shall mean and include unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Section 17203 provides: \u201cAny person performing or proposing to perform an act of unfair competition within this state may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In <em>Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Foods Corp. </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 209 [197 Cal.Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660], the Supreme Court noted that the section 17200 proscription of \u201cunfair competition\u201d <em>is not confined to anticompetitive business practice but extends to \u201cany unlawful business practice. </em>\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 209-210, italics added.) The court noted that the Legislature apparently intended to permit courts to enjoin ongoing wrongful business conduct in whatever context such activity might occur. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 210; <em>Stoiber </em>v. <em>Honeychuck </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 927 [162 Cal.Rptr. 194]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>McKale </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 626, 632 [159 Cal.Rptr. 811, 602 P.2d 731]; <em>Barquis </em>v. <em>Merchants Collection Assn. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94, 113 [101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817].)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Section 17204 provides: \u201cActions for injunction pursuant to this chapter may be prosecuted by the Attorney General or any district attorney . . . upon their own complaint or upon the complaint of any board, officer, person, corporation, or association, or by <em>any person acting for the interests of itself, its members or the general public. </em>\u201d (Italics added.) The emphasized language has been construed to mean that \u201c \u2018suit may be brought by any person acting in his own behalf <em>or </em>on behalf of the general public.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Foods Corp., supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 215, italics in original; <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Atlantic Finance Co. </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 65, 72 [164 Cal.Rptr. 279].)</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Our review of the record does not support appellants\u2019 contention that respondents have not alleged injury to the consuming public. In their fourth cause of action, respondents specifically alleged that they were seeking injunctive relief \u201con behalf of themselves and the general public,\u201d that \u201cas a direct and proximate result of defendants\u2019 unfair business practice, members of the general public including business persons of all religious faiths other than \u2018Born-Again\u2019 Christians ... are subject to defendants\u2019 discriminatory pattern and practice and excluded from advertising in said periodicals\u201d and that \u201cmembers of the general public discriminatorily excluded . . . will continue to suffer irreparable injury . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that respondents had standing to bring the instant action for injunctive relief either on their own behalf or on behalf of the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">I. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\n<em>Respondents had standing to sue appellants for alleged violations of \u201cthe conspiracy against trade\u201d statute, Business and Professions Code section 16721.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Appellants contend respondents lacked standing to sue for violations of \u201cthe conspiracy against trade\u201d statute, Business and Professions Code section 16721, because they did not demonstrate at trial the requisite injury to their \u201cbusiness or property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Section 16721, subdivisions (a) and (b), prohibits the exclusion of any person from a business transaction on the basis of an express discriminatory policy <em>imposed by a third party.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Section 16750 provides that a person injured in \u201chis or her business or property\u201d by anything forbidden or declared unlawful in the chapter, which includes section 16721, may sue there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>fore and that such action may be brought \u201cby any person who is injured in his business or property . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Appellants urge that since respondents were unable to prove at trial that they suffered any consequential damage by reason of appellants\u2019 conduct, their standing was thereby negated. We find appellants\u2019 \u201cstanding\u201d argument to be completely lacking in merit.  Having alleged that as a direct result of appellants\u2019 discriminatory conduct in violation of section 16721 \u201cplaintiffs have been damaged and are entitled to $4500,\u201d respondents have established standing. (See <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 661, 665, fn. 5 [180 Cal.Rptr. 537].)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In their reply brief, appellants also urge that respondents have failed to prove a cause of action under section 16721, because the evidence is insufficient to show they were injured in their \u201cbusiness or property.\u201d Appellants point to the court\u2019s explanation for its damage award at the conclusion of trial as support for their theory that the court determined respondents suffered no compensatory or actual damages. Appellants argue that the court\u2019s language indicates it intended only to award respondents the minimum $250 statutory penalty required by Civil Code section 52, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for violations of Civil Code sections 51 and 51.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">We have reviewed the statements of the trial court at the time it awarded damages to respondents,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and have concluded that its comments, read in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>context, do not support appellants\u2019 theory that the trial court determined respondents suffered no injury to their \u201cbusiness or property\u201d within the meaning of Business and Professions Code section 16750. Moreover, appellants\u2019 theory is contradicted by the trial court\u2019s written findings of fact and conclusions of law in which it specifically stated that \u201cthe discriminatory conduct of defendants . . . proximately caused injury and actual damage to plaintiffs . . . Pines and . . . Aronek . . . and each said plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum of $250 from defendants . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Accordingly, we hold that respondents had standing to bring the instant action pursuant to Business and Professions Code sections 16721 and 16750, and that substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s determination that respondents were entitled to an award of damages under the authority of those sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">I. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\"><em>The CYP is a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d within the meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 <em>51, 51.5), and its activities fall within the meaning of a \u201cbusiness practice\u201d as that term is used in the \u201cunfair competition\u201d statute (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, </em>\u00a7 <em>17200 et seq.) and a \u201cbusiness transaction \u201d as that term is used in the \u201cconspiracy against trade \u201d statute (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, </em>\u00a7 <em>16721).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Appellants note that the \u201cunfair competition statute\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) applies to a \u201cbusiness practice,\u201d the \u201cconspiracy against trade\u201d statute (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16721) applies to a \u201cbusiness transaction,\u201d and the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 51, 51.5) applies to \u201cbusiness establishments.\u201d They therefore argue that because they do not operate a \u201cbusiness establishment,\u201d their activities are not proscribed by those statutes. Appellants\u2019 argument is based on the fact that the CYP is published under the formal aegis of a nonprofit religious corporation and their belief that their work is a \u201cministry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The 1959 Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civil Code section 51, emanated from and was modeled upon traditional \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d legislation. The Unruh Civil Rights Act expanded the reach of such statutes from common carriers and places of public accommodation and recreation, e.g., railroads, hotels, restaurants, theaters, and the like, to include \u201call business establishments of every kind whatsoever.\u201d (See <em>Marina Point, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Wolf</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>son </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 721, 731 [180 Cal.Rptr. 496, 640 P.2d 115, 30 A.L.R.4th 1161], cert. den. 459 U.S. 858 [74 L.Ed.2d 111, 103 S.Ct. 129]; and see <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Village Green Owners Assn. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 790, 793-794 [191 Cal.Rptr. 320, 662 P.2d 427]; <em>Curran </em>v. <em>Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 712, 726-727 [195 Cal.Rptr. 325].)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Civil Code section 51 provides in part: \u201cAll persons . . . are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, or national origin are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all <em>business establishments of every kind whatsoever. </em>\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In 1976 the Legislature added Civil Code section 51.5 to the Unruh Civil Rights Act and amended Civil Code section 52<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (which provides penalties for those who violate the Unruh Civil Rights Act), in order to, inter alia, include section 51.5 in its provisions.

We believe, however, that the Legislature meant the identical language in both sections to have the identical meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">In <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>the Supreme Court held that the owners association of a condominium development was a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d within the meaning of section 51 and that any age restriction established by the asso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ciation was invalid. The <em>O\u2019Connor </em>court, quoting from <em>Burks </em>v. <em>Poppy Construction Co., supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at pages 468-469, discussed the scope of the language of section 51: \u201c \u2018The Legislature used the words \u201call\u201d and \u201cof every kind whatsoever\u201d in referring to business establishments covered by the Unruh Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51), and the inclusion of these words without any exception and without specification of particular kinds of enterprises, leaves no doubt that the term \u201cbusiness establishments\u201d was used in the broadest sense reasonably possible. The word \u201cbusiness\u201d embraces everything about which one can be employed, and it is often synonymous with \u201ccalling, occupation, or trade, engaged in for the purpose of making a livelihood or gain.\u201d [Citations.] The word \u201cestablishment,\u201d as broadly defined, includes not only a fixed location, such as the \u201cplace where one is permanently fixed for residence or business,\u201d but also a permanent \u201ccommercial force or organization\u201d or \u201ca permanent settled position (as in life or business).\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d (33 Cal.3d at p. 795.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The <em>O\u2019Connor </em>court noted that the original version of the bill presented to the Legislature, in addition to affording protection in \u201cbusiness establishments,\u201d referred specifically to the right \u201cto purchase real property\u201d and to other rights, such as the obtaining of \u201cprofessional\u201d services. (33 Cal.3d at p. 795; see <em>Burks </em>v. <em>Poppy Construction Co., supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 469.) The final version, however, eliminated specific references and added to the term \u201cbusiness establishments\u201d the words \u201cof every kind whatsoever.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The deletion of the specific references were explained in <em>Burks </em>and <em>O\u2019Connor </em>on the ground that the Legislature deemed specific references no longer necessary in view of the broad language of the act as finally passed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The Supreme Court stated in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>that the broad scope of business establishments in the final version of the bill \u201cis indicative of an intent by the Legislature to include therein all formerly specified private and public groups or organizations that may reasonably be found to constitute \u2018business establishments of every type whatsoever.\u2019\u201d (33 Cal.3d at pp. 795-796.) Therefore, the court held that the Unruh Civil Rights Act covered even nonprofit organizations. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 796.) The court noted: \u201cIndeed, hospitals are often nonprofit organizations, and they are clearly business establishments to the extent that they employ a vast array of persons, care for an extensive physical plant and charge substantial fees for those who use the facilities.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Following on the heels of <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>the Court of Appeal in <em>Curran </em>v. <em>Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d 712, also examined <em>Burks </em>v. <em>Poppy Construction Co., supra, </em>57 Cal.2d 463, and concluded that in <em>Burks </em>the court had determined the Legislature intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the word \u201cbusiness\u201d in the Unruh Civil Rights Act to include <em>noncommercial </em>as well as commercial entities. (147 Cal.App.3d at pp. 728-729.) Therefore, the <em>Curran </em>court held that the term \u201cbusiness establishments,\u201d consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent to use the term in the broadest sense reasonably possible, includes all commercial and <em>noncommercial </em>entities open to and serving the general public. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 732-733.) Accordingly, it held that the Boy Scouts is a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d within the meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act <em>(id., </em>at p. 733) and under that act, the Boy Scouts are prohibited from arbitrarily discriminating against homosexuals <em>(id., </em>at p. 734).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In the instant case, appellants urge that they are a nonprofit organization arid that their activities in connection with the CYP were noncommercial. While the CYP certainly had \u201cbusinesslike attributes,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as did the condominium owners association in <em>O\u2019Connor (O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Village Green Owners Assn., supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 796), the CYP \u201cfits both the commercial and noncommercial aspects of the meaning of \u2018business establishment.\u2019\u201d <em>(Curran </em>v. <em>Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d at p. 730.)</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We hold, therefore, that the CYP is a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d within the meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a751, 51.5) and that its activities fall within the meaning of a \u201cbusiness practice\u201d as that term is used in the \u201cunfair competition\u201d statute (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) and a \u201cbusiness transaction\u201d as that term is used in the \u201cconspiracy against trade\u201d statute (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16721).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">I. D.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\n<em>Appellants argument that they are entitled to a special \u201cpublic policy\u201d exception from the Unruh Act is a constitutional argument in disguise.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Appellants creatively argue that they are entitled to a special \u201cpublic policy\u201d exception from the Unruh Act. This argument is based on <em>Marina </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number><em>Point, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Wolfson, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 721, in which the Supreme Court noted that, while age discrimination against children in housing is generally impermissible under the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51 et seq.), in light of the unique housing needs of senior citizens (a problem addressed by both the state and federal governments in specific \u201c \u2018age-conscious\u2019 \u201d legislative measures), retirement communities and other housing designed for senior citizens are excluded from the act\u2019s prohibition of housing discrimination against children. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 742-743.) Appellants claim that because freedom of religion is a fundamental constitutional value, they are entitled to a similar exemption for their \u201cministry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">However, the \u201cpublic policy\u201d exemption for senior citizens housing which was recognized in <em>Marina Point </em>had a <em>statutory, </em>not a constitutional, basis. Appellants\u2019 \u201cpublic policy\u201d argument has no statutory basis, but is a constitutional argument in disguise, i.e., that religious liberty as guaranteed by the First Amendment warrants an exclusion for appellants from the civil rights laws. As a constitutional argument, we address it as such, rather than under a less rigorous, and in this context, somewhat ill-defined \u201cpublic policy\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\n<em>Appellants \u2019 constitutional freedoms are impaired by that portion of the trial court\u2019s order which enjoins their publication of editorial material in the CYP, but not by that portion of the order which prohibits their discriminatory acts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The trial court\u2019s injunctive order contains three paragraphs. Paragraph 1 enjoins appellants\u2019 discriminatory business practices by prohibiting appellants from requiring an oath or affirmation of a particular religious belief as a precondition to placing an advertisement in the CYP. Paragraphs 2 and 3 enjoin appellants from publishing certain editorial materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Appellants assert their freedoms of speech, press, religion and association would all be impaired by enforcement of the trial court\u2019s injunction and contend the judgment must be reversed in its entirety. Respondents urge that the trial court\u2019s order must be affirmed in toto.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">We have concluded, however, that paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s order does not unconstitutionally impair protected freedoms and must be upheld, that paragraph 2 of the trial court\u2019s order is violative of free speech rights guaranteed by the federal and state Constitutions and must be stricken, and that paragraph 3 of the trial court\u2019s order is unnecessary to the judgment and should also be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>II. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\n<em>Paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s injunction, which prohibits appellants\u2019 discriminatory business practice of requiring an oath or affirmation of a particular religious belief as a precondition to placing an advertisement in the CYP, does not impair constitutionally protected freedoms.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s injunctive order may arguably be said to implicate appellants\u2019 First Amendment freedoms of religion and association. A review of the facts, however, shows that appellants have failed to demonstrate that the court\u2019s order would materially abridge the free exercise of their religion in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">1. <em>Paragraph 1 does not abridge appellants \u2019 right to free exercise of religion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Although the trial court specifically found that publication of the CYP was secular commercial conduct which was performed for profit, the court did not make any findings as to the religious or other motivations of appellants. Appellants maintain strenuously, that the overriding purpose of the CYP is religious in nature, that their purpose is \u201cto teach and preach the Gospel and teachings of Jesus Christ,\u201d and that the CYP is published \u201cfor the purpose of mobilizing Christians to declare and propagate their faith in the workplace and to live their faith as they do their jobs.\u201d Indeed, each edition of the CYP directory contains the \u201cChristian Yellow Pages Concept\u201d which declares: \u201cOne of the primary purposes of the CYP directory is to strengthen the Christian community in which it is being published by pointing out some of the many businesses operated by Christians\u2014therefore offering the entire community the opportunity to do business with Christian business people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s injunctive order does not materially interfere with the accomplishment of those purposes. Nothing in paragraph 1 prevents the proprietors of the CYP or their advertisers from declaring \u201ctheir position in Christ\u201d or from \u201cstanding up to be counted\u201d as members of the Christian community. Moreover, nothing in paragraph 1 prevents advertisers who wish to do so from identifying themselves as Christians in their advertisements. Paragraph 1 does not materially interfere with the freedom of any person to believe in the appellants\u2019 version of Christianity, nor with any person\u2019s ability to propagate Christian beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Paragraph 1 simply enjoins appellants from refusing advertisements on the ground the person attempting to place an advertisement is not, or will not affirm that he is, a \u201cborn-again\u201d Christian. Thus, the religious purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>appellants have asserted for publishing the CYP are not impaired by paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Further, the express \u201cprimary\u201d religious purpose of the CYP, to offer \u201cthe entire community the opportunity to do business with Christian business people,\u201d is not materially served by requiring the person who places an advertisement in the CYP to affirm he is a \u201cborn-again\u201d Christian.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Nothing in the CYP\u2019s present advertising policy offers assurance that the advertisers themselves are in fact \u201cChristian business people.\u201d Appellants do not require that the proprietors or managers of the businesses advertising in the CYP in fact be Christians; they require only that the <em>employee </em>placing the ad so testify, as the fifth paragraph of the \u201cConcept\u201d makes plain. That paragraph states: \u201cPlease recognize the fact that a Christian businessman advertising [sz'c] in the CYP directory does not mean that all of his employees are Christians\u2014nor does it mean that a Christian employee placing an ad in the directory imply [sz'c] that his employer is a Christian . . . .\u201d Therefore, the stated \u201cprimary\u201d religious purpose of the CYP could more effectively be served by simply allowing Christian business proprietors to identify themselves as such in their advertisements by word or symbol.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Appellants contend, however, that compelling them to accept advertisements from non-Christians would force appellants to subscribe to non-Christian beliefs in violation of <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Barnette </em>(1943) 319 U.S. 624 [87 L.Ed. 1628, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 147 A.L.R. 674]. On the contrary, paragraph 1 does not require appellants to endorse the religious beliefs, or even the business practices, of non-Christian advertisers, or to alter their own beliefs. It merely requires appellants to <em>act </em>in a nondiscriminatory manner toward all prospective advertisers. A legal compulsion by court order to refrain from discriminating against advertisers on the basis of religion can hardly be characterized as an endorsement. In any event, appellants can publish whatever disclaimers are necessary to assure that their compliance with the court order to treat all advertisers equally is not confused with indorsement. (See <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center </em>v. <em>Robins </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 74, 87-88 [64 L.Ed.2d 741, 756, 100 S.Ct. 2035].)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In finding a law firm\u2019s discrimination on the basis of sex is unlawful under title VII of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 2000e et seq.) in <em>Hishon </em>v. <em>King &amp; Spaulding </em>(1984) \u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 [81 L.Ed.2d 59, 68, 104 S.Ct. 2229], the United States Supreme Court stressed that the defendant law firm had not shown how its ability to engage in First Amendment activities would be inhibited by a requirement that it consider a woman lawyer for partnership on her merits. Similarly, in <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees </em>(1984) \u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 [82 L.Ed.2d 462, 477, 104 S.Ct. 3244], the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>stated defendant Jaycees had failed to show that application of the Minnesota Human Rights Act to the Jaycees, to compel them to admit women as full members, imposed \u201cany serious burdens\u201d on the male members\u2019 First Amendment freedoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Here, appellants have not shown that application to them of paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s injunction would materially abridge their rights to free exercise of religion. Thus, we need not undertake a free exercise analysis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">2. <em>Paragraph 1, which infringes on appellants\u2019 freedom of religious association, is justified by the compelling government interest in eradicating invidious discrimination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Appellants contend the trial court\u2019s order violates their freedom of religious association. In response to a similar contention made by the Jaycees, who were seeking to avoid application to them of the state antidiscrimination laws, the Supreme Court, in <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 [82 L.Ed.2d 462], found that two distinct varieties of associational freedom had to be considered, the \u201cfreedom of intimate association and . . . [the] freedom of expressive association.\u201d (\u2014 U.S. at p. \u2014 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 471].)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Freedom of \u201cintimate association\u201d receives protection as \u201can intrinsic element of personal liberty.\u201d <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 [82 L.Ed.2d 462, 472-473].) These highly personal affiliations are exemplified by relationships such as marriage, childbirth, the raising and education of children, and cohabitation with one\u2019s relatives. (\u2014 U.S. at p. \u2014 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 472-473.) In the instant case, appellants operate a telephone directory business which accepts paid listings from business persons engaged in the sale for profit of secular goods and services. Appellants\u2019 business has been operated for profit and operates interstate, publishing nine regional editions. Apart from religious creed, appellants apparently employ no criteria, other than financial, to determine which parties are acceptable telephone directory advertisers. Indeed, as discussed, <em>supra, </em>business persons seeking to advertise in the CYP directory need not themselves be Christians. Thus, like the Jaycees in <em>Roberts, </em>appellants\u2019 operation lacks the distinctive characteristics which would entitle them to claim their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>freedom of \u201cintimate association\u201d has been violated by the trial court\u2019s order. <em>(Id., </em>at p. \u2014 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 473-474].)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">With regard to the freedom of \u201cexpressive association,\u201d the Supreme Court stated in <em>Roberts: </em>\u201cAn individual\u2019s freedom to speak, to worship, and to petition the Government for the redress of grievances could not be vigorously protected from interference by the State unless a correlative freedom to engage in group effort toward those ends were not also guaranteed. . . . Consequently, we have long understood as implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.\u201d <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 [82 L.Ed.2d 462, 474].) In view of appellants\u2019 express religious purposes in publishing the CYP and \u201cthe scriptural teachings of not associating with non-believers,\u201d the freedom of \u201cexpressive association\u201d is plainly implicated here. Freedom of association \u201cpresupposes a freedom not to associate.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. \u2014 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 475].)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In the instant case, the consequence of paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s injunctive order is to compel appellants to do business with\u2014to \u201cassociate\u201d with\u2014non-Christian advertisers in spite of their religious beliefs. \u201cThe right to associate for expressive purposes is not, however, absolute. Infringements on that right may be justified by regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.\u201d <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 [82 L.Ed.2d 462, 475].) Here, that high standard is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">As a general proposition, \u201cgovernment has a compelling interest in eradicating discrimination in all forms.\u201d <em>(E. E. O. C. </em>v. <em>Mississippi College </em>(5th Cir. 1980) 626 F.2d 477, 488, cert. den. (1981) 453 U.S. 912 [69 L.Ed.2d 994, 101 S.Ct. 3143] [upholding application of civil rights laws to a pervasively sectarian college].) While the application of the antidiscrimination laws over First Amendment objections has chiefly occurred in the context of racial or sexual discrimination (see <em>Runyon </em>v. <em>McCrary </em>(1976) 427 U.S. 160 [49 L.Ed.2d 415, 96 S.Ct. 2586]; <em>Hishon </em>v. <em>King &amp; Spaulding, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 [81 L.Ed.2d 59]), California has chosen to broadly interdict discrimination on the basis of religion on the same terms and for the same reasons as discrimination on other invidious bases.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Thus, the California statutes at issue here may be viewed as implementing not only the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s promise of equality, but also the greater guarantee of the California Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>article I, section 7, subdivision (a), and the guarantee of equality in the workplace and marketplace, provided by article I, section 8, which has no federal counterpart. California\u2019s interest in eradicating discrimination on the basis of race or sex is unquestionably \u201ccompelling\u201d and is \u201cunrelated to the suppression of ideas . . . .\u201d <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 [82 L.Ed.2d 462, 475].)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The only question remaining, therefore, is whether the state\u2019s interest can be achieved by \u201cless restrictive\u201d means <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 [82 L.Ed.2d 462, 475]) than by the application of paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s order to appellants. Clearly, it cannot. Paragraph 1 implements the state\u2019s interest in ending religious discrimination in business activity by prohibiting the discriminatory business practices of the CYP. Paragraph 1 \u201c \u2018responds precisely to the substantive problem which legitimately concerns\u2019 the State and abridges no more . . . associational freedom than is necessary to accomplish that purpose.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. \u2014 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 478].)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Paragraph 1 is the <em>sine qua non </em>of the trial court\u2019s injunction. Although it undeniably infringes on appellants\u2019 freedom of religious association by requiring them to do business with non-Christians despite their preference to the contrary, that infringement is amply justified by the compelling state interest in eradicating invidious discrimination. Religious liberty \u201cembraces two concepts,\u2014freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute, but in the nature of things, the second cannot be.\u201d <em>(Cantwell </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>(1940) 310 U.S. 296, 303-304 [84 L.Ed. 1213, 1218, 60 S.Ct. 900].)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">II.

While we concede the Constitution affords a lesser protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression <em>(Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 557 [65 L.Ed.2d 341, 100 S.Ct. 2343]), speech is not rendered commercial by the mere fact that it relates to an advertisement. <em>(Pittsburgh Press Co. </em>v. <em>Human Rel.

The section guarantees: \u201cEvery person may freely speak, write and publish his or her <em>sentiments </em>on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of this right. A law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Analysis of the section shows that it is comprised of three subparts: (1) an affirmation that all persons may freely speak, write and publish their \u201csentiments,\u201d (2) a provision allowing for liability once that right is abused and (3) a prohibition against laws which infringe freedom of speech or the press. Only the third subpart is paralleled, more or less, in the federal Constitution (\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press . . .\u201d). (See Comment, <em>Rediscovering the California Declaration of Rights </em>(1974) 26 Hastings L.J. 481, 493.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The first subpart of the section, \u201c[e]very person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects!\u201d is qualified only by the second subpart which provides for responsibility <em>after the fact </em>if that right is abused. Although the section does not use the term \u201cprior restraint,\u201d the plain meaning of the first sentence of article I section 2, subdivision (a) is that \u201csentiments\u201d are protected from any prepublication sanctions, i.e., from all prior restraints. <em>(Dailey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1896) 112 Cal. 94, 100 [44 P. 458].)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The California Supreme Court\u2019s seminal opinion on the meaning of article I, section 2, subdivision (a) was rendered in 1896 in <em>Dailey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>112 Cal. 94. <em>Dailey </em>concerned a play entitled \u201cThe Crime of a Century\u201d which was being advertised by posters and newspapers in San Francisco. The play was assertedly based on the facts of a notorious murder for which the accused was soon to be tried in San Francisco. On complaint of the accused alleging that production of the play would deprive him of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>fair trial, the trial court issued an order prohibiting further production or advertising. The Supreme Court reversed the trial court, concluding that \u201cthe order made by the trial court was an attempted restraint upon the right of free speech, as guaranteed by the constitution of this state . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 100.) The Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of what is now section 2, subdivision (a) of article I is instructive: \u201cThe wording of this section is terse and vigorous, and its meaning so plain that construction is not needed. The right of the citizen to freely speak, write, and publish his sentiments is unlimited, but he is responsible at the hands of the law for an abuse of that right. He shall have no censor over him to whom he must apply for permission to speak, write, or publish, but he shall be held accountable to the law for what he speaks, what he writes, and what he publishes. It is patent that this right to speak, write, and publish cannot be abused until it is exercised, and before it is exercised there can be no responsibility. The purpose of this provision of the constitution was the abolishment of censorship, and for courts to act as censors is directly violative of that purpose. This provision of the constitution as to freedom of speech varies somewhat from that of the constitution of the United States, and many state constitutions treating of this question; but, if there is a material difference in the various provisions, it works no harm to this petitioner, for the provision here considered is the broader, and gives him greater liberty in the exercise of the right granted.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 97-98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 651, a decision which interpreted federal constitutional law, the Supreme Court stated that its interpretation of section 2, subdivision (a) of article I of the California Constitution \u201cis exemplified\u201d by <em>Dailey </em>and referred to that \u201cprotective provision\u201d as one \u201cmore definitive and inclusive than the First Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 658.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">What then is the scope of the guarantee of the first sentence of article I, section 2, subdivision (a), which protects \u201csentiments\u201d from prepublication sanctions? Its scope must depend on the meaning of the term \u201csentiments.\u201d In Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary (1976), \u201csentiment\u201d is defined as \u201c1. a complex combination of feelings and <em>opinions 2. </em>an <em>opinion, </em>etc., often colored by emotion 3. appeal to the emotions, or sensitivity to this 4. maudlin emotion.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 542, italics added.) In <em>Guglielmi </em>v. <em>Spelling-Goldberg Productions </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 860 [160 Cal.Rptr. 352, 603 P.2d 454], the Supreme Court observed: \u201cIt is noteworthy that the California Constitution provides that \u2018[e]very person may freely speak, write and publish his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>or her sentiments on all subjects . . . (Art. I, \u00a7 2.) As Webster confirms, \u2018sentiments\u2019 encompasses not only thoughts but the attendant emotions. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 867, fn. 8.) Thus, it is plain that the \u201csentiments\u201d to which article I, section 2, subdivision (a) refers include statements of editorial thought, emotion and opinion. Therefore, consistent with that provision, in this state statements of editorial opinion may not be restrained prior to publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Here, however, the purpose and effect of paragraph 2 of the trial court\u2019s injunction is precisely that\u2014to restrain appellants\u2019 statements of editorial opinion\u2014as it forbids appellants from stating they have a religious purpose in publishing the CYP, from expressing their views as to what kind of treatment consumers should expect from \u201cChristian business people,\u201d and from offering their editorial opinion on the question \u201c \u2018Who is a Christian?\u201d\u2019 Therefore, paragraph 2 of the trial court\u2019s order cannot be reconciled with the plain meaning of article I, section 2, subdivision (a) of the California Constitution and for that reason it must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">2. <em>Paragraph 2 is invalid as a prior restraint on speech under the First Amendment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Any restraint on expression prior to publication bears \u201c\u2018a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity\u2019 \u201d under the First Amendment. <em>(New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 713, 714 [29 L.Ed.2d 822, 824, 91 S.Ct. 2140]; <em>Bantam Books, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 58, 70 [9 L.Ed.2d 584, 593, 83 S.Ct. 631].)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Prior restraints have been viewed as offensive to the First Amendment since the United States Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in <em>Near </em>v. <em>Minnesota </em>(1931) 283 U.S. 697 [75 L.Ed. 1357, 51 S.Ct. 625]. In <em>Near, </em>state law made it unlawful to publish a \u201c \u2018malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper, magazine or other periodical\u2019 \u201d and empowered state courts to enjoin the publication of such papers. (At pp. 701-702 [75 L.Ed. at p. 1360].) Near published a weekly newspaper containing articles relating to public officials and others which was virulently antisemitic. (At p. 724, fn. 1 [75 L.Ed. at p. 1372] (dis. opn. of Butler, J.).) An action was brought and, after trial, the state court permanently enjoined Near and his codefendants \u201c \u2018from producing, editing, publishing, circulating, having in their possession, selling or giving away any publication whatsoever which is a malicious, scandalous or defamatory newspaper, as defined by law,\u2019 and also \u2018from further conducting said nuisance under the name and title of said The Saturday Press or any other name or title.\u2019\u201d (At p. 706 [75 L.Ed. at p. 1362].) The Supreme Court reversed. Chief Justice Hughes noted the history of prior restraints both in this country and in England and, drawing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>on the commentaries of Blackstone and Justice Story, stated in his opinion that in determining the extent of the First Amendment\u2019s protection, \u201cit has been generally, if not universally, considered that it is the chief purpose of the guaranty to prevent previous restraints upon publication.\u201d (At p. 713, see p. 714 [75 L.Ed. at p. 1366].)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Subsequent cases have followed <em>Near </em>in refusing to validate court-ordered prior restraints on publication. Thus, in <em>New York Times </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>403 U.S. 713, the court held that no prior restraint could issue to prevent publication of the Pentagon Papers, despite a claim that national security would probably be jeopardized. In <em>Nebraska Press Assn. </em>v. <em>Stuart </em>(1976) 427 U.S. 539 [49 L.Ed.2d 683, 96 S.Ct. 2791], the Supreme Court reversed a trial court order restraining the news media from publishing or broadcasting accounts of the accused\u2019s confessions or admissions or facts strongly implicating him, where there was no showing that alternatives to a prior restraint on the news media would not have sufficiently mitigated the adverse effects of pretrial publicity. (Cf. <em>Dailey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>112 Cal. 94.) And, in <em>Organization for a Better Austin </em>v. <em>Keefe </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 415 [29 L.Ed.2d 1, 91 S.Ct. 1575], the Supreme Court reversed an injunction prohibiting the distribution of leaflets attacking the policies of a real estate broker, holding it was an unconstitutional prior restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 652, a candidate had distributed a newsletter which contained reprints of newspaper articles showing his incumbent opponent had been indicted for various crimes. The newsletter did not reveal that the indictment was six years old nor that the incumbent had been acquitted. The incumbent brought an action to restrain further publication of the newsletter and the trial court issued an injunction to that effect. The California Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the injunction was unconstitutional. The harms sought to be prevented by the injunction were grave\u2014they included not only defamatory material but were injurious to the electoral process. However, the <em>Wilson </em>court noted, \u201c[t]he cases establish that \u2018the substantive evil must be extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high before utterances can be punished. \u2019 [Citation.] . . . [I]f publication of the Pentagon Papers did not constitute a sufficiently serious threat to justify creation of an exception to the established principles [of the prior restraint doctrine], the circulation of election campaign charges, even if deemed extravagant or misleading, does not present a danger of sufficient magnitude to warrant a prior restraint.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 660.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Respondents urge, however, that publication of the \u201cChristian Yellow Pages Concept\u201d is both discriminatory business conduct by itself and also that it \u201caids\u201d and \u201cincites\u201d other such unlawful conduct in violation of Civil Code section 52, subdivision (a), and the trial court has so found. That argument does not save paragraph 2 from being stricken as a prior restraint. Peaceful expressions of religious or political opinion cannot be enjoined consistent with the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><em>Collin </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(7th Cir. 1978) 578 F.2d 1197, cert. den., 439 U.S. 916 [58 L.Ed.2d 264, 99 S.Ct. 291], is instructive. There the courts were asked to prevent prior restraint of a march which the American Nazi Party was seeking to hold in the predominantly Jewish suburb of Skokie, Illinois. The Seventh Circuit upheld the Nazi\u2019s right to march, holding that the denial of a forum in advance of actual expression is a prior restraint which violates the First Amendment. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1207.) The court stated with regard to government control of the content of First Amendment activity: \u201c \u2018[A]bove all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter or its content. [Citations.] To permit the continued building of our politics and culture, and to assure self-fulfillment for each individual, our people are guaranteed the right to express any thought, free from government censorship. The essence of this forbidden censorship is content control. Any restriction on expressive activity because of its content would completely undercut the \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The court noted that content regulation is not per se invalid. There are established exceptions to the rule, \u201cnamely, obscenity, fighting words, and as limited by constitutional requirements, libel.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1202.) Likewise, in very narrow circumstances, a government may proscribe content on the basis of imminent danger of a grave substantial evil. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>Brandenburg </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 444, 447 [23 L.Ed. 430, 433, 89 S.Ct. 1827].) In <em>Brandenburg, supra, </em>395 U.S. 444, 447 [23 L.Ed.2d 430, 434], the Supreme Court stated, \u201cthe constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe [even] advocacy of the use of force or of law violation <em>except </em>where such advocacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">In the instant case, respondents have asserted only that appellants\u2019 publication \u201caids\u201d or \u201cincites\u201d others to discriminate on the basis of religion. That contention does not bring this case within one of the exceptions to the First Amendment prohibition against government control of protected expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Moreover, as appellants have pointed out, the CYP advertisers and readers also have protected First Amendment rights. In <em>Va. Pharmacy Bd. </em>v. <em>Va. Consumer Council </em>(1976) 425 U.S. 748, 756-757 [48 L.Ed.2d 346, 355, 96 S.Ct. 1817], the Supreme Court succinctly stated the principle as follows: \u201c[T]he protection afforded is to the communication, to its source and to its recipients both . . . [T]his Court has referred to a First Amendment right to \u2018receive information and ideas,\u2019 and that freedom of speech \u2018 \u201cnecessarily protects the right to receive.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Here, there is no justification for overcoming the presumption that a prior restraint is invalid. Eradication of invidious religious discrimination in business is unquestionably a vital governmental objective. However, the manifestation of that evil\u2014appellants\u2019 unlawful business practice of refusing to deal with those who are not, or who will not affirm they are, \u201cborn-again\u201d Christians\u2014is sufficiently circumscribed by paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s injunctive order. Unlike paragraph 1, paragraph 2, which prohibits appellants from publishing their opinions, does not respond precisely to that harm. \u201c[A] free society prefers to punish the few who abuse the rights of speech <em>after </em>they break the law than to throttle them and all others beforehand.\u201d <em>(Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Conrad </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 546, 559 [43 L.Ed.2d 448, 459, 95 S.Ct. 1239]; italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">II. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\n<em>Paragraph 3 of the trial court\u2019s injunction is unnecessary to the judgment and should be stricken.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">Paragraph 3 of the trial court\u2019s injunction orders that appellants not \u201c[1] Publish advertisements or material of any kind whatsoever . . . which requires direct or indirect identification of an advertiser\u2019s or lister\u2019s religious affiliation ... [2] except that advertisers or listers may identify themselves as Christians or use Christian logos or symbols.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s injunction, which we have upheld, prohibits appellants\u2019 discriminatory business practice of requiring an oath or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>affirmation of a particular religious belief as a precondition to placing an advertisement in the CYP. While paragraph 1 is in force, if appellants were to publish advertisements or material of any kind which require a lister or advertiser to identify his religious affiliation, it would be punishable as contempt. Therefore, the first portion of paragraph 3 is unnecessary to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The second portion of paragraph 3, which provides that advertisers or listers may identify themselves as Christians by words or symbols, adds nothing to their rights under the First Amendment. Thus, it is also unnecessary to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We conclude, therefore, that paragraph 3 should be stricken from the trial court\u2019s injunctive order as unnecessary to the protection of respondents\u2019 First Amendment freedoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\n<em>Paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s injunction, as modified, is not void for vagueness or overbreadth.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Appellants contend that paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s injunction must be reversed as void for vagueness and overbreadth.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">They posit that the last sentence of paragraph 1 is unintelligible. We agree and modify the trial court\u2019s injunctive order by striking therefrom the third word of the sentence so that the sentence now reads: \u201cThe foregoing [] shall be deemed to include a prohibition against the exclusion from advertisements or listings based upon the existence or non-existence of any personal religious experience, including the experience described as \u2018born-again\u2019 Christianity.\u201d As thus modified the sentence correctly reflects the intent of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">Appellants next contend that paragraph 1 of the trial court\u2019s order is overbroad in that it applies to \u201call of the defendants\u2019 . . . publications, <em>in or outside of California. </em>\u201d (Italics added.) They assert the trial court lacks jurisdiction to enjoin their publications outside this state. Appellants\u2019 contention lacks merit.  \u201c \u2018[I]n accordance with the general rule, . . . that a court of equity having jurisdiction of the person of defendant may render any appropriate decree acting directly on the person, even though the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ject matter affected is outside the jurisdiction, a court having jurisdiction of the parties may grant and enforce an injunction, although the subject matter affected is beyond its territorial jurisdiction, or requires defendant to do or refrain from doing anything beyond its territorial jurisdiction which it could require him to do or refrain from doing within the jurisdiction.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (Al<em>lied Artists Pictures Corp. </em>v. <em>Friedman </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 127, 137 [137 Cal.Rptr. 94].)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\n<em>Respondents are entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Respondents have requested an award of attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal pursuant to the provisions of Business and Professions Code section 16750 and Civil Code section 52.

In that light, we have cautiously reviewed any attempted encroachment over another\u2019s will or desire.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">As the end of the law is peace, we have sought in our resolution to extend a saving hand to this occasion\u2019s call by allowing no preferred treatment nor unnecessary relegation of any party to a deferent position.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">We have advanced an interpretation of fact and law which results in a standard of what is deemed reasonable and right and fashions a path for greater harmony in the human community.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>While we cannot, except by case-by-case analysis, dictate the morals of the marketplace, we can pronounce that acts of discrimination, practiced ingeniously or ingenuously, cannot stand in this hallowed hall where the injured apply for justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We wish to stress that the reversal of paragraphs 2 and 3 of the trial court\u2019s injunction will not strip the judgment of its vitality. Nothing in the doctrine of prior restraints prohibits legal sanctions from being taken against those who violate a lawful court order.
