Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Petitioner David Shane (Shane) is a party to two complicated civil actions pending in different branches of the Los Angeles County Superior Court. The first action, filed December 30, 1982, and entitled Paul V. Spencer et al. v. Kenneth Kaplan et al., is pending in the court\u2019s central district and will be referred to herein as \u201cthe Los Angeles action.\u201d The second case, filed August 11, 1983, and entitled Lillian Barrett v. David L. Shane et al., is proceeding in the superior court\u2019s northwest district (the Van Nuys action). Real party in interest Kenneth Kaplan (Kaplan) is a defendant in the Los Angeles action, in which he has asserted a cross-complaint against Shane and others for various relief including indemnity. In the Van Nuys action Shane is the primary defendant and has asserted against Kaplan and another a cross-complaint which Kaplan claims seeks equitable indemnity from him but which Shane characterizes as being for damages for intentional or negligent misrepresentation by Kaplan. As disclosed by the pleadings before us, the genesis and substance of these actions is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">In 1981 Shane was attorney for Lillian Barrett (Barrett) and also was trustee of a trust he had created to hold and manage the proceeds of a multimillion-dollar land sale Barrett had recently made (the Trust). Barrett was the sole beneficiary of the Trust. Kaplan and one Larry Harvey (Harvey) owned the stock of Louisiana Fried Chicken, Inc., a closed corporation engaged in the fast food business (the corporation). Shane\u2019s son and a partner arranged to buy the corporation\u2019s stock. The terms of sale included two $250,000 promissory notes, payable to Kaplan and Harvey respectively. Each note was secured by a $250,000 letter of credit issued by the Trust\u2019s depository bank and secured by Trust funds. The letters of credit were subject to demand upon default on the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Shane was instrumental in arranging and structuring the transaction. In the course thereof, Kaplan and Harvey allegedly made fraudulent representations to Shane and the buyers concerning the corporation\u2019s financial condition. Less than a year after the stock purchase closed in 1982, the corporation went into bankruptcy and the buyers ceased paying on the notes. Kaplan gave notice of intention to draw upon the letters of credit. In response the buyers, together with Shane in his capacity as trustee of the Trust, commenced the Los Angeles action against Kaplan and Harvey, seeking to rescind the stock sale and the letters of credit on grounds of inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>tional or negligent misrepresentation and to enjoin payment of Trust funds under the letters of credit. As an alternative to rescission the complaint sought damages suffered by the buyers and the Trust by reason of the alleged misrepresentations; in addition, \u201cconsequential damages\u201d were prayed for to accompany the rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">The Los Angeles action was filed at the very end of 1982. Before the hearing on the request for preliminary injunction\u2014which was unsuccessful except to provide 15 days to cure the arrears on the notes\u2014Barrett discharged Shane as her attorney and trustee. Barrett and her Trust then paid the arrears on the notes and made further payments thereon, through the first half of 1983. On August 11, 1983, she commenced the Van Nuys action, against Shane and his law partners. The complaint in that action, which consists of 78 pages and 193 paragraphs, charges Shane and his partners with a variety of derelictions, including breaches of attorneys\u2019 and trustee\u2019s duties in connection with the corporate transaction and other alleged transactions involving Trust assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">On August 29, 1983, Barrett and her new trustee entered into a written \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d with Kaplan (the settlement). Barrett and her Trust agreed to pay Kaplan $75,000, which was less than the amount still owing on his note, and to dismiss the Los Angeles action against him (as well as a cross-complaint against him in a pending federal court action involving the corporation). For his part Kaplan released Barrett and the Trust from any further claim under the letters of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Thereafter Kaplan filed a cross-complaint in the Los Angeles action against Shane and the corporation\u2019s buyers. Among other things this cross-complaint sought to have Shane indemnify Kaplan for his settlement and defense of the Los Angeles action. Shane and his law firm also filed a cross-complaint, in the Van Nuys action, asserting distinct causes of action against Kaplan and Barrett\u2019s accountant. Insofar as directed against Kaplan the cross-complaint alleged Kaplan had misrepresented to Shane and his firm certain aspects of the corporation\u2019s financial condition (essentially the same misrepresentations as alleged in the Los Angeles action) and that in reliance thereon Shane and his firm had counseled Barrett to involve her assets in the purchase and operation of the corporation. The cross-complaint sought to recover from Kaplan, as damages suffered on account of these intentional or negligent misrepresentations, Shane\u2019s and his firm\u2019s legal fees and costs incurred in defending the Van Nuys action, as well as any sums therein awarded to Barrett. Punitive damages also were prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">In January 1984, Kaplan filed in the Los Angeles action a \u201cNotice of Motion and Motion for Order Determining Good Faith Settlement.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>moving papers included a copy of the settlement and copies of the complaint and cross-complaint in the Van Nuys action, of which the court was requested to take judicial notice. The notice of motion sought \u201can order pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 877.6 determining the fact that the settlement . . . was made in good faith <em>and, therefore, acts as a conclusive bar to certain actions for indemnification or contribution, including but not limited to all claims made by cross-defendant David L. Shane in his cross-complaint in [the Van Nuys action] </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The moving papers were served upon the parties to the Los Angeles action, including Shane, as well as his attorneys of record in the Van Nuys action. Shane filed opposition to the motion asserting the settlement could not and should not be held to bar his cross-complaint against Kaplan in the Van Nuys action because Kaplan and Shane were not \u201cjoint tortfeasors\u201d and Shane\u2019s claims against Kaplan were not \u201cfor equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity. ...\u201d(\u00a7 877.6, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The hearing of the motion was not reported or transcribed, but Kaplan informs us the court specifically assayed the legal sufficiency of Shane\u2019s cross-complaint in the Van Nuys action and opined that the claim for attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in that action \u201cwas not legally valid\u201d and that the remainder of the cross-complaint \u201cwas simply one for contribution.\u201d The court granted Kaplan\u2019s motion and entered a minute order which reads: \u201cMotion of defendant and cross-complainant, Kenneth M. Kaplan, for order determining Good Faith Settlement. Grant.\u201d Based upon this ruling, Kaplan prepared and served a lengthy notice of ruling reciting the court\u2019s purported determination not only of good faith character of the settlement but also of the nature and sufficiency of Shane\u2019s claims in the Van Nuys action and that those claims were \u201cspecifically barred.\u201d The text of this notice, which went beyond the terms of Kaplan\u2019s notice of motion, is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>Shane then commenced this proceeding for an extraordinary writ, challenging the propriety of respondent court\u2019s determination the settlement was made in good faith and its further determination Shane\u2019s cross-complaint in the Van Nuys action was \u201cbarred.\u201d We issued an alternative writ of mandate limited to the portion of the order \u201cdetermin[ing] that the settlement . . . constitutes a conclusive bar to the cross-complaint filed by [Shane] against [Kaplan] in [the Van Nuys action].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Kaplan\u2019s reply papers in support of his motion below commenced with this positive and accurate statement: \u201cThe only issue in any hearing on a C.C.P. \u00a7 877.6 motion is whether or not the tortfeasor entered into a good faith settlement.\u201d But incongruously, the order Kaplan obtained from the trial court did not just decide this question but proceeded to declare that claims pending in another action, which was not before the court for adjudication, were \u201cspecifically barred.\u201d Our decision that this advisory, declaratory order concerning the viability of another lawsuit exceeded the court\u2019s jurisdiction begins with a review of the history and functions of section 877.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">In <em>American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 578 [146 Cal.Rptr. 182, 578 P.2d 899] <em>(AMA), </em>the Supreme Court decided \u201cthat the California common law equitable indemnity doctrine should be modified to permit a concurrent tortfeasor to obtain partial indemnity from other concurrent tortfeasors on a comparative fault basis.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 591.) The court further held \u201cthat under the governing statutory provisions a defendant is generally authorized to file a cross-complaint against a concurrent tortfeasor for partial indemnity on a comparative fault basis, even when such concurrent tortfeasor has not been named a defendant in the original complaint.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 607 (fn. omitted).) Finally, the court reconciled these substantive and procedural holdings with the \u201cstrong public policy in favor of settlement\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 603) reflected and effectuated by section 877,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by declaring \u201cthat a tortfeasor who has entered into a \u2018good faith\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>settlement [citation] with the plaintiff must also be discharged from any claim for partial or comparative indemnity that may be pressed by a concurrent tortfeasor.\u201d (20 Cal.3d at p. 604; see also <em>id., </em>at p. 607, fn. 9 (excluding from the general allowance of partial indemnity cross-complaints one \u201cagainst a concurrent tortfeasor who has entered a good faith settlement with the plaintiff . . .\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Two years later <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 434 [163 Cal.Rptr. 47] observed that notwithstanding AMA\u2019s disqualification of a good faith settling tortfeasor from liability for comparative equitable indemnity, cross-complaints against such settling defendants were frequently being pressed. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 440.) To short-circuit this burden upon settlors and to further effectuate the policy favoring settlement advanced by <em>AMA, </em>the <em>Fisher </em>court held that judicial determination of the \u201cgood faith\u201d vel non of a settlement\u2014the issue determinative of the settlor\u2019s discharge from contribution under section 877 and from comparative indemnity under <em>AMA\u2014 </em>should be made \u201cat the earliest possible time,\u201d and if at all possible \u201cin advance of the trial of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint or of any determination of comparative or partial (equitable) indemnity as between cross-complainant and cross-defendant tortfeasors.\u201d (103 Cal.App.3d at pp. 442-443.) In addition, <em>Fisher </em>held the party asserting a settlement has not been entered into in good faith bears the burden of proof on that issue. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 447-449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Responding to procedural and substantive concerns expressed and partially resolved in <em>Fisher, </em>the 1980 Legislature enacted section 877.6. <em>(Northrop Corp. </em>v. <em>Stinson Sales Corp. </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 653, 657, fn. 4 [199 Cal.Rptr. 16]; accord 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (1984 supp.) Torts, \u00a7 40A, p. 29.) The statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides a specific, speedy hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>mechanism for determination of \u201cthe issue of the good faith of a settlement entered into by the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more alleged tortfeasors\u201d (subd. (a)), the determination to be made upon proof by affidavit, or other evidence in the discretion of the court (subd. (b)). It also codifies the <em>Fisher </em>court\u2019s holding that \u201c[t]he party asserting the lack of good faith shall have the burden of proof on that issue\u201d (subd. (d)). Finally, and of critical concern here, subdivision (c) of section 877.6 states: \u201cA determination by the court that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based upon comparative negligence or comparative fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">In contrast to the remaining subdivisions of section 877.6, which enunciate rules of procedure, subdivision (c) prescribes a substantive right of discharge from liability. The subdivision has been well characterized as \u201ca codification of the principle set forth in <em>\\AMA\\ . . . </em>\u2018that a tortfeasor who has entered into a \u201cgood faith\u201d settlement [citation] with the plaintiff must also be discharged from any claim for partial or comparative indemnity that may be pressed by a concurrent tortfeasor.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Turcon Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton-Villiers, Ltd. </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 280, 283 [188 Cal.Rptr. 580]; accord <em>Kohn </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 323, 326-327 [191 Cal.Rptr. 78].)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Notably, section 877.6 does <em>not </em>provide or specify a procedure whereby the rule of discharge or \u201cbar\u201d announced in <em>AMA </em>and codified by subdivision (c) may be implemented as between the tortfeasor whose settlement has been determined to be in good faith and cotortfeasors who assert indemnity claims against him. However, other provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure provide mechanisms by which the good faith settlor may obtain dismissal of actions or cross-complaints which come within the judicial and statutory bar. One popular and entirely appropriate method is to make a motion for summary judgment under section 437c, either contemporaneous with or following the hearing determining the good faith of the settlement. (See, e.g., <em>Northrop Corp. </em>v. <em>Stinson Sales Corp., supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d at pp. 657-658 and cases cited therein; <em>Wysong </em>&amp; <em>Miles Co. </em>v. <em>Western Industrial Movers </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 278, 284 [191 Cal.Rptr. 671].) Another approach is a motion for judgment on the pleadings or, if the indemnity claim is not yet at issue, a general demurrer, in either case invoking judicial notice of the good faith settlement determination that effects a \u201cbar\u201d to the claim, much as judicial notice may be taken of a prior judgment that operates as a bar to a pending action under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. (See, e.g., <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Mitchell, Silberberg </em>&amp; <em>Knupp </em>(1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 39 [170 Cal.Rptr. 533] [affirming general demurrer sustained on grounds of collateral estoppel established by judicial notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>prior proceedings].) Finally, some courts have granted simple motions to dismiss cross-complaints for indemnity immediately upon determining the cross-defendant\u2019s settlement was in good faith. (See, e.g., <em>Turcon Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton-Villiers, Ltd., supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 282.) While we have found no authority expressly prescribing such a disposition, it shares with its traditional counterparts discussed above the features of a final adjudication made by <em>the court before which the indemnity claim or action is pending for determination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Regardless of which mechanism is chosen, employment of a distinct procedure to adjudicate the effect of a judicially determined good faith settlement upon a pending action or claim not only is procedurally necessary but also serves an important salutary function: it focuses the court\u2019s attention distinctly upon two completely different substantive questions\u2014whether the settlement was in good faith and whether the claim sought to be dismissed is of such a nature as to be barred by a good faith settlement. Each of these questions is becoming increasingly controversial and complex with the development of the law in this area. (Cf. <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Union Pacific R.R. Co. </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 499 [203 Cal.Rptr. 825] and <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em> (Cal.App.) [meaning and method of measuring good faith of a settlement] with <em>Huizar v. Abex Corp. </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 534 [203 Cal.Rptr. 47] [types of indemnity claims barred under <em>AMA </em>and section 877.6, subd. (c)].)  Where, as here, there is a substantial dispute whether the claim sought to be barred is actually one for indemnity at all, the need for particularized adjudication becomes even greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">In stark contrast, the order rendered in the present case, insofar as it declared \u201cbarred\u201d Shane\u2019s cross-complaint in the Van Nuys action, was not made under any known or recognizable procedure, was not made by a court assigned to hear the action the order purported to affect, and was not even made in that action but rather in another case. For each of these reasons, the order exceeded the court\u2019s jurisdiction and authority, as we now explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">A. <em>The Order Exceeded the Authority Conferred by Section 877.6.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">As we noted above, section 877.6 provides a procedure to determine whether a settlement has been made in good faith, but does <em>not </em>purport to confer authority to render declarations that actions or claims are \u201cbarred\u201d by such a settlement. A recent amendment to section 877.6 reiterates the limited procedural scope of the statute. Statutes 1984, chapter 311, section 1 adds a new subdivision (e), providing for review by writ of mandate of \u201ca determination of the good faith or lack of good faith of a settlement</p>\n<p id=\"ANn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>. . . The writ will lie \u201cto review <em>th[at] </em>determination,\u201d and the provisions of section 583 will be tolled \u201cduring the period of review of a <em>determination </em>pursuant to this subdivision.\u201d <em>(Ibid, </em>(italics added).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This reenactment and amendment of section 877.6 thus underscores that its existing subdivisions confer authority only to render a determination of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Notwithstanding this limitation\u2014acknowledged by Kaplan\u2019s statement below that \u201c[t]he only issue in any hearing on a C.C.P. \u00a7 877 motion is whether or not the tortfeasor entered into a good faith settlement\u201d\u2014Kaplan by his motion sought and obtained not only a determination of good faith settlement but also a declaration concerning the nature of Shane\u2019s claims asserted in his Van Nuys cross-complaint and a corresponding order that such claims were \u201cspecifically barred.\u201d The jurisdictional impropriety of the trial court\u2019s rendering such novel and extended relief on a motion under section 877.6 is demonstrated by the analogous case of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>(1942) 55 Cal.App.2d 48 [130 P.2d 158].</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\"><em>Parker </em>was an action on an alleged open, mutual and current account. Defendants obtained an order under former section 1000, for inspection of the documents comprising the account pleaded. The statute provided for such discovery, and further provided the sanction of exclusion from evidence of documents not produced. Plaintiff produced a set of documents and defendant, relying on the statute, moved for an order precluding their introduction into evidence on the basis the documents did not constitute an open, mutual and current account. The court granted the motion and made an order that the entries of the alleged account were to be excluded from evidence in the trial of the action. When the case came to trial before another judge he abided by this order and precluded plaintiffs from introducing any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">The Court of Appeal reversed. While admitting section 1000 was remedial and subject to liberal construction, Justice Peters explained that \u201ca liberal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>construction cannot supply a remedy or impose a penalty not expressly or impliedly contained in the statute. . . . There is nothing in the statute to indicate that the Legislature ever intended that the court, in such a proceeding, should pass on the relevancy or the sufficiency of the documents to prove the allegations of the party relying on them. . . . The appellants produced the documents upon which they rely to show their alleged open, mutual and current account. The motion judge, on motion of respondent, then made an order purporting to exclude those documents from evidence. Presumably, that order was made because the motion judge believed that such documents, as a matter of law, did not constitute an account of the type alleged. Regardless of the correctness of that conclusion, <em>the motion judge was without power, in such a proceeding, to pass on the legal sufficiency of the produced documents. </em> <em>Where a statute authorizes a prescribed procedure, and the court acts contrary to the authority conferred, it has exceeded its jurisdiction, and the order so made is void. </em>[Citations].\u201d <em>(Parker </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., supra, </em>55 Cal.App.2d at pp. 52-53.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">The present case presents parallel circumstances requiring an identical conclusion. The trial court has made an order \u201cbarring\u201d Shane\u2019s cross-complaint. This order was in no wise authorized by the statute under which it was purportedly rendered. The substance and intended effect of the order is to preclude Shane from prosecuting his cross-complaint. If the order stands, the trial court in the Van Nuys action presumably will abide by it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the order cannot stand, for it exceeded the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction and hence is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">B. <em>The Van Nuys Action Was Not Before the Court for Adjudication.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">A second jurisdictional defect in the trial court\u2019s order arises from the fact that the Van Nuys action, a portion of which that order purports to affect in the most severe manner imaginable, was not before the trial court for adjudication. The Van Nuys action had not been assigned for hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>either plenary or partial, before the motion judge in the Los Angeles action, and the motion and order that purportedly \u201cbarred\u201d a part of the former action were made only in the latter.  It would seem axiomatic that a court or department lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate and dispose of the merits of an action that has not been assigned to it for hearing. But by issuing its barring order, and in the course of that process assaying and determining the validity of the Shane\u2019s cross-complaint in the Van Nuys action, the trial court effectively did just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Most likely because the trial court\u2019s action at bench is unprecedented, we have found no case precisely comparable. However, related authorities concerning the correlative jurisdiction of the numerous departments of the Los Angeles County Superior Court provide are instructive and dispositive. The leading case is <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 656 [96 P.2d 334], which first instructs that the jurisdiction of a multijudge, multidepartment superior court is vested in the court as a whole and if one department exercises authority in a matter which might properly be heard in another such action, although \u201cirregula[r],\u201d it does not amount to a defect of jurisdiction. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 662-663.) However, <em>Williams </em>further holds: \u201c[W]here a proceeding has been duly assigned for hearing and determination to one department of the superior court by the presiding judge of said court in conformity with the rules thereof, and the proceeding so assigned has not been finally disposed of therein or legally removed therefrom, <em>it is beyond the jurisdictional authority of another department of the same court to interfere with the exercise of the power of the department to which the proceeding has been so assigned. </em>[Citation.] In other words, while one department is exercising the jurisdiction vested by the Constitution in the superior court of that county, the other departments thereof <em>are as distinct therefrom as other superior courts. </em>[Citation.] If such were not the law, conflicting adjudications of the same subject-matter by different departments of the one court would bring about an anomalous situation and doubtless lead to much confusion.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 662.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The instant proceeding does not present the exact procedural posture of Williams, because the Van Nuys action had not been \u201cassigned for hearing and determination\u201d to a department and the trial judge\u2019s action here constituted interference with an action pending in another district of the court. Nonetheless, the jurisdictional principles and underlying policies expressed in <em>Williams </em>do control. The Van Nuys action had been filed in a branch of the Los Angeles Superior Court in accordance with the rules of that court. (L. A. County Super. Ct. Rules, rule 300, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4.) These rules also authorize only the presiding judges of the court and its central civil master calendar department to transfer such a case to the central district. (Id., rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>300, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6; rule 304, \u00a7 3.) But no such transfer had been made in contemplation of the hearing in the Los Angeles action. The trial (motion) judge in that action therefore had not been vested with the superior court\u2019s jurisdiction over the Van Nuys action. Had he purported to dispose of that action directly, his jurisdiction would have been subject to serious question at the very least. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Batchelor </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 278, 283-285 [128 Cal.Rptr. 349].)  A fortiori, the trial court\u2019s purported determination of a portion of the Van Nuys action, through an unauthorized procedure and under the rubric of the Los Angeles action, constituted an excess of jurisdiction. Moreover, the ruling assessing the merits of Shane\u2019s cross-complaint and purporting to \u201cbar\u201d it planted a deep seed of conflict and confusion if and when the Van Nuys cross-complaint was called for hearing before a properly assigned department. (See fn. 6, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">C. <em>The Van Nuys Action Was the Proper Forum for Adjudication of the Settlement\u2019s Effect on That Action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">As observed above, Kaplan had (and still has) abundant remedies in the Van Nuys action by which to assert the effect\u2014if any\u2014of his good faith settlement with Barrett upon Shane\u2019s Van Nuys cross-complaint. Demurrers, motions for judgment on the pleadings, and motions for summary judgment are all available in the Van Nuys action. By skipping these regularly prescribed procedures and resorting instead to a statutorily unrecognized motion for a \u201cdeclaration of bar,\u201d Kaplan and the trial court improperly intertwined two separate lawsuits and the discrete questions of the settlement\u2019s good faith and the effect of the settlement upon the causes of action Shane had pleaded in the Van Nuys action. The latter question involves difficult substantive issues, including the proper characterization of Shane\u2019s claims, the impact thereon not only of section 877.6 but also section 877, and the viability in either event of Shane\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the Van Nuys action allegedly as the result of Kaplan\u2019s misrepresentations to Shane.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">In the normal course of procedure, these questions not only may but properly should be raised and determined in the Van Nuys action, where the challenged claims are pending. Conversely, established authorities dictate that the Los Angeles action was not the proper forum to adjudicate the validity or viability of claims pending in the Van Nuys action.  It has long been held that the validity of one lawsuit is not a proper subject for declaratory relief in a second lawsuit, inasmuch as the first case will determine the questions posed by the second. (E.g., <em>Taliaferro </em>v. <em>Taliaferro </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 787, 791 [4 Cal.Rptr. 689], and cases cited therein; see also <em>Sunset Scavenger Corp. </em>v. <em>Oddou </em>(1936) 11 Cal.App.2d 92, 96 [53 P.2d 188] (\u201cA declaratory judgment is not a proper method of determining the sufficiency of legal defenses to a pending action.\u201d).) Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number><em>Pacific Electric Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Dewey </em>(1949) 95 Cal.App.2d 69 [212 P.2d 255], specifically held that a suit for declaratory judgment that a tort plaintiff could not prosecute his action in view of a settlement and release did not lie, given that the settlement could be asserted and effectuated in the principal action. Yet the trial court\u2019s \u201cbarring\u201d order at bench amounts in form and substance to just such a declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\"><em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 530 [92 Cal.Rptr. 329] is also instructive. There a defendant in a personal injury action pending in Shasta County filed an action in Sacramento County for enforcement of an alleged good faith settlement with the Shasta plaintiff and an injunction against further prosecution of the Shasta action. The Court of Appeal issued a writ of prohibition against the second lawsuit, in part because the alleged settlement could have been asserted as a defense in the first. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 545.) The court also invoked the rule of priority of jurisdiction among actions involving the same subject matter. <em>(Ibid.) </em>While that rule of jurisdiction does not technically apply among actions pending in the same superior court <em>(Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 486, 492-493 [145 Cal.Rptr. 17]), the practical lesson of the <em>Halpin </em>case pertains here: the Van Nuys action offers ample, appropriate vehicles for resolution of Kaplan\u2019s defense of \u201cbar\u201d to the cross-complaint pending therein. In short, absent consolidation of the actions under section 1048, subdivision (a), the Los Angeles action was not and is not the proper forum for adjudication of the sufficiency of pleadings or defenses in the Van Nuys action.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Section 877.6 was enacted to facilitate the determination of good faith settlements by joint tortfeasors, whereby they would be discharged, under <em>AMA, </em>from actual or potential liability for comparative indemnity. In most cases, where such indemnity claims are asserted as cross-complaints in a single action, effectuation of this discharge as declared by subdivision (c) following a determination of good faith settlement will present little procedural difficulty. In the unusual instances where separate lawsuits for liability and indemnity are filed, existing procedural vehicles furnish full means for a good faith settlor to obtain the relief contemplated by the statute and <em>AMA. </em>However, the reach of that \u201cbar\u201d presents questions distinct from the good faith of the settlement itself, and adjudication of these questions in a given case requires care and discrimination. When, as here, <em>two </em>or more cases are involved, the underlying issues concerning the extent of the \u201cbar\u201d may be highly complex. Such cases may also involve courts of different jurisdiction, and/or different stages of proceeding, and/or diverse parties asserting diverse claims. Subject of course to the convenient statutory mechanisms of transfer, severance, consolidation, and coordination, each such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>case must be decided on its own, by a court seized of jurisdiction to adjudicate. Hybrid, nonstatutory procedures which spontaneously intermingle discrete cases and issues will only heighten confusion and conflict, both procedural and substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">We of course are conscious the parties to this proceeding have tendered for our redetermination the substantive question whether Shane\u2019s cross-complaint is barred by the trial court\u2019s determination of Kaplan\u2019s good faith settlement with Barrett and her Trust,  But, as we have held above, the legal sufficiency of the cross-complaint\u2014intrinsically and in light of the good faith settlement determination\u2014is a question that belongs, in the first instance, in the action where that cross-complaint is pending. We will not compound the trial court\u2019s excess of jurisdiction by issuing an advisory opinion on issues that were never properly in suit in the action from which this proceeding arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">IV. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue requiring the Los Angeles County Superior Court to vacate its February 2, 1984, order in case No. C437276 insofar as it determines\u2014as reflected by the February 6, 1984, notice of ruling, commencing with the words \u201cto the extent that\u201d on page 2, line 14 thereof\u2014that the settlement dated August 29, 1983, between Kenneth M.

Degerman, Esq., of Jones &amp; Wilson. After having read and considered all papers filed in support of and in opposition to said motion and having heard and considered oral argument in support of and in opposition to said motion, the court granted the motion and made an order that pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 877.6 the settlement agreement dated August 29, 1983, made between Defendant and Cross-complainant Kenneth M. Kaplan, The Barrett Ranch Trust, and Lillian Barrett was made in good faith, and, therefore, constitutes a conclusive bar to any further claim by any other alleged or actual joint tortfeasor against Kenneth M. Kaplan for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault to the extent that such claim arose out of or was related to the facts or claims set forth in the aforesaid settlement agreement, and that all claims, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>but not limited to a claims for attorney\u2019s fees incurred by David Shane, set forth against Kenneth M.

Technically, it would not. Even assuming arguendo its procedural propriety and consequent vitality, the order was not a final judgment but was more in the nature of an intermediate ruling concerning the sufficiency of pleadings. (See 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Judgment, \u00a7 162.) The cases upon which Kaplan relies, involving orders upon motions made after judgment in marital proceedings, are not in point. (See <em>Wodicka </em>v. <em>Wodicka </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 181, 188 [130 Cal.Rptr. 515, 550 P.2d 1051].)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">On the other hand, a determination of good faith settlement does create a \u201cbar\u201d analogous in effect to res judicata. And the peculiarity of such a determination, coupled with the peremptory nature of the trial court\u2019s \u201cbarring\u201d order as recited in Kaplan\u2019s notice of ruling, would likely lead a court in the Van Nuys action to consider the viability of Shane\u2019s cross-complaint in that action foreclosed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
