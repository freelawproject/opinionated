On August 12, 1982, the County of Orange filed a Notice of Action stating its intention to discontinue aid, effective August 31, 1982, because the county believed the children\u2019s father, Richard Rodriguez, was residing with respondent in her home. Under Welfare and Institutions Code section 10950, Rodriguez requested a \u201cfair hearing\u201d before the Department of Social Services (DSS). Before that hearing, the County of Orange filed a \u201cStatement of County Position,\u201d outlining the welfare history of Rodriguez, noting its suspicion of the father\u2019s residency, and concluding her AFDC assistance \u201cshould be terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">At the fair hearing on September 27, 1982, a county investigator testified he had talked to neighbors and learned Richard Rodriguez was residing with Respondent and her children. He had not seen the husband at the home, and declined to produce the witnesses who had actually observed husband, citing the anticipation of a criminal welfare fraud case against Rodriguez. Rodriguez testified her husband had not lived with her at any time while she received welfare benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The hearing officer concluded Rodriguez\u2019 welfare benefits should not be terminated because the facts presented by the county were too weak to prove, by the preponderance of the evidence, the father\u2019s residency, and he found \u201cclaimant and Richard Rodriguez <em>are not </em>residing together.\u201d (Italics added.) The county sought no review.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Before the hearing officer\u2019s decision was adopted, a criminal complaint was filed charging Rodriguez with two counts of welfare fraud (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11483) committed between January 7, 1979 and August 1981 and between May 1982 and August 1982, and two counts of food stamp fraud (Pen. Code, \u00a7 396) committed between March 1980 and August 1981 and between May 1982 and August 1982. After a preliminary examination, Rodriguez was held to answer on all four charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">On May 10, 1983, Rodriguez filed a common law motion to dismiss the action under <em>People </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 468 [186 Cal.Rptr. 77, 651 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>P.2d 321], contending the hearing officer\u2019s finding collaterally estopped prosecution. The motion was granted and the entire action was dismissed. The People appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The correctness of the ruling below turns on the application of <em>People </em>v. <em>Sims, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 468, also a welfare fraud prosecution. Sims had received $5,395 in AFDC and $1,144 in food stamps. The Sonoma County Department of Social Services demanded restitution of those benefits, claiming she was ineligible to receive them because the children\u2019s employed father lived in the home, a fact which Sims had allegedly concealed. A \u201cNotice of Action\u201d was filed, proposing to reduce future cash grants to compensate for the overpayments. Sims requested a \u201cfair hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Before the hearing, a criminal complaint charging welfare fraud was filed against Sims in municipal court. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11483.) After pleading not guilty, she attended her \u201cfair hearing,\u201d at which the county presented no evidence, contending the DSS lacked jurisdiction because of the pending criminal action. Both Sims and her husband testified, denying his residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The hearing officer found the county had failed to prove welfare fraud, ordered the Notice of Action rescinded and a refund of all restitution payments. The county did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Sims then moved for dismissal of the criminal charges, contending her exoneration of welfare fraud by the hearing officer collaterally estopped criminal prosecution for the same offense. The trial court agreed and dismissed the information. The California Supreme Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\"><em>Sims </em>enunciates the three elements of collateral estoppel: (1) The issue necessarily decided at the previous proceeding is identical to the one sought to be relitigated. (2) The previous proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits. (3) The party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the prior proceeding. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sims, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 484.) Finding all these elements established, the court held collateral estoppel barred the People from prosecuting Sims for welfare fraud, as the hearing officer\u2019s decision was conclusive on that issue. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 488.) The court based its ruling upon the perceived legislative policy of special statutory schemes establishing preferential treatment for noncriminal resolution of cases involving those accused of welfare fraud, preservation of the integrity of DSS hearings by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>reinforcing the finality of their judgments, and the enhancement of judicial economy by minimizing repetitive litigation. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 488-489.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Rodriguez contends the favorable resolution of the issue of father residency in <em>her </em>DSS hearing precludes, under <em>Sims, </em>her prosecution for welfare fraud. Assuming <em>Sims </em>applies to this case, we hold its rationale dictates estoppel here, but <em>only </em>as to those issues <em>raised </em>and <em>decided </em>at the DSS hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We first note the central issue before the Department of Social Services was whether Rodriguez\u2019 benefits should be terminated; the question of her <em>fraud </em>was never directly raised. The county \u201cNotice of Action,\u201d which appears to frame the \u201cfair hearing\u201d issues, states merely an intention to discontinue aid because the absent parent resides in the home of the welfare recipient. It does not mention fraud or residency dates before August 9, 1981. The \u201cStatement of County Position,\u201d roughly analogous to a trial brief, provided background information concerning Rodriguez\u2019 welfare benefits and the suspicion of the father\u2019s residency in Rodriguez\u2019 home. It concluded: \u201cOrange County correctly proposed a <em>termination </em>of claimant\u2019s AFDC assistance.\u201d (Italics added.) The only issue, therefore, before the hearing officer, was, in Department of Social Services cant, \u201cabsence of deprivation of father\u2019s presence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Further, only the father\u2019s residency <em>on September 27, 1982 </em>was decided. In his \u201cFindings of Fact,\u201d the hearing officer stated: \u201cBased upon the preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, it is found that claimant and Richard Rodriguez <em>are not </em>residing together.\u201d (Italics added.) Under conclusion No. 1 of conclusions of law he found \u201cclaimant and Richard Rodriguez <em>are not </em>living together.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Since only a narrow factual issue, the father\u2019s residency on September 27, 1982, was decided at the hearing, <em>Sims </em>only estops the People from proving the father\u2019s residency <em>on that date. </em>They are not prevented from showing, if they can, his residency <em>before </em>that time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">We note the hearing officer may have inferred the father\u2019s absence for some period <em>before </em>September 27, 1982. He made <em>no finding </em>in this regard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>however, thus the doctrine of collateral estoppel as to pre-September residency is not brought in to play.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Wallin, Acting P. J., and Crosby, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b502-11\">Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Because collateral estoppel affects a fact of only marginal importance\u2014father\u2019s residency on September 27, 1982\u2014we do not find it necessary to discuss the retroactive application of <em>Sims. </em>Were we to reach the issue, however, we would hold, since <em>Sims </em>represents a clear break with prior law, that its retroactivity should be limited. <em>(Desist </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) 394 U.S. 244 [22 L.Ed.2d 248, 89 S.Ct. 1030]; <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 24 [196 Cal.Rptr. 704, 672 P.2d 110]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kaanehe </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 1 [136 Cal.Rptr. 409, 559 P.2d 1028].) <em>Sims </em>was filed on September 27, 1982 (the same day as respondent\u2019s hearing) and became final on October 27, 1982 (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 24 (a).). It should only apply to DSS \u201cfair hearings\u201d held <em>after </em>October 27, 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
