The Public Guardian of that county is her conservator. By this petition for extraordinary relief, she seeks to overturn a March 16, 1984, order of the Santa Clara County Superior Court which determined that she did not have the capacity to give written, informed consent to convulsive treatment. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5326.7, subds. (f) and (g).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">The superior court\u2019s order was made following an evidentiary hearing on a petition for necessary convulsive treatment filed by the conservator. The petition alleged that Lillian F. was in need of electroconvulsive therapy (hereafter ECT), that the procedures and consequences of the treatment had been discussed with her, and that, according to her physicians, as a result of a mental disorder she was incapable of fully understanding the treatment and of giving written, informed consent to it. Therefore, the conservator sought authorization from the court to give such consent. At the hearing, petitioner expressly requested that the superior court apply a \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of proof to the question of whether she was capable of giving informed consent to the proposed treatment. Instead, the court determined the question by the \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard and granted the conservator\u2019s petition. This request for extraordinary relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>followed. Having issued a temporary stay of the lower court\u2019s order, we deemed the petition one for writ of mandate and issued our alternative writ. Petitioner contends, and we agree, that the superior court erred in applying the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof to the question of whether or not she was capable of giving written, informed consent to the administration of ECT. We disagree, however, with petitioner\u2019s contention that the appropriate standard of proof is that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, as will be seen, we hold that the standard of proof applicable to a section 5326.7, subdivision (f), proceeding is that of proof of the conservatee\u2019s lack of capacity to consent by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">It will be useful to the present decision to briefly discuss ECT and the statutes regulating its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u201c \u2018Shock\u2019 treatment, more accurately termed \u2018electroconvulsive therapy\u2019 is the name given to a group of therapies which involve passing electrical currents through the brain in order to induce convulsions. The therapeutic effects of ECT are generally believed to be obtained by the seizure produced by the stimulation of the central nervous system. The risks attending such treatment have been greatly reduced by the use of muscle relaxants and general anesthetics, which greatly reduce the body convulsions that led to bone fractures in the past. The mechanism by which ECT confers its benefits is still unknown, but two facts stand out in almost every discussion of the treatment: first, ECT does relieve symptoms of certain mental illnesses, most notably acute depression, and is widely recognized therapy for obtaining remission of those symptoms; second, ECT has several adverse effects, including memory loss and intellectual disorientation. The extent of memory loss and the risk of permanent memory loss are not fully known or agreed upon, but the fact of memory loss is not questioned. The risk of other adverse effects is possible, since the procedure is still so little understood. Those possible risks include permanent brain damage in the local area of the electrodes and a slowing of brain waves. The outstanding features of ECT, then, are its acknowledged benefits in the treatment of certain illnesses, and the intrusive and possibly hazardous character of the treatment.\u201d <em>(Aden </em>v. <em>Younger </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 662, 672, fns. omitted [129 Cal.Rptr. 535].)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">In apparent recognition of the \u201cintrusive\u201d and \u201cpossibly hazardous\u201d character of ECT, the Legislature has established a variety of procedural safeguards surrounding the use of the treatment for voluntarily or involuntarily detained patients pursuant to the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (hereafter LPS Act). (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5000 et seq.) Thus, section 5325 provides in relevant part that \u201c[e]ach person involuntarily detained for evaluation or treatment under provisions of this part . . . shall have the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ing rights, a list of which shall be prominently posted in the predominant languages of the community and explained in a language or modality accessible to the patient in all facilities providing such services and otherwise brought to his or her attention by such additional means as the Director of Mental Health may designate by regulation: ... [1] (f) To refuse convulsive treatment including, but not limited to, any electroconvulsive treatment, any treatment of the mental condition which depends on the induction of a convulsion by any means, and insulin coma treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">And, section 5325.1 provides that \u201c[i]t is the intent of the Legislature that persons with mental illness shall have rights including, but not limited to, the following: \u201c(a) A right to treatment services which promote the potential of the person to function independently. Treatment should be provided in ways that are least restrictive of the personal liberty of the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u201c(b) A right to dignity, privacy, and humane care.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u201c(c) A right to be free from harm, including unnecessary or excessive physical restraint, isolation, medication, abuse, or neglect. Medication shall not be used as punishment, for the convenience of stalf, as a substitute for program, or in quantities that interfere with the treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u201c(i) A right to be free from hazardous procedures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Convulsive treatment may not be administered to an involuntary patient such as petitioner unless the extensive requirements of section 5326.7 are met.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The informed consent contemplated by the section is expressly defined in section 5326.5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Finally, the act specifies, in section 5326.2,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the information which must be given to a patient prior to that patient\u2019s consent to the treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>It is clear, then, that the statute contemplates the safeguard of an evidentiary hearing directed to the question of whether the conservatee is able to understand and knowingly and intelligently act upon the information provided him by the attending physician pursuant to section 5326.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Notably, subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 5326.7, do <em>not </em>specify the standard of proof to be used by the court in making its evidentiary findings. Evidence Code section 115 provides in relevant part that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, the burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Evidence Code section 160, however, specifies that \u201claw\u201d includes decisional and constitutional as well as statutory law. Evidence Code section 115 also specifies three different burdens of proof: 1) proof beyond a reasonable doubt; 2) proof by clear and convincing evidence; and 3) proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u201c \u2018Clear and convincing\u2019 evidence requires a finding of high probability.\u201d <em>{In re Angelia P. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 908, 919 [171 Cal.Rptr. 637, 623 P.2d 198].) Such a test requires that the evidence be \u201c \u2018so clear as to leave no substantial doubt\u2019; \u2018sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.\u2019\u201d <em>(Sheehan </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1899) 126 Cal. 189, 193 [58 P. 543].)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">A preponderance of the evidence standard, on the other hand, \u201csimply requires the trier of fact \u2018to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 371 [28 L.Ed.2d 368, 379, 90 S.Ct. 1068].)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">And, \u201c[i]n criminal proceedings, where the conflicting interests involve an individual\u2019s freedom and the state\u2019s enforcement of its criminal laws, courts have traditionally been particularly sensitive to the citizen\u2019s liberty\u201d <em>(In re Angelia P., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 908, 918), and have applied the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, our state\u2019s high court has not hesitated to extend this standard \u201cto those noncriminal situations in which a personal freedom similarly collides with the state\u2019s interest in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>finement for the protection of both the public and the individual.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>see also <em>Conservatorship of Roulet </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 219 [152 Cal.Rptr. 425, 590 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Our task is to determine the appropriate standard of proof having in mind the nature and purpose of the proceeding, the grave personal intrusion and stigma involved, and the potential deprivation of liberty. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burnick </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 306 [121 Cal.Rptr. 488, 535 P.2d 352].)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">We must balance a \u201ccomplex group of interrelated, but perhaps conflicting, interests . ...\u201d <em>(In re Angelia P., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 908, 919.) Those interests include the right of the conservatee to effective treatment. <em>(In re Roger S. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 921 [141 Cal.Rptr. 298, 569 P.2d 1286]; <em>In re Ingram </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 495, 500 [142 Cal.Rptr. 825].) And that right, we will add, here includes the right to elect or reject a treatment which itself can invade the constitutional right of privacy. As the basic right of privacy implicated has already been eloquently discussed in <em>Aden </em>v. <em>Younger, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.3d 662: \u201cThe right to be free in the exercise of one\u2019s own thoughts is essential to the exercise of other constitutionally guaranteed rights. First Amendment rights of free speech would mean little if the state were to control thought. \u2018Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men\u2019s minds . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] Here the state has sought to control neither what is thought by mental patients, nor how they think. Rather, the state is attempting to regulate the use of procedures which touch upon thought processes in significant ways, with neither the intention nor the effect of regulating thought processes, per se. Yet despite the lack of any showing the state has attempted to regulate freedom of thought, this legislation may diminish this right. If so, the legislation can only be sustained by showing (1) it is necessary to further a \u2018compelling state interest\u2019 and (2) the least drastic means has been employed to further those interests [citation].</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u201cFreedom of thought is intimately touched upon by any regulation of procedures affecting thought and feelings. In an effort to protect freedom of thought, the state has put procedural and substantive obstacles in the path of those who both need and desire certain forms of treatment, and in that way their freedom of thought remains impaired because they cannot get treatment. The means of alleviating mental disorders generate their own kinds of fear and misunderstanding. This attitude touches our public affairs; the fact of treatment alone may impair our confidence in people of unquestioned talent and industry. Psychosurgery and (ECT) are viewed, rightly or wrongly, as drastic, radical forms of treatment compared to psychotherapy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>or drug therapy, and indicative of more severe illness. Public exposure, or even disclosure to limited numbers of government representatives, may have a chilling effect on patients\u2019 efforts to undergo these treatments, thereby restricting their freedom of thought. Some patients will be denied treatment as a natural and intended result of this legislation. Although the reasons for such denials may be the patients\u2019 own best interests, such regulation must be justified by a compelling state interest.\u201d <em>(Aden </em>v. <em>Younger, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.3d 662, 679-680.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The conservatee\u2019s power to refuse medical treatment generally \u201cinvolves such fundamental rights as one\u2019s right to self-determination in the conduct of one\u2019s affairs, the right to be left alone (freedom from governmental interference), and the right to the inviolability of one\u2019s person. All of these rights fall within the \u2018zones\u2019 of privacy found by implication as a \u2018penumbral\u2019 right in the First, Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Amendments of the United States Constitution. [Citations.]\u201d (58 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. (1975) pp. 849, 850.) Of course, California expressly embodies the right of privacy as an inalienable right (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1). \u201cNo right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, <em>unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law. </em>As well said by Judge Cooley, \u2018The right to one\u2019s person may be said to be a right of complete immunity: to be left alone. \u2019 Cooley on Torts, 29.\u201d <em>(Union Pacific Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Botsford </em>(1891) 141 U.S. 250, 251 [35 L.Ed. 734, 11 S.Ct. 1100], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u201cThe function of a standard of proof, as that concept is embodied in the Due Process Clause and in the realm of factfinding, is to \u2018instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication.\u2019 [Citation.] The standard serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants and to indicate the relative importance attached to the ultimate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u201cGenerally speaking, the evolution of this area of the law has produced across a continuum three standards or levels of proof for different types of cases. At one end of the spectrum is the typical civil case involving a monetary dispute between private parties. Since society has a minimal concern with the outcome of such private suits, plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof is a mere preponderance of the evidence. The litigants thus share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u201cIn a criminal case, on the other hand, the interests of the defendant are of such magnitude that historically and without any explicit constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>requirement they have been protected by standards of proof designed to exclude as nearly as possible the likelihood of an erroneous judgment.\u201d <em>(Addington </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1979) 441 U.S. 418, 423 [60 L.Ed.2d 323, 329, 99 S.Ct. 1804]; see generally <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, 370 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 379], Harlan, J., conc.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Plainly, it cannot be said of society\u2019s interest in preventing an erroneous determination of the lack of a conservatee\u2019s power to consent that it is \u201cno more serious in general for there to be an erroneous verdict in the defendant\u2019s favor than for there to be an erroneous verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor\u201d in a civil suit for money damages. <em>(In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, 371 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 379], Harlan, J., conc.) At the same time, the criminal sanction of incarceration is not, strictly speaking, at issue here. (Cf. <em>Conservatorship of Roulet, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The state has, of course, a profound interest in insuring appropriate treatment for the conservatee as well as access to such treatment even for those who by virtue of their illness are incapable of understanding the benefit of the treatment and giving consent to it. It has an equal interest in insuring that such a serious and intrusive procedure is not forced on a conservatee who does not want it and who is simply in disagreement with his conservator and his physicians. \u201cThe proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard is inappropriate in a . . . proceeding where the state may be an adversary to the [patient] but also may be a necessary champion\u201d for his right to treatment. <em>(In re Angelia P., supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 908, 919.) The clear and convincing evidence test is consistent with the balancing of these interests and the proper allocation of the risk of error. Indeed, as the conservator notes, \u201cto use the much more difficult standard of beyond a reasonable doubt in such a hearing would frustrate the purpose of the LPS Act and effectively condemn a gravely disabled person to life in a mental institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Real party\u2019s initial opposition argued that any standard of proof greater than that of a preponderance of the evidence would create \u201cconfusion\u201d and \u201cchaos\u201d in trial courts regarding standards of proof to be used for various medical treatments for conservatees. Decisional law does not support this view. We note, for example, that in <em>Maxon </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 626, 633-634 [185 Cal.Rptr. 516], a clear and convincing evidence requirement was posited concerning the necessity of a hysterectomy for a conservatee because of the impact of that procedure upon the conservatee\u2019s right of privacy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Our research has disclosed no cases expressly deciding the point at issue. While <em>New York Health &amp; Hosp.

We do not join in real party\u2019s view that the opinion \u201cquite obviously\u201d did not use a beyond a reasonable doubt standard and as \u201calmost assuredly\u201d applying a preponderance standard.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Other instructive appellate decisions are <em>Maxon, </em>supra; <em>Grannum </em>v. <em>Berard </em>(1967) 70 Wn.2d 304 [422 P.2d 812, 25 A.L.R.3d 1434]<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and <em>Cobbs </em>v. <em>Grant </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 229, 246 [104 Cal.Rptr. 505, 502 P.2d 1].<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">We need not and do not decide here which standard of proof might be required to determine capacity to consent to other forms of more or less intrusive medical procedures.

The hospital, however, \u201ccommendably\u201d chose to proceed under changes not yet in effect and applied for a court order authorizing ECT, despite the fact that the patient steadfastly objected to it. Specifically, the court addressed the question of whether the patient had the mental capacity to give consent. Stein [the patient] was examined by \u201cindependent psychiatrists\u201d who testified not only that she was capable of consenting or withholding consent, but also that ECT was not clinically indicated in her case. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 946.) In \u201csharp dispute\u201d was the testimony of other doctors produced by the hospital who testified that the treatment was the one of choice for Stein and that she \u2018\u201cis not now nor was she during any period of her hospitalization able to make a rational judgment about any treatment she might require.\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In addition, the court made its own observations of the patient and conversed with her in open court. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 946-947.)
