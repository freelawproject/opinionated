Code, \u00a7 187)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and found true special allegations that defendant used a deadly and dangerous weapon during the commission of the offense (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)) and that defendant had been previously convicted of a \u201cserious felony,\u201d i.e., one in which defendant had personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, 1192.7, subd. (c)(23).) Defendant appeals contending: (1) no substantial evidence supports the verdict; (2) the enhancement for the prior \u201cserious felony\u201d was unlawfully found and imposed; (3) his prior \u201cserious felony\u201d conviction is unconstitutional, and (4) his counsel was incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">We conclude defendant had not been previously convicted of a \u201cserious felony\u201d as a matter of law. We therefore set aside the jury\u2019s \u201cserious felony\u201d finding and order the five-year enhancement term stricken. In all other respects, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Facts Related To The Current Offense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">As noted, defendant was convicted by the jury of first degree murder (\u00a7 187). The jury also found true an allegation that defendant had been previously convicted of a \u201cserious felony,\u201d to wit, that described in section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23): \u201cany felony in which the defendant personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d Defendant contends the \u201cserious felony\u201d enhancement was unlawful. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Before the trial of the serious felony allegation, the court conducted a hearing outside the presence of the jury. The court took judicial notice of portions of its \u201cfile\u201d of the action that resulted in the prior conviction. The court noted that in 1976 defendant was charged with assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a));<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it was also alleged defendant personally used a firearm during the commission of that offense. (\u00a7 12022.5.) The court also noted that the enhancement allegation was dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain. The court ruled that, despite dismissal of the use enhancement allegation, the issue of whether defendant\u2019s prior conviction was a \u201cserious felony\u201d within the meaning of sections 667 and 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23) could go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The prosecution then called the victim of the 1976 conviction as a witness. He testified defendant shot him in the stomach with a revolver in March 1976. The prosecution also introduced a \u201cchange of plea\u201d form, a \u201cjudgment of commitment,\u201d and prison records showing defendant\u2019s photograph and fingerprints. The court took judicial notice (and so instructed the jury) that a person with the same name as the victim had testified at the preliminary hearing in the 1976 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">We conclude that, with respect to prior convictions arising out of crimes committed before the effective date of Proposition 8, subdivision (c)(23) of section 1192.7 must be interpreted to mean a prior felony in which an enhancement for use of a deadly or dangerous weapon, pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (b), was found or admitted to be true. Since the applicable statutory enhancement was first enacted in 1977 (see Stats. 1977, ch. 165, \u00a7 91, p. 678), defendant\u2019s 1976 conviction for violation of section 245, subdivision (a) was understandably not accompanied by the requisite enhancement. The prior conviction is therefore not a \u201cserious felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Our analysis begins with the applicable statutes. Serious felony enhancements are defined by two statutes, sections 667 and 1192.7, which are set forth in full in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These statutes were enacted as a part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Proposition 8 initiative, which was effective on June 9, 1982. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 251, 257 [193 Cal.Rptr. 692, 667 P.2d 149].)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Sections 667 and 1192.7 work in concert. Section 667 describes what shall happen to those convicted of serious felonies; section 667 refers to subdivision (c) of section 1192.7 to define what felonies are serious. Both these statutes contemplate that the serious felonies at issue are discrete statutorily defined crimes or enhancements with elements that are commonly pleaded. We know this for several reasons. First, section 667 speaks of \u201cAny person convicted of a serious felony who previously has been convicted of a serious felony . . . .\u201d That language contemplates a conviction of a defined crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Next, subdivision (a) of section 667 states that an out-of-state felony constitutes a serious felony when it \u201cincludes all of the elements of any serious felony . . . .\u201d From this language, we may reasonably infer that in-state serious felonies are discrete crimes or enhancements with elements that can be compared to the elements of out-of-state discrete crimes or enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">As noted, section 667 uses section 1192.7 as a convenient laundry list to define what felonies are serious. However, section 1192.7 is not principally an enhancement statute. Rather, its primary announced purpose is to limit plea bargaining. Subdivision (a) of section 1192.7 tells us plea bargaining is prohibited \u201cin any case <em>in which the indictment or information charges any serious felony </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) From this language, we can reasonably infer that the laundry list set forth in subdivision (c) of the same statute is made up of matters that we would ordinarily expect to see pleaded in an indictment or information, because subdivision (a) has plainly told us to look to the indictment or information to find out whether a \u201cserious felony\u201d has been charged. The proper function of an indictment or information is to plead only the elements of a statutorily defined offense and not factual surplusage. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crowson </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 623, 634 [190 Cal.Rptr. 165, 660 P.2d 389].) Consequently, we infer the statute contemplates that \u201cserious felonies\u201d are statutorily defined crimes or enhancements with elements that are properly pleaded. And, with the exception of a few items, the laundry list of subdivision (c) fits nicely into this construct: we immediately recognize most items on the list as discrete crimes or enhancements that are pleaded routinely. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">It is evident, however, that the laundry list of section 1192.7, subdivision (c) is not composed exclusively of matters that were defined crimes or enhancements <em>as of passage of Proposition 8. </em>For example, subdivision (c)(12) gives \u201cserious felony\u201d status to \u201cassault by a life prisoner on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>noninmate.\u201d At time of passage of Proposition 8, in 1982, (and at the present time) section 4500 outlawed assaults by prisoners subject to life sentences but did not distinguish between inmate and noninmate victims. Similarly, subdivision (c)(10) of section 1192.7 refers to \u201cassault with intent to commit . . . robbery\u201d even though no such crime existed when Proposition 8 was enacted. Does this mean our \u201cserious felony\u201d construct is invalid and that the statutes do not envision \u201cserious felonies\u201d as being discrete crimes or enhancements? Do the statutes rather contemplate that we should examine the factual circumstances of crimes to find out whether they fit a \u201cserious felony\u201d category, for example, whether an assault was, <em>in fact, </em>upon a noninmate?</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">We think not. Rather, we believe there is an irresistible explanation for most of the matters on the \u201cserious felony\u201d laundry list that were not crimes as of enactment of Proposition 8: the list of serious felonies set forth in subdivision (c) of section 1192.7 was appropriated nearly verbatim from subdivision (b) of section 12021.1,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the latter statute included several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>offenses which had earlier been statutory crimes but which had been subject to repeal before Proposition 8. Thus, nearly all items on the \u201cserious felony\u201d laundry list set forth in subdivision (c) of section 1192.7 can be readily explained by reference to subdivision (b) of section 12021.1: they consist either of matters that were or had been earlier statutory crimes or enhancements as of the date of passage of Proposition 8. In short, we believe subdivision (b) of section 12021.1 is the rosetta stone that explains the otherwise paradoxical \u201cserious felony\u201d statutes in Proposition 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">As is readily apparent from a perusal of the appendix, <em>post, </em>subdivision (c) of section 1192.7 is nearly an exact replica of subdivision (b) of section 12021.1. Section 12021.1 became operative on April 24, 1982\u2014before passage of Proposition 8. (Stats. 1982, ch. 136, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 14, 15, pp. 446-447, 455.) The remarkable similarities in the two statutes compel the conclusion subdivision (b) of section 12021.1 was the basic template from which subdivision (c) of section 1192.7 was produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The ostensible purpose of section 12021.1, read in its entirety, is to require a six month county jail term as a condition of probation, except as provided in subdivision (d), where one who has been previously convicted of a listed \u201cviolent offense\u201d is found guilty of owning or possessing a concealable firearm. As the appendix, <em>post, </em>indicates, each offense set forth in subdivision (b) of section 12021.1 was or is an explictly defined crime or enhancement, as we would expect of a statute that imposes increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>penalties on those who have been previously convicted of specified felonies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In the context of subdivision (b) of section 12021.1, the apparent anomalies we noted earlier\u2014that neither \u201cassault by a life prisoner on a noninmate\u201d nor \u201cassault with intent to commit robbery\u201d were crimes when Proposition 8 was adopted\u2014make perfect sense. Assault by a life prisoner on a noninmate was a crime defined by section 4500 between 1973 and 1977. (Added by Stats. 1973, ch. 719, \u00a7 13, p. 1301; repealed by amendment Stats. 1977, ch. 316, \u00a7 21, pp. 1264-1265.) Similarly, assault with intent to commit robbery was a statutory crime (usually defined by section 220) between 1850 and 1978. (Added by Stats. 1850, ch. 99, \u00a7 50, p. 234; repealed by amendment Stats. 1978, ch. 579, \u00a7 12, p. 1982.) Since the purpose of section 12021.1 is generally to increase the punishment of those convicted of specified crimes in the past who carry proscribed weapons, it is wholly reasonable for the statute to include these former crimes as applicable prior \u201cviolent offenses.\u201d Otherwise, persons previously convicted of these former crimes would evade the statute. Including these former offenses as \u201cserious felonies\u201d makes sense under section 667 for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We find it untenable that the drafters of the \u201cserious felony\u201d provisions of proposition 8 made a conscious decision to depart from the coherent statutory construct reflected in section 12021.1. One arguable indication of such intent lies in the deletion of certain language from subdivision (b)(8) of section 12021.1 when it was made subdivision (c)(8) of section 1192.7. Subdivision (b)(8) of section 12021.1 provides: \u201cAny other felony in which the defendant inflicts great bodily injury on any person, other than an accomplice, <em>which has been charged and proven, </em>or any felony in which the defendant uses a firearm <em>which use has been charged and proven. </em>\u201d (Italics added.) Subdivision (c)(8) of section 1192.7 dropped the emphasized language. (See appendix, <em>post.) </em>Deletion of the emphasized language could arguably be construed as indicating an intent to abandon the notion of discrete crimes that pervades section 12021.1. However, a far more plausible explanation is that deletion of the language was necessary to avoid facial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>absurdity under section 1192.7, which, as we have noted, prohibits plea bargaining in cases where the indictment or information charges specified felonies. Since subdivision (a) of section 1192.7 has told us that all items in subdivision (c) will be pleaded, the requirement in subdivision (b)(8) of section 12021.1 that the matters be \u201ccharged\u201d would be redundant under section 1192.7. And, since plea bargaining takes place before any charge has been proven, it would be absurd to include a requirement that a charge be \u201cproven\u201d in a statute, such as section 1192.7, that outlaws plea bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In sum, we conclude the linguistic change made in subdivision (b)(8) of section 12021.1 cannot reasonably be construed as indicating an intent in section 1192.7 to abandon the former statute\u2019s reference to statutorily defined crimes or enhancements. Rather, we conclude sections 667 and 1192.7, subdivision (c) must be read to define discrete crimes (or former crimes) and enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">We believe a contrary result would, as a practical matter, unleash unproductive chaos in the trial courts. Under a facial application of sections 667 and 1192.7, a \u201cserious felony\u201d prior may be used to enhance a sentence regardless of the age of the prior.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If we were to construe the statutes to permit the litigation of the factual circumstances of old prior convictions, our judicial system would soon be required to resolve (on a case-by-case basis) myriad objections based on speedy trial, due process, and double jeopardy grounds. Our result avoids this morass, achieves an economy of application, and results in appropriate additional punishment for defendants whose prior personal use of dangerous or deadly weapons has been adjudicated under section 12022, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">While this interpretation leaves section 1192.7 with some problems of application,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> those problems are ultimately and fairly attributable to the fact a subdivision of one statute (\u00a7 12021.1, subd. (b)) was borrowed nearly verbatim and uncritically inserted in another statute (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)) designed to accomplish a wholly different purpose. In any event, we cannot interpret the statutes in an unreasonable way in order to try to cure problems caused by use of this perilous drafting technique.  Ordinary rules of statutory construction apply to statutes enacted by initiative. (See <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131, 145-147 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862].) The defendant is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt in the construction of a penal statute imposing increased penalties for past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>convictions. <em>(In re Tartar </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 250, 256-257 [339 P.2d 553], and authorities cited therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">We next examine subdivision (c)(23) of section 1192.7 in light of our conclusion that the statute refers to discrete crimes or enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Subdivision (c)(23) of section 1192.7 describes as \u201cserious\u201d \u201cany felony in which the defendant personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d That language bears an uncanny resemblance to the familiar language of subdivision (b) of section 12022, which provided at the time of enactment of Proposition 8: \u201cAny person who personally uses a deadly or dangerous weapon in the commission or attempted commission of a felony shall, upon conviction of such felony or attempted felony, in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or attempted felony of which he has been convicted, be punished by an additional term of one year, unless use of a deadly or dangerous weapon is an element of the offense of which he was convicted.\u201d (Stats. 1977, ch. 165, \u00a7 91, p. 678.) We conclude a reasonable construction of subdivision (c)(23) of section 1192.7 is that a serious felony conviction described by the subdivision, and arising out of a crime committed before Proposition 8,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is one where an enhancement under section 12022, subdivision (b) was pleaded and proved or admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Our conclusion makes sense under all the applicable statutes. A felony conviction accompanied by the statutory enhancement has \u201celements\u201d that we could compare with out-of-state felonies and enhancements to satisfy section 667. The People were and are required to plead an enhancement sought under section 12022, subdivision (b) (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Najera </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 504, 509, fn. 4 [105 Cal.Rptr. 345, 503 P.2d 1353]) so that such an enhancement meets the identification test of section 1192.7: we could look at an indictment or information and recognize the enhancement allegation. Finally, the language of subdivision (c)(23) of section 1192.7 is identical to that in subdivision (b)(22) of section 12021.1, where we expect to find statutorily defined crimes (or former crimes) and enhancements. (See appendix, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The section 12022, subdivision (b) enhancement for <em>personal use </em>of a deadly or dangerous weapon was enacted as an urgency measure in 1977 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>and became operative on July 1, 1977. (Stats. 1977, ch. 165 \u00a7\u00a7 91, 100, pp. 678, 680.) Before that, section 12022 imposed an enhancement only upon one <em>armed </em>with a deadly weapon. (Stats. 1968, ch. 1386, \u00a7 1, pp. 2720-2721.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since the requisite enhancement did not exist in 1976, when defendant was convicted, it could not have been (and was not) imposed on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We recognize that the language of section 12022, subdivision (b) currently precludes imposition of the enhancement upon a conviction for assault with a deadly weapon. (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1).) Section 12022, subdivision (b) makes the enhancement inapplicable where \u201cuse of a deadly or dangerous weapon is an element of the offense of which he was convicted.\u201d Use of a deadly weapon is an element of the offense defined by section 245, subdivision (a)(1). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whitehouse </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 479, 484-485 [169 Cal.Rptr. 199].) Therefore, the enhancement is precluded by its own statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">It does not follow, however, that our conclusion is nonsensical. Section 12021.1\u2014the role-model statute\u2014apparently recognizes that the section 12022, subdivision (b) enhancement cannot be imposed upon a conviction for violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(1). Subdivision (b)(24) of section 12021.1 therefore defines the crime of assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)) as a \u201cviolent offense,\u201d regardless of whether the defendant has personally used a weapon. (See fn. 6, <em>ante.) </em>However, subdivision (b)(24) of section 12021.1 is one of the few \u201cviolent offenses\u201d omitted from the \u201cserious felony\u201d laundry list set forth in subdivision (c) of section 1192.7. (See appendix, <em>post.) </em> It is an established canon of statutory construction that where statutory language is used in the same or similar context, an omission of crucial language must be given significance. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Valentine </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 121, 142 [169 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Salazar </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 799, 807 [193 Cal.Rptr. 1]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 467 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697].)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We believe a reasonable conclusion is that a conviction for violation of subdivision (a)(1)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of section 245, is not to be given \u201cserious felony\u201d status under sections 667 and 1192.7. Subdivision (c)(ll) of section 1192.7 defines as a \u201cserious felony\u201d an assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer. (See \u00a7 245, subd. (b).) And subdivision (c)(13) of section 1192.7 gives \u201cserious felony\u201d status to an assault with a deadly weapon by an inmate. (See \u00a7 4501.) Unlike the \u201cviolent offense\u201d statute, the \u201cserious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>felony\u201d statutes therefore single out for \u201cserious felony\u201d status certain species of assaults with a deadly weapon, i.e., those described in sections 245, subdivision (b) and 4501.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">We also note that a conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, in and of itself, does not fit the statutory criteria set out in subdivision (c)(23) of section 1192.7. While <em>use </em>of a deadly or dangerous weapon is an element of the offense defined by section 245, subdivision (a)(1), <em>personal </em>use is not. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Chagolla </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 422, 428-429 [193 Cal.Rptr. 711], <em>People </em>v. <em>Flanders </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 634, 640 [152 Cal.Rptr. 696].) Consequently, a conviction of assault with a deadly weapon does not satisfy the requirement of subdivision (c)(23) of section 1192.7 that defendant has <em>personally </em>used a dangerous or deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Because defendant had not suffered an enhancement under section 12022, subdivision (b) in connection with his 1976 felony conviction, the five-year serious felony enhancement was improperly imposed under sections 667 and 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23). We shall order the jury\u2019s finding of the serious felony enhancement vacated and the five-year enhancement term stricken.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The jury\u2019s finding the defendant suffered a prior conviction as alleged is vacated and the five-year term imposed for the enhancement is stricken.

The Attorney General has opined that one previously convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse (\u00a7 261.5) or of \u201cstatutory rape\u201d (former \u00a7 261, subd. (1)) has not previously been convicted of \u201crape\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (b)(3) of section 12021.1. (67 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 45, 48 (1984).) The Attorney General reasoned that rape was defined as a different crime than either unlawful sexual intercourse or \u201cstatutory rape\u201d (see \u00a7 261), so that section 12021.1 did not apply. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Attorney General's analysis assumed the obvious: that subdivision (b) of section 12021.1 referred to discrete, defined crimes, not to conduct considered in isolation from the requisite elements of such crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">We imply no view on whether the age of a prior conviction may raise constitutional problems.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">For example, it is not clear how one can attempt to plea bargain in cases where the offense has been repealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Where a defendant has personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon in a felony committed <em>after </em>Proposition 8, we presume the prosecution would ordinarily plead an enhancement under subdivision (c)(23) of section 1192.7. Consequently, with respect to post-Proposition 8 crimes, we do not imply that an enhancement finding under section 12022, subdivision (b) is the <em>only </em>finding that would satisfy the \u201cserious felony\u201d statutes. Presumably, a felony with an enhancement found under subdivision (c)(23) of section 1192.7 will be properly used as a \u201cserious felony\u201d prior conviction if the same defendant commits another \u201cserious felony\u201d in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\">A 1976 amendment, which continued the \u201carmed\u201d language, would have taken effect July 1, 1977, but was obliterated by the 1977 urgency legislation. (See Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7\u00a7 304, 351.5, pp. 5161, 5176.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Formerly subdivision (a).

(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Harvey </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 754 [159 Cal.Rptr. 696, 602 P.2d 396]; compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Guevara </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 86 [151 Cal.Rptr. 511].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-13\">See footnote 2, <em>ante, </em>page 534.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b408-10\">PUGLIA, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9T\">I concur in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">Paragraph (c), subdivision (23) of Penal Code section 1192.7 is virtually identical to the operative language of paragraph (b) of Penal Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>12022. It is highly unlikely that this precise congruence is coincidental. Rather it manifests an intended interrelationship between the two provisions. Since in appropriate cases personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon may be charged as an enhancement under section 12022, subdivision (b), the related provision of section 1192.7 may not later be invoked unless such a charge has been made and proven. No such enhancement was charged in conjunction with defendant\u2019s 1976 conviction of felony assault nor could it have been because the prior crime occurred before the enactment of section 12022, subdivision (b), which in any event is facially inapplicable to charges of assault with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The petitions of both parties for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied January 17, 1985. Lucas, J., was of the opinion that the hearing should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
