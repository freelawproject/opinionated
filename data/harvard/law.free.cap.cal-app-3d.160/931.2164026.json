This cause of action was based on petitioner\u2019s filing an unbonded stop notice during the course of litigation between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Petitioner contends the Serabias\u2019 claim was barred as a matter of law on two theories: (1) the filing of the stop notice was privileged; and (2) petitioner\u2019s conduct was not outrageous.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">Petitioner, Melorich Builders, Inc. (Melorich), a general contractor, agreed to build a house for the Serabias. Construction was to be financed through Santa Fe Federal Savings and Loan Association (Santa Fe). Disputes over the construction arose between Melorich and the Serabias. The Serabias sued Melorich for breach of contract, and Melorich cross-complained to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">After this litigation commenced Melorich filed an unbonded stop notice with Santa Fe on March 19, 1979. This was done on advice of counsel. Santa Fe\u2019s attorney acknowledged receipt of the stop notice and advised Melorich\u2019s attorney Santa Fe was not obligated to honor an unbonded stop notice. On March 25, 1979, Melorich\u2019s attorney was orally notified by the attorney for the Serabias that the stop notice was not an available remedy for a general contractor. Melorich\u2019s attorney agreed to rescind the stop notice if the remedy was not available to Melorich. Melorich\u2019s attorney rescinded the stop notice and notified Santa Fe on April 11, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">After the stop notice was rescinded, the Serabias amended their complaint to include a ninth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>distress based on the filing of this notice. The emotional distress action was ordered severed, and following a trial on the remaining causes of action, the Serabias were awarded judgment. Shortly before the severed action was scheduled to be tried, Melorich moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Melorich\u2019s motion for summary judgment was supported by declarations of its president, secretary and attorney. The declarations of the president and secretary indicated: (1) they were the sole owners and stockholders of Melorich; (2) they were not familiar with the legalities of stop notices; (3) the stop notice was filed on advice of their attorney; and (4) the stop notice was filed to protect their interest in funds held by Santa Fe and not out of malice toward the Serabias. The declaration of Melorich\u2019s attorney indicated: (1) he had not discussed the preparation of the stop notice with the president and secretary of Melorich; (2) he prepared the stop notice at the request of the president\u2019s father who formerly held an interest in Melorich; (3) he knew the president\u2019s father had no present interest in Melorich and was neither an officer nor a director; (4) he assumed the stop notice had been discussed with the president and secretary as owners of Melorich; (5) he did not know a general contractor (Melorich) could not utilize, a stop notice to collect funds; and (6) when advised a stop notice was not available to Melorich, he researched the issue and then withdrew the stop notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The Serabias filed points and authorities in opposition to the motion for summary judgment but did not contradict or dispute Melorich\u2019s declarations by counteraffidavits or declarations. Because the Serabias\u2019 memorandum in opposition to the motion for summary judgment was neither an affidavit nor a declaration, we must assume that the Serabias either cannot dispute the truth of Melorich\u2019s affidavits or cannot controvert them. <em>(Seltzer </em>v. <em>Seltzer </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 137, 140 [80 Cal.Rptr. 688].) The facts set forth in the supporting affidavits are not brought in dispute by allegations in the pleadings of the opposing party and therefore are undenied. <em>(Truslow </em>v. <em>Woodruff (1967) </em>252 Cal.App.2d 158, 164 [30 Cal.Rptr. 304].)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\u201cIn the absence of counteraffidavits, the court is required to grant a motion for summary judgment where the affidavits of the moving party satisfy the following requirements: 1) the affidavits must contain facts sufficient to entitle the moving parties to a judgment, i.e., facts establishing every element necessary to sustain a judgment; 2) the facts must be set forth with particularity, all requisite evidentiary facts must be stated, and not the ultimate facts or conclusions of law; and 3) each of the affiants must show that if sworn as a witness he can testify competently to the evidentiary facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>contained in the affidavit [citation]. Neither the trial court nor the appellate court may weigh evidence [citation]. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">\u201cWhen no affidavits are filed in opposition to a motion for summary judgment, the court is entitled to accept as true the facts alleged in the movant\u2019s affidavits, provided they are within the personal knowledge of the affiant and are facts to which he could competently testify. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\u201cWhere no triable issues of fact are presented, and the sole remaining question is one of law, it may appropriately be determined on a motion for summary judgment [citations].\u201d <em>(Leo F. Piazza Paving Co. </em>v. <em>Foundation Constructors, Inc. </em>(1981) 128 Cal.App.3d 583, 588-589 [177 Cal.Rptr. 268].)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">With these rules in mind, we examine the trial court\u2019s denial of Melorich\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The trial court made the following order in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201cOne material fact raised by the motion is whether the recording of the stop notice could create a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional harm. The Defendants have proffered evidence that the recording was priviledged [sz'c] and therefore could not so do while the Plaintiffs have proffered evidence that it was not priviledged [yz'c] and even if priviledged [szc] it could still create a cause of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">\u201cAnother material fact raised by the motion is whether Plaintiffs in fact suffered any emotional harm because of the recording of the stop notice. Defendants have proffered evidence to show that Plaintiff\u2019s condition preexisted the recording. Plaintiff has proffered evidence to show that any preexisting condition was aggravated by the recording.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">This order failed to address the second issue raised by Melorich\u2019s motion for summary judgment, i.e., Melorich\u2019s conduct was not outrageous as a matter of law.  The elements of a prima facie case for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress are: \u201c \u2018(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff\u2019s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant\u2019s outrageous conduct. <em>(Fletcher </em>v. <em>Western National Life Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 376, 394 [89 Cal.Rptr. 78, 47 A.L.R.3d 286].)\u2019\u201d <em>(Davidson </em>v. <em>City of Westminster </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 197, 209 [185 Cal.Rptr. 252, 649 P.2d 894], quoting from <em>Cervantez </em>v. <em>J. C. Penney Co. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 579, 593 [156 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>198, 595 P.2d 975].) If one of these elements in the Serabias\u2019 cause of action is missing, they lose. <em>(Weaver </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 166, 192 [156 Cal.Rptr. 745] [malicious prosecution context].)  Thus, we consider Melorich\u2019s uncontradicted declarations strictly to determine if they establish Melorich\u2019s right to judgment by conclusively negating a necessary element of the Serabias\u2019 cause of action. <em>(Tool Research &amp; Engineering Corp. </em>v. <em>Henigson </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 675, 678 [120 Cal.Rptr. 291].)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Melorich\u2019s declarations show these facts to be uncontested: (1) they were not familiar with the procedures for filing stop notices; (2) they did not know the use of a stop notice was not available to them; (3) the stop notice was filed to protect their interest in funds held by Santa Fe; (4) they filed the offending stop notice on advice of their attorney; (5) the attorney\u2019s recommendation they file the stop notice was not based on information supplied by them; (6) their attorney was familiar with the facts surrounding this litigation; (7) the stop notice was in effect from March 19, 1979, until April 11, 1979; and (8) the stop notice was withdrawn by their attorney when it was determined it was not available to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Based on these facts, was Melorich\u2019s conduct in this instance extreme and outrageous? No.  The standard set for measuring outrageous conduct indicates the qualifying conduct must be so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. <em>(Davidson </em>v. <em>City of Westminster, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 197, 209.) Generally, the case is one in which the recitation of the facts to an average member of the community would arouse his resentment against the actor, and lead him to exclaim, \u201cOutrageous!\u201d <em>(See Fuentes </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 163, 170 [136 Cal.Rptr. 275]; <em>Golden </em>v. <em>Dungan </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 295, 304 [97 Cal.Rptr. 577].)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">We take judicial notice mechanic\u2019s liens and stop notice statutes are technical in nature and utilization requires strict statutory compliance. Any prudent business person should follow the advice of his/her attorney in order to safely negotiate this complicated statutory maze. To hold otherwise would discourage business people from following the advice of their attorneys. Here, Melorich received and followed the advice of its attorney in filing a stop notice. Melorich\u2019s conduct in doing so can hardly be said to be extreme or outrageous even though the attorney\u2019s advice later proved to be legally unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">We hold, as a matter of law, it is a complete defense to a claim of extreme and outrageous conduct when the evidence shows (1) the defendant acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>on the opinion and advice of counsel; (2) counsel\u2019s advice was based on full disclosure of all the facts by defendant or the advice was initiated by counsel based on counsel\u2019s familiarity with the case; and (3) the defendant\u2019s reliance on the advice of counsel was in good faith. (Accord <em>Bertero </em>v. <em>National General Corp. </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 43, 53-54 [118 Cal.Rptr. 184, 529 P.2d 608, 65 A.L.R.3d 878] [malicious prosecution context].)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Having determined Melorich\u2019s conduct was not extreme and outrageous, a necessary element of the Serabias\u2019 cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is missing. Accordingly, the trial court improperly denied Melorich\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Having made this determination, we need not address the issue of privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the Superior Court of San Bernardino County to vacate its order denying Melorich\u2019s motion for summary judgment and to enter a new and different order granting Melorich\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to the Serabias\u2019 ninth cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The alternative writ of mandate is ordered discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Morris, P. J., and McDaniel, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
