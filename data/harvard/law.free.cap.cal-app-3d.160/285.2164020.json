J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB5\">On October 7, 1982, Bryan Lee Nece (hereinafter appellant) and two other persons were charged in an information with the commission of certain felonious conduct. Count I charged conspiracy to commit grand theft and conspiracy to cheat and defraud (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182, subds. 1 and 4). Counts II and III charged Nece and others with grand theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. 1), and in addition, that the value of the property stolen was in excess of $100,000 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.6, subd. (b)). Appellant pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">On December 21, 1982, appellant had his motion to suppress evidence of his personal finances heard in the superior court. The court denied the motion. Later the denied motion was tested by a writ of mandate filed with this court. Said petition was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">On July 26, 1983, appellant withdrew his not guilty plea as to count II, and instead, entered a plea of nolo contendere. At the same time, on the prosecution\u2019s motion, the court dismissed the remaining counts against appellant. At the sentencing hearing on October 21, 1983, the court denied probation and sentenced appellant to state prison for the midterm of two years. This appeal followed shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The grand theft charge against appellant arose out of an unauthorized transfer of funds by Mr. Nece from the bank account of his employer, Baker Commodities, Inc. These funds were then transferred to his bank accounts at the Atlantic-Whittier branch of Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">A company specializing in the manufacture and sales of animal and vegetable products, Baker Commodities, Inc., purchased and sold commodities on the commodities and world markets. Appellant handled the cash management of the company and had the responsibility of tracking the company\u2019s cash status. If the company had surplus cash, appellant became responsible for investing same. If the company was in need of cash, appellant arranged for the company to borrow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">In addition to the above responsibilities, appellant was entrusted \u201cto match up purchase orders and contracts with requests for checks,\u201d and in some instances, to notify his employer\u2019s bank (Bank of America) to whom the funds should be sent, to expedite a waiting customer\u2019s acquisition of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>On December 30, 1981, appellant opened both a personal checking account and a checking account in the name of Universal Investments (hereinafter Universal) at the Atlantic-Whittier branch of Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">On April 1, 1982, appellant \u201cwire transferred\u201d some $250,016.13 from a Baker Commodities, Inc. (hereinafter Baker) account into his Universal account. The following day, April 2, 1982, appellant transferred an additional $554,986 from the Baker account into the Universal account.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Appellant issued several checks from the Universal account, dated April 2, 1982, to Ronald Robbins. These checks totalled $98,000 and were deposited in different branches of Bank of America. Appellant also issued $87,000 worth of checks on the Universal account to Oscar Escobar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In addition to the multitude of transactions occurring on April 2, 1982, appellant \u201cwire transferred\u201d $40,000 from his Universal account to Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. The funds went to the account of First National Mortgage Corporation for the purchase of 100 Krugerrands. A balance of $2,575 remained in the Universal account after all transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">On April 2, 1982, an administrator of the Atlantic-Whittier Bank of America, familiar with the Baker account, noticed the aforementioned transactions and found them \u201cunusual.\u201d Her suspicions of fraud aroused, the officer placed stop orders and holds on some of the withdrawals and notified the Slauson-Pacific Bank of America, where Baker Commodities, Inc. maintained its account. Moreover, the bank officer, Mrs. Hurst, requested a credit rating on Baker Commodities, Inc. which led to a reciprocal check on the Universal Investments\u2019 rating and a disclosure that appellant was the only signatory on the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The latter information was made available to Ray Kelley at Baker Commodities, Inc. This led to a search of the trash near appellant\u2019s work desk disclosing numerous writings indicative of appellant\u2019s responsibility for the fund transfers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, corporate counsel for Baker Commodities, Inc. suspected that embezzlement was involved and on April 5, 1982, brought the matter to the attention of the Vernon Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">On April 5, 1982, Detective Stolan of the Vernon Police Department began investigating the matter by meeting with respresentatives from Baker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Commodities, Inc. Among other things, Detective Stolan was shown the documents found in appellant\u2019s trash and the banking records of Baker Commodities, Inc. Later that day Baker representatives requested that Detective Stolan meet with them and bank officials at the Slauson-Pacific branch of the Bank of America. At this time he was informed by an officer at the Slauson-Pacific branch of the bank, that the transactions from the Baker account were fraudulent. Eventually, at the direction of Slauson-Pacific officials, the detective went to the Atlantic-Whittier branch to speak with Mrs. Hurst.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Mrs. Hurst provided Detective Stolan, sans search warrant or subpoena, with information on both the Universal account and appellant\u2019s personal checking account. The information included photocopies of documents regarding the activities in the Universal account. Some 10 days later, detective Stolan executed a search warrant of 14 branches of Bank of America and seized various documents pursuant to same.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Appellant\u2019s sole argument concerns the propriety of the trial court\u2019s unfavorable ruling on his Penal Code section 1538.5 motion to suppress. Thus, the sole issue becomes whether appellant\u2019s banking records and other financial information were lawfully obtained by the Vernon Police Department from the Bank of America. We find that they were, and affirm the judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">In <em>Burrows </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 238 [118 Cal.Rptr. 166, 529 P.2d 590], our Supreme Court ruled that pursuant to article I, section 1 of the California Constitution,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an individual in California has a reasonable expectation that information he divulges to his bank or the information he allows said institution to compile, in connection with his banking activities, is <em>confidential. </em>In so doing, the court also indicated that the police could not lawfully acquire or use said information absent some form of consensual authorization by the individual or legal process, i.e., a warrant, subpoena, or summons; or given a situation in which the bank finds itself a victim of wrongdoing allegedly attributable to the individual customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">In 1976, as a response to <em>Burrows\u2019 </em>decision, our Legislature enacted the California Right to Financial Privacy Act (hereinafter Act).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the Act now found in section 7470, subdivision (a) of the Government Code currently restricts governmental access to an individual\u2019s banking records absent (1) an authorized disclosure by the individual to the requesting governmental agent; or (2) a validly issued administrative subpoena as summons; or (3) a validly issued search warrant; or (4) a judicially sanctioned subpoena or subpoena duces tecum.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">In addition, subdivision (d) of said section specifically permits governmental access to an individual\u2019s banking records by making said right of access discretionary and exercisable by the financial institution. The criterion for the institution\u2019s decision, should it be inclined to make same, is that it believe itself to be a victim of a crime.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">As an obvious complement to the aforesaid section\u2019s design to safeguard against unbridled governmental intrusion of an individual\u2019s privacy rights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>the Legislature enacted Government Code section 7471. That section forbids a financial institution from supplying banking records of its customer to \u201can officer, employee, or agent of any state or local agency\u201d where the financial institution knows or has reasonable cause to believe that said information is sought in connection with civil or criminal investigation of that customer. In this section, as in section 7470, subdivision (d), an exception is made where the financial institution suspects that a crime is being or has been committed. Subdivision (c) states: \u201cThis section shall not preclude a financial institution, <em>in its discretion, </em>from initiating contact with, and thereafter communicating with and disclosing customer financial records to, appropriate state and local agencies concerning suspected violation of any law.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">As we perceive it, the situation presented below falls squarely within the ambit of Government Code section 7471, subdivision (c), if not, section 7470, subdivision (d). It is clear from the language itself<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and its contextual stature that both statutes are intended to allow the disclosure of normally private information to the police, by a financial institution, when the latter has a genuine reason to suspect that a crime has or is being committed, and/ or that it may suffer as a victim thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Without such an exception, a bank aware of facts indicating criminal activity, involving its customers and/or itself, would be forced to stand idly to the side, without any other sensible recourse other than to merely <em>hint </em>such activity to the police. Undoubtedly, this would stifle police efficiency and more than likely promote criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Appellant insists that respecting section 7471, subdivision (c), the subject language limits the exception solely to situations in which the bank, and the bank alone, first contacts the police. In the same regard, he urges that the evidence in this case establishes otherwise. Secondarily, appellant attacks the application of section 7470, subdivision (d) with the complaint that the evidence fails to establish that \u201cthe bank\u201d believed itself to be \u201ca victim of a crime.\u201d We need only concern ourselves with the first contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Contending a noncompliance with section 7471, subdivision (c), appellant seizes upon the words \u201cinitiating contact,\u201d and in turn suggests that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>bank\u2019s customer, Baker Commodities, and not the bank was the first party to literally bring the suspected banking \u201cirregularities\u201d to the attention of the police. Unfortunately, although we might concede that said language, when isolated, could be construed as appellant so argues, it remains that a contextual reading of same belies said construction and would have the effect of honoring form over substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">We think the questioned language deserves an interpretation much less strict than advanced by appellant and that said \u201clooser\u201d interpretation is implicit from the obvious import of the statute. Clearly, as indicated above, the language is merely part of a larger framework designed to forestall random and unwarranted government intrusion into an individual\u2019s private affairs. The facts at bench establish that in this case, the inquiry made by the government was anything but \u201crandom\u201d or \u201cunwarranted,\u201d considering that the police did not initiate contact, but were in fact sought for their assistance by a party with well founded suspicion that it was a victim of criminal activity. Equally significant, Baker Commodities would not have been aware of its victimization, \u201cbut for\u201d Bank of America\u2019s initial observation. Thus, the bank may be said to have constructively \u201cinitiated contact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">From another perspective, it would appear that without Baker Commodities\u2019 help, Bank of America could not have been able to ascertain, to within any reasonable degree of probability, that a crime had occurred. The record establishes that only after said precautions were taken, did bank officials, Baker Commodities\u2019 officials, and the police all convene to share discoverable and nonconfidential information. This in turn led Bank of America officials to first \u201coffer\u201d appellant\u2019s bank records for police examination. Thus, it is reasonably possible to characterize said \u201coffer\u201d as constituting nothing more than an \u201cinitiation of contact\u201d by the bank for the purpose of \u201cthereafter communicating with and disclosing customer financial records to, [the police] concerning suspected violation of any law.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Construing the subject statute towards giving it meaning and effect,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and finding in this instance more than mere substantial compliance by the police, we must discount appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In determining the government\u2019s \u201csearch and seizure\u201d of appellant\u2019s banking records to have been lawful, pursuant to section 7471, subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>(c), said evidence was therefore properly admitted by the lower court. The finding makes any further consideration of appellant\u2019s contentions unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Ashby, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Ronald Robbins and Oscar Escobar were codefendants below, but are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-11\">The paperwork included forged, bogus, and altered documents signed by appellant for use in a transfer of funds from Baker Commodities, Inc.
