Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 22 counts of oral copulation with a minor (\u00a7 288a, subd. (b)(2) and (c)), and one count of sodomy with a minor (\u00a7 286, subd. (b)(2)). On appeal Ste<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>phenson raises issues with respect to the admission of evidence, the jury instructions and his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">A brief summary of the facts will suffice. Stephenson\u2019s pattern of activity with each of three male victims was essentially the same. Stephenson would invite the boy to his apartment, show him pornographic films and books depicting homosexual and heterosexual activity and, eventually, entice him into sexual activity, consisting of mutual masturbation, mutual oral copulation and, on one occasion (with Eric. E.), sodomy. At the time of his first contact with Bill B., in 1979, Stephenson was 39 years old and Bill B. was 13 years old. When Craig Y. met Stephenson in 1980 and Eric E. met him in in 1981, they were 12 and 13 years old, respectively. The jury acquitted Stephenson on all the charges involving Bill B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stephenson was convicted on all the charges involving Craig Y. and all but one of sodomy involving Eric E.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Stephenson\u2019s last argument is the trial court erred as a matter of law in sentencing him to serve a total of 15 years in state prison, rather than 10 years.  This position is premised upon the argument section 288, subdivision (a) child molestation is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">The identical argument was made and rejected recently by another division in this district. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hetherington </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 1132 [201 Cal.Rptr. 756].) We agree with the cogent analysis in <em>Hetherington </em>and reach the same conclusion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as a lewd act on a child under 14 <em>as defined in section 288, </em>it includes <em>all </em>of that section, including subdivision (a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Granted, the Legislature did distinguish between \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201cnonviolent\u201d section 288 offenses when it added subdivision (b) in 1979. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hetherington, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.3d 1132, 1137.) At the same time, the Legislature added or amended seven other statutes in the Penal Code and Welfare and Institutions Code, making specific reference to section 288, subdivision (b). <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1137-1138.) The failure to change section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6) to define <em>only </em>section 288, subdivision (b) as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d appears to be by design. (Id., at p. 1138.) While section 288, subdivisions (a) and (b) each provide the same three terms of imprisonment, the potential punishment consequences for a subdivision (b) conviction are more severe by virtue of the other statutes which were enacted or amended at the time subdivision (b) was enacted. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Consequently, it cannot be said a failure to distinguish between subdivisions (a) and (b) for purposes of section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6) results in equating \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201cnonviolent\u201d child molestation for sentencing purposes. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">As <em>Hetherington </em>notes, section 667.5, subdivision (c), also defines as \u201cviolent\u201d felonies other offenses (\u00a7\u00a7 37, 218), which can be committed without causing physical injury to a person. (154 Cal.App.3d at p. 1139.) But even were this not the case, it would not follow the Legislature did not intend to retain section 288, subdivision (a), as a \u201cviolent\u201d felony under section 667.5, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">We must follow the plain meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (c), unless to do so will produce absurd results or will frustrate the manifest purpose of the legislation as a whole. We discern no absurd results occurring from this construction of the statute. The legislative intent to encompass section 288, subdivision (a) within section 667.5, subdivision (c)(6), is buttressed by subdivision (c)\u2019s declaration condemning \u201cextraordinary crimes of violence against the person.\u201d The absence of specific reference to <em>physical </em>injury, which the Legislature has done in many statutes, signifies to us, as it did to the court in <em>Hetherington, </em>a recognition certain felonies, such as section 288, subdivision (a), are \u201cviolent\u201d by virtue of the extreme psychological or emotional harm caused by their commission. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1139-1140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The trial court chose to sentence under section 1170.1 rather than section 667.6, subdivision (c). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Belmontes </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 335 [193 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 882, 667 P.2d 686].) One section 288, subdivision (a) count was selected as the base term for Stephenson\u2019s sentence; the trial court imposed the middle term of five years and consecutive sentences on the twenty-six remaining counts. The court, pursuant to section 654, stayed imposition of sentence on certain counts. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 545, 551-552 [153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition, the trial court stayed another 13 years of the sentence, pursuant to section 1170.1, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which limits the total subordinate term for consecutive <em>nonviolent </em>felonies to five years. Three counts of child molestation (\u00a7 288, subd. (a)) remained. The trial court imposed consecutive sentences of one-third the middle term of imprisonment on each of these counts resulting in an additional unstayed term of imprisonment of five years. Hence, the trial court sentenced Stephenson to a total unstayed term of 15 years in the state prison for the 27 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Part of the statutory sentencing scheme (\u00a7 1170.1, subd. (g))<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> establishes a general rule the total term of imprisonment shall not exceed twice the number of years imposed as the base term <em>unless </em>the consecutive offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>are \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d as defined in section 667.5. But since the section 288, subdivision (a) convictions which resulted in the consecutive sentences <em>are </em>violent felonies, the limitation of section 1170.1, subdivision (g) did not apply. Stephenson was not limited to a total sentence of twice the base term of five years. There was no sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Trotter, P.
