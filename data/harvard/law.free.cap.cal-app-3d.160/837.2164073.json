We hold that the city and the firemen are not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">On November 23, 1980, fire damaged the real property of real parties in interest. Real parties filed a complaint against the City and County of San Francisco and individual personnel of the city\u2019s fire department, petitioners herein, and against a paint company. Their causes of action against petitioners arise from allegations that personnel of engine company 22, which was located approximately 300 feet from real parties\u2019 property, participated in an improper social gathering, an abalone dinner, at engine company 31 on the evening of the fire with the result that company 22\u2019s firehouse was left unmanned. The fire was reported by persons who ran directly to engine company 22 rather than by calls to department headquarters. As a result of engine company 22\u2019s absence from their firehouse, response to the fire was delayed and extensive damage to the real property of real parties resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In a fifth amended complaint, several theories of liability are posited. For example, real parties alleged that liability arose from the special relationship that existed between engine company 22 and its neighbors and from the breach of mandatory rules of the fire department. In the seventh cause of action, real parties alleged that the city and county was liable for the property damage caused by its employees who intentionally, negligently, wilfully, and wrongfully failed to carry out their duties. It was only the seventh cause of action that survived a general demurrer,  The city now argues that its demurrer to this cause of action should have been sustained as well since it owed no duty of care to real parties and, even if it did, it is immune from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The statutes upon which liability of the city is alleged in the instant case are Government Code section 815.2 subdivision (a) which makes a public entity liable for the torts of its employees and section 815.6 which makes a public entity liable for its failure to discharge a mandatory duty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the other hand, immunity is premised upon section 850.4 which provides that \u201c[n]either a public entity, nor a public employee acting in the scope of his employment, is liable ... for any injury caused in fighting fires\u201d and section 850 which provides that \u201c[njeither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for failure ... to provide fire protection.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Prior to the enactment of the California Tort Claims Act in 1963 with its statutory immunities for fire protection services, the Supreme Court considered an action by a property owner against a municipal corporation for the negligence of its employees in maintaining a water main and hydrant which became so clogged that there was insufficient water to put out a fire quickly enough to spare plaintiff\u2019s property from substantial damage. A cause of action was denied upon the reasoning that there was no liability at common law\u2014no duty of care, public or private\u2014to the inhabitants of the city in this situation. \u201cUpon analysis, it clearly appears that the gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is the failure of a governmental function. Such failure involves the denial of a benefit owing to the community as a whole, but it does not constitute a wrong or injury to a member thereof so as to give rise to a right of individual redress [citation], which right must be predicated upon the violation of a duty of care owed to the injured party. [Citation.] As the maintenance and operation of a fire department is so distinguished as a governmental function for the public good, it is \u2018well settled that a municipal corporation is not responsible for the destruction of property within its limits by a fire which it did not set, merely because, through the negligence <em>or other default </em>of the corporation or its employees, the members of the fire department failed to extinguish the fire.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Stang </em>v. <em>City of Mill Valley </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 486, 489-490 [240 P.2d 980], italics added.) After the enactment of the Tort Claims Act, the Supreme Court considered a similar claim against a city. It held that no cause of action existed against the city for two reasons. First, the court applied <em>Stang </em>and found no liability and second, the court found immunity pursuant to the provisions of sections 850.2 and 850.4. <em>(Heieck and Moran </em>v. <em>City of Modesto </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 229, 232-233 [49 Cal.Rptr. 377, 411 P.2d 105]; see also <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Madera </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 298, 303-305 [192 Cal.Rptr. 548].) In one of its causes of action, plaintiff in <em>Heieck </em>also premised liability on a failure of the city fire department to summon the tank trucks when it found the water supply was not available. Again, the court held that there was no duty to summon such assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Real parties in their pleading attempt to avoid this basic problem of lack of duty by alleging that a special relationship existed between engine company 22 and plaintiffs because they were neighbors. Respondent court rejected this theory and also rejected the theory that a mandatory duty arose from fire department regulations. Rather respondent court concluded that the allegations of intentional, wilful or reckless misconduct distinguish this complaint from those seeking damages for the ordinary negligence of firemen. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Turning first to the effect of these allegations on statutory liability itself, real parties urge this court to recognize the difference between conduct which is merely negligent and \u201cconduct intentionally committed in such a reckless manner as to greatly increase the likelihood of injury to third parties.\u201d Petitioners, on the other hand, contend that since there was no duty owed by them to real parties, it doesn\u2019t matter if their conduct was wilful, reckless, or with conscious disregard or even intentional. This contention is supported by quoting the observations of Van Alstyne that \u201cIf no duty ... is established, there can be no liability, even though the defendant\u2019s conduct may have been thoughtless or cruel.\u201d (Van Alstyne, Cal. Government Tort Liability Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1980) \u00a7 2.32, p. 79.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">However, there are obvious consequences which attach to wilful, wanton and reckless conduct in the law of negligence, and in listing these Prosser mentions that such conduct has been held to \u201cjustify a broader duty, and more extended liability for consequences.\u201d (Prosser, Law of Torts (4th ed. 1971) p. 184.) Even assuming arguendo that a persuasive argument on these lines could be advanced, or assuming that real parties could prevail in their argument that a duty arose from mandatory department rules, they would still have to overcome the immunity hurdle. We believe they cannot do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Firemen are immune from liability for injuries \u201ccaused in fighting fires.\u201d (\u00a7 850.4.) Real parties contend that the Legislature never intended immunity for wilful misconduct and point to section 850.8 which, while in the same chapter of the Tort Claims Act, provides immunity from liability with the proviso that \u201ca public employee is liable for injury proximately caused by his wilful misconduct in transporting the injured person or arranging for the transportation. \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The enactment of section 850.8 at the same time sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>tion 850.4 was enacted strongly suggests that the immunity of section 850.4 covers wilful misconduct as well as ordinary negligence. Where the Legislature intended the negligence and wilful misconduct to be treated differently, it so specified. (See also <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>City of Sunnyvale </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 666, 671 [133 Cal.Rptr. 306].)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The absolute immunity of section 850.4 absolves the city from liability for acts of itself or its employees while they are \u201cfighting fires.\u201d It does not apply if firemen are engaged in an activity other than firefighting and thus has been held not to apply where the department responds to life-threatening but nonfire related emergencies. <em>(Lewis </em>v. <em>Mendocino Fire Protection Dist. </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 345 [190 Cal.Rptr. 883].)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Getting to the fire quickly is of the very essence of firefighting. However, even if section 850.4 could be so narrowly construed as to apply to actions only after the firemen reached the fire, the immunity of section 850 would apply for then the acts of the firemen must be viewed as a failure \u201cto provide fire protection service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent court to set aside its order overruling in part petitioners\u2019 demurrer to the fifth amended complaint, to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend to all causes of action against petitioners in the fifth amended complaint, and to enter judgment in favor of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Poch\u00e9, Acting P.
