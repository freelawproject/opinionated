Timothy then met with three other minor friends, and they all commenced drinking the whiskey. At some point past midnight Timothy obtained the keys to one of his companions\u2019 automobiles. In an intoxicated condition, Timothy drove the vehicle through the plaintiffs\u2019 house and struck plaintiff Norene Rogers, causing the injuries for which plaintiffs seek damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Defendants contend that Business and Professions Code sections 25602,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 25602.1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Civil Code section 1714,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as enacted and amended by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>Legislature in 1978, establish a statutory scheme of total immunity for licensed alcoholic beverage dealers against plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Immediately prior to the 1978 amendments, California decisional law imposed tort liability for the furnishing of alcoholic beverages to intoxicated persons who, as a result of their intoxication, subsequently injured third parties. Such liability was created by three decisions of our Supreme Court: First, <em>Vesely </em>v. <em>Sager </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 153 [95 Cal.Rptr. 623, 486 P.2d 151], imposed liability on licensed vendors of alcoholic beverages who, in violation of former Business and Professions Code section 25602,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> furnished alcohol to intoxicated persons who then caused injury to third parties. Second, <em>Bernhard </em>v. <em>Harrah\u2019s Club </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 313 [128 Cal.Rptr. 215, 546 P.2d 719], extended the liability imposed by <em>Vesely </em>to Nevada gambling casinos catering to California residents who drove across the state line to patronize those establishments and subsequently caused accidents and injuries in California, holding them generally liable \u201cunder modern negligence law.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 325.) Third, <em>Coulter </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 144 [145 Cal.Rptr. 534, 577 P.2d 669], subjected social hosts to the liability imposed on commercial vendors in <em>Vesely </em>and <em>Bernhard. </em>Prior to <em>Vesely </em>no such liability existed, based on the concept that the voluntary consumption of alcohol, rather than its sale, was the proximate cause of the injury. <em>(Cole </em>v. <em>Rush </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 345 [289 P.2d 450, 54 A.L.R.2d 1137].)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">In 1978, the Legislature amended Business and Professions Code section 25602 by adding subdivision (b) and (c) (fn. 1, <em>ante) </em>and Civil Code section 1714 by adding subdivisions (b) and (c) (fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>and added section 25602.1 to the Business and Professions Code (fn. 2, <em>ante). </em>Defendants rely upon these amendments and the decision of our Supreme Court in <em>Cory </em>v. <em>Shierloh </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 430 [174 Cal.Rptr. 500, 629 P.2d 8] to support their position that plaintiffs have no cause of action against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The <em>Cory </em>court held that a minor who injured himself after becoming intoxicated at a party had no cause of action against the nonlicensed provider of alcoholic beverages. Characterizing the 1978 amendments as \u201ca patchwork of apparent inconsistencies and anomalies,\u201d some of which it de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>scribed, it nevertheless upheld them \u201cwith effort\u201d against a general constitutional attack. <em>(Cory </em>v. <em>Shierloh, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at pp. 437-441.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The <em>Cory </em>court agreed with the trial court\u2019s ruling that \u201c[b]y legislative mandate the <em>consumption </em>of alcoholic beverages is the proximate cause of injuries resulting from intoxication, <em>not the furnishing </em>of such beverages by itself . . . .\u201d <em>(Cory </em>v. <em>Shierloh, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 436, italics supplied.) Emphasizing that Business and Professions Code section 25602.1 refers to the sale by a <em>licensed </em>vendor to an <em>obviously intoxicated minor, </em>the Supreme Court described that statutory circumstance as \u201ca single exception to the foregoing sweeping immunity\u201d contained in the 1978 amendments. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 436.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Thereafter, in <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 570 [181 Cal.Rptr. 149], a divided Court of Appeal ruling on a factual situation virtually identical with the instant case imposed liability on a licensed vendor who sold alcohol to a sober minor, who then injured a third party. The <em>Burke </em>court held that neither <em>Cory </em>nor the 1978 amendments insulated a liquor dealer from such liability as a matter of law. Plaintiffs urge us to follow Burke's reasoning, but we respectfully decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">We agree with appellant and the <em>Cory </em>court that the amendments present some ambiguity. For instance, the <em>Vesely, Bernhard </em>and <em>Coulter </em>decisions all involved the sale or furnishing of alcohol to intoxicated adults. In its stated intent to abrogate those decisions and change the law in this area as it related to proximate cause, the Legislature did not include <em>Brockett </em>v. <em>Kitchen Boyd Motor Co. </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 87 [100 Cal.Rptr. 752], which imposed liability for furnishing alcohol to a minor. Thus, it can be argued, the Legislative intent was to leave the law in place as it related to minors. Further, Business and Professions Code section 25602.1 imposes liability on licensed vendors providing alcohol to obviously intoxicated minors \u201cwhere the furnishing, sale or giving of such beverage to the minor is the proximate cause of the personal injury or death sustained by such person.\u201d If Business and Professions Code section 25602, subdivision (c), and Civil Code section 1714, subdivision (b), establish that the consumption of alcohol and not the sale or furnishing thereof is the proximate cause of injuries to third persons, how can the sale or furnishing ever be the proximate cause under section 25602.1? Does the reference to \u201cminors\u201d refer literally to persons under the age of 18 as defined by section 25 of the Civil Code (see also Civ. Code, \u00a7 25.1) or does it refer to persons under the lawful drinking age of 21? (See Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 25658.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The primary rule of statutory construction is to determine legislative intent. <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 231 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>[110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].)  \u25a0 In this instance the Legislature has specifically declared its intent in Business and Professions Code section 25602, subdivision (c) (fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>and again in Civil Code section 1714, subdivision (b) (fn. 3, <em>ante). </em>In addition, the history of the 1978 amendments as they moved through the legislative process confirms our view that licensed vendors of alcoholic beverages have no liability under circumstances such as those at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">On April 28, 1977, Senate Bill No. 1175 was introduced by Senator For-an. It sought to amend Business and Professions Code section 25602 (fn. 4, <em>ante) </em>in the following manner: \u201cExisting statutory law provides that every person, as defined, who sells, furnishes, gives, or causes to be sold, furnished or given away, any alcoholic beverage to any obviously intoxicated person is guilty of a misdemeanor. Existing law also establishes a rebuttable presumption, under certain circumstances, re failure to exercise due care in case of violation of a statute. Case law has made violation of the above statutory provision the basis of civil liability for injuries caused to a third person by the intoxicated person. [1] This bill would provide that in the trial of any civil action, any party claiming that any person did not exercise due care, or claiming the benefit of the rebuttable presumption, by reason of violation of the statutory provision prohibiting the furnishing of alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person, shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that such person has violated such statutory provision, [f] The bill would provide that no person shall be liable in any civil action for violating the above statutory provision unless such person is served and return is made within 120 days after commencement of such action. [1] The bill would limit liability in any such civil action to $100,000 for death or injury of any 1 person, $250,000 for death or injury of any 2 persons, and $25,000 for property damage.\u201d (Leg. Counsel\u2019s Dig. of Sen. Bill No. 1175 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Thereafter the bill was amended June 15, 1977, January 9, 1978, January 19, 1978, August 14, 1978, August 23, 1978. The August 23 amended version provided, inter alia, that nonlicensees would have no liability for the sale or furnishing of alcoholic beverages, but maintained limited liability for licensed vendors. Senate Bill No. 1175 underwent one final revision in a conference committee on August 31, 1978. The final version, which was signed into law by the Governor, deleted all proposed amendments to Business and Professions Code section 25602, among which were provisions imposing liability on licensed vendors. It added, inter alia, section 25602.1 (fn. 2, <em>ante) </em>which, in turn, referred to section 25602 as amended by another bill, Senate Bill No. 1645.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">On May 2, 1978, Senator Ayala introduced Senate Bill No. 1645, dealing with the same subject matter. It also sought to amend Business and Profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>sions Code section 25602, as well as Civil Code section 1714. However, unlike Senate Bill No. 1175 which merely imposed certain restrictions and limitations upon recovery against licensed alcoholic beverage providers, Senate Bill No. 1645 sought to eliminate all such liability. It was amended once on May 17, 1978, to include reference to the <em>Coulter </em>decision in both statutes, to add subdivision (c) to Civil Code section 1714 in order to extend immunity to social hosts, to broaden the immunity under Business and Professions Code section 25602, subdivision (b), to actions by \u201cany injured person or the estate of such person\u201d instead of just \u201ca third person\u201d and, finally, to provide in subdivision (c) of section 25602, a legislative declaration of how the statute <em>shall </em>be interpreted in lieu of the originally proposed amendment expressing legislative intent. This version was enacted into law.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">A comparison of the provisions of Senate Bill No. 1175 as it read initially and prior to its amendment in conference committee, and as it read in its final version, and of the final version of Senate Bill No. 1645 reflects the Legislature\u2019s intent to eliminate liability for all providers of alcoholic beverages toward persons injured or killed by intoxicated consumers of those beverages, except in the case of licensed vendors who furnish alcohol to obviously intoxicated minors. Confirming this intent is a letter dated September 8, 1978, by the author of Senate Bill No. 1175 to the Governor which reads, in part: \u201cDear Governor Brown: [f] My Senate Bill 1175 has passed both Houses of the Legislature and is now on your desk for signature. [1] In the final days of the Session, when my Senate Bill 1175 and Senate Bill 1645 (Ayala) were on the Floor of the Assembly, we held discussions with representatives from your office. It was agreed upon in these meetings that Senate Bill 1645 would be signed into law and that those provisions which your office wanted contained in Senate Bill 1645 would be amended into my Senate Bill 1175. Therefore, <em>the provisions of limited liability to third parties injured as a result of being served intoxicating liquor by a licensee were stricken from my bill, and the provisions requested by your staff inserted. </em>[|] In effect this means that the Dram Shop Law, insofar as it pertains to liability to third parties, would be as set forth in Senate Bill 1645 with the amendatory provisions contained in my follow-up bill. It is, therefore, essential that you first sign Senate Bill 1645 before signing Senate Bill 1175. [|] <em>Containing the provisions requested by your office, Senate Bill 1175 would permit third party liability suits against liquor licensees who furnish alcoholic beverages to an obviously intoxicated minor if that minor causes personal injury or death as a result of his intoxication. </em>. . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Thus, it seems clear that the Legislature rejected the concept of preserving even limited liability for persons selling or furnishing alcoholic beverages, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>and imposed liability only on <em>licensed </em>vendors who sell or furnish to <em>obviously intoxicated minors. </em>To hold otherwise we would have to conclude the Legislature did not intend to differentiate between sobriety and \u201cobvious\u201d intoxication, a conclusion belied by the clear statutory language.  We must construe the clear words of the statute according to their ordinary and usual meaning. <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 698 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856]; <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 231.) In so doing we must give significance to each word and phrase and avoid any construction rendering any words or phrases surplusage. <em>{Moyer, supra, </em>at p. 230.)  By declaring that the <em>consumption </em>of alcohol and <em>not the sale or furnishing thereof </em>is the proximate cause of injury inflicted by intoxicated persons, except for sales by licensed vendors to obviously intoxicated minors, the Legislature has redefined these torts, which is within its prerogative. <em>(Cory </em>v. <em>Shierloh, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d at p. 439.)  The use of the modifying phrase \u201cobviously intoxicated\u201d preceding \u201cminor\u201d in Business and Professions Code section 25602.1 would be meaningless surplusage if the Legislature intended to hold licensed vendors liable for selling or furnishing alcohol to those minors who were sober.  We also conclude that the use of the term \u201cminor\u201d refers to persons under the age of 21.  The wording of the statute must be viewed \u201cin the context of the statutory framework as a whole.\u201d <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 230.)  The statutory framework encompassing the lawful age at which alcoholic beverages may be purchased or acquired is mandated by the California Constitution, which prohibits the sale or furnishing of such beverages to any one under the age of 21. (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22.) The Legislature recognized this when it changed the age of majority for most purposes from 21 to 18. \u201cExcept for the provisions relating to the minimum voting age, <em>the provisions relating to minimum age for the sale, purchase or consumption of alcoholic beverages, </em>the provisions relating to the sentencing and commitment of persons to the Department of the Youth Authority, or the provisions relating to veterans\u2019 benefits, whenever, in any provision of law, the term \u201821 years of age\u2019 or any similar phrase regarding such age appears, it shall be deemed to mean \u201818 years of age.\u2019\u201d (Stats. 1971, ch. 1748, \u00a7 1, italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We interpret the decision of our Supreme Court in <em>Cory </em>as requiring the result we reach herein. \u201c[T]he 1978 amendments extend to providers of alcoholic beverages a general immunity from suit, subject to the provisions of section 25602.1 of the Business and Professions Code, which preserves a cause of action by an injured person against a <em>licensed </em>seller or furnisher of alcoholic beverages to an obviously intoxicated <em>minor.\u201d (29 </em>Cal.3d at p. 439.)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>While we share the <em>Cory </em>court\u2019s concern about the nature and wisdom of the 1978 amendments, we also agree that those are decisions well within the province of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Low, P.
