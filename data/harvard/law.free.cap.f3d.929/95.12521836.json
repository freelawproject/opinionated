We also consider whether the petition (\"Subsequent Petition\") that Santarelli seeks to file in the District Court, which she annexed to the motion (\"Motion to File Subsequent Petition\") that she filed in this Court during the pendency of this appeal, constitutes a \"second or successive\" habeas petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2255(h). For the reasons that follow, we hold that the allegations contained in Santarelli's Motion to Amend \"relate back\" to the date of her initial habeas petition pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) and that her Subsequent Petition is not a \"second or successive\" habeas petition within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2255(h). We therefore will reverse the order of the District Court denying Santarelli's Motion to Amend; remand for the District Court to consider the merits of her initial habeas petition as amended by the allegations contained in the Motion to Amend; and, construing Santarelli's Motion to File Subsequent Petition as a motion to amend her initial habeas petition, transfer the Motion to File Subsequent Petition to the District Court to determine, in the first instance, whether Santarelli should be permitted to amend her initial habeas petition to incorporate the allegations contained in the Subsequent Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2011, a jury convicted Santarelli of multiple crimes in connection with a scheme that allegedly began in 2006, including (a) mail fraud, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1342 ; (b) wire fraud, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (c) conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court held a sentencing hearing in October 2013 and, applying the applicable sentencing range contained in the 2012 version of the United States Sentencing Commission's\n   <em>\n    Guidelines Manual\n   </em>\n   (\"Sentencing Guidelines\" or \"Guidelines\"), sentenced Santarelli to a seventy-month term of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release.

According to Santarelli, the PSR, which the District Court relied upon at sentencing, used the 2012 version of the Guidelines, which contained a broader definition of who may be considered a \"victim\" for purposes of determining eligibility for the number-of-victims enhancement, thereby resulting in her being eligible for the enhancement and receiving a higher Guidelines range than she would have received under the 2006 and 2007 versions of the Guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Santarelli seeks to clarify the\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   of her counsels' alleged ineffectiveness with respect to their failure to argue that the District Court erred finding that she was eligible for the number-of-victims enhancement. To her, that error stems from their failure to argue that the District Court should not have used the 2012 version of the Guidelines, which allegedly resulted in a violation of the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause of the United States Constitution because her Guidelines range would have been lower under the 2006 and 2007 versions of the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peugh v.

As outlined above, in her Motion to Amend, Santarelli simply seeks to restate her original claim-that her trial and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to argue that the District Court erred in determining that she was eligible for the number-of-victims enhancement-with greater particularity: namely, she would not have been eligible for the number-of-victims enhancement under the 2006 or 2007 versions of the Guidelines, which were in effect at the time of her alleged crimes, and her counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to argue that the District Court erred in applying the 2012 version of the Sentencing Guidelines, under which she\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   eligible for the enhancement, thereby resulting in a higher Guidelines range in violation of the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause.

Thus, we did not appoint counsel to represent Santarelli in any other capacity. We previously acknowledged that Santarelli was unrepresented for purposes of the Motion to File Subsequent Petition. In addition to consolidating case No. 16-4114 with the case in which Santarelli had filed the Motion to File Subsequent Petition-which was docketed at No. 18-1362-in our order, we appointed Santarelli's pro bono counsel to represent her in case No. 18-1362. In so doing, we implicitly recognized that Santarelli previously was not represented by counsel for purposes of her prior filing of the Motion to File Subsequent Petition in case No. 18-1362.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    In her Motion to Amend, Santarelli argued that \"more persons were allowed to be counted as 'victims' under the 2012 [G]uidelines than would have been allowable in 2006 [or] 2007.\" App. 105a. Indeed, the Sentencing Commission amended the Sentencing Guidelines in 2009 by, among other things, broadening the class of persons who could be considered \"victims\" in theft-offense cases in which the defendant unlawfully used the \"means of identification\" of the victim.\n    <em>\n     See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines\n    </em>\n    , U.S. Sentencing Comm'n 4 (May 1, 2009), https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/amendment-process/official-text-amendments/20090501_Amendments_0.pdf. In such cases, a person \"whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority\" is considered a \"victim\" of the crime,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    U.S.S.G.\u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n.4(E), whereas under prior versions of the Guidelines, only persons \"who sustained any part of the actual loss\" were considered \"victims\" of the crime,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335001\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/168/#p183\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    cmt. n.1. Thus, under the broader definition that was instituted by the 2009 amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, more persons qualify as \"victims\" for purposes of the number-of-victims enhancement under section 2B1.1(b)(2) of the Guidelines, which increases the offense level of a crime based on the number of victims involved.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    U.S.S.G.\u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2) (increasing the offense level by two, four, and six levels for offenses involving ten or more victims, fifty or more victims, and 250 or more victims, respectively).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Although neither a transcript of the sentencing hearing nor a copy of the PSR can be located on the District Court's docket or the Appendix in this case, Santarelli's objections to the PSR imply that the District Court indeed found that Santarelli was eligible for the number-of-victims enhancement under section 2B1.1(b)(2) of the 2012 version of the Guidelines. Further, Santarelli's crimes may have involved the unlawful use of one or more identifications of her victims, and, pursuant to the 2009 amendments to the Guidelines, they would qualify as \"victims\" for purposes of the number-of-victims enhancement. Therefore, it is at least possible that the District Court's application of the amended 2012 version of the Guidelines, rather than the 2006 or 2007 versions, may have affected Santarelli's eligibility for the number-of-victims enhancement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    As discussed below, however, depending on the outcome of a petitioner's exercise of her appellate remedies with respect to the denial of her initial habeas petition, a subsequent habeas petition could\n    <em>\n     later\n    </em>\n    be construed as a \"second or successive\" habeas petition regardless of our holding that such a petition is not \"second or successive\" at the time of filing during the pendency of an appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
