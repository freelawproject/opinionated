Those \"kickbacks,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the panel majority's view, are far more than normal corporate activity: Instead, Defendants are \"maintain[ing] ongoing relations with the farms so that defendants could continue receiving cocoa at a price that would not be obtainable without employing child slave labor.\"\n   <em>\n    Nestle II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518848\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/1120/#p1124\">\n    906 F.3d at 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This somehow pushes the needle over the line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   But the complaint itself, which never uses the word \"kickback,\" is devoid of any allegation that the provision of \"spending money\" was improper or illegal, and on the facts actually alleged, Plaintiffs could not plausibly make such an assertion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   allegations in the complaint show only that Defendants sought to stabilize their supply lines and minimize costs by entering into exclusive-dealing arrangements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We have recognized that such agreements \"provide 'well-recognized economic benefits.' \"\n   <em>\n    Aerotec Int'l, Inc. v.

Indeed, the complaint merely alleges that \"spending money\" is meant to \"maintain the farmers' and/or the cooperatives' loyalty as exclusive suppliers.\" Because the complaint lacks an allegation that Defendants provided anything to the farmers for an illegal purpose, the panel majority was flatly wrong to \"infer\" \"kickbacks\" from the facts alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The complaint here alleges clear, egregious, and terrible violations of Plaintiffs' basic human rights.

The panel majority's conclusion to the contrary is based on a reconstruction and/or rewriting of the allegations in the complaint in a way that essentially eliminates the presumption against extraterritoriality.

The effect of\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   in tandem with plaintiffs' habit of describing defendants en masse presents a challenge we address below.

Defendant Nestle, USA is headquartered in Virginia and coordinates the major operations of its parent corporation, Nestle, SA, selling Nestle-brand products in the United States. Every major operational decision regarding Nestle's United States market is made in or approved in the United States. Defendant Cargill, Inc. is headquartered in Minneapolis. The business is centralized in Minneapolis and decisions about buying and selling commodities are made at its Minneapolis headquarters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendants operate with the unilateral goal of finding the cheapest source of cocoa in the Ivory Coast. Not content to rely on market forces to keep costs low, defendants have taken steps to perpetuate a system built on child slavery to depress labor costs. To maintain their supply of cocoa, defendants have exclusive buyer/seller relationships with Ivory Coast farmers, and provide those farmers with financial support, such as advance payments and personal spending money. 19 Malian child slaves were rescued from a farm with whom Cargill has an exclusive buyer/seller relationship. Defendants also provide tools, equipment, and technical support to farmers, including training in farming techniques and farm maintenance. In connection with providing this training and support, defendants visit their supplier farms several times per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendants were well aware that child slave labor is a pervasive problem in the Ivory Coast. Nonetheless, defendants continued to provide financial support and technical farming aid, even though they knew their acts would assist farmers who were using forced child labor, and knew their assistance would facilitate child slavery. Indeed, the gravamen of the complaint is that defendants depended on-and orchestrated-a slave-based supply chain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The operative complaint names several foreign corporations as defendants, and plaintiffs concede those defendants must be dismissed on remand. The operative complaint also discusses defendants as if they are a single bloc-a problematic approach that plaintiffs would do well to avoid. In light of\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   , it is not possible on the current record to connect culpable conduct to defendants that may be sued under the ATS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Nestle I\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]t is common practice to allow plaintiffs to amend their pleadings to accommodate changes in the law, unless it is clear that amendment would be futile.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nestle I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201239\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/1013/\">\n    766 F.3d at 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). We are mindful that this case has lingered for over a decade, and that delay does not serve the interests of any party. But we cannot conclude that amendment would be futile, so we remand with instructions that plaintiffs be given an opportunity to amend their complaint. On remand, plaintiffs must remove those defendants who are no longer amenable to suit under the ATS, and specify which potentially liable party is responsible for what culpable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
