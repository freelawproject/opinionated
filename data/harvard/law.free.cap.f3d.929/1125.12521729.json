Browder arrived at the scene, where he encountered Fridoon Nehad walking at a steady pace in Browder's direction. The subsequent series of events, which is in dispute, culminated in Browder exiting his vehicle and, less than five seconds later, fatally shooting Nehad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellants brought Fourth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and state law claims against Browder, San Diego Chief of Police Shelley Zimmerman, and the City of San Diego. The district court granted summary judgment to Appellees on all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Reviewing the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, we affirm with respect to Appellants' Fourteenth Amendment claim, reverse with respect to all other claims, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly after midnight on April 30, 2015, Andrew Yoon encountered Fridoon Nehad outside the bookstore where Yoon worked. Nehad showed Yoon an unsheathed knife and said that he wanted to hurt people. Nehad was incoherent and \"didn't seem like he knew what was going on[,]\" so Yoon returned to work inside the store. A few minutes later, Nehad entered the store without a knife in hand, again said he wanted to harm people, then left the store via a side door into an adjoining alley. Yoon called 911 and told the emergency dispatcher that Nehad had threatened him with a knife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Around 12:06 a.m., the police dispatcher put out a \"Priority 1\" call for a \"417 (Threatening w[ith] weapon),\" and indicated that a male in a back lot was threatening people with a knife.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   San Diego Police Department Officer Neal Browder volunteered to respond to the call and drove to the scene in his police cruiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Surveillance camera footage shows that Nehad was walking down the alley behind the bookstore toward the street before Browder arrived. Browder turned his car from the street into the alley and turned on his car's high headlight beams. Browder did not activate his car's siren or police lights. Browder saw two people in a parking lot adjoining the alley and, soon after turning into the alley from the street, saw Nehad in the alley. Browder confirmed\n   with dispatch that Nehad matched the description of the person brandishing a knife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Once in the alley, Browder brought his vehicle to a halt and opened the driver's side door. Nehad continued to walk down the alley toward Browder and the street. Browder's vehicle advanced a short distance with the driver's door open before again coming to a stop. Nehad continued to walk toward Browder at a steady pace. Browder did not hear Nehad say anything, and did not see Nehad change his pace or make any sudden movements. Approximately twenty-eight seconds after pulling into the alley and eighteen seconds after opening his car door, Browder exited his vehicle. Browder did not activate his body camera.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Eyewitness accounts of what happened next differ. One witness, Andre Nelson, testified that Nehad was stumbling forward at a \"drunken pace\" in a nonagressive manner, \"like he wasn't all there,\" while \"fiddling with something in his midsection.\" Nelson could not recall Browder audibly identifying himself as a police officer, giving any type of warning, or saying anything at all. Nelson did recall Browder extending his left hand in a \"stop\" motion. No such motion is clearly visible on the surveillance video. Another witness, Albert Gallindo, testified that he heard Browder say, \"Stop, drop it\" two or three times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yoon, who was still on the phone with the emergency dispatcher when Browder arrived, recalled hearing Browder say \"Stop, drop it\" one time, no more than a \"couple seconds\" after Browder got out of the police car. Browder did not recall identifying himself or saying anything to Nehad. Video surveillance shows Nehad slowed down a few moments after Browder exited his vehicle, although it is unclear whether Browder perceived or could have perceived Nehad's change of pace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Less than five seconds after exiting his vehicle, Browder fired a single shot at Nehad, fatally striking him in the chest. Nehad was approximately seventeen feet away at the time Browder shot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A few hours later, after police investigators arrived at the scene, they asked Browder whether he saw any weapons and where in the alley they might be. Browder told the investigators that he had not seen any weapons. Browder's attorney would not allow investigators to ask Browder any more questions that night. The investigators did not find any weapons in the alley, and determined that Nehad had been carrying a metallic blue pen when Browder shot him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 5, five days after the shooting, Browder and his attorney met with homicide investigators at a police station. Police officials provided Browder and his attorney with surveillance video of the shooting, which Browder and his attorney reviewed in a police lieutenant's office for approximately twenty minutes before an interview commenced. During the interview, Browder stated that he first saw Nehad when Nehad was twenty-five to thirty feet from Browder's car and that Nehad was \"aggressing\" the car and \"walking at a fast pace ... right towards [the] car.\" Browder also stated, for the first time, that he had thought Nehad was carrying a knife, and that he had fired on Nehad because he thought Nehad was going to stab him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appellants, Nehad's parents and estate, filed suit against Browder, the City of San Diego, and San Diego Chief of Police Shelley\n   Zimmerman (collectively, \"Appellees\"). In the operative Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"), Appellants allege\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims for Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations and\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   and supervisory liability, two civil rights claims under state statutes, and common law claims for assault and battery, negligence, and wrongful death. Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on seven of the nine claims, excluding the SAC's common law claims for negligence and wrongful death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court granted Appellees' motion. The court granted summary judgment on Appellants' Fourth Amendment claim because, according to the district court, Browder's use of force was objectively reasonable. The court granted summary judgment on Nehad's parents' Fourteenth Amendment claim because there was no evidence that Browder acted with a purpose to harm unrelated to legitimate law enforcement objectives. The court further concluded that Browder was entitled to qualified immunity because there was no clear precedent establishing that Browder's use of deadly force would be considered excessive. The court also, in light of its determination that no constitutional violation had occurred, dismissed the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   and supervisory liability claims against all Appellees. Lastly, the court concluded that, because Browder's use of force was objectively reasonable, Appellees were entitled to summary judgment on \"all\" state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellants now appeal the district court's grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We review de novo a grant of summary judgment to determine whether \"a rational trier of fact might resolve the issue in favor of the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Blankenhorn v.

Browder stated that he thought Nehad had a knife, and two witnesses heard Browder say some variant of, \"Stop, drop it.\" Browder further testified that Nehad was \"aggressing\" Browder's vehicle, and that Browder thought Nehad was going to stab him. The question on summary judgment, however, is not whether some version of the facts supports Appellees' position, but rather whether a trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Appellants, could find in Appellants' favor.\n   <em>\n    Blankenhorn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077187\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/485/463/#p470\">\n    485 F.3d at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, approximately three hours after the shooting, Browder told homicide investigators that he did not see any weapons, and made no mention of feeling threatened by Nehad. Five days later, however, after consulting with his attorney and reviewing surveillance footage inside a police station, Browder claimed that he thought Nehad had a knife, that Nehad was \"aggressing\" the car, and that he thought Nehad was going to stab him. These possible inconsistencies, along with video, eyewitness, and expert evidence that belies Browder's claim that Nehad was \"aggressing,\" are sufficient to give rise to genuine doubts about Browder's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    The Reasonableness of Browder's Beliefs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Appellees, relying upon an out of context quotation from\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson v.

Under our logic in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , a particular use of force would be more reasonable, all other things being equal, when applied against a felony suspect than when applied against a person suspected of only a misdemeanor. Here, police dispatch records suggest that Browder was assigned a \"Priority 1\" call regarding a \"417 (Threatening w[ith] weapon)\" offense. Because brandishing a knife in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 417 is only a misdemeanor, a strict application of\n   <em>\n    Miller's\n   </em>\n   reasoning would provide little, if any, basis for a use of deadly force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Perhaps recognizing this (notwithstanding their citation to\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ), Appellees argue that the police dispatcher's decision to characterize Yoon's 911 call as a \"417\" misdemeanor should not be dispositive because Nehad's reported conduct \"posed a serious threat\" and could have been characterized as felonious. This argument reflects the second way in which we have sometimes applied the severity of the crime factor.

Indeed, nearly twenty years ago, we explained that it was sufficiently established that a police officer could not reasonably use a beanbag round on \"an unarmed man who: has committed no serious offense, ... has been given no warning of the imminent use of such a significant degree of force, poses no risk of flight, and presents no objectively reasonable threat to the safety of the officer or other individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    Deorle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1952912\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/272/1272/#p1283\">\n    272 F.3d at 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although Appellees attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Deorle\n   </em>\n   because the suspect there was suicidal and officers took several minutes to observe him before using less than lethal force, those facts, to the extent they are distinguishing, weigh against qualified immunity in this case. Here, there is no evidence that any eyewitness to the shooting considered Nehad to be a threat.

At a broad level, a triable issue remains regarding the reasonableness of Browder's use of deadly force.

These disputed factual questions also preclude a grant of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds, as it was well-established at the time of the shooting that the use of deadly force under the circumstances here, viewed in the light most favorable to Appellants, was objectively unreasonable. Appellants have also presented sufficient evidence of police department customs, practices, and supervisory conduct to support a finding of entity and supervisory liability. Furthermore, the district court never afforded Appellants an opportunity to be heard before granting summary judgment on the negligence and wrongful death claims sua sponte.

As Appellees' expert, Geoffrey T. Desmoulin, acknowledged, Browder had more time than average to react because, although the average time for an officer to remove his gun, aim, and shoot is 1.5 seconds, Browder had already unholstered his weapon, and took only 0.83 seconds to raise his weapon, aim, and fire. Furthermore, even if the \"rule\" were applicable, that fact would have to be balanced against Browder's potential role in creating the urgent circumstances that made the rule applicable.\n    <em>\n     Torres\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740791\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/1119/#p1124\">\n     648 F.3d at 1127\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    We applied this principle in\n    <em>\n     Harris\n    </em>\n    notwithstanding the fact that the suspect had fired upon, and possibly killed, a federal agent-a crime far more serious than Nehad's suspected offense.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Harris\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"943487\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/126/1189/#p1203\">\n     126 F.3d at 1193\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Although Appellees assert that Browder did not have time to give a warning, whether a warning was feasible here is also a triable issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    A suspect's refusal to comply with police commands despite warnings of serious or deadly consequences, could, of course, weigh in favor of the use of force, either as an \"other\" factor or as an indication of the threat posed by the suspect.
