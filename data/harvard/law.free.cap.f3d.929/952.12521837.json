Petruk was serving a term of supervised release for a prior conviction at the time he committed these offenses. After sentencing him to concurrent 372-month terms of imprisonment on each methamphetamine count, the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   revoked Petruk's supervised release and imposed a consecutive 30-month prison sentence. In these consolidated appeals, Petruk challenges the district court's\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   pretrial denial of his motion to suppress evidence and its posttrial revocation of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Over a two-week period in September 2016, law enforcement officers across two states obtained four warrants to search three vehicles associated with Petruk: a 1994 Chevrolet Camaro (Camaro), a 2001 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck (Silverado), and a 2005 Chrysler 300 (Chrysler). Three of the warrants permitted officers to install Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking devices on each of the vehicles. The fourth warrant allowed them to search the Chrysler. The affidavits supporting each warrant application contained largely the same information, but because Petruk challenges each warrant as unsupported by probable cause, we detail below the information contained in each of the affidavits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. O'Dell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200337\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/870/#p874\">\n    766 F.3d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 874 (8th Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (\"When the issuing judge relied solely upon the supporting affidavit to issue the search warrant, only that information which is found within the four corners of the affidavit may be considered in determining the existence of probable cause.\" (cleaned up)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 7, 2016, Investigator Scott Williams from the Lake Superior Drug and Violent Crime Task Force applied for a warrant to install the GPS tracker on the Camaro. His supporting affidavit detailed information that different officers had received from four separate confidential informants (CI) connecting Petruk and multiple vehicles to methamphetamine trafficking in the Duluth area. In July 2016, CI-1 informed an officer that Petruk was selling large quantities of methamphetamine and that Petruk primarily drove the Chrysler. The following month, CI-2 told another officer that Petruk was \"moving multiple pound quantities of methamphetamine and [was] supplying other known methamphetamine dealers in the [Duluth] area.\" CI-2 also said that Petruk drove the Chrysler. Also\n   in August, another law enforcement officer received a tip from CI-3 that Petruk had \"teamed up\" with other known methamphetamine dealers in the area, whom the CI named. In September, CI-3 told the same officer that Petruk \"was in possession of a very large quantity of meth and U.S. currency.\" On both occasions, CI-3 told the officer that Petruk drove multiple vehicles. Finally, CI-4 told Williams in August that Petruk was \"moving a lot of weight\" of methamphetamine and \"driving around in a black Chrysler 300 that 'sticks out,' \" and in September told Williams that Petruk was \"supplying the town with ... meth.\" Williams's affidavit stated that all four CIs said that Petruk's large-scale methamphetamine trafficking would \"require him to re-up his supply often.\" It also included the type of information each of the CIs had previously provided to law enforcement, which had led to the issuance of multiple search warrants, the seizure of contraband, and the arrest of numerous individuals on drug-related offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Williams's affidavit, officers had also independently corroborated some of the information provided by the CIs, in particular with respect to Petruk's vehicles. In late July 2016, Duluth police officers pulled over the Chrysler, and Petruk, who was riding in the passenger seat, claimed to own the car. In late August and early September 2016, officers saw Petruk driving the Camaro with the Silverado following closely behind, which led the officers to believe Petruk was conducting countersurveillance to avoid detection. On one of the occasions, the Silverado was driven by Gina Klobuchar. Officers knew Klobuchar was involved in the drug trade, and they had received a tip that she might be working with Petruk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Based on this information, Williams sought a warrant to place a GPS tracker on the Camaro. The application stated that officers wanted to be \"alerted when Petruk makes trips out of town to re-up his supply\" and to \"track his movements to other known drug dealers in the area.\" A Minnesota state court judge issued the warrant on September 7, 2016, and the GPS tracker was installed the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A few days later, on September 12, Wisconsin District Attorney Daniel Blank and Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Bork applied for a warrant to install a GPS tracker on the Silverado. An affidavit by Todd Maas, an investigator for the Superior, Wisconsin, police department, supported the warrant application. Maas's affidavit contained substantially the same information, almost verbatim, that was in Williams's affidavit for the Camaro GPS warrant. A Wisconsin state court judge issued the warrant that same day, and the tracker was installed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Also on September 12, Blank and Bork applied for a warrant to install a GPS tracker on the Chrysler. That application was also supported by an affidavit from Maas. This affidavit was not identical to Maas's affidavit for the Silverado GPS warrant. It did, however, contain the information from all four CIs that Petruk was involved in methamphetamine trafficking; the information from two CIs that Petruk drove the Chrysler as his primary vehicle; and the information about the officers' traffic stop when Petruk claimed to own the Chrysler. That day, a different Wisconsin state court judge issued the warrant, and the GPS tracker was installed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the night of September 19, once the GPS trackers were installed on all three vehicles, Cliff Sheppeck, an investigator with the Chisago County Sheriff's Office, applied by telephone for a warrant to search the Chrysler. Sheppeck's affidavit specifically stated that Petruk and an unidentified female were \"currently occup[ying]\" the car. The affidavit contained\n   substantially the same information that was in the applications for the GPS tracker warrants, including the fact that Petruk had claimed ownership of the Chrysler. But it also added new information that had not been included in any previous warrant applications. By then, a fifth CI had told officers that he had seen Petruk with two ounces of methamphetamine and that Petruk \"has methamphetamine on him at all times.\" Like the others, CI-5 had also previously provided reliable information to law enforcement. In addition, Sheppeck's affidavit stated that CI-3 told an officer that Petruk \"ma[de] trips to the [Twin Cities] twice a week to reup his supply of methamphetamine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sheppeck's affidavit also stated that GPS tracker warrants for the three vehicles had been issued, and it included information the officers had obtained from the Camaro and Silverado trackers, which corroborated the CI's statement that Petruk was frequently traveling to Minneapolis/St. Paul. In less than a week's time, the officers surveilled Petruk as he made two quick overnight trips from the Duluth area to the Twin Cities and back. The first time, Petruk drove the Camaro. The second time, Petruk drove the Silverado and was accompanied by Klobuchar, whose drug-related activities and criminal history were also included in the affidavit. On the trip in the Camaro, Petruk drove on low-traffic highways and backroads when returning to Duluth-a tactic Sheppeck stated was often used by drug traffickers in possession of large quantities of controlled substances to avoid detection and contact with police. And once Petruk was back in Duluth, officers tracked him visiting the homes of known methamphetamine users.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Chrysler search warrant application also contained information that Petruk, who had prior felony convictions, was armed and may pose a danger to law enforcement. CI-2 told an officer that Petruk stated he would not go back to prison and would \"shoot it out with the police.\" CI-3 told an officer that he had seen Petruk with at least one handgun in the last two weeks. CI-4 also told Williams that Petruk \"ha[d] weapons and will use them against police,\" and CI-5 said that he had seen Petruk with at least one handgun and that Petruk stated he would \"not plan to stop for police if the police attempt to stop him in a vehicle.\" On September 19, a fourth state court judge issued the warrant authorizing officers to search the Chrysler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   That same day, but before officers obtained the warrant, Petruk and a companion drove the Chrysler south to Minneapolis-Petruk's third trip there in eleven days. In Minneapolis, Petruk stopped at some of the same locations he had visited on his two prior trips. None of the tracking information for the Chrysler was included in the application to search that car. Petruk traveled back north to Duluth the next day, stopping at a salvage yard in North Branch, Minnesota. When Petruk got out of the car, officers detained him and drove the Chrysler to the North Branch Police Department to be searched pursuant to the warrant. In the back of the engine compartment, officers found approximately 1.75 pounds of methamphetamine inside a black shopping bag. Officers also found drug paraphernalia, receipts, and a notebook. They also seized Petruk's phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Petruk moved to suppress the seized evidence on the grounds that none of the four warrants were supported by probable cause. Following a suppression hearing, the magistrate judge disagreed and recommended the denial of the motion to suppress. The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation. At trial, the government introduced GPS tracking information obtained\n   pursuant to the warrants and various exhibits related to the seized methamphetamine. The jury convicted Petruk on both counts. Immediately after sentencing on the methamphetamine convictions, the district court revoked Petruk's supervised release and sentenced him to a consecutive 30-month term of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We first address Petruk's motion to suppress, followed by his challenge to the supervised release revocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal from the denial of a motion to suppress, we review a district court's findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, in pretrial proceedings, Petruk unequivocally contested the admissibility of the evidence seized as a result of the issuance and execution of multiple search warrants. By stating \"no objection\" at trial to the admission of the relevant evidence, Petruk likely waived the ability to raise on appeal any evidentiary challenges to the disputed evidence. But on this record we find no conscious and intentional waiver of his constitutional challenges, and thus turn to the merits of his claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Fourth Amendment protects persons against unreasonable searches.

In this case, four confidential informants provided information indicating that Petruk had teamed up with other known drug dealers to sell large quantities of methamphetamine in the Duluth area and was using multiple vehicles to travel regularly to Minneapolis/St. Paul to resupply. It is well-established that \"[t]he statements of a reliable confidential informant are themselves sufficient to support probable cause for a search warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The key inquiry is whether the confidential informant's information is, in fact, reliable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As we have repeatedly recognized, \"[w]hen an informant has provided reliable information in the past\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   where his tip was independently corroborated, a court may deem the informant's tip sufficiently reliable to support a probable cause determination.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The supporting affidavits established that all four CIs had a record of providing reliable information to law enforcement. Each of the CIs had provided information that led to the arrest of multiple individuals who were selling controlled substances, and also to the issuance of one or more search warrants that resulted in the seizure of controlled substances. Two of the CIs had also conducted one or more controlled purchases of illegal drugs. Moreover, the information provided by the CIs in Petruk's case was corroborated not only by the other CIs, but by law enforcement officers as well.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We disagree. Sheppeck's affidavit contained sufficient information from which an issuing judge could conclude that there was a reasonable probability that evidence of drug-trafficking-not just actual drugs-would be found in the Chrysler, Petruk's primary vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caswell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"939878\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/436/894/#p898\">\n    436 F.3d at 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that issuing judges are \"entitled to draw reasonable inferences about where evidence is likely to be kept, based on the nature of the evidence and the type of offense\" (cleaned up)). As detailed in Sheppeck's affidavit, a fifth CI had come forward stating that Petruk carried methamphetamine with him at all times and that he had personally seen Petruk with at least two ounces of the drug. By then, CI-3 had also told law enforcement that Petruk drove his vehicles to the Twin Cities twice a week to resupply. Moreover, the officers had\n   <em>\n    observed\n   </em>\n   Petruk make two quick turnaround trips to the Twin Cities in a week's time using vehicles linked to the trafficking. When Petruk returned from one of those trips, he was tracked visiting the homes of known drug users. And, at the time Sheppeck applied for the warrant, Petruk was \"occupying\" the Chrysler. Collectively, this information provided a sufficient nexus between drug-trafficking evidence and the Chrysler.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The district court properly denied Petruk's motion to suppress all evidence derived from the execution of the warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Petruk's sole challenge to the revocation of his supervised release is that it was premised on his methamphetamine convictions in this case, which he contends should be reversed in light of his suppression arguments. But because we conclude that the district court properly denied Petruk's motion to suppress, there is no basis for disturbing his convictions or his revocation of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For all the aforementioned reasons, we affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The Honorable Ann D.
