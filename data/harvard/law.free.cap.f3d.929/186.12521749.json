The district court denied Courtade's motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2014, investigators with the Chesapeake Police Department received a complaint from Courtade's wife alleging that she had discovered Courtade in the\n   bedroom of Jane Doe, his 14-year-old stepdaughter, kneeling by the bed with his hands underneath the sheets while she was asleep. When the police arrived at the residence, an officer found Courtade inside his car breaking a CD. The officer asked Courtade what was on the CD, and he responded that there was \"a video of Jane Doe, naked and in the shower.\" A member of the U.S. Navy who had served as a combat photographer, Courtade said that he had instructed Jane Doe to take the camera-a GoPro video camera belonging to the Navy-into the shower with her \"to see if the camera was waterproof.\" With Courtade's consent, the police then seized computers and other equipment from the residence. On a laptop was a 24-minute video of Jane Doe showering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to a Statement of Facts that Courtade signed, the video begins with Courtade turning on the camera and placing it on the bathroom counter facing the shower. Courtade speaks with Jane Doe and then leaves, at which point Jane Doe \"undresses completely, gets in the shower, closes the shower curtain, and turns on the shower.\" Jane Doe then calls for Courtade, who reenters the bathroom and hands her the camera over the shower rod. Jane Doe holds the camera under the water before returning it to Courtade, who reviews the camera and hands it back to Jane Doe with instructions to put it on the shower floor. Jane Doe complies and then gives the camera back to Courtade. Courtade again places the camera on the bathroom counter facing the shower and leaves the bathroom. Jane Doe \"peeks out at the camera a few times,\" and then exits \"at the far end of the shower, drops to the floor, and crawls out of the view of the camera below the countertop.\" She reappears at the other side of the camera's frame, \"dries off, gets dressed,\" and leaves the bathroom. During the video, Jane Doe's \"breasts and genitals are visible at various points.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2015, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Courtade, and a superseding indictment followed. Count One charged Courtade with production of child pornography in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and Count Two charged him with possession of child pornography in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B). In July 2015, the government offered Courtade a plea deal on Count Two, which carried no mandatory minimum and a 10-year statutory maximum. Count One had a 15-year mandatory minimum and a 30-year statutory maximum. As the government explained, it was offering this plea deal to prevent Jane Doe from having to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August 2015, Courtade's counsel filed a series of pretrial motions, including a motion to dismiss the indictment. Counsel argued principally that the video of Jane Doe showering did not depict a minor engaging in \"sexually explicit conduct\" within the meaning of the statute. As relevant here, that term is defined as the \"lascivious exhibition of the anus, genitals, or pubic area of any person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202256\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A)(v). Counsel reasoned that the statutory definition is not met because \"[t]he alleged victim in this video is simply showering\"-she is \"never involved in any provocative or sexually-themed poses or actions,\" and although her pubic area is visible at times, the video \"is filmed in its entirety in a fixed-zoom manner that is never adjusted to aim for a specific portion or private region of [her] body.\" In sum, the video \"merely depicts nudity, and not sexually explicit conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Despite moving to dismiss the indictment, Courtade's counsel eventually took a different position on the case's merits after doing more research and talking with the government's lawyers. Specifically, counsel testified that the government pointed him to cases outside the Fourth Circuit that\n   evaluated the \"mindset of the defendant\" in making the video in addition to assessing the content of the video itself-case law that \"caused [him] some greater concern as to the validity of the motion that [he] had filed,\" especially because the Fourth Circuit had no precedent on the meaning of \"lascivious exhibition.\" And if the motion to dismiss and the other pretrial motions were denied, counsel testified, potentially \"a lot of damaging evidence [ ] was going to come into trial in this case.\" For these reasons, counsel concluded that the motion to dismiss \"was essentially a no go\" and \"felt that the plea was the best option\" for Courtade. Counsel explained this reasoning to Courtade, advised him that the Jane Doe video met the definition of \"sexually explicit conduct,\" and told him that he was guilty of the charged offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Courtade pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography, and a magistrate judge accepted the plea agreement at a hearing held on August 25, 2015. As part of the agreement, Courtade \"waive[d] the right to appeal the conviction and any sentence within the statutory maximum ... (or the manner in which that sentence was determined) on the grounds set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203742\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   or on any ground whatsoever.\" Courtade also stipulated to the Statement of Facts describing the circumstances of his arrest and the contents of the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In December 2015, the district court held a sentencing hearing. The court noted that Courtade's Sentencing Guidelines range was 210-262 months, a range that exceeded the 10-year statutory maximum for the possession charge to which he pleaded guilty. The court then sentenced Courtade to the 10-year term, along with lifetime supervised release, and dismissed the production charge. No direct appeal was taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 22, 2016, Courtade, with new counsel, filed a motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging the following grounds for relief. First, he claimed that he pleaded guilty to conduct that is not criminal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B) because the video does not show a minor engaging in \"sexually explicit conduct\" as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202256\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). Second, Courtade argued that his guilty plea was not voluntary and intelligent because he did not understand that the conduct to which he pleaded guilty was not criminal. Third, he alleged that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(3) by failing to determine a proper factual basis for his guilty plea. And fourth, Courtade contended that counsel provided ineffective assistance, including by failing to consult with him about an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Attached to the \u00a7 2255 motion were several exhibits. As relevant here, Courtade attached as an exhibit a transcript of the audio from the Jane Doe video. That transcript reveals two more facts important to our analysis. First, at the beginning of the video, Courtade lies to Jane Doe and tells her that the camera \"is off\" and \"can't record you.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Courtade v. United States\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-736,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206397105\">\n    2017 WL 6397105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D. Va. Dec. 13, 2017). Second, Courtade induces Jane Doe to film herself by promising her ice cream as a reward after her shower.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 13, 2017, the district court issued an order denying the \u00a7 2255 motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *15. The court rejected Courtade's\n   first three grounds for relief as procedurally defaulted because he failed to file a direct appeal and could not satisfy the actual innocence exception to procedural default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-10. The court held in particular that Courtade was not actually innocent because the video of Jane Doe does in fact depict \"sexually explicit conduct\" in portraying a \"lascivious exhibition of the anus, genitals, or pubic area.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202256\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A)(v). Turning to the ineffective assistance ground for relief, the court rejected this claim as well, holding that counsel was not ineffective for failing to consult with Courtade about filing an appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Courtade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206397105\">\n    2017 WL 6397105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11-14. The court thus denied the motion in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Courtade timely appealed. In November 2018, this Court granted a certificate of appealability on (1) whether Courtade was actually innocent of possession of child pornography and (2) whether counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to consult with Courtade about nonfrivolous grounds for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, Courtade first contends that he is actually innocent of possession of child pornography because the video of Jane Doe showering does not depict a minor engaging in \"sexually explicit conduct\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B). And because he is actually innocent, Courtade argues, his procedural default should be excused and his guilty plea deemed invalid and vacated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bousley v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504035\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/614/#p622\">\n    523 U.S. 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 622,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504035\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/614/#p622\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504035\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/614/#p622\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) (holding that a defendant may raise a procedurally defaulted claim if he can demonstrate actual innocence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before taking up Courtade's actual innocence claim, we address briefly arguments from the government about why Courtade should not be permitted to make such a claim in the first place. None of these arguments has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The government first argues that Courtade cannot bring an actual innocence claim under\n   <em>\n    Bousley\n   </em>\n   because his claim depends on the construction of a statute and he has failed to identify any \"new, binding precedent [that] has changed the law applicable to the statute of conviction,\" a requirement for such a claim. As even the government recognizes, however, this Court has previously entertained actual innocence claims on the merits where the claims turned on issues of statutory construction and there was no intervening change in the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fugit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3649404\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/248/#p253\">\n    703 F.3d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 253-54 (4th Cir. 2012) (addressing merits of actual innocence claim where petitioner argued that the district court erred in construing the statute of conviction to encompass the conduct admitted in the guilty plea);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Burleson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148064\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/170/#p176\">\n    815 F.3d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176 (4th Cir. 2016) (finding petitioner actually innocent where he pleaded guilty to a felon-in-possession charge in 2013 but we determined-based on our reading of the relevant statute and a 1992 decision from this Court-that his prior convictions failed to qualify as predicates necessary to sustain the conviction). We thus reject the government's argument in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The government also contends that Courtade cannot pursue his actual innocence claim because his guilty plea itself\n   bars such a claim and so does the appellate waiver in the plea agreement. Our case law again indicates otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fugit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3649404\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/248/#p253\">\n    703 F.3d at 253-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (addressing actual innocence claim on the merits despite a guilty plea and no intervening change in the law);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143825\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/178/#p182\">\n    814 F.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182 (4th Cir. 2016) (stating that \"[w]e will refuse to enforce an otherwise valid [appeal] waiver if to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice\" and explaining that a cognizable claim of actual innocence meets this standard and compels the conclusion that the \u00a7 2255 motion falls outside the waiver's scope). The government thus cannot successfully argue that the guilty plea or appeal waiver bars Courtade's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We turn now to the merits of the \u00a7 2255 motion. To establish that he is actually innocent of possession of child pornography, Courtade \"must demonstrate that, in light of all the evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\"\n   <em>\n    Bousley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504035\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/614/#p622\">\n    523 U.S. at 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504035\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/614/#p622\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Schlup v.
