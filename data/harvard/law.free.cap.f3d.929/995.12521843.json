We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On August 5, 2016, a truck operated by Rex, LLC struck a vehicle driven by Ronald Gean, injuring him and killing his passenger Jean Carol Gean. Rex and its driver were covered by a business auto insurance policy issued by Acuity with a stated liability limit of $1 million for \"each accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 30, 2016, Acuity filed a two-count complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against the Geans and several other parties affected by the accident. Count I sought to distribute the $1 million policy proceeds among potential claimants using federal statutory interpleader.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201335\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Count II sought a declaratory judgment that the applicable policy limit was in fact $1 million per accident. Acuity also moved to deposit the stated policy limit of $1 million into the registry of the court as required by \u00a7 1335(a), the district court granted the motion, and Acuity submitted the funds to the court's registry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Meanwhile, on January 4, 2017, the Geans brought suit in Illinois state court for personal injury, wrongful death, and a declaratory judgment that Acuity's $1 million policy limit \"stacked\" for each of the twenty-one vehicles covered by the policy, providing total coverage of $21 million. The Geans also filed a motion in federal court to dismiss Acuity's federal action, arguing that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction under the federal interpleader statute unless Acuity deposited the disputed $21 million, rather than the $1 million in the court's registry. The Geans also alleged that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over them and that venue was improper in the Eastern District of Missouri.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court held the motion to dismiss in abeyance. Agreeing with the Geans that \u00a7 1335(a) requires an interpleader plaintiff to deposit the full disputed sum, it \"granted [Acuity] leave to post the appropriate amount of $21 million or dismiss Count I\" and warned that \"[f]ailure to post the appropriate amount or dismiss Count I may result in the Court dismissing Count I for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\" In response, Acuity filed an amended complaint dismissing its interpleader claim and adding an additional claim for declaratory judgment under Missouri state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court next concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the Geans because they did not have sufficient minimum contacts with Missouri, dismissed them from the lawsuit, and ordered Acuity to show cause why the lawsuit could proceed\n   in their absence. Acuity conceded that the Geans were necessary and indispensable parties, and the district court dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. Acuity appealed and challenges the district court's orders concerning subject-matter and personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We must first address whether Acuity waived appellate review of the district court's order concerning subject-matter jurisdiction by amending its complaint to dismiss its interpleader claim in response to the district court's threat to dismiss if Acuity did not deposit $21 million. Generally, \"an amended complaint supercedes an original complaint and renders the original complaint without legal effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Tolen v.

Thus, a plaintiff who amends his complaint and dismisses certain claims waives his right to appeal them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9215664\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/377/879/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But we have refused to find waiver where the court's involuntary dismissal of the original counts \"struck a vital blow to a substantial part of plaintiff's cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Williamson v.

The Geans nonetheless argue that\n   <em>\n    Tolen\n   </em>\n   controls and that Acuity's dismissal of its interpleader claim was not truly involuntary because the court gave Acuity a choice other than dismissal, namely depositing $21 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We conclude that Acuity did not waive its right to appeal the district court's ruling concerning the deposit requirement. In giving Acuity the option of depositing the full $21 million or dismissing its interpleader claim, the district court rejected Acuity's interpretation of the requirements of \u00a7 1335.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather than continuing to advance an argument that the district court had rejected, Acuity proceeded with the remainder of its case. As the Seventh Circuit has pointed out, \"It is not waiver-it is prudence and economy-for parties not to reassert a position that the trial judge has rejected.\"\n   <em>\n    Bastian v. Petren Res. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525692\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/892/680/#p683\">\n    892 F.2d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 683 (7th Cir. 1990). These factors support the conclusion that Acuity did not waive its arguments concerning the deposit required under \u00a7 1335. As we have indicated in the removal context, a motion to amend is involuntary where the plaintiff \"faced the Hobson's choice of amending his complaint or\n   <em>\n    risking\n   </em>\n   dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Atlas Van Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454897\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/209/1064/#p1067\">\n    209 F.3d at 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted and emphasis added). While Acuity could have avoided such a choice by depositing $21 million, the requirement to deposit such a large sum still confronted the company with \"a patently coercive predicament.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454897\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/209/1064/#p1067\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To be sure, Acuity could have stood on its original complaint and forced the district court to dismiss its interpleader claim. But, as the concurring opinion acknowledges, Acuity \"would have arrived at the same place on appeal\" had it done so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   , at 1004.

But Acuity points to a Third Circuit case and suggests that the district court should first peek ahead to the merits of its declaratory judgment claim contesting the Geans' stacking argument before setting the deposit requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Fire Ins.

In an opinion by then-Judge Samuel Alito, the court explained that the deposit requirement \"is not a mechanical process under which the court uncritically searches for the highest amount claimed by the adverse claimants,\" and it held that \"[a]mounts that are not realistically within the scope of the interpleader as pleaded are not required to be deposited or bonded to sustain federal jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11544588\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/182/201/#p210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Acuity therefore argues that it needed to deposit only the $1 million it believes it owes, not the $21 million claimed by the Geans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We agree with the district court that subject-matter jurisdiction is lacking because Acuity did not deposit the disputed amount into the court's registry. First, we previously held that a \"stakeholder may not compel a party to litigate his claim in interpleader unless he deposits with the court an amount equal to the sum claimed\n   <em>\n    by that party\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Gaines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1039813\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/539/1136/#p1141\">\n    539 F.2d at 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). \"It is a cardinal rule in our circuit that one panel is bound by the decision of a prior panel.\"\n   <em>\n    Mader v.

The Third\n   Circuit stated that the \"stakeholder invoking interpleader must deposit the largest amount for which it may be liable in view of the subject matter of the controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Asbestospray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11544588\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/182/201/#p210\">\n    182 F.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because only a limited sum remained in unexhausted policy proceeds, the claimants in\n   <em>\n    Asbestospray\n   </em>\n   could have recovered a greater amount only had there been a claim of collusion or fraud regarding the previous insurance settlements that had depleted the policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11544588\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/182/201/#p210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11544588\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/182/201/#p210\">\n    at 210-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, a greater sum was \"not realistically part of the interpleader action\n   <em>\n    as it was pleaded\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11544588\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/182/201/#p210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11544588\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/182/201/#p210\">\n    at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). But here, by pairing its interpleader claim with one for declaratory judgment, Acuity itself admitted that $21 million was in controversy and that Acuity would be liable for more than the $1 million it deposited if the district court concluded that coverage stacked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Third, considerations of fairness also support the conclusion that Acuity must deposit the full disputed amount. If the district court peeked ahead to the merits and decided that coverage stacked, Acuity's $1 million deposit would not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1335(a) and the court would lack subject-matter jurisdiction over both the interpleader and declaratory judgment counts. Acuity could then presumably get a second bite at the apple on its declaratory judgment claim in another proceeding notwithstanding the district court's initial ruling. Moreover, the personal jurisdiction requirements are relaxed for interpleader actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202361\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (allowing nationwide service of process).

Although Congress intended that federal statutory interpleader \"broadly ... remedy the problems posed by multiple claimants to a single fund,\" interpleader does not provide \"an all-purpose 'bill of peace' \" for \"multiparty litigation arising out of a mass tort.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.

Because Congress has set aside many of the traditional limitations on interpleader, we are reluctant to disregard remaining limitations under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In sum, our precedent and other considerations dictate that Acuity deposit the amount claimed by the Geans,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1039813\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/539/1136/#p1141\">\n    539 F.2d at 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or at the very least \"the largest amount for which it may be liable in view of the subject matter of the controversy,\"\n   <em>\n    Asbestospray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11544588\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/182/201/#p210\">\n    182 F.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
