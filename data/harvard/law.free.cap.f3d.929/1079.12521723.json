Relying on this exemption, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) withheld information from a FOIA response pertaining to a biological research laboratory (\"biolab\") located at the University of Hawai'i. Much of the withheld information was already publicly available. The primary question before us is whether the CDC properly refused to disclose the requested information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The University of Hawai'i at Manoa (UH) maintains a biolab that is \"the only facility of its kind for researchers in the entire State.\" UH publicizes the biolab's location at \"the Biosciences Building\" on \"the Kaka'ako campus, near downtown Honolulu.\"\n   <em>\n    Facilities\n   </em>\n   , Dep't Tropical Med., Med. Microbiology &amp; Pharmacology, http://manoa.hawaii.edu/tropicalmedicine/?page_id=925 (last updated June 20, 2014). According to the UH website, researchers at the UH biolab study a number of highly\n   dangerous biotoxins, including botulinum neurotoxins, the Ebola virus, Tetrodotoxin,\n   <em>\n    Brucella abortus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brucella melitensis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brucella suis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Burkholderia pseudomallei\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Burkholderia pseudomallei\n   </em>\n   , the Nipah virus,\n   <em>\n    Ralstonia solanacearum\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Xanthomonas oryzae\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   News reports in 2014 revealed that the CDC had uncovered \"widespread regulatory noncompliance\" at the UH biolab, relating to UH's failure to meet certain standards for biotoxin safety and security. In response to these reports, Civil Beat Law Center, a government watchdog group in Hawai'i, filed a FOIA request with the CDC seeking two documents: (1) a May 2014 CDC inspection report detailing the regulatory violations found at the UH biolab; and (2) a May 2014 letter from the CDC demanding that UH \"show cause\" for why the UH biolab's registration to possess, use, and transfer biological agents and toxins should not be suspended or revoked. The CDC denied both requests, maintaining that the records sought were \"specifically exempted from disclosure by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262a(h)(1)(C) and (E).\" Civil Beat requested reconsideration, which the CDC also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Seeking to compel disclosure of the two disputed documents, Civil Beat filed suit under FOIA. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, with the CDC continuing to assert that no disclosure at all of the requested documents was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A few weeks later, the CDC changed positions. In response to Civil Beat's motion for summary judgment, the CDC included redacted versions of the requested records. The redactions in the newly disclosed documents fell into three categories:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The first two categories of redactions were based on exemptions found in BPRA. First, the CDC redacted information concerning the specific regulatory violations found at UH, asserting that \"public disclosure of the redacted information ... would endanger public health or safety because it could assist unauthorized individuals to obtain illegal access to listed agents.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262a(h)(1)(E) (\"No Federal agency ... shall disclose ... [a]ny portion of an evaluation or report of an inspection ... that identifies the listed agent or toxin possessed by a specific registered person or that discloses the identity or location of a specific registered person if the agency determines that public disclosure of the information would endanger public health or safety.\"). Second, the CDC redacted all references to UH, its employees, and the laboratory, because revealing any of that information \"would inform individuals with nefarious intentions of site-specific weaknesses in the safeguards and/or security measures employed by the particular registered entity at a particular location.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262a(h)(1)(C) (\"No Federal agency ... shall disclose ... [a]ny portion of a record that discloses the site-specific or transfer-specific safeguard and security measures used by a registered person to prevent unauthorized access to listed agents and toxins.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Third, the CDC redacted \"[t]he names and telephone numbers of individual [Division of Select Agents and Toxins] staff members\" who conducted the UH inspection, based on \"the sensitive nature of the select agent information that these staff members possess and process.\" These redactions were based on FOIA Exemption 6, covering \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Unsatisfied, Civil Beat opposed all three categories of redactions. It also argued, in the alternative, that if the district court determined that the BPRA exemptions were possibly applicable, the district court should conduct\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the\n   unredacted documents to determine whether the redactions were in fact proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court granted the CDC's summary judgment motion in nearly all respects.\n   <em>\n    Civil Beat Law Ctr. for the Pub.

It may not respond with boilerplate or conclusory statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Shannahan\n   </em>\n   , 672 F.3d at 1148. Here, the CDC offered only cursory statements explaining how public health and safety would be endangered by FOIA disclosure. These \"boilerplate\" and \"conclusory\" statements did not establish that the CDC conducted an adequate case-by-case inquiry in reaching its public endangerment determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For example, in a letter responding to Civil Beat's FOIA request, the CDC wrote, \"While it is clear that you already know the specific site and the registered person related to your request, release of further details would hinder the prevention of unauthorized access to listed agents and toxins.\" No explanation of this conclusion was provided, and the redactions appear to include the information already known. Likewise,\n   in an affidavit filed with the district court, the CDC provided a one-sentence statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The fact that Plaintiff may know the identity and/or location of the registered person does not render as non-exempt the redacted information protected by FOIA Exemption 3 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262a(h)(1)(C) and/or (E) ; nor does it excuse the CDC from its duty not to disclose information protected by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262a(h)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   That's it. Nothing further was said to explain why the CDC redacted the already-known identity and location information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The most detailed explanation the CDC offered is another affidavit, which asserts that \"the release of specific locations (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , rooms in a building) where [agents and toxins are] stored or worked with ... will increase the risk of unauthorized access to [agents and toxins] by increasing the chances that [agents and toxins] will be found when otherwise lost-in-the-crowd of the larger campus of the entity.\" This explanation may have been plausible, were more explanation provided, as to redaction of \"specific locations (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , rooms in a building).\" But, again, the CDC redacted\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   references to identity or location, even though the identity (the University of Hawai'i at Manoa) and general location (the on-campus biolab) are both publicly known. Nothing was said to explain how those broad redactions protected public health and safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In sum, the CDC was not entitled to rely on the official-acknowledgment doctrine, and on the current record, it did not otherwise justify its complete withholding of identity and location information. The district court therefore erred in granting summary judgment to the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    (d)\n   </strong>\n   Civil Beat cross-moved for summary judgment in its favor and has appealed the denial of its motion. \"[S]ummary judgment in favor of the FOIA plaintiff is appropriate\" only \"[w]hen an agency seeks to protect material which, even on the agency's version of the facts, falls outside the proffered exemption.\"\n   <em>\n    Petroleum Info.

With specific knowledge that particular CDC employees were involved in the UH biolab inspection, a nefarious person interested in the specific toxins handled at the UH biolab could choose to focus on those CDC employees-who would have knowledge of the layout and security measures at that lab-for harassment or threats. This additional location-specific risk is sufficient-albeit barely, in light of the public availability of the names of CDC employees in the Division of Select Agents and Toxins-to meet the low, \"nontrivial\" privacy interest threshold.

But the public endangerment concern regarding disclosure of identity and location of individuals working with toxins presumably is that knowing where the toxins are and who is working with them could make it easier to find, take, and use the toxins for nefarious purposes.
