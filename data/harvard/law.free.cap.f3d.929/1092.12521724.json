SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Shortly after park rangers discovered him dangling from the branches of a tree in Yosemite National Park, Austin Carey was charged with two misdemeanor offenses stemming from an unlawful BASE jump. Following a one-day bench trial, a magistrate judge found Carey guilty on both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Carey now appeals his conviction, contending that the government failed to prove each element of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.17\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the magistrate judge was required to recuse himself after being exposed to a potentially prejudicial news article. We conclude that \u00a7 2.17(a)(3) 's permit exception is an affirmative defense for which Carey, not the government, bore the burden of proof, and that the magistrate judge's reference to the article, though perhaps imprudent, did not mandate recusal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20455\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). We therefore affirm Carey's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the morning of September 6, 2016, law enforcement rangers in Yosemite National Park responded to a report of a person in a parachute hitting a tree. The rangers arrived on scene to discover Carey suspended in the tree's branches an estimated 130 to 150 feet above the ground. With him, the rangers found a harness, wingsuit,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and parachute-equipment commonly associated with BASE jumping.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After some maneuvering and the employment of rigging ropes, professional tree-climbing loggers helped Carey descend to the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Once safely returned to the earth's surface, Carey was promptly arrested and charged with violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.17\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) (delivering a person or object by parachute, helicopter, or other airborne means) and 2.34(a)(4) (disorderly conduct by creating a hazardous condition).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The case proceeded to a bench trial before a magistrate judge on August 9, 2017. Although a pretrial brief filed by the government indicated that, in order to prove a violation of \u00a7 2.17(a)(3), it had to \"establish[ ] beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the defendant's act was \"[n]ot pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit,\" the government concedes that \"[a]t trial, [it] did not offer direct evidence in its case-in-chief that Carey lacked a permit to BASE jump.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the bench trial, Carey moved for acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, arguing that the government failed to establish all elements of \u00a7 2.17(a)(3) because it did not prove that he lacked a permit. The magistrate judge initially denied the motion, but then withdrew the denial and indicated that he would address the motion in his written decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The magistrate judge issued his order and judgment on September 25, 2017, finding Carey guilty on both counts. The order included a discussion of the proper burden\n   of proof for \u00a7 2.17(a)(3) 's permit exception, with the magistrate judge concluding, \"Defendant bears the burden of proving that he was permitted to BASE jump.\" It also featured a reference and citation to an article from\n   <em>\n    The Fresno Bee\n   </em>\n   , published online the same day as the bench trial, that discussed Carey's BASE jumping career and the case against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Subsequently, Carey appealed his conviction to the district court, again claiming that the government had the burden of proving that he did not have a permit, and also arguing, for the first time, that the magistrate judge should have recused himself sua sponte pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20455\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) after being exposed to extrajudicial information-namely, the\n   <em>\n    Fresno Bee\n   </em>\n   article. The district court denied the appeal, agreeing with the magistrate judge that \"the permit exception in \u00a7 2.17(a)(3) constitutes an affirmative defense and that the government did not have the burden of proving the nonexistence of permit,\" and concluding that the magistrate judge \"was not required to recuse himself pursuant to \u00a7 455(a).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review de novo the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court wrote,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   When Congress passed the District of Columbia abortion law in 1901 and amended it in 1953, it expressly authorized physicians to perform such abortions as are necessary to preserve the mother's 'life or health.'

It would be highly anomalous for a legislature to authorize abortions necessary for life or health and then to demand that a doctor, upon pain of one to ten years' imprisonment, bear the burden of proving that an abortion\n   he performed fell within that category.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Vuitch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11732665\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/62/\">\n    402 U.S. at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11732665\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/62/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).

On that same day,\n   <em>\n    The Fresno Bee\n   </em>\n   published an online article about Carey's exploits and trial, which began, \"Austin Carey says he loves to leap from Yosemite National Park's towering granite cliffs. Even a near-deadly plunge in 2015 hasn't stopped him from being a BASE jumper.\" Pablo Lopez,\n   <em>\n    He Leaps off Yosemite Cliffs, Knowing It's Illegal.

The article included Carey's personal history, details of his alleged BASE jumping in Yosemite, and a discussion of the pending criminal case.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . It reported that \"[b]efore his trial, Carey, 26, didn't deny being a BASE jumper-someone who uses a parachute or wingsuit to fly off a fixed structure or cliff. ... Carey said he has BASE jumped in Yosemite at least 20 times in the past five years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The article also noted Carey's hope that \"his case will draw attention to what he says is an injustice, and lead[ ] to legislation that will allow BASE jumping in Yosemite and other national parks,\" and featured a photo of an individual, purportedly Carey, leaping from Yosemite National Park's Half Dome wearing a pink wingsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The following month, on September 25, 2017, the magistrate judge issued his written order. The order made explicit reference to the content of the\n   <em>\n    Fresno Bee\n   </em>\n   article, and included a citation to it, in the introduction to its analysis section:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court's role is to determine if the elements of the alleged offenses have been established and, thus, whether Defendant is guilty of either or both of them. Absent a constitutional or other challenge to the validity or enforceability of the regulations-and there has been no such challenge here-the Court will not pass judgment on the wisdom of the regulations or determine whether they are inconsistent with [Yosemite National Park's] decision not to prohibit other dangerous activities. In short, while some, reportedly including Defendant [footnote citing to\n   <em>\n    Fresno Bee\n   </em>\n   article], might like to see this case produce an endorsement of BASE jumping and/or condemnation of the regulation prohibiting it, and others will seek just the opposite, it will do no such thing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The order contained no other apparent references, allusions, or citations to the article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it decided that the magistrate judge did not need to recuse himself pursuant to \u00a7 455(a). It is true that the\n   <em>\n    Fresno Bee\n   </em>\n   article contained details both prejudicial-Carey's admission to the offense-and inflammatory-in his words, \"expressing a knowing desire to break the law.\" This is particularly troubling given that Carey exercised his Fifth Amendment right to refrain from testifying at trial. But the district court articulated the correct standard under \u00a7 455(a), and reasonably concluded that \"[t]here is no indication that the judge's reading of the article, which he merely indicates in passing reference in a footnote, had any bearing on his conclusion or the legal analysis such that it would show some sort of partiality to a reasonable person reading the order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We agree that a reasonable person would not have questioned the magistrate judge's impartiality based solely on a reference to a potentially prejudicial article that had no other apparent impact on the verdict. We cannot expect judges to live as moles, roving about the limited underground landscape of the official record but never perceiving the illuminated world at the surface. In our modern, interconnected, endlessly broadcast world, complete blinders are impracticable, as a reasonable person would surely conclude. Moreover, courts have regularly held that outside knowledge does not on its own prejudice judicial proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Liteky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p548\">\n    510 U.S. at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p548\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The fact that an opinion held by a judge derives from a source outside judicial proceedings is not a\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   condition for 'bias or prejudice' recusal, since predispositions developed during the course of a trial will sometimes (albeit rarely) suffice.\");\n   <em>\n    Dean v.
