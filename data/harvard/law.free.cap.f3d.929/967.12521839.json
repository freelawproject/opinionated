At sentencing, the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   determined, without objection, that Garth was a career offender with a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of VI, resulting in an advisory guidelines sentencing range of 188 to 235 months and a statutory range of 5 to 40 years imprisonment. The district court sentenced Garth to 200 months in prison, based primarily on Garth's \"long history of dealing drugs.\" On appeal, Garth argues that this \"draconian\" sentence violates the Eighth Amendment because it is\n   grossly disproportionate to the severity of his crime. Reviewing this contention for plain error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The Eighth Amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual punishments, contains a 'narrow proportionality principle' that 'applies to noncapital sentences.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ewing v.

His 200-month sentence is within the advisory guidelines range and well within the statutory range of punishment for his offense. It is significantly shorter than the 262-month sentence in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   , the 40-year sentence in\n   <em>\n    Hutto v.

Garth committed a serious offense, helping distribute larger quantities of methamphetamine (47.4831 grams actual) than the marijuana equivalent quantities of marijuana, cocaine, and cocaine base possessed by the defendants in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hutto\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Harmelin\n   </em>\n   . Finally, we have repeatedly held that an extensive criminal history like Garth's is a factor \"justifying the imposition of lengthy sentences.\"\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237989\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/960/#p964\">\n    564 F.3d at 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and cases cited. \"Recidivism has long been recognized as a legitimate basis for increased punishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Ewing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030344\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/11/#p20\">\n    538 U.S. at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030344\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/11/#p20\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain Eighth Amendment error in sentencing Garth to 200 months imprisonment. The judgment of the district court is affirmed. We deny as moot the government's motion to dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    The Honorable James M.
