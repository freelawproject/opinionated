P. 11(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The factual basis for the drug conspiracy charge was provided by Meza-Lopez without issue, and the magistrate judge then addressed the money laundering conspiracy. When she asked if hidden compartments in the vehicles were used to conceal the fact that the money came from illegal drug activity, Meza-Lopez's counsel asked for time to confer with Meza-Lopez. His counsel then explained that Meza-Lopez did not \"feel that he [could] fairly answer\" the question. Plea Hr'g Tr. 18, Dist. Ct. Dkt. 84. Eventually, the magistrate judge said she was \"getting a little stuck\" because the money laundering conspiracy charge required Meza-Lopez to know that the transaction was designed to conceal the nature of the proceeds.

Meza-Lopez's counsel explained that Meza-Lopez disputed knowing the quantity of drugs or amount of money or where in the vehicle the money was concealed but admitted he knew drug proceeds were hidden in the vehicles and \"not being introduced properly into commerce\" or \"reported and put in a bank account.\" Plea Hr'g Tr. 23. The magistrate judge continued to question if there was a sufficient factual basis, noting \"there is nothing illegal about driving money down the interstate.\" Plea Hr'g Tr. 25. Eventually, the magistrate judge said she did not feel\n   Meza-Lopez had admitted sufficient facts to provide a basis for the money laundering conspiracy charge to allow her to accept the guilty plea. She then invited the government to propose any additional questions. The Assistant United States Attorney then asked for an off-the-record conversation with defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When the hearing resumed on the record, the magistrate judge stated, \"[C]ounsel has assisted me in understanding the facts of the case a little bit better so that I can ask the questions better.\" Plea Hr'g Tr. 29. She then asked Meza-Lopez if the vehicles coming from Lincoln, Nebraska to Phoenix had money hidden in them. He answered affirmatively. When asked if he knew the money was hidden to avoid government detection, he again said, \"Yes.\" When asked if he sought to avoid government detection because he knew the money was from drug sales, Meza-Lopez said his cousin was the one who wanted to avoid detection. The magistrate judge then asked if he knew that the money in the vehicles was from selling drugs, and Meza-Lopez said, \"Yes, but it did not belong to me.\" Plea Hr'g Tr. 30. Meza-Lopez then pled guilty to the offense, and the magistrate judge found the plea to be knowing, intelligent and voluntary with a sufficient factual basis. She recommended to the district court that it accept Meza-Lopez's plea of guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court accepted the magistrate judge's recommendation, accepted the guilty plea, and sentenced Meza-Lopez to 210 months in prison on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently.

The district court denied the motion, finding the \"extended colloquy\" at Meza-Lopez's plea hearing resulted not from a lack of a factual basis but from \"the Magistrate Judge not asking the defendant the right questions-and perhaps a more general failure of communication between the defendant and the Magistrate Judge.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Meza-Lopez argues there were insufficient facts to indicate that he knew the money in the vehicles was hidden for the purpose of concealing its nature as the proceeds of illegal activity, as required to sustain a guilty plea to a money laundering conspiracy count.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuellar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673907\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/550/#p562\">\n    553 U.S. at 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673907\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/550/#p562\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Meza-Lopez also argues his trial counsel coerced him into pleading guilty by falsely telling him that, if found guilty at trial, Meza-Lopez would face consecutive sentences on his two counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"A guilty plea is supported by an adequate factual basis when the record contains sufficient evidence at the time of the plea upon which a court may reasonably determine that the defendant likely committed the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, we need not determine whether the record provides a sufficient basis for Meza-Lopez's guilty plea. Rather, because the claim on appeal is ineffective assistance of counsel, we must decide whether, when Meza-Lopez's trial counsel advised him to plead guilty and did not object to the factual basis at the plea hearing, the attorney's representation \"fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We hold that it did not. A reasonable attorney could have determined that the record, including the government's uncontested evidence and Meza-Lopez's own colloquy with the magistrate judge, established an adequate factual basis for Meza-Lopez's guilty plea to the money laundering charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Meza-Lopez does not argue that his counsel guaranteed him a particular sentence by pleading guilty.
