Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Fernando Menendez-Gonzalez is a native and citizen of Peru who entered the United States in 1985 without being legally admitted. In 1990, he was convicted in state court of cocaine possession in violation of California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11351. He was subsequently charged as deportable for entering without inspection and for controlled substance and aggravated felony convictions based on his drug offense. An immigration judge (\"IJ\") found him deportable, and he waived appeal. He was deported in 1994, but he re-entered the United States illegally in the same year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2009, Menendez-Gonzalez's 1990 conviction was vacated because there was no preliminary hearing transcript to assess whether he was properly advised of the consequences of his plea bargain, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 1016.5. He then submitted to the immigration court a motion to reopen based on the vacatur of his conviction which, he contended, made him eligible for adjustment of status and suspension of deportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The IJ denied the motion, concluding that she lacked jurisdiction to reopen under the \"departure bar\" for removed aliens. At the time, BIA precedent held that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201002.23\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1002.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) precluded a previously-removed alien from invoking the jurisdiction of the immigration court to consider a motion to reopen, even\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Armendarez-Mendez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20646\">\n    24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2008). Menendez-Gonzalez timely appealed to the BIA, which dismissed his appeal. He then filed a petition for review in this court. This court granted the government's unopposed motion to remand to the BIA in light of a subsequent Ninth Circuit decision on the departure bar. In that case,\n   <em>\n    Reyes-Torres v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5651547\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/645/1073/#p1075\">\n    645 F.3d 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1075-77 (9th Cir. 2011), we held that an alien who filed a motion to reopen after being deported from the United States was not precluded by the departure bar from pursuing the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On remand, the BIA again denied the motion to reopen, agreeing with the IJ's alternate conclusion that the motion was time-barred. A motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of a final order of\n   removal, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever comes later.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.23\">\n    8 C.F.R \u00a7 1003.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). The BIA declined to exercise its authority-discussed at greater length below-to reopen the proceeding\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , because Menendez-Gonzalez had not demonstrated that the vacatur of his conviction was an \"exceptional circumstance\" warranting\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Menendez-Gonzalez again petitioned for review. This court granted the petition and remanded to the BIA. In doing so, we explicitly noted that we lacked jurisdiction to review the BIA's exercise of its discretionary authority to grant or deny\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopening, describing that discretion as \"unfettered.\" The remand was necessary, however, because we could not determine whether the BIA's decision was based on such an exercise of discretionary authority or, alternatively, on the application of a different standard used to evaluate the merit of a collateral attack on the underlying prior removal order. We thus asked the BIA to clarify the legal standard under which it denied\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopening.\n   <em>\n    Menendez-Gonzalez v.

Menendez-Gonzalez then filed this petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In practice, the agency's decision to exercise its\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   authority is often not actually initiated by the agency on its own but is instead prompted, as here, by a party filing a motion to reopen\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174473\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/575/#p588\">\n    840 F.3d at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Since the enactment of IIRIRA, where the timing and numerosity statutory requirements are not met and equitable tolling is unavailable, the only way an alien can reopen an adverse final order of removal is to ask the Board to exercise its\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   authority ....\").

Even when we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Bonilla\n   </em>\n   our limited jurisdiction to review BIA decisions denying\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopening, we affirmed our prior holding that the \" 'exceptional situation' benchmark does not provide a sufficiently meaningful standard to permit judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Bonilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174473\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/575/#p588\">\n    840 F.3d at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Menendez-Gonzalez contends that the BIA has a settled practice of finding that the vacatur of a criminal conviction is an exceptional circumstance warranting\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopening, and that it irrationally departed from this settled practice in his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Menendez-Gonzalez argues that this court should follow a decision by the Third Circuit and hold that orders denying\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopening are subject to judicial review when the BIA departs from its settled practice. The Third Circuit has recognized such a \"settled course\" exception allowing it to review orders denying\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopening when petitioners \"establish that the BIA has limited its discretion via a policy, rule, settled course of adjudication, or by some other method, such that the BIA's discretion can be meaningfully reviewed for abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    Sang Goo Park v.

He argues that those citations demonstrate a \"pattern\" of BIA orders granting\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopening following vacatur of a conviction, and that this pattern established a sufficiently \"settled course\" that constrained the BIA's discretion and obligated it to exercise its\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   authority to reopen his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We do not agree. Among the thousands of decisions made by the BIA over many years, it is not at all remarkable or persuasive to be able to find a few that seem to have elements in common with a current litigant's case.

There have been other decisions over the years in which the BIA declined to exercise its\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   authority to reopen after determining that vacatur of the underlying conviction did not constitute an \"exceptional circumstance\" sufficient to warrant such an extraordinary remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In Re Tunbosun Olawale William\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205537807\">\n    2008 WL 5537807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4 (BIA Dec. 23, 2008) (unpublished);\n   <em>\n    In Re: Hugo Vara-Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203276566\">\n    2012 WL 3276566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA July 13, 2012) (unpublished).

BIA Regulations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(iv), \"the Board will not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.\" Menendez-Gonzalez argues the BIA violated this provision by making factual findings instead of remanding his case to the IJ for factfinding. \"Where the IJ has not made a finding of fact on a disputed matter, and such a finding is necessary to resolution of the case, the BIA must remand to the IJ to make the required finding; it may not conduct its own fact-finding.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895013\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/1164/#p1170\">\n    683 F.3d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1170 (9th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although Menendez-Gonzalez argues that the BIA violated this rule, he has not identified the finding of any disputed facts that mattered for the BIA's decision. The only \"factfinding\" he challenges is whether he remained convicted and whether his positive equities constituted \"exceptional circumstances\" warranting reopening. It is not disputed that Menendez-Gonzalez was convicted in 1990 and the conviction was set aside under state law in 2009 because he might not have been properly advised of the consequences of his plea bargain. The legal significance of those events presented a legal question that the BIA permissibly decided. Determining whether he presented \"exceptional circumstances\" called for exercise of the agency's discretion, not factfinding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The relevant regulations also provide that \"[a] party asserting that the Board cannot properly resolve an appeal without further factfinding must file a motion for remand.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(iv). Menendez-Gonzalez did not file such a motion and did not ask the BIA to remand. Instead he simply argued that\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopening was warranted and that \"[t]he Board should therefore order that Respondent's case be reopened so that he may proceed with his applications.\" He apparently did not see the need for additional factfinding then. We do not see it now.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez-Palafox v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120848\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/1138/#p1145\">\n    744 F.3d 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1145 (9th Cir. 2014) (\"Although Perez-Palafox accuses the BIA of engaging in improper factfinding, he does not point to any fact found by the IJ that was ignored by the BIA, or any fact found by the BIA that was not found by the IJ.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nor was it necessary for the BIA to remand the matter to the IJ in order to let the IJ offer her view on the exercise of discretion. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(ii), \"[t]he Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\" Menendez-Gonzalez argues the BIA erred in making a discretionary decision in the first instance because the regulations only permit de novo \"review\" of the IJ's exercise of discretion. The word \"review\" does not prohibit the BIA from exercising its own discretion in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wood v. Mukasey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639511\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/516/564/#p569\">\n    516 F.3d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569 (7th Cir. 2008) (\"Provided the BIA can do so without additional fact-finding,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(iv), we see no reason why it must avoid issues of discretion in an appeal because they were never reached by the IJ.\"). The BIA did not violate section 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) by declining to exercise its discretionary\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   authority without remanding to the IJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The petition for review is denied. We generally lack jurisdiction to review a decision by the BIA not to exercise its\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   authority to reopen proceedings. This petition does not fit within the narrow exception where the BIA's decision was based on legal or constitutional error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    We use the term \"petitioner\" to refer to the party so described in this court, the person seeking relief from an order of removal. In proceedings before the BIA and the immigration court, that person is denominated the \"respondent.\" The potential for confusion is evident, so we make clear how we are using the term.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Among the cases Menendez-Gonzalez cites, many have factual features that potentially distinguish them from his appeal. For example, in all but two of the cases he cites where the BIA decided to reopen\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    , the Government either did not oppose or did not respond to the noncitizen's motion to reopen.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
