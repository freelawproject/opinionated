They filed tax returns in the names of themselves and others. The false tax returns sought over $965,000 from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS paid about $347,000 in refunds, mostly in the form of prepaid debit cards sent to Osman and William. The conspirators initially used tax preparers to file the false returns. In March 2009, they switched to tax software, filing the returns themselves. The conspirators filed many returns from the Internet Protocol (IP) address of Osman's business, Hot Wireless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A jury convicted Osman on 15 counts: one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; thirteen counts of aiding and assisting the preparation of a false tax return in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and one count of failure to appear at a pretrial conference in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203146\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The district court imposed a three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b) for managing and supervising a criminal operation with five or more participants. The court also imposed a special condition restricting Osman's computer use during supervised release:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant shall not possess or use a computer or have access to any online service without the prior approval of the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services Office.

Monitoring may include random examinations of computer systems along with Internet, electronic, and media storage devices under his control. The computer system or devices may be removed for a more thorough examination, if necessary. Defendant shall contribute to the costs of such monitoring services, based on your ability to pay, as deemed appropriate by the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services Office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Osman objects to the three-level enhancement and the computer restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Osman challenges the district court's factual finding that he was a manager or supervisor of the criminal activity, and thus subject to a three-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b).

The evidence showed Osman recruited the majority of filing conspirators and collected their personal information. He then oversaw the status of the tax returns, obtaining corrected information where necessary. Additionally, he controlled the deposit of the fraudulent refunds. The conspirators relied on him to share these funds with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Osman also supervised Clausen, directing her to file at least 30 false tax returns and requiring her to report back \"so that Osman could track her progress.\" Clausen traveled to Hot Wireless once a week to receive personal information that Osman gathered. Clausen made notes about the returns she filed. She returned the notes to Osman for his review. Osman used a computer at Hot Wireless to check the status of returns. He contacted Clausen if the IRS rejected a return. He also controlled the addresses where the IRS sent the refunds. And he controlled how much Clausen received from the refunds. At trial, Clausen testified she felt like she worked for Osman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   These facts support the finding that Osman managed or supervised a criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     United States v.

The district court's failure to make particularized findings did not affect Osman's substantial rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In a supplemental brief, Osman presents three issues. First, he objects to the two-level enhancement for using sophisticated means. The district court found that he used fake employers, stolen identities, different addresses and P.O. boxes, and that the scheme was complex, repetitive, and coordinated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(C) &amp; cmt. n.9(B)\n   </strong>\n   . These findings are not clearly erroneous and adequately support the enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    8th Cir. R. 47B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, Osman believes the district court did not adequately explain its sentence. To the contrary, on this plain error review, the district court adequately explained its within-guideline sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     United States v. Bistrup\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5408382\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/873/#p883\">\n    449 F.3d 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 883-84 (8th Cir. 2006) (the sentencing court need not \"repeat all of its findings when it decides on a specific term of imprisonment\");\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Feemster\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670730\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/455/#p461\">\n    572 F.3d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461-62 (8th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (this court may give a presumption of reasonableness to a within-guidelines sentence);\n   <strong>\n    8th Cir. R. 47B\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Third, for the first time on appeal, Osman asserts there was insufficient evidence for the amounts of loss and restitution. To the contrary, the amounts listed in the superceding indictment and the Presentence Investigation Report support the amounts of loss and restitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    8th Cir. R. 47B\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   * * * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The Honorable David S. Doty, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
