Bradley sued the village and mayor in federal court under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violating his Fourteenth Amendment rights by depriving him of a property interest in his job without due process of law. He also asserted several state-law claims. The district court dismissed Bradley's federal due process claim on the pleadings. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties agree that Bradley had a protected property interest in his continued employment. They agree that the mayor and the village board are the policymakers for their municipality on the subject. And everyone agrees that although there was ample opportunity for a hearing, Bradley received no pretermination notice or hearing. Those points of agreement suffice to prove a due process claim under \u00a7 1983 against the individual officials and the village itself, where the village acted through high-ranking officials with policymaking authority.

Defendants reason that because the village's top officials decided as a matter of village policy to deny an employee due process in a way that also violated state law, their policy decision should be treated as a \"random and unauthorized act ... beyond the control of the State,\"\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188807\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/527/#p541\">\n    451 U.S. at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188807\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/527/#p541\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , leaving Bradley to pursue remedies only under state law. In other words, defendants argue that by intentionally violating plaintiff's federal due process rights in a way that also violated state law, they insulated their actions from federal liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This argument is foreclosed for several reasons. First, the Supreme Court has never suggested that the pragmatic but narrow rule of\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   applies to employee due process claims where predeprivation notice and an opportunity to be heard could be provided in a practical way. Public employers' decisions to violate both state and federal procedural requirements have never been treated as grounds to excuse federal due process liability. In addition, in this case, the decision to fire Bradley was made by the top municipal officials. This court has held squarely that \"a complaint asserting municipal liability under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   by definition states a claim to which\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   is inapposite.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Town of Clayton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10543932\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/839/375/#p380\">\n    839 F.2d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380 (7th Cir. 1988). That holding is consistent with other circuits and accords with common sense. A municipality cannot be held liable under a respondeat superior theory of liability. It can be held liable for a constitutional violation only if the violation resulted from a formal policy, an informal custom, or a decision \"made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p694\">\n    436 U.S. at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 694 &amp; n.58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p694\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In cases alleging due process violations by municipal policymakers, there is no need to inquire separately into whether an employee's actions were \"random and unauthorized.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition, defendants' expansive interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   is at odds with the Supreme Court's explication of\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Zinermon v.

There is no indication in\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zinermon\n   </em>\n   , or our en banc decision in\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   of an intention to undermine or overrule so much bedrock \u00a7 1983 law or to intrude on\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   doctrine in cases against municipalities. Those decisions should not be read to provide a defense to Bradley's due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Where predeprivation procedures are both required and practicable, municipal policymakers expose the municipality and themselves to liability under \u00a7 1983 if they deliberately disregard an individual's constitutional due process rights. This is true even when state law also offers postdeprivation remedies. We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2013, plaintiff Bradley became the police chief of the Village of University Park, Illinois. Soon after a municipal election in 2015, however, the mayor and village board placed Bradley on administrative leave. Thirteen days later, they fired him summarily, without giving him any notice of good cause or any opportunity to be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The letter terminating Bradley did not try to justify his firing based on any sort of good cause. It suggested that he was being ousted by operation of state law because his employment contract extended his tenure beyond the term of the village officeholders who had appointed him, citing 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3.1-30-5(c) &amp; 5/8-1-7(b), and\n   <em>\n    Millikin v. Edgar County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3088536\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill/142/528/\">\n    142 Ill. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20N.E.%20493\">\n    32 N.E. 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1892). This meant, according to the village board, that Bradley's appointment as police chief terminated as of May 15, 2015 without needing a board vote, a statement of reasons, or a hearing. Bradley responded with a letter demanding an opportunity to be heard. He received no answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   These actions did not comply with the termination provisions of Bradley's employment contract, the requirements of state law, or-critical to this case-the Fourteenth Amendment. To effect Bradley's removal, Illinois state law required the village to follow a process set forth in 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/10-2.1-17. See also University Park, Ill.,\n   <em>\n    Codified Ordinances\n   </em>\n   part 2, title 8, \u00a7 271-02(g) (adopting in its entirety 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/10-2.1-17 ). This process requires a statement of \"the reasons for such removal or discharge,\" which must be voted on by the village's corporate authorities before the discharge may take effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20N.E.%20493\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The process also includes \"a fair and impartial hearing of the charges\" in front of the village's board of fire and police commissioners.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20N.E.%20493\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These procedures would, if followed, satisfy\n   the basic federal constitutional requirement that the village offer its tenured employees notice and an opportunity to be heard before firing them, a right that \"does not depend on a demonstration of certain success.\"\n   <em>\n    Loudermill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/#p542\">\n    470 U.S. at 542-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/#p542\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/#p542\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/#p542\">\n    at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/#p542\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Carey v.

The village filed an answer admitting that Bradley was fired without any process and asserting several affirmative defenses, including qualified immunity for the mayor in her individual capacity. The village has conceded that Bradley held a protected property interest in his job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court directed the parties to address the qualified immunity defense and to address our decision in\n   <em>\n    Michalowicz v.

The municipal defendants seem to have conceded that the municipality's policymakers unconstitutionally deprived Bradley of a recognized property interest without any due process. Yet defendants instead contend that their official action-taken by the village's highest-ranking officials with final policymaking authority-should be considered \"random and unauthorized\" and thus excused under\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   . We reject this defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   To explain why, we first describe\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   and its progeny (\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zinermon\n   </em>\n   , and our circuit's application of the\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   exception in\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   ). We then explain why defendants' proposal to extend the\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   exception to municipal \u00a7 1983 liability is contrary to our own and other circuits' precedent-and for good reasons. It makes no sense to speak of such official policymaking as \"random and unauthorized\" in terms of\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   . That's why the Supreme Court has never suggested that\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   can be extended to defend against an otherwise valid\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. The defendants' proposed exception is not necessary given\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   's test for liability. And accepting defendants' argument would conflict directly with\n   <em>\n    Monroe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pembaur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Owen\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Bryan County\n   </em>\n   . We would have to reach the improbable conclusion that a municipality is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   liable for its highest officials' decision to deprive a person of his federal constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, even if the\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   exception were relevant here, neither Supreme Court precedent nor our decision in\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   supports defendants' theory that, so long as municipal policymakers violate both the federal Constitution and state law, and some state remedy exists, the municipality is excused from \u00a7 1983 liability. In the past we have disparaged similar attempts to evade municipal liability, dismissing as \"extravagant\" a claim that the \"acts of [a] Mayor ... are merely acts of an errant employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Vodak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201491\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/738/#p747\">\n    639 F.3d at 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, we cited\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   because of the \"inherently unpredictable\" nature of the specific kind of procedural missteps in\n   <em>\n    Michalowicz\n   </em>\n   -assigning a post-termination hearing to the wrong municipal body.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The dissent asserts: \"The substance of Bradley's claim\"-i.e., a constitutional violation-compared to Michalowicz's claim-i.e., failure to follow state procedures-\"is simply irrelevant under the\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\" Post at 913-. To the contrary, the substance of that claim is decisive.

State and local laws often provide very detailed procedures for terminating public officials and employees. As we have noted so often, those procedural details of those state and local laws simply are not matters of federal due process. Where the plaintiff received the constitutionally required notice and opportunity to be heard before termination, and a more extensive hearing afterward, the \"remedies guaranteed by state law\" in state court were enough to protect against the kind of state-law mistakes that happened in\n   <em>\n    Michalowicz\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581589\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/528/530/#p532\">\n    528 F.3d at 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Doherty\n   </em>\n   , 75 F.3d at 323 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Cannici v.

We accepted the defendants' argument that\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   barred Easter House's suit and rejected Easter House's three main arguments: (1) that\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   applies only to minor deprivations; (2) that a conspiracy can never be a \"random and unauthorized\" act; and (3) that the actions of high-level policymaking employees are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   \"authorized\" because they amount to the policy or established procedure of the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1398 (majority opinion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The last of these is particularly relevant here. In rejecting that argument, we distinguished\n   <em>\n    Zinermon\n   </em>\n   on the grounds that the statute delegating authority in that case did not include procedural safeguards, meaning the state officials had \"broadly delegated authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1401. In effect, we limited\n   <em>\n    Zinermon\n   </em>\n   's qualification of\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   to situations where the state official in question had unfettered discretion to act. That much is clear from our statement that \"we can envision a scenario where a high-ranking state official does exercise the authority and discretion to effect a deprivation, yet that discretion is 'circumscribed' by statutory or other predeprivation procedural safeguards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1400. In such a case, we said, \"an abuse of that discretion ... would not necessarily be 'predictable' from the point of view of the state and, according to\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Zinermon\n   </em>\n   , not compensable under \u00a7 1983.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, we went as far as to call the failure to cabin the officials' discretion in\n   <em>\n    Zinermon\n   </em>\n   a \"statutory oversight.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1401. In short, Easter House's claim was barred because it alleged that state officials simply failed to heed the procedural\n   safeguards contained in state law. The \"licensing conspiracy was not one that the state could have predicted or, more importantly, prevented through the implementation of additional predeprivation procedural safeguards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Further still, the\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   court rejected Easter House's related argument that the acts of certain high-ranking officials may be considered \"established state procedure\" and thus avoid the application of\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   . Writing for the court, Judge Kanne framed the issue as \"whether a single act of employee misconduct, which clearly contravenes established state policy and procedure as contained within formal rules, regulations, and statutes, automatically becomes the state's new position in all similar matters or whether the act, when viewed from the state's perspective, is merely a 'random and unauthorized' deviation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1402. We chose the latter: Where there is a formal pronouncement of state policy (like a state statute) rather than case-by-case adjudication, even if a policymaker himself \"deviates in a single instance from the more formal pronouncement, it is less likely to reflect a new trend in state policy and procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   established that (1)\n   <em>\n    Zinermon\n   </em>\n   's limitation of the\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   doctrine does not apply when state employees ignore procedural safeguards guaranteed under state law; and (2) when they violate state procedural statutes, even high-ranking officials can commit random and unauthorized acts from the perspective of the State. To put it differently, a wrongful decision may be predictable and authorized from the State's perspective only when state law does not cabin an official's discretion to grant pre-deprivation process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   We have subsequently applied this rule to bar cases where the plaintiff alleges a violation of state procedural rules.

But like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Clifton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Germano\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Michalowicz\n   </em>\n   , he has not alleged the mayor and Village Board had unfettered discretion to fire him without a hearing. Rather, his complaint acknowledges the mayor and Board's actions as alleged would violate Illinois law. Put another way, he alleges the mayor and the Village Board did something that, as far as the State is concerned, was random and unauthorized. Nothing the legislature in Springfield could dream up could have stopped this conduct. Illinois law already \"circumscribed any discretion [the Village actors] might have had over the decision\" to fire Bradley without process.\n   <em>\n    Clifton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514855\" index=\"375\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/969/278/#p281\">\n    969 F.2d at 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, Bradley's claim falls within the scope of\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   . So long as Illinois provides an adequate post-deprivation remedy, a \u00a7 1983 procedural due process claim will not lie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Michalowicz\n   </em>\n   , the Illinois Administrative Review Act provides an adequate remedy for Bradley. We said in that case \"the relief Michalowicz seeks-an independent review of whether the evidence supports his termination and whether the Village Board was biased or failed to follow the prescribed procedure in connection with his termination-falls squarely within the ambit of the Act, both through the state court's own review of the administrative record and through its authority to remand for rehearing.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581589\" index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/528/530/#p532\">\n    528 F.3d at 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fact that\n   <em>\n    no hearing\n   </em>\n   instead of a\n   <em>\n    defective hearing\n   </em>\n   occurred in this case does not change that outcome. If the state\n   court believes more fact-finding is necessary, it can simply remand to the Village and order it to conduct a hearing.

However, reaching that conclusion does not mean there is no longer a need to examine whether the action taken under color of state law was random and unauthorized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   While it is true that the actions in cases like\n   <em>\n    Michalowicz\n   </em>\n   and this one would certainly rise to the level of a municipal policy under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   , such a policy would still be random and unauthorized as far as the\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   is concerned. Even the official policy of a municipality established through acts of high-ranking officials is unpredictable from the State's perspective if such policy contravenes established state procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Germano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9019421\" index=\"408\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/926/#p929\">\n    403 F.3d at 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is especially true when the high-ranking official is a municipal official acting on behalf of the municipality as opposed to a high-ranking state official. We've applied this reasoning to a county board in\n   <em>\n    Germano\n   </em>\n   and a village board in\n   <em>\n    Michalowicz\n   </em>\n   .

These are precisely the sort of\n   claims barred by\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   . It makes no difference whether the defendant is a high-ranking municipal employee creating municipal policy through his action or a state official acting with the authority imbued in his office by state law. The actions may still be random and unauthorized from the State's perspective if the defendant's authority has been circumscribed and regulated by state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540920\" index=\"411\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/1387/\">\n    910 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1402 ;\n   <em>\n    Clifton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514855\" index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/969/278/#p281\">\n    969 F.2d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   , we emphasized that whether an act is random and unauthorized depends on the state's point of view, not the actor's.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The court dismisses this line of reasoning by asserting the State's perspective is irrelevant in cases where the State is not a defendant, and that \"different rules of liability under \u00a7 1983 apply to municipalities making and carrying out their own policies.\" Maj. Op. at 892. This essentially construes\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   as creating a wholly new cause of action: one analogous to \u00a7 1983, but which holds municipal policymakers liable for actions taken under color of\n   <em>\n    municipal policy\n   </em>\n   in the same way that \u00a7 1983 holds actors liable for actions taken under color of\n   <em>\n    state law\n   </em>\n   . If that were the case, then it might be reasonable to look to the perspective of the municipality when determining if an action was random and unauthorized. This is not what\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   purported to accomplish, however, when it held that a municipality qualifies as a \"person\" under \u00a7 1983 and may be liable for the actions of high-level policymakers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Moreover, the court's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 1983 misses the essential \"under color of state law\" linchpin of \u00a7 1983.

It suggests such a holding would undermine public employees' constitutional due process protections and conflict with longstanding Supreme Court precedent allowing municipal officials to be held liable under \u00a7 1983 for acts representing official municipal policy. Maj. Op. at 898-99. The thrust of these arguments is that applying the\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   exception to actions of municipal officials as representatives of the municipality would eliminate municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 and would eviscerate public employees' due process protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   As I have already explained in detail, however, a proper understanding of the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   municipal-liability inquiry and the\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   random-and-unauthorized-acts inquiry demonstrates that the one does not foreclose the other. Rather than engage in further refutation of these contentions, I will simply point to\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   's binding interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Zinermon\n   </em>\n   as the answer to the court's concerns. Applying\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   to\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   -type claims would no more eliminate public employees' procedural protections or municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 than\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   's rule eliminates due process claims against all state agency employees. Instead, where the State has conferred broad, unfettered discretion on an actor (whether that actor is a state employee, municipality, or other person), a deprivation committed by that actor cannot be said to be random and unauthorized. In such a case, the State could predict the deprivation would occur and could have prevented it through additional procedural safeguards. That was the case in\n   <em>\n    Zinermon\n   </em>\n   and, as I have pointed out, in\n   <em>\n    Tavarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Breuder\n   </em>\n   . That was not the case, however, in\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Germano\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Michalowicz\n   </em>\n   ; nor is it Bradley's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The court's additional concern that applying\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   to this case would conflict with\n   <em>\n    Patsy v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Since our\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   decision in\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   , the law of this circuit has been clear: an individual deprived of property without pre-deprivation process by the random and unauthorized act of a state actor may not maintain a due process action in federal court so long as the State provides an adequate post-deprivation remedy. Whether that state actor is a municipality or some other person clothed with authority by the State does not change the essential inquiry of whether the act was predictable and preventable by the State. We had a chance 28 years ago to adopt the broader reading of\n   <em>\n    Zinermon\n   </em>\n   that Judge Cudahy and others\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   advocated, but we rejected it. Today, the court seeks to change direction. Yet we are now bound by\n   <em>\n    Easter House\n   </em>\n   . Under that decision-and with a proper understanding of municipal liability under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   and the relevance of the State's perspective under\n   <em>\n    Parratt\n   </em>\n   -the outcome of this case is clear: Bradley cannot maintain a due process claim in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Contrary to the court's concerns, the failure of Bradley's federal claim does not mean he has no opportunity for redress. If Bradley's allegations are true, he will have a remedy under the Illinois Administrative Review Act.
