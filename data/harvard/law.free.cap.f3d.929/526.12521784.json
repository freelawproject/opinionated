Deputy Lesan recognized Oglesby from Oglesby's prior encounters with the sheriff's department, which included instances where Oglesby made threats against law enforcement. Deputy Lesan was also aware of reports that Oglesby had access to weapons. She approached Oglesby and asked for his license and registration, which he provided. Deputy Lesan then told him to \"wait here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After returning to her car and checking Oglesby's documents, Deputy Lesan discovered that the Lincoln, Nebraska Police Department (LPD) had a broadcast\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   out for him due to a disturbance that had occurred within the Lincoln city limits. The broadcast indicated that any LPD officer who encountered Oglesby should issue a citation to him. Deputy Lesan returned Oglesby's documents and told him that LPD had a broadcast out for him. She did not provide Oglesby with any details about the broadcast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Oglesby told Deputy Lesan that LPD staff could call him if they wished to talk to him. He asked if he was under arrest and Deputy Lesan told him he was not. Oglesby then asked if he could leave. Deputy Lesan told him that he could but that she would follow him. Oglesby got in his car and drove home. Deputy Lesan followed him, calling dispatch on the way to make certain an LPD officer would meet her at Oglesby's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   LPD dispatched Officer Chad Hein to take care of the LPD broadcast for Oglesby. Officer Hein, who knew of Oglesby as a dangerous individual who had made threats against law enforcement in the past and had access to weapons, determined, based on existing police reports, that he had probable cause to cite Oglesby for the Lincoln disturbance. He reached Oglesby's residence, which is outside the Lincoln city limits, and completed the citation while waiting for Oglesby and Deputy Lesan to arrive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Oglesby arrived first, parked in the driveway, and walked toward the house. Officer Hein followed him up the driveway and asked Oglesby to stop and talk. Oglesby\n   asked if Officer Hein had a warrant. Officer Hein replied that he did not need a warrant. Oglesby asked Officer Hein if he was under arrest, and Officer Hein replied, \"No.\" At this point Officer Hein pulled out a stun gun, pointed it at Oglesby, and tased him, with the electrodes becoming embedded in his chest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oglesby then entered his residence. Officer Hein followed him to the porch and radioed for assistance. Oglesby and his mother began arguing with Officer Hein through the open door to the porch. Oglesby refused to step outside to sign the citation, and Oglesby's mother attempted to close the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Oglesby states that Officer Hein then burst through the door, knocking Oglesby's mother to the floor, and rushed him. Officer Hein states that he placed his foot between the door and the door frame to prevent the door from closing on Oglesby's mother and injuring her. When Oglesby used his full body weight to attempt to close the door, Officer Hein asked him to let go because his foot was painfully wedged between the door and the door frame. After 10 to 15 seconds, Officer Hein deployed his Taser, which had little effect on Oglesby due to the heavy winter coat he was wearing but did cause him to stop pushing on the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties agree that Oglesby ran farther into the house. Officer Hein followed and tackled him. The two struggled and Officer Hein deployed his Taser once or twice. Deputy Lesan then entered the home and, after more struggling, the officers handcuffed Oglesby, walked him outside, and turned him over to other LPD officers who had arrived on scene. As a result of these events, Oglesby was charged in state court with hindering, delaying, or obstructing arrest in violation of the Lincoln Municipal Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lincoln, Neb., Mun. Code \u00a7 9.08.030 (\"It shall be unlawful for any person to intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly ... physically hinder, delay, interrupt, or in any manner physically oppose any police officer of the city, or any peace officer, in making an arrest.\"). Oglesby pled no contest, was sentenced to a $500 fine, and did not appeal his conviction or sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Oglesby then filed a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   suit in United States District Court against Officer Hein and Deputy Lesan in their individual capacities, alleging that the officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights by unlawfully seizing him on the Hickman street, unlawfully arresting him at his residence, and using unreasonable force against him. Officer Hein and Deputy Lesan moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. Oglesby filed a 111-page single-spaced brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, in which he objected to virtually every exhibit the officers submitted with their motion. The officers attached additional exhibits to their reply brief, to which Oglesby also objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court overruled all evidentiary objections. It found that Deputy Lesan did not seize Oglesby on the street in Hickman, that the officers had probable cause to arrest Oglesby at his residence, and that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity on Oglesby's excessive force claim because Oglesby failed to show the right at issue was clearly established at the time. The district court therefore granted summary judgment in the officers' favor on all claims. Oglesby now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, taking\n   the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , 753 F.3d at 754.

Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/#p178\">\n    553 U.S. 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 178,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/#p178\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/#p178\">\n    170 L.Ed.2d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (stating that a police officer who has probable cause but violates a state law in effecting an arrest does not violate the Fourth Amendment because \"it is not the province of the Fourth Amendment to enforce state law\");\n   <em>\n    Rose v. City of Mulberry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4037865\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/678/#p680\">\n    533 F.3d 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 680 (8th Cir. 2008) (stating that a city police officer who has probable cause but arrests someone outside his jurisdiction does not violate the Fourth Amendment even if he violates state law). We find, therefore, that Officer Hein and Deputy Lesan did not violate the Fourth Amendment solely by arresting Oglesby outside of the Lincoln city limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Oglesby also argues, for the first time before this Court, that Officer Hein lacked probable cause to arrest him. In general, we \"will not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal\" unless failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice.\n   <em>\n    Trs. of Electricians' Salary Deferral Plan v. Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3497175\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/922/#p926\">\n    688 F.3d 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 926 (8th Cir. 2012). Oglesby failed to raise this argument before the district court. He has therefore waived it, and \"[w]e find no miscarriage of justice warranting further analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Cole v. UAW\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038971\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/932/#p936\">\n    533 F.3d 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 936 (8th Cir. 2008). We affirm the district court's dismissal of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Next, Oglesby claims that Officer Hein and Deputy Lesan used excessive force in effectuating his arrest. The district court found that Oglesby failed to show that the facts established a violation of his constitutional rights and that, even if they did, those rights were not clearly established at the time of Oglesby's arrest. It therefore granted summary judgment in favor of the officers, finding that they were entitled to qualified immunity. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On appeal, Oglesby argues that non-violent, non-fleeing suspects have a clearly-established right to not be shot with stun guns. However, in opposition to summary judgment, Oglesby's sole argument against applying qualified immunity was that Officer Hein possessed no authority to arrest him outside of the city of Lincoln. He failed to identify the right at issue, argue that right was clearly established, or cite any case that would have put the officers on notice that their conduct was unconstitutional. By failing to do so, Oglesby waived the arguments he now asserts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3497175\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/922/#p926\">\n    688 F.3d at 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment to the officers on Oglesby's excessive force claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Oglesby finally argues that the district court improperly admitted a host of evidentiary materials and relied on those materials in making its decision. \"We defer to admissibility determinations under an abuse-of-discretion standard of review, even at summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Morgan v. United Parcel Serv. of Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9211565\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/459/#p467\">\n    380 F.3d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467 (8th Cir. 2004). A district court abuses its discretion in admitting evidentiary materials if those materials could not \"be presented at trial in an admissible form.\"\n   <em>\n    Gannon Int'l, Ltd. v. Blocker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879830\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/785/#p793\">\n    684 F.3d 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 793 (8th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Oglesby argues that multiple exhibits Officer Hein and Deputy Lesan submitted\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   were not properly authenticated. However, Oglesby makes no showing that these documents\n   <em>\n    could not\n   </em>\n   be presented at trial in an admissible form. We thus find\n   that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879830\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/785/#p793\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (stating that a district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence when the objecting party \"[did] not even attempt to argue that the [evidence] could not have been presented in an admissible form at trial\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Oglesby next argues that Officer Hein improperly attached authentication of several of his exhibits to an index of evidence instead of his attorney's affidavit. However, the district court's local rules require parties to attach exhibits to an index of evidence and to provide an affidavit authenticating those exhibits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NECivR 7.1(a)(2). Similarly, Oglesby objects to the officers' submission of an index of evidence and supplemental affidavits on reply at summary judgment. However, the district court's local rules provide that a moving party may file an index of evidence attached to a reply brief if it is filed within seven days of the filing of the opposing brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NECivR 7.1(c). Oglesby does not argue that the reply was untimely. We decline to find that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the officers' exhibits pursuant to a local rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Oglesby also avers that all evidence related to his state conviction for interfering with an arrest, including a certified copy of the chapter of the Lincoln Municipal Code under which he was arrested, was inadmissible as irrelevant to the instant case. However, a plea of no contest in a matter forecloses a subsequent \u00a7 1983 claim for arrest without probable cause.\n   <em>\n    Heck v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/#p484\">\n    512 U.S. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/#p484\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/#p484\">\n    129 L.Ed.2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (stating that a prior criminal proceeding must terminate in favor of the accused to support a later \u00a7 1983 claim). Officer Hein raised this defense in response to Oglesby's unlawful arrest claim. Evidence that Oglesby pled no contest to and was subsequently convicted in state court of charges stemming from his arrest was therefore relevant to whether Oglesby could prevail on his unlawful arrest claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 401 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/#p484\">\n    512 U.S. at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/#p484\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding this evidence relevant and admitting it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Oglesby finally argues that the district court improperly admitted Deputy Lesan's and Officer Hein's affidavits because those affidavits detail events that occurred at Oglesby's residence, which is outside the Lincoln city limits. Oglesby does not actually explain why he believes this evidence is inadmissible; rather, he reiterates his argument that Officer Hein did not have jurisdiction to arrest him at his residence. Moreover, Deputy Lesan's and Officer Hein's affidavits detail events which underlie this case, of which they have personal knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We affirm the district court's judgment in full.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The Honorable Richard G.
