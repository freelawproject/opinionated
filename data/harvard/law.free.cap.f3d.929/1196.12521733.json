They argue that the recently enacted First Step Act's amendment to the good time credit provision requires the Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") to re-calculate their sentences immediately, which would accelerate their dates for release or transfer to prerelease custody.

Section 3624(b) controls how the BOP calculates good time credit.

The Act implemented a number of prison and sentencing reforms. We limit our focus to subsection 102(b), which made two amendments relevant to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   First, paragraph 102(b)(1) amends \u00a7 3624(b) - the good time credit provision - to require the BOP to permit up to 54 days per year. \u00a7 102(b), 132 Stat. at 5210. Second, paragraph 102(b)(1) amends \u00a7 3624 by adding subsection (g), which is relevant to the Act's creation of an earned time credit system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5210-13. The Act requires that, within 210 days of its enactment, the Attorney General establish a \"risk and needs assessment system\" to, broadly speaking, review each prisoner's recidivism risk level, award earned time\n   credit as an incentive for participation in recidivism reduction programming, and \"determine when a prisoner is ready to transfer into prerelease custody or supervised release in accordance with section 3624.\" \u00a7 101(a), 132 Stat. at 5196-97. Section 3624(g) details the criteria for when a prisoner becomes eligible, considering earned time credit, for transfer to prerelease custody or supervised release. \u00a7 102(b), 132 Stat. at 5210-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsection 102(b) also includes an effective-date provision in paragraph 102(b)(2), and a retroactivity provision in paragraph 102(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    SEC. 102.

They disagree, however, as to when that amendment takes effect. Petitioners argue that the amendment took effect upon the Act's enactment on December 21, 2018, and, therefore, that they are entitled to the immediate recalculation of their good time credit. But the BOP contends that the amendment does not take effect until July 19, 2019 - the date by which the Attorney General must establish \"the risk and needs assessment system.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court agreed with the BOP. It held that the Act's text clearly links the good time credit amendment's effective date to the creation of \"the risk and needs assessment system.\" Accordingly, the court explained that it \"cannot, as Petitioners invite [it] to do, ignore Section 102(b)(2)'s express and unambiguous text and conclude that, despite what it clearly said, Congress really intended the 'good time fix' to be effective immediately.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Congress provided \"clear direction\" in paragraph 102(b)(2) to delay the implementation of the good time credit amendment until the Attorney General establishes the \"risk and needs assessment system.\"\n   <em>\n    Gozlon-Peretz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227711\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/395/#p404\">\n    498 U.S. at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227711\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/395/#p404\">\n    111 S.Ct. 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like the district court, we refuse to overlook the Act's plain text and therefore affirm the denial of the joint habeas petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our analysis can begin and end with paragraph 102(b)(2)'s text. First, paragraph 102(b)(2)'s title - \" EFFECTIVE DATE \" - leaves no doubt about its purpose. \u00a7 102(b), 132 Stat. at 5213. Second, paragraph 102(b)(2)'s text unambiguously applies to the entire subsection. Its subject - \"[t]he amendments made by this subsection\" - refers to \"amendments\" in the plural without any qualifications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Subsection 102(b) makes only two amendments: the good time credit amendment and the addition of \u00a7 3624(g).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5210-13. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that paragraph 102(b)(2) must apply to both amendments made in paragraph 102(b)(1). Third, paragraph 102(b)(2)'s text is straightforward as to when these amendments become operative: \"The amendments made by this subsection\n   <em>\n    shall take effect\n   </em>\n   beginning on the date that the Attorney General completes and releases the risk and needs assessment system ... as added by section 101(a) of this Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5213 (emphasis added). In addition to the mandatory language - \"shall take effect\" - paragraph 102(b)(2) plainly ties the amendments' effectivity to the date that the \"risk and needs assessment system\" is established. Although no specific date is provided, the text refers directly to \"section 101(a) of this Act,\" which requires the Attorney General to establish the \"risk and needs assessment system\" within 210 days of enactment, thus no later than July 19, 2019. \u00a7 101(a), 132 Stat. at 5196.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Conceding that paragraph 102(b)(2)'s text is difficult to overcome, Petitioners argue that \"the full statutory context\" requires reading paragraph 102(b)(2) so that it does not apply to the good time credit amendment. They contend that \"this subsection\" in paragraph 102(b)(2) refers only to paragraph 102(b)(1)'s addition of \u00a7 3624(g) because just that amendment is related to the newly created \"risk and needs assessment system.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We reject this narrow reading of \"this subsection.\" Interpreting paragraph 102(b)(2) to apply only to the addition of \u00a7 3624(g) is unnatural. This proposed interpretation also asks us to ignore how \"this subsection\" is used elsewhere.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641522,12454860\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/474/\">\n    560 U.S. at 483-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641522,12454860\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/474/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing a \"presumption that a given\n   term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute\" (citation omitted)). For instance, paragraph 102(b)(3) uses \"this subsection\" to give both of paragraph 102(b)(1)'s amendments retroactive effect:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    SEC. 102. IMPLEMENTATION OF SYSTEM AND RECOMMENDATIONS BY BUREAU OF PRISONS.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (b) PRERELEASE CUSTODY.- ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (3) APPLICABILITY.-The amendments made by this subsection shall apply with respect to offenses committed before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act, except that such amendments shall not apply with respect to offenses committed before November 1, 1987.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00a7 102(b), 132 Stat. at 5208, 5210, 5213. As in paragraph 102(b)(2), the subject of paragraph 102(b)(3) - \"[t]he amendments made by this subsection\" - refers to more than a single amendment and contains no qualifier to limit its application to only the addition of \u00a7 3624(g).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Notably, Petitioners do not advocate for a narrow interpretation of \"this subsection\" in paragraph 102(b)(3) because that would produce a disadvantageous result for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Still in search of a viable argument for narrowly construing paragraph 102(b)(2)'s text, Petitioners contend that we should not interpret the Act as written because it is illogical to link the good time credit amendment's effective date to the \"risk and needs assessment system.\" At first glance, Petitioners are correct that it is not immediately intuitive why Congress linked the two. However, even though the good time credit calculation and the \"risk and needs assessment system\" are not dependent on each other, they are generally related. Specifically, both affect prerelease custody under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203624\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The good time credit calculation affects a prisoner's projected release date, which affects when a prisoner can be transferred to prerelease custody.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203624\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (requiring that the BOP, \"to the extent practicable, ensure that a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment spends a portion of the final months of that term\" in prerelease custody). And, under the new \"risk and needs assessment system,\" receiving earned time credit can potentially shorten prerelease custody or supervised release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101(a), 132 Stat. at 5198. Because good time credit does not operate entirely separately from the \"risk and needs assessment system,\" Congress rationally placed the good time credit amendment in subsection 102(b), titled \" PRERELEASE CUSTODY .\" \u00a7 102(b), 132 Stat. at 5210;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Almendarez-Torres v.

Releasing a prisoner comes with a host of obligations, including the provision of clothing, a stipend, and transportation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203624\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Because the good time credit amendment affects a large swath of the federal incarcerated population, there is nothing absurd about giving the BOP time to prepare for this increased administrative burden and the ensuing number of releases and prerelease transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Alleged Drafting Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Likely understanding the weakness in their proposed statutory interpretation, Petitioners move beyond textual arguments. They argue that even if paragraph 102(b)(2) delays the good time credit amendment, this is a \"drafting oversight\" for us to fix. We find nothing to suggest that the delay was such an oversight. Moreover, Petitioners' reliance here on\n   <em>\n    Gozlon-Peretz\n   </em>\n   is inapt. There, the United States Supreme Court clarified when a statute, which was\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   an effective-date provision, became operative.\n   <em>\n    Gozlon-Peretz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227711\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/395/#p404\">\n    498 U.S. at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227711\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/395/#p404\">\n    111 S.Ct. 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e note that \u00a7 1002, like many other congressional enactments, contains no provision for its effective date.

Constitutional Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, we also reject Petitioners' contention that the delay violates the Constitution. Petitioners argue that reading paragraph 102(b)(2) to stall the good time credit amendment violates the Equal Protection Clause because federal prisoners with projected release dates between December 21, 2018, and July 19, 2019, are irrationally deprived of the amendment's benefit and thus overserve their sentences. Because Petitioners do not allege that this classification implicates a suspect class or infringes on a fundamental right, we apply only rational basis review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Petitioners have failed to satisfy their burden of \"disprov[ing] the rationality of the relationship between the classification and the purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As already discussed, Congress understandably gave the BOP time to implement the good time credit amendment rather than making it immediately effective. This respite eased the BOP's administrative burden and bolstered its ability to prepare for the impending releases and prerelease transfers. Questioning whether the Act provided the BOP too many days to prepare does not overcome the deference we owe to Congress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGinnis v.

In\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   , the defendant challenged the United States Sentencing Commission's delayed implementation of a sentence-reduction amendment because he did not benefit unless that amendment took immediate effect.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341130\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/1104/#p1113\">\n    800 F.3d at 1107-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Denying the equal protection challenge, we recognized the \"legitimate government interests\" in delay because of the large number of potentially eligible prisoners and the agency's need to prepare.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341130\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/1104/#p1113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341130\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/1104/#p1113\">\n    at 1113-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
