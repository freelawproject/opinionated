Although Congress provided some funding for those purposes, it consistently refused\n   to pass any measures that met the President's desired funding level, creating a standoff that led to a 35-day partial government shutdown. The President signed the budget legislation that ended the shutdown, but he then declared a national emergency and pursued other means to get additional funding for border barrier construction beyond what Congress had appropriated. One of those means, and the one at issue in this emergency request for a stay, was a reprogramming of funds by DoD in response to a request by the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Specifically, DoD relied on section 8005 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2019 and related provisions to reprogram approximately $2.5 billion, moving the funds from DoD to DHS, for the purpose of building border barriers in certain locations within Arizona, California, and New Mexico. Section 8005 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer funds for military purposes if the Secretary determines that the transfer is \"for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements\" and \"the item for which funds are requested has [not] been denied by the Congress.\" Pub. L. No. 115-245, \u00a7 8005,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%202981\">\n    132 Stat. 2981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2999 (2018) (hereinafter \"section 8005\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") sued Defendants to enjoin the reprogramming and the funds' expenditure. They argued that the requirements of section 8005 had not been satisfied and that the use of the funds to build a border barrier was accordingly unsupported by any congressional appropriation and thus unconstitutional. A federal district court agreed with Plaintiffs and enjoined Defendants from using reprogrammed funds to construct a border barrier. Defendants now move for an emergency stay of the district court's injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   To rule on Defendants' motion, we consider several factors, including whether Defendants have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their appeal, the degree of hardship to each side that would result from a stay or its denial, and the public interest in granting or denying a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We conclude, first, that Defendants are not likely to succeed on the merits of their appeal. The Appropriations Clause of the Constitution provides that \"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\" U.S. Const. art I., \u00a7 9, cl. 7. Defendants assert that, through section 8005, Congress authorized DoD to reprogram the funds at issue. We agree with Plaintiffs, however, that the requirements of section 8005 have not been met. Specifically, the need for which the funds were reprogrammed was not \"unforeseen,\" and it was an item for which funds were previously \"denied by the Congress.\" Defendants do not argue that their contrary interpretation of section 8005 is entitled to any form of administrative deference, and we hold that no such deference would be appropriate in any event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because section 8005 did not authorize DoD to reprogram the funds-and Defendants do not and cannot argue that any other statutory or constitutional provision authorized the reprogramming-the use of those funds violates the constitutional requirement that the Executive Branch not spend money absent an appropriation from Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants contend that these Plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail because they lack a cause of action through which to challenge the reprogramming. We disagree. Plaintiffs either have an equitable cause of action to enjoin a constitutional violation, or they can proceed on their constitutional claims under the Administrative Procedure\n   Act, or both. To the extent any zone of interests test were to apply to Plaintiffs' constitutional claims, we hold that it would be satisfied here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Considering the remaining factors relevant to Defendants' request for a stay-the degree of hardship that may result from a stay or its denial, and the public interest at stake-we are not persuaded that a stay should be entered. There is a strong likelihood that Plaintiffs will prevail in this litigation, and Defendants have a correspondingly low likelihood of success on appeal. As for the public interest, we conclude that it is best served by respecting the Constitution's assignment of the power of the purse to Congress, and by deferring to Congress's understanding of the public interest as reflected in its repeated denial of more funding for border barrier construction. We therefore hold that a stay of the district court's order granting Plaintiffs an injunction is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual &amp; Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   President Trump has made numerous requests to Congress for funding for construction of a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border. In his proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2018, for example, the President requested $2.6 billion for border security, including \"funding to plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border.\" Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget, Exec. Office of the President,\n   <em>\n    Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2018\n   </em>\n   , at 18 (2017). Congress partially obliged, allocating in the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act $1.571 billion for border fencing, \"border barrier planning and design,\" and the \"acquisition and deployment of border security technology.\" Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, div. F, tit.

Throughout 2018, House and Senate lawmakers introduced numerous bills that would have authorized or appropriated additional billions for border barrier construction. Specifically, Congress considered and rejected the Securing America's Future Act of 2018, H.R. 4760, 115th Cong. \u00a7 1111 (2018) (instructing the Secretary of Homeland Security to take necessary actions to build a physical barrier on the southern border); the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2018, H.R. 6136, 115th Cong. \u00a7 5101 (2018) (appropriating $16.625 billion for a border wall); the American Border Act, H.R. 6415, 115th Cong. \u00a7 4101 (2018) (same); the Fund and Complete the Border Wall Act, H.R. 6657, 115th Cong. \u00a7 2 (2018) (creating a \"Secure the Southern Border Fund\" for appropriations for border barrier construction); the Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act of 2018, H.R. 7059, 115th Cong. \u00a7 9 (2018) (again, appropriating $16.625 billion for a \"border wall system\"); the 50 Votes for the Wall Act, H.R. 7073, 115th Cong. \u00a7 2 (2018) (establishing a \"Border Wall and Security Trust Fund\" of up to $25 billion to \"construct a wall (including physical barriers and associated detection technology, roads, and lighting)\" along the U.S.-Mexico border); and the WALL Act of 2018, S. 3713, 115th Cong. \u00a7 2 (2018) (appropriating $25 billion for the construction of a border wall). Lawmakers spent countless hours considering these various proposals, but none ultimately passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The situation reached an impasse in December 2018. During negotiations with Congress over an appropriations bill to fund various parts of the federal government for the remainder of the fiscal year, the President announced his unequivocal position that \"any measure that funds the government must include border security.\" C-SPAN,\n   <em>\n    Farm Bill Signing\n   </em>\n   (Dec. 20, 2018), https://www.c-span.org/video/?456189-1/president-government-funding-bill-include-money-border-wall.

On December 20, 2018, the House of Representatives passed a continuing resolution that allocated $5.7 billion in border barrier funding.

The new projects, El Centro Project 1 and Tucson Sector Projects 1, 2, and 3, are located in California and Arizona. Around the same time, the President indicated that he expected to approve additional projects using funds authorized by the national emergency declaration pursuant to section 2808, although no concrete action has been taken in that regard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White House Memorandum on Sequencing of Border Barrier Construction Authorities (Mar. 4, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On February 19, 2019, the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition filed a lawsuit against Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States; Patrick M. Shanahan, in his official capacity as Acting Secretary of Defense; Kirstjen M. Nielsen, in her official capacity as Secretary of Homeland Security; and Steven Mnuchin, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Treasury (collectively, \"Defendants,\"\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   n.1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This lawsuit followed closely on the heels of a related action brought by a coalition of states against the same group of Defendants and others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs are two nonprofit organizations who sued on behalf of themselves and their members. The Sierra Club is dedicated to enjoyment of the outdoors and environmental protection, and it engages in advocacy and public education on issues such as habitat destruction, land use, and the human and environmental impact of construction projects, including the proposed construction of the border barrier. SBCC is a program of Alliance San Diego that brings together organizations from California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas to promote policies aimed at improving\n   the quality of life in border communities, including border enforcement and immigration reform policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs' operative Complaint alleges that Defendants exceeded the scope of their constitutional and statutory authority by spending money in excess of what Congress allocated for border security; that Defendants' actions violated separation of powers principles as well as the Appropriations Clause and Presentment Clause of the Constitution; and that Defendants failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204321\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .

Plaintiffs also allege that they participated in the legislative process by \"devot[ing] substantial staff and other resources towards legislative advocacy leading up to the appropriations bill passed by Congress in February 2019, specifically directed towards securing Congress's denial of substantial funding to the border wall.\" The Complaint requests declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to prevent construction of the border barrier using the funding at issue in the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On April 4, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, asking the district court to enter a \"preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants and all persons associated with them from taking action to build a border wall using funds or resources from the Defense Department; and specifically enjoining construction of the wall segments in the ... 'Yuma Sector Projects 1 and 2 and El Paso Sector Project 1 [areas].' \" In particular, Plaintiffs moved to enjoin Defendants from using DoD's reprogramming authority in section 8005 to transfer funds from Army personnel into the counterdrug appropriations line, from subsequently using section 284 to divert those funds from DoD's counterdrug appropriations line to be used by DHS for border barrier construction, from invoking section 2808 to divert funds appropriated to military construction projects, and from taking any further action before complying with NEPA's procedural requirements. Plaintiffs argued that a preliminary injunction was necessary because Defendants had already diverted funds, and that Plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed if Defendants proceeded with their threatened construction during the pendency of the district court proceedings. After receiving briefing from both sides, the district court held a multiple-hour hearing on May 17, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On May 24, the district court issued an order granting the motion in part and denying it in part.\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Defendants implored our court to act as quickly as possible because they were incurring daily fees and penalties from contractors due to the suspension of construction and because, if the injunction remained in place, Defendants would need to begin the process of reprogramming the funds again by the end of June or else face the risk of being deprived of the use of those funds entirely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Initial briefing on the stay motion was completed on June 14, and we heard oral argument on June 20. On June 24, we requested supplemental briefing from the parties on issues that arose during oral argument but that had not been briefed. That briefing was completed on June 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Meanwhile, proceedings continued in the district court. On May 29, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a supplemental preliminary injunction to block the additional planned construction in California and Arizona using funds reprogrammed under sections 8005 and 9002 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2019, as well as section 1512 of the 2019 NDAA. Plaintiffs acknowledged that the motion \"present[ed] virtually identical legal questions regarding whether the proposed plan for funding border barrier construction exceeds the Executive Branch's lawful authority\" to the ones that the court had decided in its May 24 order granting in part Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. On June 12, 2019, Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment,\n   seeking a permanent injunction based on the same arguments made in their initial and supplemental motions for a preliminary injunction. Defendants cross-moved for summary judgment, resting on the same arguments they had made against the preliminary injunction. Briefing on those motions was completed on June 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On June 28, the district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, and denying Defendants' cross-motion for partial summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Cal. June 28, 2019). In that order, the court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from using reprogrammed funds to construct a border barrier in the El Paso and Yuma Sectors (the subject of the initial preliminary injunction) as well as the more recently-announced El Centro and Tucson Sector areas (the subject of the motion for a supplemental preliminary injunction).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.

The court heeded Defendants' request to certify the judgment for immediate appeal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), and it denied Defendants' request to stay the injunction pending appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants filed an immediate notice of appeal from that decision. At Defendants' request, we consolidated their new appeal with the pending appeal of the preliminary injunction. Defendants now seek a stay of the permanent injunction pending appeal, resting on the same arguments they made about the preliminary injunction because the underlying legal questions are identical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues Not Before the Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Before turning to the merits, we highlight what is not at issue in this appeal. First, Defendants at oral argument acknowledged that they are \"not challenging [Article III] standing for purposes of the stay motion.\" Thus, Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs have suffered an \"actual or imminent,\" \"concrete and particularized,\" \"injury in fact\" that is \"fairly traceable\" to Defendants' actions and that will \"likely\" be \"redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

If Defendants were correct that section 8005 allowed this spending reallocation, Plaintiffs' claim would fail, because the spending would be consistent with Congress's appropriation legislation. If section 8005 does not authorize the reallocation, however, then Defendants are acting outside of any statutory appropriation and are therefore spending funds contrary to Congress's appropriations decisions. We believe Plaintiffs are correct that there is no statutory appropriation for the expenditures that are the subject of the injunction. Reprogramming and spending those funds therefore violates the Appropriations Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Section 8005's Meaning\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendants argue that they are likely to prevail on appeal because Congress has authorized DoD to reprogram funds, the planned use of funds is consistent with that reprogramming authorization, and this spending is therefore authorized by an\n   appropriation from Congress as the Appropriations Clause requires. We disagree. DoD's proposed expenditures are not authorized by the applicable reprogramming statute. They therefore are not \"in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   At bottom, this constitutional issue turns on a question of statutory interpretation. Section 8005 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2019 provides that the Secretary of Defense may reprogram funds for certain military functions other than those for which they were initially appropriated, but it limits the Secretary's ability to do so to a narrow set of circumstances.

Defendants assert in response, without citation, that \"[a]n expenditure is 'unforeseen' ... if DoD was not aware of the specific need when it made its budgeting requests.\" Defendants contend that DoD could not have foreseen the \"need to provide support\" to DHS for border barrier construction in the relevant sectors when it made its budget requests for 2019, before DHS's own budget was even finalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendants mistakenly focus on the assertion that DoD \"could not have anticipated that DHS would request specific support for roads, fences, and lighting.\" Even assuming that is true, the fact remains that DHS came to DoD for funds because Congress refused to grant DHS itself those funds. And when properly viewed as applying to the broader \"requirement\" of a border wall, not to DHS's specific need to turn to an entity other than Congress for funds, it is not credible that DoD did not foresee this requirement. The long history of the President's efforts to build a border barrier and of Congress's refusing to appropriate the funds he requested makes it implausible that this need was unforeseen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. \"Denied by the Congress\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Even if there could be doubt about how to interpret \"unforeseen,\" it is clear that\n   Congress denied this request. Because each of section 8005's conditions must be satisfied for DoD's reprogramming and spending to be constitutionally permissible, this conclusion alone undermines Defendants' likelihood of success on the merits on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendants urge that \"an 'item for which funds are requested' \" refers to \"a\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   budget item\" for section 8005 purposes, so \"Congress's decisions with respect to DHS's more general request for border-wall funding [are] irrelevant.\" But this interpretation, which would require that a specific funding request be explicitly rejected by Congress, is not compatible with the plain text of section 8005. First, the statute refers to \"item[s] ... denied by the Congress,\" not to\n   <em>\n    funding requests\n   </em>\n   denied by the Congress, suggesting that the inquiry centers on what DoD wishes to spend the funds on, not on the form in which Congress considered whether to permit such spending. Second, Defendants give the term \"denied\" a meaning other than its \"ordinary, contemporary, and common\" one.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Iverson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11809656,11809570\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/162/1015/\">\n    162 F.3d 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1022 (9th Cir. 1998). In common usage, a general denial of something requested can, and in this case does, encompass more specific or narrower forms of that request. To illustrate, if someone offered a new job asks her potential future employer for a larger compensation package than was included in the job offer and the request is denied, she has been denied a five percent higher salary even if her request did not specifically ask for that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As the district court noted, Defendants' reading of section 8005 also would produce the perverse result that DoD could, by declining to present Congress with a particular line item to deny, reprogram funds for a purpose that Congress refused to grant another agency elsewhere in the budgeting process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, it would simply invite creative repackaging. But putting a gift in different wrapping paper does not change the gift. Identifying the request to Congress as having come previously from DHS instead of from DoD does not change what funding was requested for: a wall along the southern border.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Construing section 8005 with an eye towards the ordinary and common-sense meaning of \"denied,\" real-world events in the months and years leading up to the 2019 appropriations bills leave no doubt that Congress considered and denied appropriations for the border barrier construction projects that DoD now seeks to finance using its section 8005 authority. Long before the emergency declaration and DoD's reprogramming at issue here, the President made plain his desire to construct a border barrier, requesting $5.7 billion from Congress to do so. Throughout 2018, Congress considered multiple bills that would have supported construction of such a barrier; it passed none of them.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   That DoD never specifically requested from Congress the specific sums at issue here for the specific purpose of counterdrug funding at the southern border (and that Congress therefore never had cause to deny that specific request) is of no moment. The amount to be appropriated for a border barrier occupied center stage of the budgeting process for months, culminating in a prolonged government shutdown that both the Legislative and Executive Branches clearly understood as hinging on whether Congress would accede\n   to the President's request for $5.7 billion to build a border barrier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In sum, Congress considered the \"item\" at issue here-a physical barrier along the entire southern border, including in the Yuma, El Paso, Tucson, and El Centro sectors-and decided in a transparent process subject to great public scrutiny to appropriate less than the total amount the President had sought for that item. To call that anything but a \"denial\" is not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendants' Interpretation and Agency Deference\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendants did not argue in their briefing to the district court, their stay motion, or their supplemental briefing that their contrary interpretation of section 8005 is entitled to agency deference.

First, it does not appear that Congress intended to delegate to DoD the power to interpret section 8005. DoD's authorizing and appropriating statutes do not contain an explicit grant of rulemaking power to the agency. Section 8005 could suggest a potential congressional intent to delegate to DoD the authority to interpret the phrase \"higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements,\" because these are subjects about which DoD has expertise. But the same is not true of the \"denied by the Congress\" limitation, given that DoD has no clear expertise in assessing what \"denied by the Congress\" might mean. Moreover, as discussed above, Congress's intent in inserting the \"denied\n   by the Congress\" limitation in the first place was to tighten the fiscal reins and retain congressional control over the appropriations process.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   n.18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Second, the agency has not advanced its interpretation in a manner that would typically trigger review under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   .

Because DBCRA authorized unfettered discretion by the President to either approve or disapprove the package of base closures as a whole, the Court had no occasion to consider the constitutional implications of violating statutes, such as section 8005, that authorize executive action contingent on satisfaction of certain requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Dalton\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' claim is not one \"\n   <em>\n    simply\n   </em>\n   alleging that the President has exceeded his statutory authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147367\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/462/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147367\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/462/\">\n    at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147367\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/462/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n    556 U.S. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The second factor, \"whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay,\" was identified in\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   together with the first factor as \"the most critical.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Supreme Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   that the third and fourth factors-whether issuance of a stay will substantially injure other parties and where the public interest lies-\"merge when the Government is the opposing party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n    at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That case involved an application for a stay of removal by a noncitizen who was facing deportation. The motion before us presents\n   a variant on that situation. Here, it is Defendants who seek a stay, so the question whether Defendants will be irreparably injured absent a stay may, in practical terms, merge with consideration of the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Public interest is a concept to be considered broadly. The Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   , for example, that there is a public interest in \"preventing aliens from being wrongfully removed,\" but also that there is \"always a public interest in prompt execution of removal orders.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 436,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Defendants have discussed these three remaining factors together in terms of the \"equitable balance of harms.\" There is logic in that, so we will do the same, considering the respective impacts on Defendants, Plaintiffs and others interested in the proceedings, and the general public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The primary harm cited by Defendants if a stay is not granted is that a \"delay in the construction of border fencing pending appeal will create irreparable harm\" because \"deadly drugs [will] flow into this country in the interim.\" They argue that CBP has recorded over 4,000 \"drug-related events\" between border crossings in the El Paso, El Centro, Tucson, and Yuma Sectors in Fiscal Year 2018 and cites CBP's seizure of thousands of pounds of marijuana and lesser amounts of other illegal substances, including cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   We do not question in the slightest the scourge that is illegal drug trafficking and the public interest in combatting it. Our circuit includes several border states, and our courts deal with no small number of cases involving illegal drugs crossing those states' borders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Defendants have not actually spoken to the more relevant questions, however. What will be the impact of building the barriers they propose? Even more to the point, what would be the impact of delaying the construction of those barriers? If these specific leaks are plugged, will the drugs flow through somewhere else? We do not know, but the evidence before us does not support a conclusion that enjoining the construction of the proposed barriers until this appeal is fully resolved will have a significant impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   To begin with, the statistics cited by Defendants describe drug trafficking that CBP has detected with existing barriers and law enforcement efforts. They do not tell us how much gets through undetected or what additional amounts would be stopped by the proposed barriers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   As Plaintiffs point out, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration's most recent assessment, the \"majority of the [heroin] flow is through [privately operated vehicles] entering the United States at legal ports of entry, followed by tractor-trailers, where the heroin is co-mingled with legal goods.\" Drug Enforcement Admin.,\n   <em>\n    2018 National Drug Threat Assessment\n   </em>\n   19 (2018), https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/DIR-032-18% 202018% 20 NDTA% 20final% 20low% 20resolution.pdf. Only \"a small percentage of all heroin seized by [CBP] along the land border was between Ports of Entry.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Fentanyl transiting the southern border is likewise most commonly smuggled in \"multi-kilogram loads\" in vehicles crossing at legal ports of entry.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 33. Defendants have not disputed these assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   That does not lead to a conclusion that leaks should not be plugged. It does suggest, however, that Defendants' claim that failing to stay the injunction pending appeal will cause significant irreparable harm is supported by much less than meets the eye. Congress could have appropriated funds to construct these barriers if it concluded that the expenditure was in the public interest, but it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   For similar reasons, we are unmoved by Defendants' contention that \"the injunction threatens to permanently deprive DoD of its authorization to use the funds at issue to complete\" the selected projects, including \"approximately $1.1 billion it has transferred for these projects but has not yet obligated via construction contracts,\" because \"the funding will likely lapse during the appeal's pendency.\" A lapse in funding does not mean that the money will disappear from the Treasury. The country will still have that money. It could be spent in the future, including through appropriations enacted by Congress for the next fiscal year. The lapse simply means that Defendants' effort to justify spending those funds based on the appropriations act for the current fiscal year and the authority to reprogram funds under section 8005 may be thwarted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Defendants' identification of this lapse as a factor that should tip the balance of harms in their favor actually serves instead to illustrate the underlying weakness in their position. Defendants' rush to spend this money is necessarily driven by their understanding that Congress did not appropriate requested funding for these purposes in the current budget and their expectation that Congress will not authorize that spending in the next fiscal year, either. The effort by Defendants to spend this money is not consistent with Congress's power over the purse or with the tacit assessment by Congress that the spending would not be in the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Finally, Defendants maintain that a stay is necessary because DoD \"is incurring unrecoverable fees and penalties of hundreds of thousands of dollars to its contractors for each day that construction is suspended.\" But that liability resulted from Defendants' own decisions about how to proceed in the face of litigation. Plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction on April 4, 2019, and a hearing was held on May 17. When DoD awarded contracts on April 9 for El Paso Project Sector 1, and May 15 for Yuma Project Sector 1 and Tucson Project Sectors 1-3, DoD knew this litigation was pending and that the district court had been asked to enter a preliminary injunction. Placing significant weight on financial obligations that Defendants knowingly undertook would, in effect, reward them for self-inflicted wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Moving to the impacts on the Plaintiffs, Defendants denigrate those impacts as limited to \"aesthetic and recreational injuries.\" As noted above,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section II, Defendants have elected not to dispute that Plaintiffs' interests are sufficiently substantial to support Article III standing. Environmental injuries have been held sufficient in many cases to support injunctions blocking substantial government projects. The Supreme Court has observed that \"[e]nvironmental injury, by its nature, can seldom be adequately remedied by money damages and is often permanent or at least of long duration,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , irreparable. If such injury is sufficiently likely, therefore, the balance of harms will usually favor the issuance of an injunction to protect the environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Amoco Prod. Co. v.

The Constitution assigns to Congress the power of the purse. Under the Appropriations Clause, it is Congress that is to make decisions regarding how to spend taxpayer dollars. As we have explained,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section V.C.2., the Appropriations Clause serves as a check by requiring that \"not a dollar of [money in the Treasury] can be used in the payment of any thing not thus\n   previously sanctioned\" by Congress,\" as \"[a]ny other course would give to the fiscal officers a most dangerous discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Reeside v.

On the one hand, if Congress has entirely withdrawn agency discretion over the who, what, when, where, and why of agency spending, an Appropriations Clause violation may lie.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On the other hand, if Congress has merely appropriated a lump-sum\n   amount and leaves it to the agency to re-allocate funds toward a particular statutory purpose, Congress has provided such discretion to the agency that, not only could there be no\n   <em>\n    constitutional\n   </em>\n   violation, a challenger does not even have a viable \"exceeding statutory authority\" claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lincoln v.

Section 8005 operates only to authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer previously-appropriated funds between DoD accounts, based upon certain conditions and circumstances. This statute arguably protects Congress and those who would have been entitled to the funds as originally appropriated; and as a budgetary statute regarding the transfer of funds among DoD accounts, it arguably protects economic interests. Plaintiffs have not asserted that they would have been entitled to the funds but for the transfer, nor have they raised any other economic interests. Rather, they assert aesthetic, recreational, and generalized environmental interests that will be affected, not by the transfer of funds, but by the building of the border wall. Nothing in \u00a7 8005 requires that aesthetic, recreational, or environmental interests be considered before a transfer is made, nor does the statute even address such interests. At best, Plaintiffs' interests are only \"marginally related to ... the purposes implicit in the statute [such] that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit,\"\n   <em>\n    Clarke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217100\" index=\"520\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/388/\">\n    479 U.S. at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217100\" index=\"521\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/388/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and they fall outside \u00a7 8005's zone of interests. Thus, Plaintiffs may not bring this APA claim, because their interests are not protected by the relevant statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Even if we ignored the discretion \u00a7 8005 provides to the DoD and thus could reframe Plaintiffs' claim as a constitutional one, the APA's \"scope of review\" provision would cover it. Those provisions provide that a reviewing court shall:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   [H]old unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   (B)\n   <em>\n    contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"522\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (emphasis added). Where courts can review an agency action under the APA to ensure the agency has not abused its discretion, violated the Constitution, or otherwise operated outside its authority, we have no business devising additional \"equitable\" causes of action. Here, an avenue for challenging the DoD's reprogramming action exists under the APA-just not for these Plaintiffs. Thus, there is no reason to resort to the extraordinary step of implying an equitable cause of action for these Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   As the majority recognizes, \"[t]he ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal officers is the creation of courts of equity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.

We are limited to decide only whether a stay should be granted until the appeal on the merits is final. Although \"[a] stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result,\" it is \"an exercise of judicial discretion, and the propriety of its issue is dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"542\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n    556 U.S. at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"543\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations, alteration, and quotation marks omitted).

Defendants are likely correct. The funding for those projects will lapse on September 30th, and even if Defendants prevail in this court's final ruling, we could not order or permit Defendants to spend funds granted in a lapsed appropriation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    City of Houston v.

Cir. 1994). No one appears to dispute that this will likely be the practical consequence if a stay is denied. Congress may opt to appropriate new funds for these projects in the future, but that possibility is irrelevant. Simply, the permanent injunction will certainly render Defendants unable to use the funds at issue here under \u00a7 284(b)(7). Thus, there is a \"possibility that ... corrective relief will [not] be available at a later date, in the ordinary course of litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sampson v.

On the other hand, the irreparable harm to Plaintiffs during this relatively short period (if a stay is granted) is less clear. Defendants have represented to this court that the projects at issue are needed to protect national security and must go forward even if there is a possibility that a merits panel may eventually order them to remove whatever was constructed while a stay was in place.

It is difficult to determine that Plaintiffs' inability to recreate in and otherwise enjoy this public land would outweigh the claimed national interests during the limited period of time the requested stay would be in place-especially considering Plaintiffs do not have a viable cause of action to challenge Defendants' actions under \u00a7 8005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Third, the district court's reasoning that the public interest does not favor Defendants, because the public has a generalized interest in ensuring that the Executive acts within the limits imposed by statute and by the Constitution, simply begs the question. If a court accepts the premise that Defendants exceeded statutory or constitutional limitations on its authority, then the public has an interest in seeing that the Executive Branch is \"reined in.\" However, if Defendants show that they did not exceed those bounds, then the public interest articulated by Plaintiffs and the district court has no merit. Moreover, when considering whether to grant a stay, the public interest factor cannot rise or fall on how the appeal is ultimately resolved on its merits. That analysis would collapse the public interest factor into the first element of the four-part test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   In conclusion, because Defendants have more than demonstrated a substantial case on the merits, and because the second and fourth factors \"militate in [their] favor,\" we should exercise our discretion and issue a stay pending the appeal of the district court's permanent injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5522781\" index=\"565\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/859/#p863\">\n    502 F.3d at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
