At sentencing, the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   concluded that two of Parker's prior convictions-one in 2006 for second-degree robbery and another in 2010 for attempted second-degree assault-were crimes of violence under section 4B1.2(a) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (\"Guidelines\"). Based partly on these convictions, the district court concluded that Parker's offense level was 25 and that he had a category-IV criminal history. The district court sentenced Parker to a within-range term of 84 months' imprisonment. Parker timely appealed. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Parker argues that the district court erred in concluding that Missouri second-degree robbery is a crime of violence under the Guidelines. We disagree. At the time Parker was convicted, \"a person commit[ted] the crime of robbery in the second degree\" in Missouri by \"forcibly steal[ing] property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20569.030.1\">\n    Mo.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 570.025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Last year, we held that Missouri second-degree robbery is a \"violent felony\" for purposes of applying the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\") because it \"requires the use or threatened use of violent force.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Swopes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516467\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/668/#p670\">\n    886 F.3d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 670-672 (8th Cir. 2018) (en banc);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(i) (defining the term \"violent felony\" to include an offense that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\"). The definition of the term \"crime of violence\" in the Guidelines is \"nearly identical\" to that of \"violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mata\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265854\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/640/#p644\">\n    869 F.3d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644 (8th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (\"The term 'crime of violence' means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that-(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another ....\"). We therefore \"construe 'violent felony' under [the ACCA] and 'crime of violence' under the Guidelines as interchangeable.\"\n   <em>\n    Mata\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265854\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/640/#p644\">\n    869 F.3d at 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Indeed, we did so just months after\n   <em>\n    Swopes\n   </em>\n   , holding that Missouri first-degree robbery is a crime of violence under the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We likewise hold, for the reasons articulated in\n   <em>\n    Swopes\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Shine\n   </em>\n   , that Missouri second-degree robbery is a crime of violence under the Guidelines and reject Parker's first argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Parker also argues that the district court erred in concluding that his 2010 conviction for attempted second-degree assault under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20565.060.1\">\n    Mo.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 565.052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) is a crime of violence. Parker concedes that we have previously held to the contrary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We must follow our decision in\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mader v.

We therefore reject Parker's second argument and affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    The Honorable Gary A.
