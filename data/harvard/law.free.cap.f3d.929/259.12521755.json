The district court held that Crutsinger's motion was a second-or-successive petition for habeas relief within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), and therefore, that the court lacked jurisdiction. We conclude that the motion was not a successive habeas petition and therefore vacate the order of transfer. However, based on circuit precedent binding on this panel, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to treat the transfer order and Crutsinger's requests for relief in this court as a request for a certificate of appealability (COA).

The majority concludes that a COA is required and that it has no jurisdiction, but then exercises jurisdiction to determine that Crutsinger's Rule 60(b)(6) motion was not a successive habeas petition. The effect of that determination is a conclusion that the district court abused its discretion, as I state herein. However, the majority never mentions abuse of discretion. Because the majority concludes that it lacks jurisdiction to consider Crutsinger's appeal without a COA, it seems the appropriate remedy would be to remand for the district court to grant or deny a COA. Instead, the majority remands for the district court to consider the Rule 60(b)(6) motion in the first instance. But, the district court already considered the Rule 60(b)(6) motion in the first instance and determined that it is \"in actuality a second-or-successive petition for habeas relief,\" hence, the transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Regardless, I agree with the majority that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   compels the conclusion that Crutsinger's Rule 60(b)(6) motion is proper and not a successive petition.
