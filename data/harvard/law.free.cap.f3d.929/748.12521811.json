The unions worry that the FLRA cannot address all of their claims, especially their broader claims: that the President acted ultra vires or violated the Take Care Clause, the First Amendment, or the Statute in issuing the executive orders. And the unions argue that the FLRA cannot entertain suits\n   against the President. Even if true, the latter point does not appear to make FLRA review any less meaningful than district court review in this case, where the unions stated that injunctive relief against the President's subordinates in executive branch agencies was sufficient to afford them the relief they sought and the district court did not grant injunctive relief against the President.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Mot.

As already discussed, many of the claims are not so grand, but rather require interpreting the FSLMRS-the very law that the FLRA is charged with administering and\n   interpreting.

Even in the absence of constitutional expertise, an agency's expertise in other areas may still weigh in favor of administrative review if the agency could \"obviate the need to address\" broad constitutional and statutory claims by resolving a case on other grounds or if the agency could \"alleviate constitutional concerns\" through its interpretation of its statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406976\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406976\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/1/\">\n    at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Elgin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406976\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/1/\">\n    567 U.S. at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406976\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/1/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of La.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520605\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/919/916/#p925\">\n    919 F.3d at 929-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
