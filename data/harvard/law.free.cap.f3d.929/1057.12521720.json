Because the district court's analysis was inconsistent with the constitutional principles the Supreme Court delineated in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and subsequent case law, we vacate Briones's sentence and remand to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Briones grew up on the Salt River Indian Reservation in Arizona. As a child, Briones endured physical abuse from his father, Riley Briones, Sr., and was introduced to drugs and alcohol at age 11. Briones was a fairly good student and he aspired to attend college. After he and his girlfriend had a child while still in high school, however, he dropped out to take a full-time position in an apprentice program, training to be a heavy equipment operator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Briones, his father, and his brother Ricardo founded a gang called the Eastside Crips Rolling 30's. While still a teenager, Briones planned and participated in a number of violent, gang-related crimes on the Reservation. The most serious of these\n   crimes was the robbery of a Subway restaurant in May 1994, when Briones was seventeen years old. Although Ricardo came up with the idea, Briones agreed to the plan and drove four of the gang's members to the restaurant to carry it out. Briones remained in the car as the getaway driver while the others went inside and ordered food from the lone employee, Brian Lindsey. As the food was being prepared, the only armed member of the cohort left the restaurant, spoke to Briones, then reentered the store and shot Lindsey as he stood at the front counter, killing him. The gang members grabbed their food and a bag of money and ran back to Briones's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Briones was arrested on December 21, 1995. He was charged with \"first degree/felony murder\" for the Subway robbery, and also charged with arson, assault, and witness tampering because of other gang-related offenses. Briones's father and brother were among the five co-defendants. The government extended pre-trial plea offers of twenty years in prison to all five defendants, but Briones's father was \"adamant\" that neither he nor either of his sons should accept the deal. Briones rejected the government's offer, went to trial, and was convicted on all charges. For the felony murder conviction, he was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June of 2012, the Supreme Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits sentencing schemes that mandate life in prison without the possibility of parole for juvenile defendants.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p465\">\n    567 U.S. at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p465\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   explained that sentencing courts must consider the unique social and psychological characteristics of juvenile offenders because \"hallmark features\" of youth reduce the penological justifications for imposing LWOP sentences on juveniles.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 477-80,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p465\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ct. at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By the time the district court resentenced Briones in March 2016, he was almost forty years old and he had served nearly eighteen years in prison without a single infraction of prison rules. In addition to maintaining a perfect disciplinary\n   record, Briones held a job in food service; volunteered to speak with young inmates about how to change their lives; completed his GED; and, in 1999 (sixteen years before his resentencing), married Carmelita, the woman he had been dating since high school and with whom he had a daughter. By all accounts, and as even the government conceded, Briones had been a model inmate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Briones cited\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   extensively in the memorandum he filed in anticipation of the resentencing hearing, and he asked the district court to impose a sentence of 360 months in accordance with the factors identified in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and his extensive history of rehabilitative efforts. In his testimony at the resentencing hearing, Briones expressed \"[g]rief, regret, sorrow, pain, sufferings\" for his crimes and for Lindsey's death. He described how he was haunted by his actions, and he apologized to his own family and to the victim's family. Briones's counsel argued that a life sentence would be \"unconstitutional in violation of\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\" and that the presumption in Briones's case should be\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   a life sentence because\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   requires that LWOP be the exception rather than the rule. The government contended that Briones had not accepted responsibility because, when he was interviewed in advance of the second sentencing hearing, Briones contested some aspects of the PSR's description of his responsibilities in the gang. But Briones did not dispute the role he played in the Subway robbery and murder, even saying at one point in his testimony that it was \"probably [his] fault\" that the robbery was not called off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court's sentencing remarks were quite brief; its justification for reimposing LWOP comprised less than two pages of transcript. The court considered the PSR and letters written on Briones's behalf, the parties' sentencing memoranda, the transcript of the previous sentencing hearing, and the victim questionnaire. The court began with the Sentencing Guidelines calculation-which yielded a life sentence-and then stated: \"in mitigation I do consider the history of the abusive father, the defendant's youth, immaturity, his adolescent brain at the time, and the fact that it was impacted by regular and constant abuse of alcohol and other drugs, and he's been a model inmate up to now.\" The district court acknowledged that \"[a]ll indications are that defendant was bright and articulate\" and that \"he has improved himself while he's been in prison,\" but the court described Briones's role in the Subway robbery as \"be[ing] the pillar of strength for the people involved to make sure they executed the plan.\" The court stated that \"some decisions have lifelong consequences\" and reimposed a life sentence. Because there is no parole in the federal system, the parties agree that Briones's life sentence is effectively LWOP.\n   <em>\n    See Sentencing Reform Act of 1984\n   </em>\n   , Pub. L.

Accordingly, when courts consider\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's central inquiry, they must reorient the sentencing analysis to a forward-looking assessment of the defendant's capacity for change or propensity for incorrigibility, rather than a backward-focused review of the defendant's criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based on the district court's articulated reasoning at Briones's resentencing, we cannot tell whether the district court appropriately considered the relevant evidence of Briones's youth or the evidence of his post-incarceration efforts at rehabilitation. The district court described Briones's crime and his history of gang-related violence, identified certain factors it considered \"in mitigation,\" and stated that \"some decisions have lifelong consequences.\" In this way, the district court's sentencing remarks focused on the punishment warranted by the terrible crime Briones participated in, rather than whether Briones was irredeemable. The district court's statement that it considered some factors in \"mitigation\" suggests that the district court applied the Guidelines and began with a presumption that LWOP would be appropriate. As we have explained, however, a sentencing court may not presume the propriety of a Guidelines sentence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702099\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/984/#p991\">\n    520 F.3d at 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , particularly in juvenile LWOP cases after\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . Rather, the Constitution requires that the court consider a juvenile offender's youthful characteristics before taking the rare step of imposing an LWOP sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Briones provided evidence related to a number of the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors at the resentencing hearing, including his abusive upbringing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   his extensive exposure to drugs and alcohol beginning when he was only eleven years old,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   his difficulty finding acceptance at his local high school because of his Native American traditions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his father's inexplicable insistence that he reject the government's favorable plea offer even though Briones faced a mandatory LWOP sentence if convicted. Briones's lawyer also argued that Briones was somewhat less culpable because he was the getaway driver, not the shooter.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 478,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p465\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Most significant, Briones offered abundant evidence on the critical issue: that he was not irreparably corrupt or irredeemable because he had done what he could to improve himself within the confines of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The eighteen years that passed between the original sentencing hearing and the resentencing hearing provide a compelling reason to credit the sincerity of Briones's efforts to rehabilitate himself. Briones was sentenced in 1997;\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   was not issued until 2012. Thus, for the first fifteen years of Briones's incarceration, his LWOP sentence left no hope that he would ever be\n   released, so the only plausible motivation for his spotless prison record was improvement for improvement's sake. This is precisely the sort of evidence of capacity for change that is key to determining whether a defendant is\n   <em>\n    permanently\n   </em>\n   incorrigible, yet the record does not show that the district court considered it. This alone requires remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pete\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253286\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/1121/\">\n    819 F.3d at 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The district court may have hesitated to fully consider Briones's post-incarceration conduct because we had not yet issued our decision in\n   <em>\n    Pete\n   </em>\n   , and because the government argued that the court had to \"make some guesses as to what Judge Broomfield would have done back [at Briones's original sentencing] had Judge Broomfield had the option of something other than a life sentence available to him.\" On this point, the government's argument missed the mark.\n   <em>\n    Pete\n   </em>\n   explained that \"whether [the juvenile offender]\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   changed in some fundamental way since [the original sentencing], and in what respects, is surely key evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253286\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/1121/\">\n    819 F.3d at 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Briones's most serious crime, committed less than one month before his eighteenth birthday, was the planned robbery and murder of a Subway employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On May 15, 1994, Briones drove four other gang members, one armed with a gun, to the Subway restaurant and waited in the vehicle while the others entered the restaurant. Prior to the murder, the gunman returned to the car and conferred with Briones, then returned to the restaurant and shot the employee in the face, and then shot him several more times as he lay injured or dying on the floor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The conspirators stole a bank bag containing $100 (plus the food that they had ordered). One testified that after they returned to the car with the proceeds, Briones instructed another to grab a rifle from the backseat and shoot a maintenance worker who had been working in front of the Subway when they arrived. Though they searched for the worker to kill him as Briones had instructed, fortunately they did not find him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Three weeks later-one day before Briones's eighteenth birthday-he and other gang members conspired to burn down the family residence of a rival gang member. Briones personally constructed the Molotov cocktails that another gang member used to firebomb the house. Luckily, the family inside-including a ten-year-old asleep on a couch-was not harmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Briones (now having reached the age of majority) and other gang members again decided to burn down the same rival gang member's home. Concerned that the fire department could thwart their plans, this time they decided to first start diversionary fires to lower the risk that the blaze at the targeted home would be prematurely contained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Briones drove other gang members to two abandoned buildings, where they started the diversionary fires. With the first step of their scheme completed, Briones then drove his co-conspirators to their rival's home, which had survived the first firebombing. Briones personally constructed the five Molotov cocktails that were used to start one of the diversionary fires and to firebomb the home, and he also provided the gasoline used to start the second diversionary fire. Many people, of course, could have been killed, including two children inside the firebombed home. Again, thankfully, no one was killed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Attempt two having failed, Briones moved on to attempt three about a month later. Briones helped plan a drive-by shooting of the same home. Though Briones was neither the driver nor the shooter, he and another gang member went to Briones's home to pick up the assault rifle used in the shooting. Afterward, Briones wiped the fingerprints off the assault rifle and directed other gang members to discard the shell casings and drop off the stolen car used in the shooting in an isolated place. Again, those inside the home during the shooting were unharmed, though not due to any lack of trying by Briones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In 1995, Briones violently assaulted a member of his gang in order to stop him from speaking to law enforcement about the Subway murder. Briones broke a beer bottle on the victim's face and pistol-whipped his head. The victim testified at trial that Briones knocked him unconscious, and when he regained consciousness, he overheard Briones and others discussing \"how they [were] going to dispose of [him].\" That victim escaped and eventually cooperated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At trial, the government presented evidence that the gang planned to blow up the Salt River Police Department and kill a tribal judge, federal prosecutors, and Salt River Police investigators. Briones and two others followed one investigator to lunch but did not shoot him because there were too many witnesses. The government also received information that at Briones's direction gang members practiced shooting at objects from a hilltop to simulate shooting from the roofs of buildings near the federal building. The government received information that while in jail, Briones carved gang graffiti into the door of a jail cell and discussed plans to escape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Briones was convicted of all charged offenses, including felony murder, arson, assault, and witness tampering. At his original sentencing in July 1997, almost three years after the Subway murder, Briones continued to deny responsibility for his crimes. The district court sentenced Briones to the then-mandatory guidelines sentence of life imprisonment without parole on the felony murder count.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Briones's original sentence was vacated in light of\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

During resentencing, Briones argued that the sentencing guidelines, which recommend a life sentence in his case, should be set aside under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . He also argued that an appropriate sentence would be 360 months \"based on the evidence in mitigation\" he would present, including relating to the \"hallmarks of youth\" identified by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The resentencing record before the district court was comprehensive. It included the transcript of Briones's original sentencing, resentencing memoranda submitted by the parties, testimony from Briones and his wife at the resentencing hearing, arguments from counsel during the resentencing hearing, the presentence report (PSR)-which had been revised to include new information since Briones's incarceration-and letters on behalf of Briones and the victim questionnaires that were attached to the PSR. The district court adopted the findings in the PSR, and Briones made no objections to the PSR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After considering all of the information in the record, the district court determined that a life without parole sentence was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [I]n mitigation I do consider the history of the abusive father, the defendant's youth, immaturity, his adolescent brain at the time, and the fact that it was impacted by regular and constant abuse of alcohol and other drugs, and he's been a model inmate up to now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   However, some decisions have lifelong consequences. This robbery was planned, maybe not by the defendant but he took over and was all in once the plan was developed. He drove everybody there. He appeared to be the pillar of strength for the people involved to make sure they executed the plan. The murder of the clerk was planned. It wasn't an accident, it wasn't unexpected. Although the defendant did not pull the trigger, he was in the middle of the whole thing. He stayed in the car, apparently, to avoid responsibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   And circumstantially, at least, it appears that defendant was involved in the\n   final decision to kill the young clerk. Eschief came out to the car and spoke to him and walked right back in and shot him in the head. He spoke to the defendant right before he pulled the trigger. I don't know what other conclusion can be drawn than that the defendant was involved in the final decision and encouraged the shooter to pull the trigger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   All indications are that defendant was bright and articulate, he has improved himself while he's been in prison, but he was the leader of a gang that terrorized the Salt River Reservation community and surrounding area for several years. The gang was violent and cold-blooded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Having considered those things and all the evidence I've heard today and everything I've read, ... it's the judgment of the Court that [Briones] is hereby committed to the Bureau of Prisons for a sentence of life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Briones argues that, under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the district court committed constitutional error by imposing a life without parole sentence.

First, there is no doubt that the district court was fully aware of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's requirements. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   was the sole reason Briones was resentenced. The parties' memoranda cited\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   throughout. Briones's memorandum explicitly set forth the \"hallmarks of youth\" that the court must consider before imposing a life without parole sentence, and the government's memorandum, quoting\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , highlighted that the court's task was to consider whether Briones's crimes reflect \"unfortunate yet transient immaturity\" or \"irreparable corruption.\" And during the resentencing hearing, counsel for both parties focused their arguments on\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   With the correct standards in mind, the district court did exactly what\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   requires-it considered Briones's \"youth and attendant characteristics.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p465\">\n    567 U.S. at 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p465\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We know this because the district court explicitly stated that it considered Briones's \"youth, immaturity, [and] adolescent brain at the time,\" and other evidence attendant to his youth, including \"the history of [his] abusive father\" and Briones's \"constant abuse of alcohol and other drugs.\" We also know that the district court considered Briones's post-incarceration efforts at rehabilitation because the court expressly stated that Briones has \"been a model inmate up to now\" and \"[Briones] has improved himself while he's been in prison.\" The district court further stated that it adopted the findings in the PSR, which contained information about Briones's youth and post-incarceration rehabilitation efforts. Thus, contrary to the majority's opinion, the district court very clearly considered Briones's youth, youth-related characteristics, and post-incarceration rehabilitation efforts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The district court therefore was aware of and applied the appropriate standards announced in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . The record also supports that the district court imposed a permissible sentence. The district court found that Briones was a founding member and leader of an extraordinarily violent gang.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The robbery and murder of the Subway employee was planned and brutal. Although Briones did not pull the trigger, as the district court found, he \"was involved in the final decision [to kill the employee] and encouraged the shooter to pull the trigger.\" Moreover, he was only twenty-three days shy of his eighteenth birthday when he participated in the murder and instructed his subordinates to murder a witness. And the day before his eighteenth birthday he firebombed a home without any regard for the death and damage it might cause. Even after he reached the age of majority, he risked wide-scale death and destruction through another firebombing, a drive-by shooting, and gang leadership. Many could have died from his actions-only one was proven to have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Though Briones had the opportunity to express remorse at his original sentencing three years after the murder, he continued to deny responsibility for his crimes. During the resentencing hearing, government counsel stated that he had met with Briones\n   <em>\n    the day before the hearing\n   </em>\n   -almost twenty-two years after the murder-and even then Briones failed to accept responsibility and minimized his role in the murder and within the gang. When Briones testified at his resentencing hearing, he still maintained that he was \"surprised\" when he heard the gunshots that killed the Subway employee, and still denied that he was a leader in the gang. The district court's factual findings to the contrary were not clearly erroneous. When deciding to impose a sentence of life without parole, the district court expressly stated that it considered this information: \"Having considered ... all the evidence I've heard today [during the resentencing\n   hearing] and everything I've read ... [Briones] is hereby committed to the Bureau of Prisons for a sentence of life.\" As there is no requirement under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   that the district court make any specific findings before imposing a life without parole sentence, there is no error here-constitutional, plain, or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Thus, despite evidence of Briones's rehabilitation, youth when the heinous crimes were committed, and youth-related characteristics, the record supports that Briones's crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility, as opposed to transient immaturity. The district court therefore imposed a permissible sentence. Notably, the majority does not conclude that a life without parole sentence is impermissible in this case. Instead, although the majority claims otherwise, the majority's opinion vacates the district court's sentence because the district court failed to find that Briones was permanently incorrigible. But as discussed above, there is no requirement for the district court to make any specific findings before imposing a life without parole sentence. In short, the majority, citing\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , states that it \"do[es] not suggest the district court erred simply by failing to use any specific words,\" Maj. at ----. But in clear contravention of\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , that is precisely why it has reversed. We remand for the district court to do again what it has already done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Because the district court complied with\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's requirements and imposed a permissible sentence supported by the record, I would affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The Presentence Report (PSR) reflects other very serious criminal conduct. It describes Briones providing Molotov cocktails for gang members to throw at the homes of rival gang members; planting diversionary fires to occupy the authorities; planning a shooting; covering up a separate drive-by shooting; assaulting a gang member who knew about the Subway murder; and discussing plans to blow up the Salt River Police Department and kill a tribal judge, federal prosecutors, and Salt River Police investigators.
