The district courts determined they were subject to the career offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the Guidelines because their prior convictions under \u00a7 124.401 were \"controlled substance offenses.\" This significantly increased their advisory guidelines ranges. The district court also determined that one of Green's two convictions under \u00a7 124.401 qualified as a prior \"felony drug offense\" under the CSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (44).

The Iowa statute at issue provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   it is unlawful for any person to manufacture, deliver, or possess with the intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance, a counterfeit substance, or a simulated controlled substance, or to act with, enter into a common scheme or design with, or conspire with one or more other persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess with the intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance, a counterfeit substance, or a simulated controlled substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20124.401\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 124.401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). Raising an issue of first impression in this circuit, defendants argue that\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   conviction under this statute can be a predicate prior conviction under the ACCA, the CSA, or the career offender guidelines because aiding and abetting liability is inherent in the definition of all drug offenses, and Iowa's doctrine of aiding and abetting is broader than \"the generic definition of aiding and abetting.\" More specifically, defendants argue that a \"vast majority of relevant authorities -- the federal courts, 45 state jurisdictions, and the Model Penal Code -- [hold] that a defendant cannot be convicted on an aiding and abetting theory on only a 'knowledge'\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   .\" By contrast, Iowa is one of the few States that \"only requires mere knowledge that one's actions will facilitate a crime.\" Because \"knowledge\" is a lesser\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   than \"intent,\" defendants posit, \"it follows, with respect to aiding and abetting liability, that Iowa \u00a7 124.401 is broader than\" drug offenses as defined in\n   the ACCA, the CSA, or the career offender guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the determination that a prior conviction qualifies as a sentence enhancing predicate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Analytical Framework.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In determining whether a prior \u00a7 124.401 conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for purposes of these federal sentencing enhancements, we apply a categorical approach that looks to the statutory definition of the prior offense, not to the facts underlying a defendant's prior convictions.\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

In\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the Court considered whether a burglary conviction fell within the ACCA provision defining violent felony to include certain enumerated offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii) (\"is burglary\").

The argument was \"teed up,\" in defendants' view, by the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   that \"every jurisdiction -- all States and the Federal Government -- has expressly abrogated the distinction among principals and aiders and abettors.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p189\">\n    549 U.S. 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 189,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p189\">\n    127 S.Ct. 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p189\">\n    166 L.Ed.2d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (quotation omitted).

When it included \"aiding and abetting\" offenses in the career offender definition of a \"controlled substance offense,\" the Commission was surely aware that, \"because the difference between acting purposefully (when that concept is properly understood) and acting knowingly is slight, this is not a matter of great concern.\"\n    <em>\n     Rosemond\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707001\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/65/#p76\">\n     572 U.S. at 85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707001,12578373\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1240/\">\n     134 S.Ct. 1240\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Alito, J., dissenting) (2014);\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Duenas-Alvarez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p189\">\n     549 U.S. at 193\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p189\">\n     127 S.Ct. 815\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a more expansive concept of \"intent\" must \"extend significantly beyond the concept as set forth in the cases of other States\" to create a state crime that is outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute). Thus, I conclude that the Commission's simple inclusion of \"aiding and abetting\" offenses in Application Note 1 is best viewed as a decision that the slight\n    <em>\n     mens rea\n    </em>\n    difference between knowing and intentional participation in a drug offense does not affect whether a conviction was for an offense \"that prohibits\" that conduct.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
