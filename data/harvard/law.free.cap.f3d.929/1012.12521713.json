Shockley sued PrimeLending, alleging a violation of the\n   Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The district court denied the motion to compel arbitration because there was no agreement to arbitrate between Shockley and PrimeLending. The district court held that the arbitration provision contained in the PrimeLending Handbook Addendum (\"Handbook\"), and the delegation provision therein, were not enforceable contracts. We agree with the district court that Shockley and PrimeLending never entered into a contract relating to either provision. Therefore, we affirm the denial of PrimeLending's motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shockley\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was employed by PrimeLending from June 2016 to July 2017. PrimeLending maintained a computer network accessible by its employees, which contained employment-related information, such as its new hire policies and Handbook. In August 2016, Shockley accessed this section of PrimeLending's network by using a computer mouse to click and open various company documents, including the Handbook. Clicking on the Handbook in the system automatically generated an acknowledgment of review. That same click would have generated a pop-up window containing a hyperlink to open the full text of the Handbook. Shockley does not recall reviewing the Handbook, and there is no evidence that she ever opened or reviewed the Handbook's full text. As part of her required annual policy review, Shockley completed the same process in the computer network again in February 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Handbook contains two important provisions relevant to this case: the \"Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Clause\" (\"arbitration provision\") and the \"\n   <em>\n    Control of Decisions\n   </em>\n   \" provision (\"delegation provision\"), which is a subpart within the arbitration provision. The arbitration provision specifically includes FLSA disputes as subject to arbitration. In pertinent part, the arbitration provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   If the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation, you and the Company agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the covered dispute exclusively through final and binding arbitration in accordance with the terms, conditions and procedures of this Arbitration Clause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   For all Covered Disputes, both you and the Company waive their right to trial by jury or before a judge in a court of law, including the right to initiate a class, collective, representative or private attorney general action. All Covered Disputes will be settled by binding arbitration, on an individual basis, pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act as administered by JAMS, a third party alternative dispute resolution provider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Def.'s Reply Suggestion in Support of Its Mot. to Compel Individual Arbitration, Ex.

Mo., Jan. 12, 2018). The court also noted that a party seeking to compel arbitration and enforce any part of an arbitration agreement, including a delegation provision, must prove an arbitration agreement was validly formed under state contract law. The district court found that the parties did not form an enforceable agreement to arbitrate their disputes. Consequently, the court declined to interpret the arbitration and delegation provisions contained in the Handbook. Specifically, the district court decided that furnishing an employee a Handbook that could be modified unilaterally by PrimeLending did not constitute an offer; secondly, the court determined that even if it was an offer, merely reviewing a Handbook does not constitute acceptance. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Nebraska Machinery Co. v.

Arbitration is a matter of contract law, and favored status notwithstanding, parties cannot be compelled to arbitrate unless they have contractually agreed to be bound by arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howsam v.

The primary inquiry, therefore, is to determine whether the parties formed a valid contract that binds them to arbitrate their dispute.

Thus, she was aware of the terms of PrimeLending's purported contract offer. \"We are aware of no legal authority holding that an employee's general knowledge or awareness of the existence of a contract constitutes the positive and unambiguous unequivocal acceptance required under Missouri law.\"\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318717\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/347/533/#p545\">\n    347 S.W.3d at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted). Shockley\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have reviewed the delegation clause, but on these facts, it is entirely possible that she never even saw it. Even assuming the delegation provision, as presented, constitutes an offer, Shockley's document review, and the subsequent system-generated acknowledgment, does not create an unequivocal acceptance; therefore, no contract was created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Applying Missouri contract law, we conclude Shockley's mere review of the subject materials did not constitute an acceptance on her part. Without an acceptance, no contract was formed as to the delegation provision. An acknowledgment of a review of offered terms alone does not evince an intent to accept those terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182198\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/283/#p287\">\n    497 S.W.3d at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because a valid contract cannot lack any one element, the failure to find acceptance is dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We hold that the delegation clause is invalid. An arbitration agreement lacking a valid delegation clause leaves the remaining arbitration agreement, as a whole, open to review for validity. We now turn to that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Arbitration Provision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We need not engage in an in-depth review of the arbitration provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The arbitration provision is a standalone and independent contract from the delegation provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soars\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658331\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/563/111/#p114\">\n    563 S.W.3d at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Its validity requires the same proof of the elements of a valid contract as the delegation provision.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The terms of the arbitration provision are presented in the Handbook by the same hyperlink mechanism. It thus suffers from the same fatal flaw as the delegation provision and thus fails for the very same reasons. The absence of proof of unequivocal acceptance of an agreement to arbitrate renders the provision unenforceable. Shockley did no more to accept the arbitration provision than she did to accept the delegation provision. Therefore, we determine that the arbitration provision was not a validly formed contract due to a lack of acceptance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The decision of the district court is affirmed. Shockley did not contract with PrimeLending to arbitrate any disputes between them, nor was a contract formed to delegate this decision to an arbitrator; therefore, PrimeLending cannot compel Shockley into arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Honorable Dean Whipple, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Shockley filed suit individually and on behalf of others similarly situated to her. No collective action has been certified, so we refer only to Shockley in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
