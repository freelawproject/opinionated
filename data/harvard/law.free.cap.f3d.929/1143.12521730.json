Because of these hostilities, the plaintiffs, Universal Cable Productions, LLC, and Northern Entertainment Productions, LLC (collectively \"Universal\"), moved the production of their television series\n   <em>\n    Dig\n   </em>\n   out of Jerusalem. Universal incurred significant\n   expenses during this move and filed an insurance claim for coverage of those costs under a television production insurance policy (the \"Policy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Universal's insurer, defendant Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company (\"Atlantic\"), denied coverage, stating that although the Policy covered expenses related to terrorism, the hostilities were excluded from coverage. Atlantic relied on the Policy's war exclusions, which excluded coverage for expenses resulting from \"war,\" \"warlike action by a military force,\" or \"insurrection, rebellion, [or] revolution.\" Atlantic concluded that Hamas' actions were excluded acts of war.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Universal responded that these war exclusions did not apply because the terms had a specialized meaning in the insurance context. Specifically, \"war\" and \"warlike action by a military force\" required hostilities between de jure or de facto sovereigns. Universal argued that Hamas was not acting as a sovereign, and thus its actions were not excluded from coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The district court granted summary judgment to Atlantic and held that, instead of the specialized meanings of \"war\" and \"warlike action,\" the relevant definitions were the ordinary and plain meanings of each term. The district court held that under its interpretation, Hamas' actions clearly constituted \"war\" and \"warlike action by a military force,\" rather than acts of terrorism. Based on its interpretation of those two exclusions, the district court also granted summary judgment to Atlantic on Universal's bad faith claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although this case concerns the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and hostilities between different factions in the region, the legal analysis boils down to simple contractual interpretation. Section 1644 of the California Civil Code requires us to apply the specialized meaning of a term - instead of the plain, ordinary meaning - when that specialized meaning has been developed from customary usage in a given industry and when both parties have constructive notice of that usage. Both \"war\" and \"warlike action by a military force\" have a specialized meaning in the insurance context and the parties had, at the least, constructive notice of the meaning. The district court erred when it failed to apply that meaning. Under that specialized meaning, both \"war\" and \"warlike action by a military force\" require hostilities between either de jure or de facto sovereigns, and Hamas constitutes neither.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Atlantic on the first two war exclusions and hold that Atlantic breached its contract when it denied coverage by defining Hamas' conduct as \"war\" or \"warlike action by a military force.\" Because the district court did not address the third war exclusion - whether Hamas' actions constituted \"insurrection, rebellion, or revolution\" - we remand for the district court to address that question in the first instance. The district court's grant of Atlantic's motion for summary judgment on Universal's bad faith claim turned on its erroneous analysis of the first two war exclusions; accordingly, we vacate the grant of summary judgment on Universal's bad faith claim and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the period from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, Atlantic issued a television production insurance policy to Universal. The Policy covered losses that are \"a direct result of an unexpected, sudden or accidental occurrence entirely beyond your control to include ... [i]mminent peril, defined as certain, immediate and impending danger of such probability and severity to persons or property that it would be unreasonable or unconscionable to ignore.\" The Policy, which was negotiated before December 2013, covered loss caused by terrorism if that loss was not otherwise excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The relevant exclusions for our analysis are the four war exclusions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    War\n   </em>\n   , including undeclared or civil war; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Warlike action\n   </em>\n   by a military force, including action in hindering or defending against an actual or expected attack, by any government, sovereign, or other authority using military personnel or other agents; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Insurrection, rebellion, revolution\n   </em>\n   , usurped power, or action taken by the governmental authority in hindering or defending against any of these. Such loss or damage is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributed concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   4. Any weapon of war including atomic fission or radioactive force, whether in time of peace or war ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Universal's broker, Aon/Albert G. Ruben Insurance Services, Inc., initially sent the first three exclusions above to Atlantic. The language was standard insurance industry form language from the Insurance Service Office, Inc.'s (\"ISO\") standard Form No. CA00200310. Atlantic subsequently edited some of the policy language and added the fourth war exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On December 3, 2013, Universal's broker emailed Atlantic about three developments: (1) noting \"that there is a production in development that is tentatively starting up in February 2014 and filming in Israel,\" specifically in \"Tel Aviv and Jerusalem\"; (2) stating \"[w]e wanted to get some feedback from you on what issues we may have covering the production under the blanket policy - any additional premiums or exclusions beyond our standard terms\"; and (3) asking Atlantic to let Universal \"know what [Atlantic's] concerns may be on this.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The broker then had a discussion with Atlantic \"regarding issues they may have with the project entitled 'Dig,' potentially working in Israel.\" During that conversation, Atlantic indicated it \"understands that [Universal] takes seriously safety and security precautions on every production but that they were particularly concerned about those precautions in this locale.\" As a result, Atlantic asked Universal to provide \"specific information regarding the security efforts that will be taken during the course of principal photography.\" Atlantic then concluded that it would \"not be imposing any additional premium or additional coverage terms on\n   <em>\n    Dig\n   </em>\n   relating to the work in Israel,\" the \"primary reason for [which] is [its] confidence in the safety and security measures that will be taken during the production.\" Atlantic did not change the policy's terms, add any exclusions - such as a terrorism exclusion - or charge any additional premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    1. June 2014 Conflict\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After\n   <em>\n    Dig\n   </em>\n   began production in Israel, three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped on June 12, 2014, and Hamas was suspected of involvement in the kidnappings. On June 30, 2014, the bodies of the three missing teenagers were recovered, and there were signs indicating Hamas was\n   involved. On July 2, 2014, a Palestinian teenager was abducted and killed by Israelis, presumably in retaliation for the kidnapping of the Israeli teens. In late June or early July 2014, Hamas began firing rockets from Gaza into Israeli civilian populations, significantly increasing the number of attacks around July 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Israel responded by launching a campaign against Hamas, called \"Operation Protective Edge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On July 8, the U.S. State Department issued a warning regarding the \"safety and security of civilians\" in Israel, specifically in Jerusalem.\n   <em>\n    Dig\n   </em>\n   filming was scheduled to take place in Jerusalem over the next few weeks. Two days later, the Universal security team advised the\n   <em>\n    Dig\n   </em>\n   production team that the \"security environment in Israel currently prohibits NBCU Security from being able to guarantee the safety and security of our employees, production partners and associated crew and talent.\" The security team indicated that \"current rocket attacks\" appeared \"to target locations to be used in forthcoming filming\" and it was concerned about \"acts of terrorism within Israel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    2. Denial of Claim Coverage\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On July 11, 2014, the day after receiving the security team's advice, Universal decided to postpone production for a week and informed Atlantic. Four days later, Universal's broker notified Atlantic in writing of Universal's claim relating to the one-week delay of\n   <em>\n    Dig\n   </em>\n   . Atlantic's Chief Underwriting Officer, Peter Williams, then wrote in an internal email to the claims investigator stating that the claim was a \"covered claim they have immanent [sic] peril. Unless you are going to invoke the war exclusion.\" Atlantic's senior claims investigator responded to Williams:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Any chance you happen [sic] to suggest that they push for more than just the week, since the crew needs to be advised at least one week in advance for a push and since a ground war still might occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The next day, Atlantic's Assistant Vice President stated internally that \"it looks like we need to have a lot further discussion about this.\" Atlantic had never applied the war exclusions before this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Due to escalating violence, Universal decided to move the\n   <em>\n    Dig\n   </em>\n   production out of Israel altogether and notified Atlantic of that decision on July 17, 2014 That same day - two days after Universal's broker submitted the initial written claim - Atlantic denied coverage under the war exclusions. Atlantic's supervising claims examiner could not recall any other claim where a coverage determination was made in two days, stating that this denial occurred on an expedited timeframe. During the two days between the filing of the claim and Atlantic's denial of coverage, Atlantic employees engaged in the following analysis: They conducted Google searches for news articles about Hamas and Israel and reviewed one case, in which the court declined to apply war exclusions to the act of Palestinian and Lebanese sub-national groups bombing a hotel in Beirut.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holiday Inns Inc. v. Aetna Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3596015\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/571/1460/#p1503\">\n    571 F. Supp. 1460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1503 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). Atlantic did not consult the policy's underwriter about the intent regarding the exclusions, although its usual practice was to engage in such a consultation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Two weeks after denying coverage, Atlantic sent Universal a denial letter. Atlantic's letter stated that \"[r]ockets launched toward areas where filming is taking place would no doubt reasonably constitute\" a covered imminent peril. Atlantic also stated,\n   however, that \"[t]he question now is not whether the loss falls within the insuring clause but whether the war exclusion\" applies. Atlantic concluded that \"the extra expense associated with the move is not covered under [the Policy] because of the exclusion for war and warlike action\" - the first and second war exclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Universal filed suit against Atlantic, asserting claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. During litigation, Atlantic took the position that all four contractual war exclusions barred coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Following discovery, Atlantic moved for summary judgment on both claims. Universal filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on its first claim: Atlantic breached the contract. In June 2017, the district court granted Atlantic's motion in a short minute order without further explanation. Four months later, the district court issued a written order granting Atlantic's motion and denying Universal's motion, holding that the first two war exclusions barred coverage and that Atlantic did not act in bad faith. With regard to the war exclusions, the district court concluded that under California law, the exclusions should be understood in their popular and ordinary sense and that \"[s]uch a conflict easily would be considered a 'war' by a layperson.\" The district court rejected Universal's argument that \"war\" has a special meaning through usage in the insurance industry.

Moreover, Universal does not rebut the district court's conclusion that it is a sophisticated party. Most importantly, Universal - the insured - is asking the court to interpret policy language under the customary meaning in the insurance context. Unlike\n   <em>\n    AIU\n   </em>\n   , where the court was concerned about restrictive, technical language being construed against the insured without notice, Universal is aware of the customary meaning in the insurance context and asks us to apply that meaning instead of the plain and ordinary meaning.

Generally, a party asking a court to apply customary usage would be engaged in the relevant trade - here, the insurance trade.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 222(3) (stating that \"[u]nless otherwise agreed, a usage of trade in the\n   <em>\n    vocation or trade in which the parties are engaged or a usage of trade of which they know or have reason to know\n   </em>\n   gives meaning to or supplements or qualifies their agreement\" (emphasis added)).

Here, Universal has met that burden. As discussed below, Universal provides unrebutted expert evidence demonstrating the customary usage of \"war\" and \"warlike action by a military force\" in the insurance context. Caselaw and insurance treatises buttress Universal's argument that ordinary, popular meanings of these terms do not control in this context. Moreover, as Universal notes, Atlantic's own denial letter stated that \"Appleman on Insurance discusses exclusions for war, including the meaning of war and similar terms. 'War is a \"course of hostility\" between \"states or state-like entities.\" ' \" And Universal's expert noted that \"if the policy does not contain a terrorism exclusion, there is a reasonable expectation that acts of terrorism by a known terrorist organization, regardless of however else they may be characterized, will be covered.\" Universal stated that it reasonably expected the exclusionary clause would be interpreted according to customary usage, especially after the December 2013 emails about the policy's coverage in Israel. At the least, both parties should have known the customary usage of \"war\" and \"warlike action\" in the insurance context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, we apply the customary usage of the terms in the insurance context here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    A.

In coming to this conclusion, the district court conflated the various provisions of \u00a7 1644 and shifted the burden to Universal without any explanation. Section 1644 states that words in a contract are \"understood in their ordinary and popular sense ... unless used by the parties in a technical sense, or\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   a special meaning is\n   <em>\n    given to them by usage\n   </em>\n   , in which case the latter\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be followed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201644\">\n    Cal.

Instead, as noted above in this Part IV, the only requirement is that the parties had at least constructive notice of the usage, which they did here. Atlantic failed to show that \"war\" did not have a special meaning in the insurance context, especially considering Universal's ample evidence to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Atlantic does not explicitly dispute that \"war\" has a special meaning in the insurance industry requiring hostilities between de jure and de facto governments.

Furthermore, \u00a7 1644 provides no qualifications or requirement of intent to its mandate regarding the application of customary usage. As discussed, Atlantic's interpretation would render \u00a7 1644 's distinction between technical meaning and customary usage surplusage. Moreover, Atlantic's reliance on interpretive rules requiring plain meaning in other contexts is misplaced, given \u00a7 1644 's specific requirement that plain and ordinary meaning does not apply if customary usage exists\n   <em>\n    .

Atlantic relies on two non-binding cases that addressed whether insurance policies applied to undeclared wars during World War II.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v.

Second, the Tenth Circuit's interpretation of \"undeclared war\" as an express indication of the parties' intent to avoid the special meaning of the term \"war\" does not apply under California law, which mandates the application of a special meaning under \u00a7 1644.

Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"873189\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/35/747/\">\n    35 Cal.4th 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20648\">\n    27 Cal.Rptr.3d 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20P.3d%20903\">\n    110 P.3d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 907 (Cal. 2005). The California Supreme Court has held that the \"efficient proximate\" cause is the \"predominant, or most important cause of a loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (citing\n   <em>\n    Garvey v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4614625\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/48/395/\">\n    48 Cal.3d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=257%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20292\">\n    257 Cal.Rptr. 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=770%20P.2d%20704\">\n    770 P.2d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Cal. 1989) ). Thus, \"the fact that an excluded risk contributed to the loss would not preclude coverage if such a risk was a remote cause of the loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Here, the record demonstrates that the efficient proximate cause for the relocation was Hamas' rocket fire from Gaza into Israel. The district court's reliance on Israel's indirect contribution to continued hostilities from Hamas was not supported by any evidence in the record. Atlantic's letter denying coverage noted that Universal had to relocate because of \"heightened violence in [Israel]\" due to Hamas \"firing rockets into those cities [Tel Aviv and Jerusalem]\" where filming was likely to occur. More importantly, the district court did not consider what the predominant cause of\n   <em>\n    Dig\n   </em>\n   's relocation actually was, and Atlantic provides no evidence that Israeli retaliation was the predominant cause of Universal's losses. The district court erred in holding that because Israel indirectly contributed to Hamas' conduct, Israel's conduct as a sovereign nation triggered the war exclusion here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment with regard to the second war exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Exclusion Three\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Atlantic also asks us to affirm on a ground the district court did not reach: the third exclusion (\"insurrection, rebellion, [or] revolution\"). As Universal stated at oral argument - and confirmed by the parties' briefing on the motion to strike - this question implicates potential factual\n   disputes that the district court has yet to consider. We thus remand to the district court to decide the applicability of the third exclusion in the first instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Universal's Bad Faith Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Similarly, because we hold that Hamas does not constitute a de jure or de facto sovereign, the policy covers Hamas' hostilities as acts of terrorism creating imminent peril (unless the district court finds that the third exclusion applies). The district court's summary judgment of Universal's bad faith claim was predicated on its erroneous analysis of the first and second war exclusions. Because we reverse the district court's entry of judgment in favor of Atlantic and conclude that Atlantic breached its contract, and because triable issues of fact remain with regard to Universal's claim that Atlantic acted in bad faith in denying its claim, we vacate the district court's judgment on Universal's bad faith claim and remand for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Atlantic filed a motion to strike portions of Universal's reply brief and further excerpts of the record because Universal relied on materials that were not a part of the district court record (and of which we cannot take judicial notice). These materials were two deposition transcripts that were not filed with the district court, but were filed as further excerpts of the record here. The transcripts involved the third war exclusion, which the district court did not consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Because we do not reach the third war exclusion, the motion to strike the portions of the record and reply brief that rely on the unsubmitted materials,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 10 ; 9th Cir. Rule 30-2, has been mooted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   We decline to sanction Universal for its conduct because the depositions were not scheduled by the parties until after briefing on the summary judgment motion was completed. Universal, thus, did not have an opportunity to supplement the record before this appeal was taken because the district court did not rule on the third war exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we hold that Atlantic breached its contract when it denied coverage by defining Hamas' conduct as \"war\" and \"warlike action by a military force.\" We reverse the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Atlantic on the first and second war exclusions, and direct the entry of summary judgment in favor of Universal on the first and second war exclusions. Because the district court did not address the third war exclusion - whether Hamas' actions constituted \"insurrection, rebellion, or revolution\" - we remand for the district court to address that question in the first instance. We vacate the grant of summary judgment on Universal's bad faith claim and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Atlantic's motion to strike [Dkt. 33] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as moot, and the request for sanctions is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .
