In Everett, Washington, a police investigation confirmed complaints that some baristas were engaging in lewd conduct at these establishments, that some baristas had been victimized by patrons, and that other crimes were associated with the stands. The City responded by adopting Everett Municipal Code (EMC) \u00a7 5.132.010-060 (the Dress Code Ordinance) requiring that the dress of employees, owners, and operators of Quick-Service Facilities cover \"minimum body areas.\" Separately, the City also broadened its lewd conduct misdemeanor by expanding the Everett Municipal Code's definition of \"lewd act\" to include the public display of specific parts of the body. EMC \u00a7 10.24.010. The City also created a new misdemeanor called Facilitating Lewd Conduct for those who permit, cause or encourage lewd conduct. EMC \u00a7 10.24.020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A stand owner and several baristas sued the City pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , contending that the Dress Code Ordinance and the amendments to the Lewd Conduct Ordinances violate their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The district court granted plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined enforcement of these provisions. The City appeals. We have jurisdiction over the City's interlocutory appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because we conclude that plaintiffs did not show a likelihood of success on the merits of their two Fourteenth Amendment void-for-vagueness challenges, nor on their First Amendment free expression claim, we vacate the district court's preliminary injunction and remand this case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bikini barista stands have operated in and around Everett since at least 2009. The baristas working at these stands wear what they call \"bikinis,\" but the City describes them as \"nearly nude employees,\" and the district court made clear that their attire is significantly more revealing than a typical bikini. The district court's finding that at least some of the baristas wear little more than pasties and g-strings is well-supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Beginning in summer 2009, the Everett Police Department (EPD) began fielding numerous citizen complaints related to bikini barista stands. One complainant asserted that she observed a female barista wearing \"pasties\" and \"a thong and what appeared to be garter belts sitting perched in the window with her feet on the ledge[.]\" The complainant went on to describe how a customer in a truck approached the window and began \"groping\" the barista in intimate areas. According to the complainant, \"the next customer in line ... was clearly touching his genitals through his clothes as he was waiting his turn.\" Stuck in traffic, the complainant wrote that she \"had to sit there w/ my 2 young daughters and was so disgusted[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After receiving upwards of forty complaints, EPD launched an undercover investigation\n   and documented that some baristas at this type of stand were openly violating the existing criminal code prohibiting various forms of lewd conduct. At the time, EMC \u00a7 10.24.010 defined lewd conduct to include exposure or display of one's genitals, anus or any portion of the areola or nipple of the female breast, but EPD's investigation revealed that some of the bikini baristas removed their costumes entirely. EPD also discovered that some baristas were not paid hourly wages and worked for tips only, resulting in pressure to engage in lewd acts, and that other baristas were paid wages but still performed lewd acts in exchange for large tips. Everett undercover police officers took a series of graphic photos documenting the extremely revealing nature of the baristas' garb and instances in which baristas removed their tops and bottoms altogether. Officers also documented a wide variety of customer-barista physical contact. At least one bikini stand owner was convicted of sexually exploiting a minor after he was caught employing a sixteen-year old at one of the bikini stands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Wheeler\n   </em>\n   , No. 72660-9-I,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201306132\">\n    2016 WL 1306132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-3 (Wash. Ct. App. 2016). Another stand turned out to be a front for a prostitution ring, and some of the baristas, who worked in isolated locations late at night, reported being victims of sexual violence. A Snohomish County Sheriff's Deputy was convicted of a criminal offense after helping an owner evade the City's undercover officers in exchange for sexual favors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Enforcing the City's existing lewd conduct ordinance required extensive use of undercover officers and proved to be both expensive and time consuming. The City also complained that policing the stands detracted from EPD's efforts to address the City's other priorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After five years of using undercover operations to prosecute individual offenders, EPD decided its \"investigative approach was an ineffective and resource-intensive method of motivating stand owners to stop the illegal conduct\" and it began collaborating with the City on a legislative fix. The City complied by enacting EMC \u00a7\u00a7 5.132.010-060, a Dress Code Ordinance applicable only to \"Quick-Service Facilities\" like drive-throughs and coffee stands. The City also amended its criminal code to broaden the definition of \"lewd act\" and created the crime of Facilitating Lewd Conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EMC \u00a7\u00a7 10.24.010; 10.24.025. Because the constitutional challenges in this case focus on the text and effect of these enactments, we describe each in some detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Lewd Conduct Amendments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Lewd Conduct Amendments expanded the definition of \"lewd act\" to include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   An exposure or display of one's genitals, anus, bottom one-half of the anal cleft, or any portion of the areola or nipple of the female breast[ ] or [a]n exposure of more than one-half of the part of the female breast located below the top of the areola; provided that the covered area shall be covered by opaque material and coverage shall be contiguous to the areola.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   EMC \u00a7 10.24.010(A)(1)-(2). An \"owner, lessee, lessor, manager, operator, or other person in charge of a public place\" commits the offense of Facilitating Lewd Conduct if that person \"knowingly permits, encourages, or causes to be committed lewd conduct\" as defined in the ordinance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201306132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10.24.025(A). Findings supporting the City's Lewd Conduct Amendments state that the City \"seeks to protect its citizens from those who profit from facilitating others to engage in the crime of Lewd Conduct,\n   and so deems it necessary ... to create the new crime Facilitating Lewd Conduct, a gross misdemeanor punishable by a maximum penalty of 364 days in jail and a $ 5,000.00 fine[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Dress Code Ordinance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The City did not hide its effort to specifically address the problems associated with the bikini barista stands when it adopted the Dress Code Ordinance. The very first factual finding in the enactment establishing the Dress Code stated that \"[t]he City has seen a proliferation of crimes of a sexual nature occurring at bikini barista stands throughout the City[.]\" The next paragraph memorialized the City's conclusion \"that the minimalistic nature of the clothing worn by baristas at these 'bikini' stands lends itself to criminal conduct[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Dress Code Ordinance requires all employees, owners, and operators of \"Quick-Service Facilities\" to comply with a \"dress requirement\" mandating coverage of \"minimum body areas.\" EMC \u00a7 5.132.020(A). Minimum body areas are further defined as \"the upper and lower body (breast/pectorals, stomach, back below the shoulder blades, buttocks, top three inches of legs below the buttocks, pubic area and genitals).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201306132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.132.020(B). The Dress Code Ordinance defines Quick-Service Facilities as \"coffee stands, fast food restaurants, delis, food trucks, and coffee shops\" in addition to all other drive-through restaurants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201306132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.132.020(C). This ordinance prohibits owners of Quick-Service Facilities from operating their businesses if any employee is not in full compliance with the dress requirement. EMC \u00a7 5.132.040(A)(1). Violations are deemed civil infractions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201306132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To ensure that stand owners are motivated to enforce the dress code, the City instituted a $ 250 fine for first time offenders. EMC \u00a7 5.132.040(B)(1). Repeat offenders face stiffer fines and risk losing their business licenses. EMC \u00a7 5.132.040(B)(1)-(2). In enacting these provisions, the City expressed its intent to \"provide powerful tools for reducing the illegal conduct that has occurred at bikini barista stands in a cost-effective manner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff Jovanna Edge owns Hillbilly Hotties, a bikini barista stand in Everett. Plaintiffs Leah Humphrey, Liberty Ziska, Amelia Powell, Natalie Bjerke, and Matteson Hernandez are, or at one time were, baristas employed at Hillbilly Hotties. Approximately one week after the Lewd Conduct Amendments and Dress Code Ordinance went into effect, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit alleging multiple constitutional violations, two of which are relevant to this appeal. Plaintiffs' complaint alleges: (1) that the Dress Code Ordinance and the Lewd Conduct Amendments violate their First Amendment rights to free expression, and (2) that the new provisions violate the Due Process Clause because they are unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs' First Amendment free expression claim asserts that the baristas convey messages such as \"female empowerment,\" \"confiden[ce],\" and \"fearless body acceptance\" by wearing bikinis while working. In support of their motion for a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs submitted declarations from several baristas explaining their views that \"a bikini is not a sexual message, [it's] more a message of empowerment,\" \"we are empowered to be comfortable in our bodies,\" \"[t]he bikini sends the message that I am approachable,\" \"the message I send is freedom[,]\" and \"my employees expose messages through tattoos and scars.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The baristas assert that\n   their choice of clothing demonstrates that they are \"fun and more open,\" and that wearing bikinis at work shows they are \"empowered, confident, and free.\" Plaintiff Edge, owner of Hillbilly Hotties, explained that her employees' dress allows them to \"tell stories of who they are[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Notably, in the district court and on appeal, plaintiffs persistently disavow that they are nude dancers or that they engage in erotic performances, conduct that is expressly protected under the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107753\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/560/#p566\">\n    501 U.S. 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 566,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107753\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/560/#p566\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107753\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/560/#p566\">\n    115 L.Ed.2d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' argument is that simply\n   <em>\n    wearing\n   </em>\n   what they refer to as bikinis is itself sufficiently expressive to warrant First Amendment protection, and that the City's new ordinance and amendments therefore impermissibly burden their speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The City disputes the baristas' premise that the act of wearing pasties and g-strings at work constitutes speech. The City also offers extensive evidence of adverse secondary effects associated with the stands, including prostitution and sexual violence, and argues that the new ordinance and Lewd Conduct Amendments are aimed at those effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction alleged that the new measures are impermissibly vague because they use ambiguous language to define parts of the body that must be covered by employees, owners, and operators of barista stands, and that a person of ordinary intelligence is denied a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct the City now prohibits. The City's opposition denied that the text of the Dress Code Ordinance and Lewd Conduct Amendments is vague or ambiguous, but the City voluntarily agreed to suspend enforcement of the new measures pending resolution of plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The Lewd Conduct Ordinance uses the term \"anal cleft\" in near proximity to a list of other intimate body parts.

Likewise, we conclude that the modifier \"bottom one-half\" does no more than specify an easily ascertained fractional part of an otherwise well-understood area of the body. Plaintiffs do not expressly challenge the new misdemeanor Facilitating Lewd Conduct on vagueness grounds, but we note that this provision does no more than prohibit owners, operators, lessors, lessees or any person \"in charge of a public place\" from knowingly permitting, or causing another person to commit lewd conduct as defined in EMC \u00a7 10.24.010. This prohibition is clear, as is the definition of lewd conduct.

Everett's definition of lewd conduct requires that certain areas of the body be covered in public and as we have explained, the definition is not ambiguous. Nor does the definition rely on the subjective assessment of an enforcing officer. The term \"anal cleft\" is clear and ascertainable and what constitutes the \"bottom half\" of this unambiguously described part of the human body is also an objective standard. In short, EMC \u00a7 10.24.010's description of the body parts that must be covered in public does not create a constitutional problem by inviting discretionary enforcement because there are \"standards governing the exercise of the discretion granted by the ordinance[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Papachristou\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721589\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/156/#p169\">\n    405 U.S. at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721589\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/156/#p169\">\n    92 S.Ct. 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that there will be close cases requiring some degree of law enforcement subjectivity when the Lewd Conduct Amendments are enforced, and the district court shared this concern.

We therefore vacate the district court's preliminary injunction with respect to the Lewd Conduct Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. The Dress Code Ordinance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We next consider the district court's order enjoining enforcement of the Dress Code Ordinance. EMC \u00a7 5.132.030 mandates that employees, operators, and owners of \"Quick-Service Facilities\" comply with the City's dress requirement. The Dress Code Ordinance makes it unlawful to serve customers or operate a Quick-Service Facility if \"minimum body areas\" of the owner or any employee are not covered. EMC \u00a7 5.132.030. \"Minimum body areas\" are defined as: \"breast/pectorals, stomach, back below the shoulder blades, buttocks, top three inches of legs below the buttocks, pubic area and genitals.\" EMC \u00a7 5.132.020(B). The district court enjoined the Dress Code Ordinance for two distinct reasons: (1) the court concluded that the Dress Code Ordinance's susceptibility to arbitrary enforcement renders it unconstitutionally vague; and (2) the district court concluded that the Dress Code Ordinance likely fails First Amendment review because it impermissibly burdens plaintiffs' rights to free expression. We address each rationale in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Vagueness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The vagueness principles governing our analysis of the Lewd Conduct Amendments apply with equal force to the Dress Code Ordinance. The fact that law enforcement may have to make some close judgment calls regarding compliance with these provisions does not, perforce, mean that police are vested with impermissibly broad discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p304\">\n    553 U.S. at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p304\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The terms of the Dress Code Ordinance are sufficiently clear to preclude enforcement on \"an ad hoc and subjective basis\" because the dress requirement clearly defines areas of the body that owners and employees must cover while operating Quick-Service Facilities, using commonly understood names for those body areas.\n   <em>\n    Hunt v.

This part of the court's order relied on its determination that the baristas' choice to wear provocative attire (pasties and g-strings) constituted sufficiently expressive conduct to warrant First Amendment protection, that the Dress Code Ordinance amounted to a content-neutral restriction on the baristas' speech, and that the Dress Code Ordinance failed intermediate scrutiny under\n   the \"secondary effects\" line of cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Renton v.

In other words, it applies at retail establishments that invite commercial transactions, and in these transactions, the baristas undisputedly solicit tips. The baristas' act of wearing pasties and g-strings in close proximity to paying customers creates a high likelihood that the message sent by the baristas' nearly nonexistent outfits vastly diverges from those described in plaintiffs' declarations.

The outcome of this case turns on the plaintiffs' contention that the act of wearing almost no clothing while serving coffee in a retail establishment constitutes speech.
