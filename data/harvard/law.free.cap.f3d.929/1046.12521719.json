The district court interpreted the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (\"SLUSA\") to bar the case from proceeding in federal court. We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Banks is the beneficiary of the irrevocable Lindstrom Trust, created under California law. As trustee, Northern has sole discretion on how to manage the trust's assets; Banks cannot participate in, direct, or be involved in those decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), Northern invested the trust's assets in Northern's own affiliated \"Funds Portfolio,\" rather than seeking superior investments outside its financial umbrella. This practice allegedly led to the trust suffering suboptimal returns, which would not have happened if Northern prioritized the interests of the trust beneficiaries (and not merely its own). Banks argues that favoring these inferior affiliated funds - over better-performing non-Northern funds - put money in the pockets of Northern, which thereby violated its duties of prudent investment and loyalty to Banks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The FAC also alleges that Northern, as part of an \"undisclosed internal decision to create a new profit center,\" charged improper and excessive fees for \"routine preparation of fiduciary tax returns\" and failed to maintain records to justify these expenses. These new fees, which previously were \"part of the base fee and a fundamental duty for a trustee,\" allegedly breached Northern's duty of prudent administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition, the FAC alleges elder abuse and unfair competition claims under California law, both premised on the same factual allegations underlying the investment and fee-related claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Northern filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, contending that SLUSA prohibited these state-law claims from proceeding in federal court. Over Banks' objection, the district court agreed with Northern and dismissed the FAC without leave to amend. The court reasoned that the allegedly imprudent investments were in connection with the purchase or sale of covered securities and featured material misrepresentations or omissions. The court concluded that SLUSA precluded Banks from bringing state-law fiduciary duty claims as a class action in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court dismissed the fee, elder law, and unfair competition claims without directly addressing them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although Northern moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the parties now agree that Rule 12(b)(1) - lack of subject matter jurisdiction - is the proper rule to challenge a complaint under SLUSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hampton v.

The Court emphasized that \"[e]very one of these cases ... concerned a false statement (or the like) that was material to\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   individual's decision to purchase or sell a statutorily defined security.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 393,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578243,12701997\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1058/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This case presents a question of first impression in this circuit: whether allegations concerning a trustee's imprudent investments constitute activity \"in connection with\" the purchase or sale of securities when those allegations are brought by the beneficiaries of an irrevocable trust. Banks argues that any false statements or deceptive activity by Northern could not have been material to a beneficiary's individual decision to purchase or sell a covered security for two reasons: (1) a beneficiary who is not also a trustee of an irrevocable trust cannot make an individual decision to purchase or sell securities for the trust, and (2) Banks has no control over Northern's decision to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Applying\n   <em>\n    Troice\n   </em>\n   here, we agree with Banks. Unlike an agent-principal relationship, beneficiaries who are not also trustees of an irrevocable trust cannot direct\n   Northern's actions as the trustee. Accordingly, even if Northern engaged in fraudulent conduct, that conduct does not change the fact that its beneficiaries are unable to purchase or sell covered securities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Northern contends that this difference between an agent and a trustee is a meaningless one. But if Northern were acting as an agent - similar to a stockbroker - Northern's statements and allegedly deceptive conduct could meet SLUSA's \"in connection with\" requirement because Banks (and other beneficiaries) could have relied on Northern's statements to induce the purchase of the affiliated funds. Conversely, if Northern was in fact acting as a trustee, and if Banks did not have control over investment of trust assets, Northern's deceptive or manipulative conduct resulted only in Northern - and no other party - purchasing affiliated funds. As\n   <em>\n    Troice\n   </em>\n   specifically notes, SLUSA does not preclude cases where \"the only party who decides to buy or sell a covered security as a result of a lie is the liar\" because \"that is not a 'connection' that matters.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701997\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/377/\">\n    571 U.S. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578243,12701997\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1058/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Donnell v.

Not only did the district court fail to consider Banks' allegations that the beneficiaries lacked any control over the trustees - an allegation supported by caselaw and secondary sources - but courts generally determine the existence of an agency relationship at the summary judgment stage, not in determining a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rookard v.

The district court erred in concluding SLUSA precluded Banks' imprudent investment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because we conclude Banks' imprudent investment claims do not meet the \"in connection with\" requirement for SLUSA preclusion, we need not decide whether the claims meet SLUSA's fraudulent conduct requirement, i.e., whether Banks adequately alleged Northern (1) engaged in misrepresentation or omission of a material fact or (2) used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance. We reverse and remand all of Banks' imprudent investment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Banks' fee-related claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    1. SLUSA does not preclude Banks' fee-related claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The FAC alleged three claims related to management fees, asserting that Northern: (1) improperly charged tax-preparation fees, (2) failed to maintain records justifying those costs, and (3) overcharged fixed-fee trusts. The district court dismissed these claims as precluded by SLUSA but did not explain how the alleged activities were \"in connection with\" securities transactions. The same concern that animates our holding as to the imprudent investment claims - that a trustee's misconduct, without more, cannot constitute misconduct \"in connection with\" the purchase or sale of covered securities - applies equally to Banks' fee claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Northern argues that the fee claims should be precluded because they are \"inextricably intertwined\" with the investment claims. Not only are the fee claims not precluded by SLUSA because of the \"in connection with\" requirement, the fee claims also lack any plausible relationship to covered securities. Unlike the investment claims, Banks' fee claims do not allege conduct in relation to any securities transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Third Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Taksir\n   </em>\n   , which held that SLUSA did not bar investors' almost identical overcharging claims against their broker, is instructive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   903 F.3d at 99.\n   <em>\n    Taksir\n   </em>\n   concluded SLUSA did not apply because the overcharges were \"not the result of a material misrepresentation about securities transactions, but rather a contractual breach ... tangentially related to the securities transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Taksir\n   </em>\n   relied on\n   <em>\n    Troice\n   </em>\n   for its holding that the fee-related claims were not \"in connection with\" transactions involving a security, because the fees were not plausibly material to the sale or purchase of a security.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Additionally,\n   <em>\n    Taksir\n   </em>\n   recognized our dicta in\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   that \"a claim that [the broker] charged Plaintiffs $10 for executing a trade, despite a contract providing for a $5 charge, would not be barred\" by SLUSA.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 98 (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   , 878 F.3d at 1153 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The district court's order did not address these considerations or discuss the fee claims in any substantive manner, nor did it explain why SLUSA would preclude these claims. Because we agree with the reasoning in both\n   <em>\n    Taksir\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   , we conclude the district court erred in dismissing the tax-preparation and overcharging claims on SLUSA-preclusion grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Banks' fee-related claims survive 12(b)(6).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Separately from its SLUSA-preclusion argument, Northern's motion to dismiss the FAC also contended that Banks did not sufficiently plead the fee-related claims under Rule 12(b)(6). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint must offer \"more than labels and conclusions,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   and instead contain \"enough factual matter\" indicating \"plausible\" grounds for relief, not merely \"conceivable\" ones.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

The FAC also asserted that Northern did not provide any information about when, how, or why it began charging tax-preparation fees. The FAC contended these combined allegations amounted to breach-of-trust violations: \"[t]his uniform practice of charging excessive and improper fees violates the duties of loyalty and prudent administration by placing [Northern's] own financial interest above the interest of Plaintiffs and members of the proposed Tax Preparation Class.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   These detailed allegations meet\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   's plausibility requirement and amount to more than conclusory labels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
