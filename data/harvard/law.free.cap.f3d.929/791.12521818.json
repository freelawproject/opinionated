R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement in 2011. Brumbach agreed that because he had at least three previous convictions for violent felonies and possessed a gun, he qualified as an armed career criminal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). The parties agreed to a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The United States Probation Office prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\"), within which the Probation Office explained that Brumbach had twelve prior convictions for aggravated burglary under Tennessee law, and classified him as an armed career criminal. At sentencing, Brumbach raised no objections to the PSR, and the district court accepted the plea agreement and imposed a sentence of 180 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the Supreme Court struck down the ACCA's residual clause in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

No one contends that\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   is not binding precedent, and as the district court in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   observed, any concerns about the relationship between\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Priddy\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Nance\n   </em>\n   have been resolved with\n   <em>\n    Stitt II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Brumbach also argues that reversal is not warranted on a separate ground. Although the district court did not explicitly recognize it, Brumbach contends that Tennessee's definition of \"entry\" is so broad that it treats an attempted burglary as a completed burglary. According to Brumbach, because the Supreme Court has held that an attempted burglary is not a generic burglary, a conviction under Tennessee's burglary statute does not qualify as a violent felony under the ACCA. (Response Brief at 11, citing\n   <em>\n    James v.

Even if there is merit to Brumbach's arguments concerning Tennessee's definition of entry, a panel of this court cannot overrule\n   <em>\n    Nance\n   </em>\n   . This can only be done by an \"inconsistent decision\" of the Supreme Court or, like we did briefly with\n   <em>\n    Stitt I\n   </em>\n   , a decision of the en banc court.\n   <em>\n    Salmi v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, we reverse the district court's grant of habeas relief, and remand with instructions to reinstate the original sentence.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
