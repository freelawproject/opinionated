She gave birth at 38 weeks gestation to a fully developed baby boy, Baby Boy Flute. Baby Boy Flute was well developed, normal and intact, with no obvious signs of trauma or injury, but died approximately four hours after birth. At the time of admission, Flute tested positive for cocaine and a number of prescription and over-the-counter drugs. During efforts to resuscitate Baby Boy Flute, Flute admitted that she had, shortly prior to his birth, taken three times the daily dose of Lorazepam, which had been prescribed to her during her only prenatal medical visit less than one week before Baby Boy Flute's birth; she had snorted hydrocodone, which she believed to have been laced with cocaine based on the feeling it gave her; and ingested cough medicine. Flute admitted that she knew that ingesting these substances was against the best interests of Baby Boy Flute, but that she did so because she needed to get high. An autopsy confirmed that Baby Boy Flute had no anatomical cause of death, but noted the presence of several substances that had not been medically administered to Baby Boy Flute while he was alive. The forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy concluded that Baby Boy Flute had died from combined drug toxicity due to the substances Flute ingested while Baby Boy Flute was still in utero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The government indicted Flute on one count of involuntary manslaughter. The Indictment specifically charged the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Between on or about August 19, 2016 and August 20, 2016, in Agency Village, in Indian country, in the District of South Dakota, Samantha Flute, an Indian, unlawfully killed a human being, Baby Boy Flute, without malice, in the commission of a lawful act in an unlawful manner which might produce death. Such act was committed in a grossly negligent manner, with actual knowledge that her conduct was a threat to the life of another and with actual knowledge that would reasonably enable her to foresee the peril to which her act subjected another, to wit: Samantha Flute did unlawfully kill Baby Boy Flute by ingesting prescribed and over-the-counter medicines in a grossly negligent manner, and did thereby commit the crime of involuntary manslaughter, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201153\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1112.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Indictment 1-2, Dist. Ct. Dkt. 2. Flute filed a motion to dismiss the Indictment. She admitted that she gave birth to an alive Baby Boy Flute, but argued that even if she had engaged in the conduct alleged in the Indictment, the conduct did not constitute the charged offense under federal law because \u00a7 1112 was not intended to apply to a mother's conduct with respect to her unborn child. She also asserted that she could not be charged under \u00a7 1112 because an unborn child is not a \"human being\" for the purposes of that statute. Flute also asserted that the involuntary manslaughter statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court granted the motion to dismiss the Indictment, holding that the involuntary manslaughter statute did not apply to Flute because she was not within the class of defendants under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, the district court acknowledged that \"Baby Boy Flute is within the class of victims Congress historically intended to protect under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201112\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" It nevertheless imported language from\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201841\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   that bars \"prosecution ... of any woman with respect to her unborn child\" to find that \u00a7 1112 did not reach Flute. The district court read this provision as \"creat[ing] a class of persons who cannot be prosecuted under the federal criminal statutes for injury caused to an unborn child,\" and ultimately concluded that the provision was \"a clear statement from Congress that the federal assault and murder statutes cannot be applied to the pregnant woman herself for any actions she takes with respect to her unborn child.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Nov. 14, 2017). The district court thus determined that, but for the \u00a7 1841 exception for mothers, Flute would have been an appropriate defendant. The district court did not address Flute's as-applied constitutional challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the government asserts that the district court erroneously imported the \u00a7 1841 exception in determining that the federal involuntary manslaughter statute did not extend to the class of defendants of which Flute was a part-mothers who inflicted injury upon their unborn while the child was still in utero, leading to the child's death after birth. Rather, the government contends that \u00a7 1841 is a separate, unrelated, and uncharged statute without relevance to the application of the manslaughter statute to actions of a mother against her unborn child. Flute responds that the district court correctly applied \u00a7 1841 and also asserts that the Indictment should have been dismissed because Baby Boy Flute was not a human being when the injuries were sustained in utero and thus \u00a7 1112 does not criminalize Flute's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"We review de novo a district court's dismissal of an indictment for failure to state an offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The dispositive questions on appeal are whether Baby Boy Flute is within the class of victims protected by \u00a7 1112 and whether Flute is within the class of defendants covered by \u00a7 1112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Turning to the first question, we assess whether Baby Boy Flute, who sustained injuries in utero that caused his death after birth, falls within the class of victims protected by \u00a7 1112. Flute asserts that Baby Boy Flute does not because he was not a human being at the time the\n   conduct which ultimately caused death occurred. We disagree with this contention and agree with the district court that Baby Boy Flute is a proper victim under the federal involuntary manslaughter statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2002, Congress passed the Born Alive Infants Protection Act, which defines the term \"human being\" for all Acts of Congress:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the words \"person\", \"human being\", \"child\", and \"individual\", shall include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208\">\n    1 U.S.C. \u00a7 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Act further defines \"born alive\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   the complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother of that member, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut, and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8(b). Under this definition, the uncontested fact that Baby Boy Flute survived for several hours after his birth-complete expulsion or extraction from his mother-until succumbing to the drugs in his system would establish that he was \"born alive.\" Because he was born alive, under the plain language of these statutes, Baby Boy Flute was a \"human being.\" And because the language of the manslaughter statute plainly encompasses the death of a born-alive child-a child at the earliest possible moment that it exists outside of the womb-the statute necessarily extends to conduct that occurred in utero and caused death to this born-alive child. Baby Boy Flute's death and Flute's conduct while pregnant thus fall within the ambit of the involuntary manslaughter statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As the district court noted, this conclusion is consistent with the common-law understanding of the \"born alive\" rule, whereby liability extended to the death of a child born alive related to injuries received in utero.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In view of Congress's intent to reflect the state and common-law definition of murder when it passed the statute, and the state and common-law acceptance of infants who died subsequent to birth due to fetal injuries as human beings, it seems clear that Congress intended fetal infanticide to be included within the statutory definition of 'murder' under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201111\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"). We need not resolve Flute's argument that Baby Boy Flute was not a \"human being\" while in utero to determine that Baby Boy Flute is within the class of victims protected by \u00a7 1112 because application of the born-alive statute hinges on the time of the born-alive child's death, not initial injury. We further note that Flute's argument is inconsistent with the common law understanding that homicide does not occur unless and until the victim actually dies; because death completes the offense of manslaughter, the victim's status at death is the determination rather than the victim's status when the injuries were sustained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Wayne R.

Baby Boy Flute is thus within the class of victims described under \u00a7 1112, regardless of whether he was or\n   was not (as Flute argues) a human being when he sustained injuries in utero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We next turn to whether Flute falls within the class of defendants recognized by \u00a7 1112 ; that is, whether the statute extends criminal culpability to a mother for actions against her unborn child. Although the plain language of \u00a7 1112 and the Born Alive Infants Protection Act plainly encompasses Flute and her conduct, the district court erroneously utilized a separate, unrelated, and uncharged statutory provision to exclude Flute's conduct from \u00a7 1112. The district court relied on the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which \"recognizes unborn children as a class of victims not previously protected under federal law and criminalizes the killing or injuring of unborn children during the commission of certain federal offenses.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031267\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/1074/#p1086\">\n    635 F.3d 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1086 (8th Cir. 2011). This Act creates a separate offense for an individual who engages in any of a list of enumerated crimes, including involuntary manslaughter, which results in \"the death of, or bodily injury ... to, a child, who is in utero at the time the conduct takes place ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201841\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 1841 thus has the effect of expanding the reach of numerous federal criminal statutes to protect unborn victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Despite the fact that \u00a7 1841 expands criminal culpability for crimes against the unborn, the district court relied on an exception in this section to conclude that the involuntary manslaughter statute did not encompass Flute's conduct as the mother of the unborn child. Section 1841 contains an exception that bars prosecution of a mother for actions taken against her own unborn child.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201841\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) (\"Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the prosecution ... of any woman with respect to her unborn child.\").

He is thus a victim within the scope of \u00a7 1112. No applicable exception for conduct of a mother that causes injuries sustained in utero and resulting in death after birth exists. Flute is thus an appropriate defendant within the scope of \u00a7 1112 and may be criminally charged for her conduct of abusing prescription and over-the-counter drugs, ultimately resulting in Baby Flute's death after birth.

According to the United States Attorney, the government has never before charged a mother with manslaughter based on prenatal neglect that causes the death of a child. As the district court observed, accepting the government's view of the statute could have broad ramifications for the criminal liability of mothers based on their conduct while pregnant. Resolving this significant issue of first impression requires careful attention to the historical underpinnings of the manslaughter statute. While I do not agree with the district court's particular statutory analysis, I do conclude that Congress has not adopted a manslaughter statute that imposes criminal liability on a mother for prenatal conduct that results in the tragic death of her child. I would therefore affirm the order dismissing the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Manslaughter is a crime of long lineage.

In discerning the meaning of \u00a7 1112(a), then, it is appropriate to consider the common-law history of the manslaughter offense and its application to the circumstance of prenatal neglect by a mother that later results in the death of a child born alive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The common law of England recognized that a\n   <em>\n    third party\n   </em>\n   could be guilty of homicide for causing prenatal injuries to a mother or unborn child that resulted in the subsequent death of a child born alive. The principal debate in that situation concerned whether it was feasible to prove that prenatal acts caused the death of a live-born child. Lord Coke suggested that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [i]f a woman be quick with childe, and by a Potion or otherwise killeth it in her wombe; or if a man beat her, whereby the childe dieth in her body, and she is delivered of a dead childe, this is a great misprision, and no murder: but if the childe be born alive, and dieth of the Potion, battery, or other cause, this is murder: for in law it is accounted a reasonable creature,\n   <em>\n    in rerum natura\n   </em>\n   , when it is born alive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   3 Edward Coke,\n   <em>\n    Institutes of the Laws of England\n   </em>\n   50 (London, M. Flesher 1644). Others such as Hale and Lambard, \"impressed by the difficulty of proving that the death of a live-born child was occasioned by a defendant's prenatal acts, took a different view from Coke.\" D. Seaborne Davies,\n   <em>\n    Child-Killing in English Law\n   </em>\n   , 1 Modern L. Rev. 203, 209 (1937);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   1 Matthew Hale,\n   <em>\n    The History of the Pleas of the Crown\n   </em>\n   433 (London, E. &amp; R. Nutt and R. Gosling 1736); William Lambard,\n   <em>\n    Eirenarcha, or Of the Office of the Justices of Peace\n   </em>\n   231 (London 1607 ed.) (1581). On the question whether proof of causation was legally possible, the law adopted Coke's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Thus, in cases involving prenatal acts of a third party that caused the death of a child born alive, the common law recognized a crime of murder or manslaughter. In\n   <em>\n    Rex v. Senior\n   </em>\n   (1832) 168 Eng. Rep. 1298; 1 Mood. C.C. 346, the court upheld a manslaughter conviction for a male midwife who negligently compressed the head of an infant in the act of birth, thereby causing the child's death after he was completely born alive. The court in\n   <em>\n    Regina v. West\n   </em>\n   (1848) 175 Eng. Rep. 329; 2 Car. &amp; K. 784, similarly instructed a jury that a defendant would be guilty of the murder of a child carried by another if she, \"by a felonious attempt to procure abortion, caused the child to be brought into the world, for which it was not then fitted, and that the child did die in consequence of its exposure to the external world.\" 175 Eng. Rep. at 330. Such decisions led the Ninth Circuit to conclude that \"it was well-established in common law that murder was the killing of one human being by another, and that an infant born alive that later died as a result of fetal injuries was a human being.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548905\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/839/1341/#p1343\">\n    839 F.2d 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1343 (9th Cir. 1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   When it came to prosecutions of a mother, however, Coke's view did not prevail. The issue arose in two prominent cases under the law of England. In both decisions, courts ruled that a mother was not liable for manslaughter based on prenatal neglect that resulted in the death of a child born alive.\n   <em>\n    Regina v. Knights\n   </em>\n   (1860) 175 Eng. Rep. 952; 2 F. &amp; F. 45, involved a mother who knew that she was about to give birth and wilfully abstained from taking the necessary precautions to preserve the life of the child after its birth. The prosecution urged that where the child died as a consequence of the alleged criminal neglect, the mother would be guilty of manslaughter. 175 Eng. Rep. at 953. The court, however, had \"never heard such a\n   doctrine\" and ruled that the mother could not be convicted of manslaughter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548905\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/839/1341/#p1343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The British Parliament in 1874 then considered proposals to provide for the punishment of a mother guilty of culpable prenatal neglect resulting in death, but no such provision was enacted. Davies,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 210.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Thereafter, the decision in\n   <em>\n    Rex v. Izod\n   </em>\n   (1904) 20 Cox C.C. 690 (Eng.), reaffirmed the rule of\n   <em>\n    Knights\n   </em>\n   . The court rejected the prosecution's theory that \"failure on the part of a woman to make proper provision for her expected confinement, resulting in the complete birth and subsequent death of a child, amounts to manslaughter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 691. To establish manslaughter by a mother, the court ruled, \"neglect must be subsequent to the birth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   One leading treatise stated the common-law rule in the early twentieth century: \"The mere failure on the part of a woman to make proper provision for her expected confinement, resulting in the complete birth and subsequent death of a child, is not sufficient in itself to warrant a conviction of manslaughter.\" 1 William Oldnall Russell,\n   <em>\n    A Treatise on Crimes and Misdemeanors\n   </em>\n   675-76 (William Feilden Craies &amp; Leonard William Kershaw eds., 7th ed. 1910).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The common law in early America was no different. A compilation of American and English cases through 1909 stated the law: \"The wilful and negligent omission of a mother to care for herself or to make preparations for the birth of a child will not amount to manslaughter, although as a result of such neglect the child dies shortly after birth.\" 13\n   <em>\n    The American and English Annotated Cases\n   </em>\n   43 (William M. McKinley et al. eds., 1909). The few American cases on point followed the English common-law rule. In\n   <em>\n    Brown v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1751588\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/95/670/\">\n    95 Miss. 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1751588\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/95/670/\">\n    49 So. 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1909), a woman gave birth in the toilet room of a train; the baby dropped to the ground through the stool and died after uttering a faint cry. The prosecution maintained that the mother was guilty of \"such criminal negligence as to constitute manslaughter,\" but the Supreme Court of Mississippi ruled that the mother was not \"guilty of any crime under the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147. As late as 1954, the Supreme Court of Wyoming addressed a contention by the State that a mother was guilty of manslaughter for her failure, prior to the birth of a child, to provide medical care for an infant to be born.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court reported that \"\n   <em>\n    no case decided in this country\n   </em>\n   has been found going to the length of the contention of the state,\" and then applied the common-law rule of\n   <em>\n    Knights\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Izod\n   </em>\n   that a mother is not guilty of manslaughter based on prenatal neglect causing the subsequent death of a child born alive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 475 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The 1909 federal manslaughter statute is best understood as incorporating this common-law meaning. \"Unlike the homicide statutes in some modern penal codes that specifically define each element of the various degrees of criminal homicide, the federal homicide statutes simply adopt the language of the traditional common-law offenses of murder and manslaughter.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Research reveals no decision in England or the United States before 1909 holding that a mother's prenatal neglect constituted manslaughter. Congress in 1909 adopted the common-law definition of manslaughter in \u00a7 1112(a) ; nothing in the statute dictates that its scope is broader than the common-law meaning. No federal statute enacted after 1909 has expanded the manslaughter statute to encompass a mother's prenatal neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This case raises profound moral and policy questions, but it requires an Act of Congress to extend federal criminal liability to a mother whose drug use during\n   pregnancy causes the death of her child. I conclude that under present law, the government's allegations against Samantha Flute do not state an offense, and the district court's order dismissing the indictment should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    As enacted in 1909, the words defining involuntary manslaughter appeared in a slightly different order: \"In the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony, or in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection.\" Act of March 4, 1909, ch. 321, Pub. L. No. 60-350, \u00a7 274,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20Stat.%201088\">\n     35 Stat. 1088\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1143. The phrase \"of a lawful act which might produce death\" was moved to the end of the sentence in 1948.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 645, \u00a7 1112(a),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Stat.%20683\">\n     62 Stat. 683\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 756.
