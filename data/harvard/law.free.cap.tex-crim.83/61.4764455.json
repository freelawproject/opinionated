The language of the indictment is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">\u201cThat on the <em>28th </em>day of May, A. D. 1910, an election, in accordance with the laws of this State, was held under authority of an order of the commissioners court of Cooke County, Texas, theretofore duly made and published to- determine whether or not the sale of intoxicating liquors should be prohibited in said county, and the qualified voters at said election did then and there determine that the sale of intoxicating liquors should be prohibited in said county, and thereupon the commissioners court of said county did pass and publish an order declaring the result of said election and prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors \u2019 in said county, and thereupon said order was published for the time and in the manner required by law, and thereafter on or about the 3rd day of February, A. D. 1917, and anterior to the presentment of this indictment, in Cooke County, and State of Texas, Cliff Johnson did unlawfully sell to W. C. Busk intoxicating liquor in violation of said law and against the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">Supporting his contention that the indictment is insufficient, appellant cites Carnes v. State, 50 Texas Crim. Rep., <em>282; </em>also Commonwealth v. Cope, 53 S. W. Rep., <em>272, </em>and other cases of similar tenor. The indictment is in substantially the same terms as the one declared valid by this court-in Watson\u2019s case, <em>52 </em>Texas Crim. Rep., 551. The opinion in the Watson case reviews the Texas cases on the subject cited by appellant, and, without repeating the discussion, our opinion is that upon the authority of the Watson case there was no error in overruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the motion to quash the indictment, and we are further of the opinion that the conclusion reached in the case last mentioned was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\">The State\u2019s case was proved by a detective with whom the transaction was had. He claimed that he bought a pint of whisky from appellant; that he had asked appellant about an hour before if he knew where he could get some whisky, and appellant replied that he had a little on hand. Witness told him he was feeling bad and wanted a drink; that appellant in about an hour returned with a bottle and delivered it to witness upon the payment of a dollar. A very strong and plausible attack upon this State\u2019s witness is made in the written argument on the ground that he was hired to bring about prosecutions, and that there was proof that he offered for hire to abandon the prosecution and leave the State. The record discloses, however, that the appellant in his testimony, in a sense, corroborates the State\u2019s witness. We quote from his testimony as follows: <em>\u201c1 </em>didn\u2019t sell W. CL .Busk a pint of whisky. I went after a pint of whisky for him. I went down by George Leathers for the whisky. That is \u00e1 pool hall\u2014I think a negro pool hall. I got the whisky from this fellow Bobinson. He is, a negro, that is all I know. He was selling whisky. He had been working for Hoodie &amp; Wilson in their cotton office. W. C. Busk come up and asked me if I knew where I could get any whisky and I told him yes. After a while he came back and said what did you find out? and I said, Hive me a dollar and I will get you a pint.\u2019 He gave me a dollar to get it and when I got it I gave it to him in the pool hall. I don\u2019t remember who was present at the time. I helped him drink several drinks of whisky. I drank out of his bottle two, three, four or five times. He called me back and asked me if I wanted a drink.\u201d The jury was instructed that if appellant acted as the agent of the State\u2019s witness in buying the whisky, or if there was a reasonable doubt on the subject, he would be entitled to an acquittal. There is no complaint of the manner in which the issue of agency was submitted to the jury. The sole questions raised are the sufficiency of the indictment and sufficiency of the evidence. The indictment, in our opinion, is good, and we do not feel authorized to hold the evidence insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b93-6\">on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">February 13, 1918.</p>\n<author id=\"b93-8\">MORROW, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AiL-\">Appellant in a very earnest and forceful motion insists that the State\u2019s witness, upon whose testimony the conviction rests, was unworthy of belief. ' There is no bill of exceptions complaining of the admission of evidence nor of the manner in which the issues were \u2019 submitted to the jury. The State\u2019s witness testified to facts, which, if true, constitute an offense. Appellant testified to a state of facts, which, if believed, would have exculpated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>This court has never assumed the right, where the evidence is sufficient, if believed, but conflicting, to set aside the verdict because the judges might, if they had been upon the jury, believed the evidence of one witness and disbelieved that of another. The contrary view has been taken by this court throughout its history, and by the Supreme Court when it had jurisdiction of criminal matters. Shaw v. State, 27 Texas, 750; Lockhart v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 567; O\u2019Connor v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 267; Turner v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 451, and numerous cases listed in White\u2019s C. C. P., p. 601, sec. 942. In fact, the Code of Criminal Procedure, in terms, provides that \u201cThe jury, in all cases, are exclusive judges of the facts proved, and of the weight- to be given to the testimony.\u201d To the same effect is article 734, as follows: \u201cThe jury are the, exclusive judges of the facts in every criminal case.\u201d Later expressions of the court will be found in Vernon\u2019s C. C. P., p. 689, note 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
