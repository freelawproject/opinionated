This matter has been rectified and the case will be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">The record contains really but one question. That is, want of sufficient evidence to establish a corpus delicti. The majority of this court have reached the conclusion that the evidence is sufficient upon, that question. We now state the strength of the State\u2019s case revolving around, the question of corpus delicti. The State\u2019s witness Washington when asked where the alleged deceased, Joe Murray, was, answered: \u201cHe is dead, so they say.\u201d This extract is taken from the testimony of Crowell: \u201cDo you know whether the boy died or not? A. Yes, sir.\u201d The testimony shows that appellant shot deceased, the shot taking effect just above the top of the hip. The evidence shows also that appellant shot at deceased and he fell. Washington also testified that he was working in Mr. Yarborough\u2019s camp at the time Joe Murray was killed. \u201cI do not remember the exact date that Joe Murray was killed.\u201d Crowell also testified: \u201cI was in the camp when Joe Murray was killed. I saw the transaction there when he was killed. I was coming through there with a load of lumber, coming from Pineland. I see the plat or map on the floor there that is supposed to represent the houses and railroad and streets and the other roads near where Joe Murray was killed.\u201d He also testified that when Joe Murray walked up to the gate, to go into the gate, Eli stepped back about two steps and shot him. Eli had the muzzle of his gun down \u201cand he stepped back this way (indicating) and raised his gun and fired. . . . After the gun fired, he fell over inside the yard.\u201d He also testified as follows: Q. \u201cDo you know whether the boy died or not?\u201d A. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Q. \u201cHe died?\u201d A. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Appellant testified: \u201cWhen I shot him he threw his hand back that way; I didn\u2019t know whether it was going under his jumper \u25a0or where it was going; I know he threw it back, and I aimed to defend myself. I was not mad then. I was cool and deliberate. I was standing up there talking; I was inviting his mother up to the little meeting I was going to have. I was no waj's angry at all. I was cool and deliberate. I did not kill that boy because he cursed me. I want to tell the jury that I didn\u2019t kill him at that time because he cursed me. I didn\u2019t intend to kill him then at all; I aimed to stop him from shoot- - ing me; I didn\u2019t even intend to shoot when I shot.\u201d Witness Dan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>White testified: \u201cI know Eli Johnson. I remember the day that Joe Murray was killed. I was sitting on my gallery that day just like I am sitting here. I lived next to Carrie McHeal at that time. I saw the transaction at the time the boy, Joe Murray, was killed.\u201d He further testified: \u201cThe boy came on up and walked up there and reached at the gate to open it, and Eli was standing there, and just as he got inside the gate, Eli just came up with the gun that way\u2014bumb. When the boy was killed he was standing just like I am. I do not know the position of his hands. I just saw him fall; I saw him when he caught hold of that gate, when he first walked up.. I didn\u2019t see him do anything with his hand.\u201d Witness also states that Eli backed off just about a step and had his gun just about in that position and said, \u25a0\u201c\u2018Joe, you put me in the dozen,\u2019 and the gun said cbumb\u2019 and the boy fell. The boy did not run around by the corner of the house. He didn\u2019t run anywhere; he fell right down there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\">This is the strength of the testimony with reference to whether deceased was dead. My brethren are of opinion that this sufficiently proves the corpus delicti. There is no evidence in thi\u00e1 record of any witness or anybody having seen the body of deceased after the shooting. It was at a turpentine camp where there was quite a number of people. The mother of deceased, who was standing within a few feet of where the shooting occurred, was not placed upon the witness stand and is shown, in fact, to have left Texas and gone to another State. Why some witness was not placed on the stand who saw the body of deceased after it was killed is not explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Article 1084 of our Penal Code reads as follows: \u201cHo person shall be convicted of any grade of homicide <em>unless the body of the deceased or portions of it are found and sufficiently identified to establish the fact of the death, of the person charged to have been killed.\u201d </em>There are quite a number of decisions construing this statute and they are all to the same effect. These are all collated by Mr. Branch in his Ann. Penal Code, under article 1084, above quoted. It is not the purpose of the writer to review these cases. It may be that my brethren are correct, that the evidence is sufficient to show the deceased was killed and to comply with the article above quoted. The mind of the writer is not clear on this subject at all,, but in consonance with the opinion of the majority this judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
