Hildreth, who lived in Blue Ridge, in Collin County, was in Dallas a short time before June 18th to buy an automobile, and there met appellant and so told him. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s automobile was stolen from Cycle Park in Dallas about. 9 or 10 o\u2019clock in the night of June 18th. Later that night appellant, with Will O\u2019Leary, reached Mr. Hildreth\u2019s home with Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s car. Appellant knocked on- Mr. Hildreth\u2019s door, called him out of the bed, and told him, \u201cI have brought you the car.\u201d Mr. Hildreth asked him, \u201cWhat car ?\u201d and he said, \u201cThe car I was telling you about down at Burleson\u2019s\u201d\u2014the place they had met in Dallas. Appellant then tried to sell him' the car. At this time appellant introduced said O\u2019Leary to Mr. Hildreth under the name of Tom Hawkins. After some further parleying, because it was so late, Mr. Hildreth induced them to wait <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>over until morning. Appellant then backed the ear into Mr. Hildreth\u2019s barn, and they remained there-until the next morning. Mr. Hildreth was suspicious of them and early the next morning sent for the constable, who came to his house and arrested them and took charge of the car. The car was later identified as Mr. O\u2019Bourke\u2019s and delivered to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\">Appellant testified that on the night of June 1.8th when he met Hawkins in Dallas, Hawkins already had the car and wanted him to take him to the- man whom he said wanted to buy a car, and he went to Hildreth\u2019s with him. That he had no interest in the car, but Hawkins was to pay him $5 for taking him to Hildreth\u2019s. Hildreth said appellant, that night, told him Hawkins owned the car and had owned it for two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Will O\u2019Leary (Tom Hawkins) swore that appellant met him in Dallas before the night of June 18th and told him \u201che knew where he could sell one (a car) if we could get it.\u201d \u201cHe told me we could sell the car at Blue Ridge.\u201d That on the night of June 18th, about 7:30 or 8 o\u2019clock, they met again, when the subject was again referred to, and appellant told him he would go get some money for gasoline, \u201cand we will go get the car.\u201d That he got $2 and they went arid got the car and drove it to Blue Ridge, with the result as stated. That he did not tell appellant it was his car\u2014\u201che knew it was not my car.\u201d That appellant suggested he take the name of Tom Hawkins; he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t go by your name, because they could identify you.\u201d That they were to split the money, half and half, they were to get for the car.</p>\n<p id=\"AP6\">O\u2019Leary (Hawkins) was an accomplice, arid the judge so told the jury in a proper charge, requiring corroboration. He had already pleaded guilty to stealing said car, but had not been sentenced. The court, therefore, properly overruled appellant\u2019s objection to his competency as a witness. Art. 788, C. C. P., and cases cited in note 19, p. 701, <em>2 </em>Vernon\u2019s Crim. Stats.</p>\n<p id=\"A8Y9\">Appellant has another bill wherein he complains of the testimony of said accomplice witness that he first met appellant in the county jail. This bill is entirely too meager. It does not show the surroundings so as to show error or authorize this court to hold it error. From the testimony of this witness on the subject, if we could look to the statement of facts, we gather that the witness.himself was in jail, confined on some charged offense, and that appellant was there to see him about making bond for him\u2014not himself confined in jail. At any rate it is not shown to he any such error as to justify a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"A_s\">The evidence was sufficient to show that appellant himself, together with O\u2019Leary, actually stole the car. It also raised the question, and was sufficient to show, that he was a principal with O\u2019Leary even if O\u2019Leary himself personally stole the car. Both of these issues were submitted by the court in his charge to the jury, to which charge there was no objection at all. Appellant requested some special charges on the same subject but the court refused to give them, stating thereon that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>he did so because they were embraced in his main charge. The court committed no reversible error in refusing to give his special charges.</p>\n<p id=\"A3r\">The. judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">May 29, 1918.</p>\n<author id=\"b506-8\">PRENDERGAST, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AuC\">In his motion for rehearing and brief thereon appellant contends \u201cthe evidence is not legally sufficient, . . . aside from that of Willie O\u2019Leary, an accomplice, to warrant a conviction,\u201d and that the testimony of the accomplice was not sufficiently corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">The State\u2019s theory and contention was that appellant and O\u2019Leary were principals in the theft of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">The testimony was somewhat fully stated in the original opinion. But it will now be more particularly stated with reference to appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">The evidence establishes that Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s car\u2014automobile,\u2014was stolen from him at -Cycle Park in the City of Dallas in the night of June 18th. On that same night about 10 or 11 o\u2019clock appellant and O\u2019Leary together appeared at Mr. Hildreth\u2019s home at Blue Ridge, in Collin County, with said car. Blue Ridge is more than five miles beyond McKinney from Dallas, perhaps forty or fifty or more miles from Dallas. Early the next morning the ear was recovered from appellant and O\u2019Leary at Mr. Hildreth\u2019s by an officer, who at the time arrested them for the theft of it. The' car was identified and restored to Mr. O\u2019Rourke.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">Mr. Hildreth swore he met appellant first in Dallas May 30 at Mr. Burleson\u2019s. Appellant himself swore this meeting was three or four days before June 18th\u2014the night the car was stolen. He also swore, \u201cWe (O\u2019Leary and himself) left Dallas (for Hildreth\u2019s) on the night of the 18th of June,\u201d with the car. Hildreth further swore: \u201cI saw him (appellant) up about Blue Ridge on the 19th day of- June this year. This red-headed boy (O\u2019Leary) was with him. Smith introduced the red-headed boy to me as Tom Hawkins; that was at my house. They came up there in a Ford car. I talked to this defendant at that time. . . . He drove up to my house and called me up out of bed and wanted to sell me a Ford car. He says, \u2018I have brought you the car.\u2019 I didn\u2019t recognize who he was and I said, \u2018What car?\u2019 He said, \u2018The car I was telling you about down at Burleson\u2019s. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t want any car now; I have a new one,\u2019 and he said, \u2018You would buy a bargain.\u2019 He said, \u201cYou told me you would buy it,\u2019 and I said, \u2018You boys come in and we will fix you a bed and I will look at the car in the morning.\u2019 He insisted that I take a look at it, and then I went out and seen it wasn\u2019t the car recommended to me, and I asked what the price was. They said they wouldn\u2019t go to bed, but would drive in my lot, and I said, \u2018Boys, the barn there is vacant, dover (drive) over there if you want to sleep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>in the car and I will look at the car in the morning. So I suspicioned something, and sent my boy up town to the constable early the next morning and he came down there and arrested them. Mr. Smith was driving the car. Up to that time I had never met O\u2019Leary; I had met Smith, prior to that time. When I met Smith in Dallas he told me he had a friend that had a car down here that had not been run-but a few miles and he would take $375 for it; that was my business down here, to buy a car, and I said, \u2018Where is your friend ?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">On cross-examination he said he didn\u2019t know who drove the car to his house at Blue Bidge. That appellant told him it was a new Ford, had been run only a few miles, \"but I know it was an old car and had been run lots from the looks of it.\u201d That he didn\u2019t know who had possession of the car, \"only Smith (appellant) drove it back to the barn, or backed it in the bam, and then drove out to the pasture the next morning to look at the horse I traded him.\u201d After appellant himself alone failed to sell Hildreth the car that night apparently as his own, he then and not till then told it was O\u2019Leary\u2019s, and falsely stated O\u2019Leary had owned it two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">According to the positive testimony of O\u2019Leary, he and appellant together, as principals, stole the car. He was corroborated in that, immediately after the car was stolen they were together in possession of it, and together at once took it to Mr. Hildreth\u2019s, where appellant himself tried to sell it to Hildreth, whom, in effect, he swore he had staked out to sell it to, and told him, \"I have brought you the car\u201d; and even as between him and O\u2019Leary, what he said and did showed that <em>Tie </em>was in control of the car and not O\u2019Leary. But in any event, that they were together in possession, as against the trae owner and all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Appellant in his own testimony flatly contradicted himself and was flatly contradicted by others. In trying to avoid the fact of his control and possession of the car, he first swore O\u2019Leary got him to go with him in the car to Hildreth\u2019s, and <em>agreed to pay Mm </em>$5 <em>therefor. </em>Then later he swore, \"I was to get nothing out of the proceeds of this car <em>except </em>$5 <em>that Mr. Hildreth was to pay ms for my trouble. O\u2019Leary was not to pay me anything at all.\u201d </em>O\u2019Leary swore he and appellant were to divide equally what they got for it. Appellant swore he went with O\u2019Leary to Hildreth\u2019s with the car, but did not try to sell it\u2014he only introduced O\u2019Leary to Hildreth as Tom Hawkins.. As shown above, by Hildreth\u2019s evidence, appellant alone at first tried to sell the car to Hildreth, and pressed him to buy that night, and that appellant was in control of the car as to O\u2019Leary. <em>He </em>drove it to Hildreth\u2019s\u2014at least did not deny doing so, and after <em>he </em>failed to induce Hildreth to buy that night <em>he </em>ran or backed it into the barn, and next morning <em>he </em>drove the car into the pasture to see the horse, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">O\u2019Leary, the accomplice, swore he did not steal the car alone, but that he and appellant, before stealing it, agreed to do so, to sell it to Hildreth, whom appellant had staked out to sell it to, and that they went together, and together did steal it, and together took it to Hildreth\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The evidence was amply sufficient to show that appellant and O\u2019Leary were principals in stealing the car, and that O\u2019Leary was sufficiently corroborated under the statute and decisions thereunder.-</p>\n<p id=\"ARB\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
