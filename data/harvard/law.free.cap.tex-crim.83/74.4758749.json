Rep., 190, the definition of \u201chabitual\u201d is quoted as follows: \u201cFormed or acquired by or resulting from habit, frequent use, or custom; formed by repeated impressions.\u201d The court says: \u201cThe statute requires, where the parties do not live together, that the proof must show habitual intercourse, and not merely occasional acts.\u201d A similar interpretation of the word \u201chabitual\u201d as used in the statutes has been, made in various cases cited in Words &amp; Phrases, vol. <em>2 </em>(2nd series), p. 816. From the decisions of this court we understand that proof of occasional acts of carnal intercourse does not alone prove habitual carnal intercourse; that is to say, where the State relies alone upon proof of specific instances of a limited number of acts of this character, and where the evidence excludes the idea that there were other acts, and where there are no attending circumstances upon which to found the inference that the intercourse was habitual, the proof is not sufficient. It is to be remembered, however, that in this class of cases it is generally necessary to depend, at least in part, upon circumstantial evidence to establish the offense. 25 Cyc., 215. And occasional acts of illicit intercourse are potent circumstances when accompanied by other proof tending to show that the relation was habitual, and when so attended and lead to a conviction, it would be sustained) although the number of actual acts proved is very limited, or even proved alone by circumstances. In this case, as we understand the facts, there is no contention there were other acts, or evidence of other acts, or other relationship than that which is testified to by the accomplice and above detailed, corroborated to the extent and in the manner stated, and it would seem that this proof would, under the decisions of this court, classify the transactions as occasional rather than habitual, and render it proper to order a reversal of the judgment of the court below, which is accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
