It is contended, however, that the evidence is not sufficient. The State\u2019s testimony shows a sale by the defendant to the alleged purchaser, Collins. Collins testified that he bought a quart and a half, or a quart and a pint of whisky from appellant and paid him $3.75 for it. Appellant denies the transaction. This formed an issue of fact for solution by the jury. Hnder this condition of the record we would not feel justified in reversing the case. The judgment, therefore, will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-18\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
