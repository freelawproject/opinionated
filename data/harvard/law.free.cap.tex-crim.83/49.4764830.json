Article 635, Penal Code, prescribes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>any person who unlawfully solicits orders for intoxicating liquors is a vagrant. The complaint and information herein, among other things, in one count, alleges that on or about September 1, 1917, and thence continuously to the day of the filing of the information (which was on September 13th), appellant \u201cdid then and there unlawfully solicit orders for intoxicating liquors.\u201d Neither the complaint nor information alleged that prohibition was in force or ever had been in Hill County, where the soliciting was alleged to have been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The only law known to us which makes it unlawful to solicit orders for intoxicating liquors is article 606e, stated above. There was no testimony showing that prohibition was in force in Hill County, even if this could have been proven without alleging it. The court by his charge expressly authorizes appellant\u2019s conviction for unlawfully soliciting orders for intoxicating liquors without any evidence that prohibition was in force. Appellant objected to this in various ways and made and saved the point in every particular. The court\u2019s charge, therefore, authorizing appellant\u2019s conviction on this count was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The court\u2019s charge to the effect that if the jury believed the .defendant is not guilty under either count of the indictment, is objectionable and was properly objected to. .This charge, in the language used, rather places the burden upon appellant of proving his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">It is always permissible to impeach a witness by showing that he has been convicted, when not too remote, of any felony or any misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, but it is not permissible to thus impeach any witness by proving his prosecution or conviction of any other misdemeanor. The State was permitted over appellant\u2019s objection to prove by him that he had before been convicted for bootlegging. It is always understood that by bootlegging it meant illegally selling intoxicating liquor in prohibition territory. It might, or might not, be a felony in the given territory. Appellant\u2019s bill objecting to this does not show whether appellant\u2019s conviction was for a misdemeanor or a felony, and hence we can not tell from his bill whether this testimony is admissible or not for impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Reversed and remanded. <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
