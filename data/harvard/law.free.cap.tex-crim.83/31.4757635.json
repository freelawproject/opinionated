We are of opinion this contention is correct. In order to constitute theft from the person under article 1350, Branch\u2019s Penal Code, page 1369, the indictment must allege specifically that the property was taken from the person of another. That article reads thus: \u201cIf any person shall commit theft by privately stealing from the person of another, he shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than seven years.\u201d To constitute this offense, article 1351, Penal Code, provides that the theft must be from the person. It is not sufficient that it be merely in the presence or possession of the party from whom it was taken. It is unnecessary to repeat further provisions of the latter named article. The allegation in the indictment may be as readily \u25a0applied to constructive as to actual dr personal possession. This crime .is said by the decisions to be more nearly in line with robbery than any nther species of theft. In- order to constitute robbery under the terms of the definition it is necessary to take property from the person by force or violence, by the use of firearms, etc. It is not sufficient that it be taken from the possession of the party under a charge of theft from the person. \u2022 It must be taken from the person. Possession by the person of property may be exercised in many ways, and under the law is constituted in various ways. In Jones v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 387, it was specifically held that property must be taken from the person; that no other means of taking it would constitute theft from the person. It is a familiar rule of construction that where the statute uses words, \u25a0those same words must be used in the indictment, and if not, then 'words of similar or more potent force than those used in the statute must be employed in order to charge the offense. Applying that rule, this indictment is not sufficient. The property may be in the possession of a person and yet not be upon his person or in manual or bodily possession. It will not do to hold nor does the statute contemplate that possession in the person of the .alleged owner is-sufficient. It must be upon and taken from his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">For the reasons indicated the indictment is held to be insufficient and the judgment is reversed .and the prosecution .ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b62-7\">PRENDERGAST, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Asb\">(dissenting).\u2014My opinion in the companion case of Willie Johnson, this day delivered, is my dissenting opinion in this as well as in that case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
