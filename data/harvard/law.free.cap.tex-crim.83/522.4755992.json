The motion to dismiss, filed hy the State, is based upon this defect. This motion, under the decisions of this State, must he sustained. Art. 903, C. C. P.; White v. State, 68 Texas Crim. Rep., 147, 151 S. W. Rep., 826; Watson v. State, 62 Texas Crim.

The evidence shows that appellant inflicted a wound upon the injured party named in the indictment by stabbing or cutting with a pocketknife. The evidence is quite meager as to the character of the knife and the character of the wound. It does appear, however, that with a pocketknife he stabbed the party named in the breast near the nipple, inflicting a wound about an eighth of an inch in length, striking the sixth rib on the left side of the body, ranging upward. The record discloses no extenuating circumstances except that the appellant is an aged man, and we fail to find the record in condition to authorize this court to disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The order heretofore entered dismissing the appeal is set aside in response to the motion for rehearing and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
