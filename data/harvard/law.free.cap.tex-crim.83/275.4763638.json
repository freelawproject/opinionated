Either or both of the grounds stated in the statute could have been alleged, if the words of the statute and the allegations are of equal significance.

In order to charge the offense the pleading must aver that the driver or operator shall wilfully collide with or cause injury to \u2018another person, or such collision shall be through gross negligence, otherwise the offense would not be set forth in the terms and definition of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">The complaint charges that appellant \u201cdid then and there unlawfully in and upon Miss Alice Cook, Miss Bennie Cook, and Dewey Cook, make an aggravated assault by then and there carelessly and negligently colliding with a vehicle,\u201d etc. The information follows the complaint. Motion in arrest of judgment was overruled. It should have been sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>tained. The complaint and information do not charge that appellant either wilfully or with gross negligence collided with the vehicle. The pleader should have charged that the accused did so wilfully collide, or did with gross negligence so collide. He may incorporate both or only one of the grounds or causes specified, but he must in defining either or both follow the language of the statute. We have a rule, however, that where the statutory words are not followed in the pleading that those employed must be of equal or greater significance than those employed in the statute. It is evident from reading the pleading that this rule was disregarded. The word \u201cwilfully\u201d nowhere occurs in the pleading, and where the pleader undertook to charge \u201cnegligence,\u201d he only uses the language that he \u201ccarelessly and negligently collided.\u201d This does not charge \u201cgross negligence.\u201d The language is neither tantamount nor equal , to the language in the statute, but is of much less significance. Under the pleading it would take less evidence to convict than under the statutory definition. We are of opinion, therefore, the motion in arrest of judgment should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The pleading being insufficient to sustain the charge under the statute mentioned, the judgment will be reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">PRENDERGAST, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
