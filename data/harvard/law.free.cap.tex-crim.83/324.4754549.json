The State has made a motion to strike it out and not consider it. Under the statutes and the many and uniform decisions of this court the State\u2019s motion must be granted. A great number of cases down to the present time could be cited but we deem it unnecessary. We here cite some of them: Hargrave v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 147; Essary v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 596; Baird v. State, 51 Texas Crim. Rep., 322; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Brown v. State, 57 Texas Crim. Rep., 269; King v. State, 57 Texas Crim.

State, 71 Texas Crim. Rep., 369; Stephens v. State, 77 Texas Crim. Rep., 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Appellant made a motion for a continuance and he has some very defective and incomplete bills to the admission of certain testimony. Hone of these matters can be considered in the absence of a statement of facts as has all the time been held by this court in a great number of decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Hence, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
