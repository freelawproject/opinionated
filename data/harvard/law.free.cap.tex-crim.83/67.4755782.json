It is not unlawful to practice medicine, but it is unlawful to do so without compliance with the statute. The offense is a practice of medicine without compliance with the statute, and the burden is upon the State to prove the offense. There will be found decisions of other States holding, under certain circumstances, the burden of making proof of authority to practice medicine is not upon' the State because a fact within the peculiar knowledge of the accused. 30 Cyc., 1567. Such is not the case here, as the statute itself prescribes a rule of evidence making the absence' of the record prima facie evidence of the want of such certificate, and requiring that the certificate be recorded in the county in which the accused is residing at the time renders it easy for the State to make the proof of records of \"the particular county. The failure to make the proof in this instance characterizes the evidence as insufficient. The appellant\u2019s suggestion that the evidence shows that the occupation in which' he was engaged was that of a masseur and exempted by article 754, Penal Code, from the provisions of article 750, Penal Code, can not, we think, be sustained as a matter of law. The character of his occupation was a question of fact. See Words &amp; Phrases, vol. 3 (2d series), p. 113; Newman v. State, 72 Texas Crim. Rep., 367; Dankworth v. State, 61 Texas Crim.
