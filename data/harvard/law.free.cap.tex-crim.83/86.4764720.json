The charge is criticised, however, in the motion for new trial, but nothing is presented of such a nature as could bring in review the court\u2019s action. There is no error fundamental in its character mentioned. It is contended that the evidence is not sufficient. The State\u2019s case places appellant in such relation 'to the burglary that the jury was justified in reaching the conclusion that he assisted in the burglary, and if he did not enter the house, was present aiding and encouraging those who went in. He took the stand and testified in his own behalf. Even under his testimony we think the facts are sufficient to show that he was a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-19\">The judgment will be affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
