We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">According to the testimony of the complaining witness, Jane,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in January of 1990, the defendant \u2014 who had been living with Jane, her mother, and two sisters since Jane was very young, and to whom she referred throughout the trial as her \u201cstepfather\u201d \u2014 began coming into her bedroom late at night, after arriving home from work. Bom on October 22, 1981, Jane was nine years old when the defendant began to kiss and lick or suck her \u201ctitties.\u201d Some weeks later, the defendant began to put his hands in her pants and his finger in her vagina; he also licked and put his tongue into her vagina. Jane testified that the sexual encounters, which \u201cshocked and scared\u201d her, took place approximately twice each week, continuing until just before her fourteenth birthday. During the encounters, Jane said she would sometimes move or turn away, but that the defendant persisted. A few times, Jane called out \u201cMommy.\u201d Sometimes the sexual encounters occurred while her little sister slept in the same bed as Jane, and Jane would try to kick or nudge her awake. If her sister woke up, and on one occasion when her mother came into the bedroom, the defendant would pretend he was just checking on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The final incident occurred in October of 1995, when, according to Jane\u2019s testimony, the defendant \u201cput his penis in me \u2014 He pulled my pants down, and he tried to put his penis in me, and I moved.\u201d Jane said the defendant\u2019s penis was \u201ctouching my vagina,\u201d that he pushed down once or twice, and that \u201c[i]t hurt a little bit.\u201d Just after her fourteenth birthday, Jane and the defendant had a conversation during which he asked her if she \u201cliked what he did to [her] at nighttime.\u201d Jane testified, \u201cI told him, \u2018No\u2019 and to stop. And he said, \u2018Okay.\u2019 And he got mad and he left.\u201d After this conversation, the defendant did not sexually touch Jane again.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Jane told no one of these incidents until around the third week of January, 1996, when she confided in her best friend, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>who then relayed to an adult what Jane had told her. The defendant was arrested the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">There was no direct evidence corroborating Jane\u2019s testimony. The theory of defense was that Jane fabricated the story of sexual abuse because she resented the restrictions placed upon her by her mother and the defendant, and wished to live with her father where she was allowed to come in late, have friends over, and, most significantly, have a boyfriend. Defense counsel, expanding on this theory, argued in closing that when a person, who may have been related to the defendant, saw Jane being hugged by a boy and yelled to her that, \u201cHe\u2019s not supposed to be hugging you,\u201d Jane decided to leave her mother\u2019s house and to fabricate the tale of sexual abuse in order to accomplish this goal. She then told her best friend about the sexual abuse in order to test out her story, and so that her friend would tell others.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\"><em>Exclusion of evidence. </em>During cross-examination of Jane, the defendant sought to introduce a statement in Jane\u2019s medical record dated October 1, 1988, that purported to establish that Jane had previously disclosed a sexual assault to her doctor, and that her mother knew about it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the evidence was relevant to refuting Jane\u2019s claim that she had not disclosed the defendant\u2019s abuse earlier because she felt ashamed to do so. The defendant \u201cfails to support his . . . argument^ [that it was error to exclude the hearsay statement] with any case or statutory law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hrycenko, </em>417 Mass. 309, 319 (1994). See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). In any case, \u201c[w]hether evidence is legally relevant is a question which is generally left to the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chasson, </em>383 Mass. 183, 187 (1981). It is within the judge\u2019s discretion to exclude evidence that is too remote in time or too speculative, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>430 Mass. 111, 116 (1999), and, here, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>Restriction on cross-examination. </em>The defendant next claims it was error to exclude questions on cross-examination of Jane about an allegation she made to a teacher that her mother had been neglecting her and that she wanted to be removed from the house. Jane allegedly made this accusation when she was eight years old, i.e., \u201cat the time that [the abuse] allegedly was beginning.\u201d According to defense counsel, \u201cwhen no one believed her, she was returned to the home. And she admitted that she lied, and she was returned to the home.\u201d The defendant argues that the evidence went to the heart of Jane\u2019s motive to lie, i.e., her previous fabrication not having been enough to get her out of the defendant\u2019s house, she now had to come up with a stronger scenario, one not directed at her mother, to do the job. The defendant claims that the exclusion impermissibly curtailed his cross-examination of Jane.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We think that there was not a sufficient showing of a nexus between the excluded evidence and the defense\u2019s theory of fabrication, and that \u201cthis lack of linking evidence, together with what was in the circumstances a significant passage of time, provided sufficient grounds for the judge in his discretion to exclude [the questions] as lacking probative value.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chasson, </em>383 Mass. at 187. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 291, 295 (1995) (absent evidence or basis for inquiry, it was proper to limit cross-examination of rape victim and her friend regarding a statement allegedly made by the victim to her friend that she feared a physical examination to establish her virginity; judge was warranted in concluding that such cross-examination \u201cwould only invite the jury \u2018to indulge in conjecture and supposition\u2019 \u201d). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\"><em>Improper closing argument. </em>The defendant claims that various statements made by the prosecutor in closing argument constituted improper vouching for the victim\u2019s credibility, misstated evidence, suggested facts not in evidence, and attacked the character of a witness. The defendant preserved some of these claims by objecting at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u201cWhen a defendant objects to the prosecutor\u2019s statements made during a closing argument, the standard for determining whether a conviction must be reversed because of inappropriate statements is whether the improper statements made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>prosecutor \u2018constituted prejudicial error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 515 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>416 Mass. 347, 352 n.5 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">a. <em>Vouching for witness\u2019s credibility. </em>The defendant objected at trial to the prosecutor\u2019s comment regarding Jane\u2019s testimony, that \u201c[s]he didn\u2019t have to subject herself to the humiliation of talking to countless strangers about horribly embarrassing personal experiences in her young life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The statement made by the prosecutor is similar to one discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Krepon, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 945 (1992), that we concluded did not constitute improper vouching. There, the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument included this comment on the victim\u2019s testimony: \u201cWhat reason would [the victim] have to come into this courtroom, stand on that witness stand, and testify before fourteen people about all of this if this were pure fantasy . . . ? What is her motive?\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Krepon, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 946. Here, because the complainant\u2019s credibility was at issue, the prosecutor was entitled to \u201cargue from the evidence why a witness should be believed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>430 Mass. at 119 (citations omitted). Further the prosecutor put the argument in context by stating, \u201c[n]ow, it is up to you to decide, in a few moments, after the judge gives you some instructions, you are going to have a chance, for the first time, ... to decide this case on the facts and evidence that you heard.\u201d Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Krepon, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 946-947.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">b. <em>Misstatement of evidence. </em>During closing argument, counsel for the defendant, pointing to alleged inconsistencies in Jane\u2019s testimony, said that Jane had lied when \u201cshe said[] her mother raped her. She put her fingers inside of her vagina,\u201d and that Jane had not previously told anyone that her mother had put her fingers inside of her, suggesting that Jane was not credible. The prosecutor responded in his closing to this characterization of the evidence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by arguing: \u201cWas she suggesting, in some way, that her mother was raping her? Ladies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>gentleman, common sense; what is your memory of that? What she was saying was, \u2018My mother saw something. It was weird. I don\u2019t know why she was doing what she was doing, but she put her hands in my pants.\u2019 \u201d The prosecution\u2019s appeal to the jury to use \u201ccommon sense,\u201d and his characterization of what Jane\u2019s testimony likely meant, was a rhetorical device, and in the context of the entire argument, was not improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 896 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s earlier summary of Jane\u2019s testimony in this regard was also not a misstatement. The prosecutor said that Jane had testified, \u201cI don\u2019t know what my mother saw. All I know is, after he left the room, my mother came over and put her hands in my pants,\u201d and that she had denied, in cross-examination, saying her mother had put her fingers in her vagina, that she had put them in her pants. The jury could not have been misled into thinking that the prosecutor was giving them a verb\u00e1tim quote of Jane\u2019s statements. This was not an inaccurate summary of the testimony, and it was permissible for the prosecutor to focus on those aspects of Jane\u2019s somewhat equivocal statements regarding her mother\u2019s actions. Further, the judge instructed the jury to consider only the evidence introduced at trial, and the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not impinge on their prerogative to weigh the evidence. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 517 (1987) (\u201cA certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>measure of jury sophistication in sorting out excessive claims on both sides fairly may be assumed\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 308 (1992) (evidence misquoted, but error harmless because we assume some measure of jury sophistication in ability to sort out hyperbole and speculation).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">c. <em>Facts not in evidence. </em>The defendant claims that the prosecutor made two arguments that were not based on evidence at trial. The defendant preserved below his claim that the prosecutor impermissibly argued at closing that Jane\u2019s mother could have gotten a ride to Boston for her daughter\u2019s counseling sessions from one of the \u201cfifteen or so people sitting in the back of the courtroom.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We agree that the prosecutor\u2019s statement strayed beyond the logical conclusions that are permissible to draw from testimony submitted at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>430 Mass. at 118-119. There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that any of the people sitting in the courtroom were among those Jane\u2019s mother had asked for a ride. We note, however, that the judge instructed the jury both at the outset of trial and in his charge that a closing argument is not evidence and that the jurors were responsible for assessing the credibility of the evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>401 Mass. 109, 117 (1987). Further, the comment did not go to the heart of the matter, but only to a collateral issue, i.e., that of possible bias of Jane\u2019s mother, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. at 518, and did not prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The defendant also claims prejudice from the prosecutor\u2019s statements that Jane\u2019s mother was in \u201cdenial\u201d and that \u201cshe must have seen something. She could have realized what was going on, but she didn\u2019t want to believe it.\u201d The defendant did not raise this issue below.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s comment was an appropriate response to the closing argument of defense counsel, in which defense counsel argued that Jane\u2019s mother was a credible witness in part based on her tearful denials in response to his questions as to whether she had ever seen the defendant touch her daughter in a sexual way. The prosecutor\u2019s argument was grounded in the evidence, and permissibly focused the jury on the issue of her credibility. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>430 Mass. at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">d. <em>Attack on character of witness. </em>Also for the first time on appeal, the defendant raises the additional claim that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument went too far by calling one of the defense witnesses, \u201cnothing more than a seventeen-year-old punk; ... a stooge who was brought in here; that he wouldn\u2019t know the truth about what was going on in that household, if it hit him across the face.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s comment was in reference to the testimony of Jose Binet, who, testifying for the defense, said that after hearing about Jane\u2019s allegations from his mother, he had approached Jane in the school cafeteria, asked her whether the defendant \u201cha[d] sex with her\u201d and that she had replied, \u201cNo.\u201d The defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statements consisted of an attack on the character of the witness and that there was no evidence supporting the statements that Jose was a \u201cpunk\u201d or a \u201cstooge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument went too far. We have cautioned counsel for the Commonwealth to avoid prejudicial name-calling. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 451, 452-453 (1978) (referring to the defendant as a \u201cwild animal\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 592 (1983). Because the defendant failed to object to these statements at trial, our inquiry is limited \u201cto whether they created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Car-mona, </em>428 Mass. 268, 273 (1998). \u201cIn making this analysis we must view the prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u2018considering the argument as a whole, the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, and the evidence produced at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>On this basis, we conclude there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The name is fictitious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The medical record is handwritten and some words are not legible. The relevant paragraph is set out as follows: \u201c[illegible] No serious illnesses/ accidents 0 allergies 0 meds, [illegible] dentist. Discussed SA - [\u2018no\u2019 or \u2018wo\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019] - little boy in school last yr touched her \u2014 mom raised a fuss. PE Totally [illegible].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\">During direct testimony, Jane stated that, at a point during the period the defendant was coming into her room at night and sexually touching her, her mother walked into the bedroom while the defendant was licking her vagina. The defendant pretended that he \u201cwas just checking on [her],\u201d and left the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>room, while her mother \u201cpretend[ed] that she didn\u2019t see.\u201d Jane testified that her mother then came over and \u201claid down in the bed with me, and she put her hand inside my pants. I don\u2019t know what she was doing. She, like, put her fingers in my vagina. She just, like, touched it. I don\u2019t know what she did. Then, she just left.\u201d When asked on cross-examination whether her mother had put her fingers in Jane\u2019s vagina, she said \u201cNot inside of me. I didn\u2019t mean inside of me. I mean, she touched me.\u201d The prosecutor then asked, \u201cOkay. But, you said, yesterday, that she put her fingers in your vagina?\u201d Jane answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">We adhere to the notion that counsel for <em>both </em>parties may not engage in prejudicial characterizations of evidence, or argue conclusions not logically drawn from the evidence at trial. See Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 1860-1868 (2d ed. 1983), and cases cited. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dowdy, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 502 (1994) (Brown, J., dissenting) (\u201ca plethora of opinions have rained down upon both defense counsel and prosecutor, warning, threatening, and admonishing\u201d about propriety of closing arguments). Defense counsel\u2019s characterization of Jane\u2019s testimony as a claim that her mother had raped her was unwarranted, and had it come from the prosecution would rightly have given rise to a claim of prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">When asked by the prosecutor whether she recalled having failed to show up on several occasions for counseling sessions with Jane, after Jane had made the allegation of sexual abuse and had gone to live with her father, Jane\u2019s mother responded that she did not have a car and, having just learned to drive, could not drive around Boston. The prosecutor then asked, \u201cAnd with all the family and with all the friends you have up here, you couldn\u2019t find anybody to give you a ride down to Boston, so you could sit in with your daughter on a counseling meeting. Is that what you\u2019re telling us?\u201d She replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t find nobody. Everybody works, sir.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aef\">(concurring). Although I still adhere to the views set out in my dissent in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Dowdy, 36 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 501-503 (1994) (Brown, J., dissenting), I concur, albeit reluctantly, only because I am \u201csubstantially confident that, if the [unbridled comments] had not been made, the jury verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>433 Mass. 617, 626 (2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The instant case pushes the outer limits of what this court found permissible in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Krepon, 32 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 945, 946 (1992). I repeat my usual refrain: It is long past time for attorneys, both defense and prosecution, to have to be reminded not to stray recklessly outside the bounds of proper argument. In this regard, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>370 Mass. 591, 597 (1976), where <em>twenty-five years ago </em>the court reversed and admonished a \u201cprosecutor [who] repeatedly and deliberately sailed unnecessarily close to the wind.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
