Maher sustained serious injury and permanent disability. Chase, a resident of New Hampshire, was driving an automobile owned by his parents, also residents of New Hampshire. The automobile was insured under a \u201cNew Hampshire Family Policy\u201d (policy) and registered in New Hampshire. The parties agree that New Hampshire law controls the interpretation of the policy. <em>Kahn </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>429 Mass. 572, 575 (1999). <em>Avemco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aerotech, Ltd., </em>677 F. Supp. 35, 37-38 (D. Mass. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Maher filed suit against Chase and others, seeking to \u201cstack\u201d the bodily injury coverage of the two other automobiles owned by the Chase family with the coverage of the automobile involved in the accident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company (Hartford) then moved to intervene, Mass.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2), 365 Mass. 769 (1974), seeking a declaration of rights with regard to the policy and moved for summary judgment. After a hearing, a Superior Court judge granted the motion and Maher appealed. We conclude that stacking bodily injury liability coverage was not permitted by the Chase family policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">1. <em>New Hampshire law. </em>Interpretation of language in an insurance policy presents a question of law for the court. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Guaranty Trust Life Ins. Co., </em>132 N.H. 337, 340 (1989). Unambiguous language is given its natural and ordinary meaning. <em>Coakley </em>v. <em>Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co., </em>136 N.H. 402, 410 (1992). Where there is ambiguity, the language is construed in favor of the insured. <em>Ibid. </em>New Hampshire honors the reasonable expectations of the insured. <em>Trombly </em>v. <em>Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>120 N.H. 764, 771 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">There are no statutes and no reported decisions in New Hampshire addressing the stacking of bodily injury liability coverage. The New Hampshire Supreme Court has stated, with respect to uninsured or underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>age, that intra-policy stacking is permitted unless the insurance company has limited its liability for stacking through clear and unambiguous language in the policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cacavas </em>v. <em>Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co., </em>128 N.H. 204, 208 (1986). <em>Green Mountain Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>131 N.H. 762, 768 (1989). <em>United Servs. Auto. Assn. </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>132 N.H. 439, 443-446 (1989). Maher claims that, because no such limitation of liability was included with regard to bodily injury liability coverage, New Hampshire law would permit stacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">2. <em>Stacking bodily injury liability coverage. </em>Although no case in New Hampshire specifically prohibits the stacking of bodily injury liability coverage, our review of New Hampshire case law reveals that the principle of stacking has been applied only to UM/UIM or medical payment coverage. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>United Servs. Auto. Assn., </em>120 N.H. 106, 108 (1980). <em>Cacavas </em>v. <em>Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co. </em>128 N.H. at 205, 207-208. See <em>Green Mountain Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>131 N.H. at 768; <em>United Servs. Auto. Assn. </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>132 N.H. at 443; <em>Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>138 N.H. 229, 231-233 (1994). The reason courts have limited stacking to UI/UIM and medical payment coverage lies in the nature of the coverage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The Supreme Court of New Hampshire has noted that UM/ UIM was a legislative innovation designed to protect the public which has been interpreted liberally. <em>Hein </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>106 N.H. 378, 381 (1965). See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 264.15 (1999 &amp; Supp. 2000) (current codification of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>statute cited in <em>Hein). </em>UM/UIM and medical payment coverages provide direct benefits to the insured, not to third parties, and are provided pursuant to a contract with the insured. <em>Kirouac </em>v. Healey, 104 N.H. 157, 160 (1962). <em>Hein </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., supra. </em>Bodily injury coverage is liability insurance that protects the policy holder from liability to others and obligates the insurance company to pay third parties on behalf of the insured. Some courts have reasoned that bodily injury liability coverage \u201cfollows the vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See generally 12 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 169:109 &amp; n.64, at 198-199 (3d ed. 1998), and cases cited. Compare <em>Cacavas </em>v. <em>Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co., </em>128 N.H. at 206 (\u201c[ujninsured motorist coverage is not linked to a particular vehicle\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">UM/UIM coverage may be stacked in the absence of clear anti-stacking language because the insured reasonably expects protection against the uninsured or underinsured motorist, to the amount for which the insured paid premiums. <em>Ibid. </em>This rationale does not apply to injured third parties. Maher did not purchase the policy and was not a party to the contract. She, therefore, could have no expectation of benefit in the policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">3. <em>Ambiguity in the policy. </em>Maher further argues that the presence of anti-stacking language in the endorsement with regard to Ul/UIM and medical payment coverage, coupled with the absence of anti-stacking language in the endorsement with regard to bodily injury liability coverage, created an ambiguity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Policy terms are ambiguous \u201conly when the parties may reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>ably differ about their interpretation.\u201d <em>Holey </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>129 N.H. 512, 514 (1987) (citation omitted). The language limiting bodily injury liability coverage was clear. The declarations page expressly stated the per person and per accident limits and the bodily injury liability coverage provision clearly stated that it limited the bodily injury coverage to the per person and per accident limits in the declaration. Only one of the three automobiles covered in the Chase policy was involved in the accident; therefore, only $100,000 of bodily injury coverage is available to Maher.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">4. <em>The separability clause. </em>Maher claims the language in the \u201climit of liability\u201d clause in the Chase policy is identical to language found to be ambiguous by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in <em>Cacavas, </em>and when coupled with the separability clause,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> created an ambiguity which should be resolved against Hartford to permit intra-policy stacking of bodily injury coverage. <em>Cacavas </em>v. <em>Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co., </em>128 N.H. at 207. Again, Maher relies solely on cases addressing UI/UIM or medical payment coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">A significant number of jurisdictions have found that separability clauses similar to the one in the Chase policy created no ambiguity when interpreted with regard to bodily injury liability coverage and merely rendered the policy applicable to whichever of the insured cars was involved in the accident.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Greer </em>v. <em>Associated Indem. Corp., </em>371 F.2d 29, 32-33 (5th Cir. 1967). <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mole, </em>414 F.2d 204, 205 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>1969). <em>Basso </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>19 Ariz. App. 58, 60 (1973). <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>350 So. 2d 1161, 1162-1163 (Fla. App. 1977). <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Zellars, </em>462 S.W.2d 550, 554 (Tex. 1970). <em>Pacific Indent. Co. </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>56 Wash. 2d 715, 716 (1960). <em>Rosar </em>v. <em>General Ins. Co. of America, </em>163 N.W.2d 129, 131 (Wis. 1968). We do not think that <em>Cacavas </em>or <em>Concord </em>suggest that the New Hampshire courts would conclude otherwise. See <em>Cacavas </em>v. <em>Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co., </em>128 N.H. at 206-208; <em>Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>138 N.H. at 231-233.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>New Hampshire case law permitting stacking applies only to UM/UIM or medical payment coverage. The Chase Family Policy limits liability with regard to bodily injury coverage to $100,000 per person.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b45-7\">In this context, stacking refers to \u201cthe phenomenon of insureds or claimants against them adding all available [coverages contained in a single policy] together to create a greater pool in order to satisfy their actual loss.\u201d 12 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 169:4 (3d ed. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Under the terms of the insurance policy issued to the Chase family, the insurance company agreed to pay \u201con behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of . . . bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom, hereinafter called \u2018bodily injury,\u2019 sustained by any person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">The declaration page which listed the three Chase family automobiles stated: \u201cWith respect to each automobile to which coverage applies, the insurance afforded is only with respect to such and so many of the coverages as are indicated by specific premium charge or charges. With respect to each such automobile, the limits of the company\u2019s liability against each such coverage shall be as stated herein, subject to all the terms of this policy having reference thereto.\u201d The limits were shown as $100,000 for each injured person and $300,000 for each occurrence. If Maher were permitted to stack the policies, she could collect the $100,000 bodily injury liability coverage for each vehicle, for a total of $300,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Intra-policy stacking refers to stacking coverages for multiple vehicles insured under one policy.
