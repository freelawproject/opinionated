(KMS),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Patrick Forte (Forte), VKK Corporation (VKK), and FWM Corporation (FWM). The plaintiff sought a declaration that it was not obliged under a general liability insurance policy (policy) it issued to KMS to reimburse KMS for legal fees or to indemnify the defendants in an action brought by a former employee of KMS against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The defendants answered Transamerica\u2019s complaint and, in addition, filed a three-count counterclaim against Transamerica and K&amp;K Insurance Group, Inc. (K&amp;K), the administrator of the insurance policy at issue. The counterclaim requested a declaration that the insurance policy Transamerica issued to KMS did require Transamerica to defend and indemnify the defendants (count III). It also claimed that Transamerica had violated the terms of the policy (count I) and had engaged in unfair claim settlement practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A, and G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (count II). Transamerica and K&amp;K filed respective replies each denying liability and setting forth various defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Transamerica moved for summary judgment on its complaint, and Transamerica and K&amp;K also moved for summary judgment on the defendants\u2019 counterclaim. The defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment on counts I and II of their counterclaim. After a hearing, a Superior Court judge entered an order declaring that the policy did not obligate Transamerica to defend or indemnify the defendants in regard to the employee\u2019s claim and subsequently issued an amended order allowing Transamerica\u2019s and K&amp;K\u2019s summary judgment motion and denying the defendants\u2019 motion. The defendants appealed from the ensuing judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">We summarize the facts contained in the materials before the motion judge. Between May 9, 1991, and July 6, 1992, KMS was covered by a general liability insurance policy issued by Transamerica that included, among other provisions, a broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>form comprehensive general liability endorsement (CGLE).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the CGLE, Transamerica contracted to pay, on behalf of the insured, \u201call sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury ... to which this insurance applies . . . ,\u201d and to \u201cdefend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such injury even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false, or fraudulent. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A set of definitions in section 11(D) of the CGLE defined \u201cpersonal injury\u201d to mean \u201cinjury arising out of one or more of the following offenses committed during the policy period: . . . 3. a publication or utterance (a) of a libel or slander or other defamatory or disparaging material, or (b) in violation of an individual\u2019s right to privacy. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">On or about April 3, 1992, Carolyn Palla, a former employee of KMS and a resident of Rhode Island, filed a four-count complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against KMS, Forte, VKK, and FWM. In her complaint, Palla alleged claims for unlawful discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 151B (count I); breach of an employment contract (count II); intentional infliction of emotional distress (count PD); and assault and battery (count IV).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">According to the complaint, the defendant Forte was vice-president of administration for KMS, and Palla had been employed as his assistant from June 24, 1991, until October 29, 1991. The complaint alleged that Palla was subject to various forms of sexual harassment by Forte \u201cincluding physical touching and verbal propositions and comments\u201d throughout the term of her employment. The unwanted touching included Forte hugging and kissing her on several occasions and, on one occasion, placing his hand inside the back of Palla\u2019s skirt on the pretext of fixing the zipper on her skirt. The unwelcome physical contact occurred at work and also, on one occasion, after work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>at a nearby establishment with other employees present. The harassing comments consisted of numerous unwanted questions about her relationship with her boyfriend, calling her \u201ccupcake,\u201d and complimenting her appearance. Her complaint also alleged that, after she rejected Forte\u2019s advances, a rumor circulated in the workplace that she was having an affair with Forte. She further alleged that KMS \u201ccondoned and ratified [Forte\u2019s] misconduct and took no action to stop it or to discourage discriminatory sexually harassing conduct . . .\u201d and that \u201cshe was ultimately dismissed because she refused to submit to further harassment or to engage in sexual conduct with Forte.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In June of 1992, the defendants asked Transamerica to indemnify them against Falla\u2019s claims and to provide a defense to her complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By letter dated July 9, 1992, Transamerica denied coverage on the ground that the employee\u2019s allegations were not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Falla\u2019s suit was eventually settled. On February 25, 1993, the defendants notified Transamerica that the costs of defending and settling Falla\u2019s claim amounted to approximately $227,000, and made formal demand for coverage pursuant to G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D. Transamerica then filed this complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we determine \u201cwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974).\u201d <em>Judson </em>v. <em>Essex Agric. &amp; Technical Inst., </em>418 Mass. 159, 162 (1994), quoting from <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). \u201cHere, where both parties moved for summary judgment, and the evidence taken in the light most favorable to [the defendants] entitled Transamerica [and K&amp;K] to a judgment as a matter of law ... the judge properly granted Transamerica\u2019s [and K&amp;K\u2019s] summary judgment motion and properly denied [the defendants\u2019] motion.\u201d <em>Timpson </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 344, 346 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">1. <em>Transamerica\u2019s duty to defend. </em>It has been held that \u201ca li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against any claims that create a potential for indemnity.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>423 Mass. 366, 368 (1996). \u201cIt is settled in this jurisdiction, and generally elsewhere, that the question of the initial duty of a liability insurer to defend third-party actions against the insured is decided by matching the third-party complaint with the policy provisions: if the allegations of the complaint are \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer must undertake the defense.\u201d <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983). <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Mut. Ins. Co., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 617, 623 (1998). \u201cHowever, when the allegations in the underlying complaint \u2018lie expressly outside the policy coverage and its purpose, the insurer is relieved of the duty to investigate\u2019 or defend the claimant.\u201d <em>Timpson </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 347, quoting from <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 168 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">a. <em>Personal injury coverage for the publication or utterance of a libel or slander or other disparaging material. </em>The defendants claim that Falla\u2019s complaint alleged a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as defined by the CGLE because the complaint contained allegations of \u201c3. a publication or utterance (a) of a libel or slander or other defamatory or disparaging material . . . .\u201d The defendants cite, in particular, an allegation in Fal-la\u2019s complaint that, after she rejected Forte\u2019s advances, a rumor circulated in the workplace that Forte was having an affair with her. They argue that the allegation should have put Transamerica on notice of a potential defamation claim. That allegation, however, does not in any way suggest that KMS or Forte published or otherwise spoke to others about the alleged affair. At most, the allegation states only that Forte\u2019s behavior toward Palla led others to talk of an affair.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Other allegations in Palla\u2019s complaint refer to suggestive comments made by Forte to Palla, and Forte\u2019s refusal to provide information to Palla regarding the reasons for her termination. Because there was no allegation that the comments were published or uttered to others, none of Palla\u2019s allegations state a defamation claim against the defendants. See <em>Correllas </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>Viveiros, </em>410 Mass. 314, 319 (1991) (\u201cDefamation is the publication of material by one without a privilege to do so which ridicules or treats the plaintiff with contempt\u201d). See also <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 630, 636 (1996). As the Supreme Judicial Court observed in <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>406 Mass. 7, 12 (1989), the inquiry does not end here because the policy language, \u201cother defamatory or disparaging material,\u201d \u201cextends the coverage of the policy beyond actions for libel or slander.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In this regard, the defendants also claim that Falla\u2019s answer to a KMS interrogatory in her action triggered coverage under the COLE. Palla was asked in an interrogatory to detail her damages. In her answer, Palla stated that she was seeking damages for. her termination, among other things, because \u201cit will be very difficult for me to obtain further employment for a national football league team, franchise or other similar organization as a result of my termination and its characterization by KMS. ...\u201d The defendants claim that, as a result of that answer, Palla\u2019s complaint could be read as alleging that her termination by KMS and Forte had the effect of publishing \u201cdisparaging material\u201d about her. See <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>406 Mass. at 12 (even though actress\u2019s complaint did hot specifically so recite, it still could be fairly read as alleging that cancellation of her contract was a statement about her, to others, which \u201cspoke slightingly of her and damaged her reputation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We recognize that \u201cthe obligation of the insurer to defend is based not only on the facts alleged in the complaint[ ] but also on the facts that are known or readily knowable by the insurer.\u201d <em>Desrosiers </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. of America, </em>393 Mass. 37, 40 (1984). <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Mut. Ins. Co., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 623-624. According to the record, Palla\u2019s answers to KMS\u2019s interrogatories were signed by her on November 13, 1992, more than seven months after she filed her complaint. Further, there is nothing in the record as to when Palla actually served her answers upon KMS or when Transamerica received a copy of the answers from KMS. Contrast <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>406 Mass. at 9 (insurer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>informed on two occasions of facts vital to coverage under policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Because there was nothing in the record to demonstrate that Transamerica was aware of the existence of Falla\u2019s answer to the interrogatory and its contents, we reject the defendants\u2019 argument that the answer to this interrogatory triggered a duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">b. <em>Personal injury coverage for publication or utterance in violation of right of privacy. </em>The defendants also claim that they were entitled to a defense pursuant to that portion of the CGLE which defined \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as a \u201c3. a publication or utterance ...(b) in violation of an individual\u2019s right to privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The defendants acknowledge that the tort of invasion of privacy is not one of the four counts enumerated in Falla\u2019s complaint but argue that certain allegations in Falla\u2019s complaint may be \u201c \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim\u201d of invasion of privacy. <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Those allegations may be summarized as follows: during the initial employment interview, Forte asked Palla whether she was married; whether she had a boyfriend; how long she had dated; and whether her boyfriend was going to marry her. There were also allegations that, during Falla\u2019s employment, Forte frequently took an interest in the status of Falla\u2019s relationship with her boyfriend, including asking her if her boyfriend was going to marry her.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The CGLE required that there be \u201ca publication or utterance . . . in violation of an individual\u2019s right to privacy.\u201d The defendants argue that Forte\u2019s alleged comments to Palla were \u201cutterances\u201d and therefore covered by the policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The tort of invasion of privacy is set out in G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, as inserted by St. 1973, c. 941, which states, in relevant part, \u201c[a] person shall have a right against unreasonable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>substantial or serious interference with his privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, in order to prove an invasion of privacy claim under the statute, a person must allege an unreasonable, substantial, and serious interference with his or her privacy. <em>Schlesinger </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, </em>409 Mass. 514, 517-519 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Here, the allegations concerning Forte\u2019s comments were specifically referenced to Falla\u2019s claim that she was terminated because she refused to submit to Forte\u2019s sexual advances and harassment. Palla did not allege that the comments were an unreasonable, substantial, or serious interference with her privacy. Further, there is nothing in the comments that may be reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they stated a claim of invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">We emphasize that in reaching our decision we did not consider allegations of Forte\u2019s physical contacts with Palla. Such misconduct because it was nonverbal could not be labeled as \u201cpublications or utterances\u201d as required by the policy and clearly falls outside of the policy\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">In sum, we hold that Transamerica\u2019s duty to defend under the policy was not triggered by Palla\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">2. <em>Transamerica\u2019s duty to indemnify. </em>The duty to indemnify is narrower in scope than the duty to defend. See, e.g., <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>406 Mass. at 10-11; <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Mut. Ins. Co., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 623. Thus, \u201c[i]f an insurer has no duty to defend based on the allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, it necessarily follows that the insurer does not have a duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Monticello Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 454, 459 (1999). Here, because Transamerica had no duty to defend KMS, it had no duty to indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>3. <em>Transamerica\u2019s chapter 93A and chapter 176D liability. </em>Liability under G. L. c. 93A is based upon the employment of unfair and deceptive acts and practices. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>406 Mass. at 14. Liability under G. L. c. 176D is based upon the employment of unfair claims settlement practices. When coverage has been correctly denied, as in this case, no violation of the Massachusetts statutes proscribing unfair or deceptive trade practices may be found. See <em>Jet Line Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>404 Mass. 706, 717 (1989); <em>Timpson </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 353; <em>Spurlin </em>v. <em>Merchants Ins. Co., </em>866 F. Supp. 57, 62 (D. Mass. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\">In February of 1994, the Patriots franchise was sold and KMS Patriots, L.P., was renamed New England Patriots, L.P. New England Patriots is the successor-in-interest to any coverage available under the KMS policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Transamerica also issued a second policy to KMS that provided coverage for losses that exceeded the limits of the general liability policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In addition to personal injury coverage, the policy also included bodily injury and contract coverage. On appeal, the defendants rely solely on the personal injury coverage in the policy. This court has previously noted, under different circumstances, that this definition of personal injury is \u201cvery limited.\u201d <em>LaFrance </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 987, 987 &amp; n.l (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The parties disagree on the timeliness and sufficiency of KMS\u2019s notice to Transamerica that KMS and Forte may have been facing liability to Palla. We do not address these issues in view of our decision in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b217-11\">The defendants also argue that there was \u201cpublication\u201d of the comments. We reject the defendants\u2019 argument because there was no allegation whatsoever that the comments were published to others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The Supreme Judicial Court has declined to determine whether there is a comparable common law claim in tort for invasion of privacy. <em>Tower </em>v. <em>Hirschhorn, </em>397 Mass. 581, 585 n.4 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The defendants also claim that the policy at issue here did cover losses resulting from harassment claims because Transamerica sold KMS an excess liability policy that excluded coverage for such losses. (See note 3, <em>supra.) </em>That claim ignores \u201cthe basic principle that exclusion clauses <em>subtract </em>from coverage rather than grant it.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Bond Bros. </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>393 Mass. 546, 550 (1984), quoting from <em>Weedo </em>v. <em>Stone-E-Brick, Inc., </em>81 N.J. 233, 247 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
