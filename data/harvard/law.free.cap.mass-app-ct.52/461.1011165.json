L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(6), occurred when a labor dispute between International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 25, and Hertz Corporation generated a strike lasting six weeks during the summer of 1996. Pursuant to that statute, a finding that a \u201cstoppage of work\u201d occurred would disqualify, for the period of the stoppage, any claimant for unemployment compensation benefits whose unemployment was brought about by the underlying labor dispute. Claiming that such a stoppage had occurred, Hertz challenged the award of unemployment compensation benefits to approximately 130 striking employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The deputy director of the Division of Employment and Training found that there had been no stoppage of work for purposes of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(6), and determined therefore that the claimants were not disqualified with respect to the receipt of benefits. Upon appeal by Hertz, pursuant to G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7\u00a740 and 41, the board of review of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development (board) affirmed the decision of the deputy director. Upon a further request by Hertz for judicial review under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42, a judge of the District Court affirmed the decision of the board. Hertz filed a timely notice of appeal to this court. We hold that the board<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> applied erroneous criteria in determining that a stoppage of work had not taken place. <em>Boguszewski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>410 Mass. 337, 342-344 (1991). Because the extensive subsidiary findings of the board are supported by substantial evidence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and because an ultimate finding that there was a stoppage of work follows logically therefrom once the correct legal criteria are applied, further administrative action is unnecessary. We therefore vacate the judgment of the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Court and order that judgment is to enter that the defendant employees are not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">1. <em>Material facts. </em>We state material facts drawn from the findings of the board. Hertz, the employer in this proceeding, rents cars and other vehicles to the general public at various locations in the Boston metropolitan area. When two collective bargaining agreements between Hertz and members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 25, expired and negotiations for new contracts were unsuccessful, the union went on strike for a period of forty-two days (June 10, 1996, to July 22, 1996). Of the approximately 144 to 156 striking bargaining unit employees, 130 filed claims for unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">During the strike, Hertz used management employees, as well as other employees not affected by the labor dispute, to conduct operations normally carried on by bargaining unit members. As a result, there was apparently no reduction in the number of rentals which Hertz would otherwise have made during the period, and no decrease in the revenues which Hertz would otherwise have realized from such rentals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board found that Hertz did not experience a \u201csubstantial curtailment\u201d in the activity of renting cars and other vehicles, which the board characterized as Hertz\u2019s \u201cessential function and basic business activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">At the same time, the board found that a large variety of the employer\u2019s activities were either not performed at all or greatly reduced. Each elimination or reduction of a normal activity came about because managerial and other employees were shifted from their normal job functions and assigned to basic tasks necessary to get vehicles into the hands of customers (including, without limitation, retail counter work; preparation of vehicles; washing vehicles; processing of vehicle returns; driving of shuttle buses; stripping and scraping new vehicles; and limited maintenance work).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>In summary form, the board made the following findings with respect to Hertz\u2019s operations. Normal efforts to maintain an acceptable fleet of vehicles (meaning that cars were available to accommodate customers\u2019 needs without having extra cars) were abandoned. Likewise, market planning analysis to determine what quantity and mix of cars to order from manufacturers (done ordinarily at least on a weekly basis) was reduced to a minimal level. Administration of the \u201cyield management pricing system\u201d was reduced by approximately 80 per cent, resulting in failure to adjust rental rates to meet competitive pricing.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Normal planning, analysis and forecasting, including reports thereof, were virtually eliminated. This included, among other things, analysis of financial data and preparation of forecasts of factors underlying rentals; analysis of demand for specialty vehicles; analysis reporting to achieve the goal of renting all available vehicles; and over-all monitoring of operations. Normal accounting functions were not performed. Training and other personnel activities were suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Maintenance suffered. No attention was paid to various maintenance warranty issues that ordinarily were referred to manufacturers. Normal greasing, oil and filter changes, and safety inspections were performed only on a limited basis. Ordinary maintenance of shuttle buses was postponed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">While managers and other employees not affected by the strike replaced striking bargaining unit members at the retail counters, retail operations suffered to a certain extent. Given their lower level of training and experience, the replacement employees were unable to provide the quality and speed of service that Hertz customarily offered. The board expressly found that \u201c[cjounter operations fell below Hertz\u2019s normally acceptable standards.\u201d Lines lengthened and customers complained. Cash payments were lost or misplaced. Many replacement employees were unable to operate the computer system properly. Similar problems plagued the handling of returns of vehicles. Shuttle bus service was erratic, thereby generating more customer complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">In addition, the retail sale of used cars normally carried on at the company\u2019s McLellan Highway location was completely shut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>down, and cars normally disposed of by return to the manufacturer, salvage or auction remained in Hertz\u2019s inventory. Much of the so-called \u201cback office\u201d work at McLellan Highway was not performed, resulting in late filing of paperwork and the loss of sets of car keys. The company\u2019s seasonal operation in Nantucket was affected, since Hertz could not determine an appropriate mix of cars to send to the island; the cars remained in Nantucket because of local regulatory restrictions, and business of the following year was affected because local vehicle permits were based upon vehicles entering during the prior year. Supervisory functions were affected throughout the region. Hertz contracted out its twenty-four hour road service for customers whose rental cars break down.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">2. <em>The statutory standard. </em>General Laws c. 151 A, \u00a7 <em>25(b), </em>as amended by St. 1993, c. 88, \u00a7 1, provides that unemployment benefits shall not be paid to an individual for \u201c[a]ny week with respect to which the commissioner finds that his unemployment is due to <em>a stoppage of work </em>which exists because of a labor dispute at the factory, establishment or other premises at which he was last employed . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Certain exceptions to the policy are not relevant to the present case. Prior to 1937, the statute disqualified all striking employees with respect to the receipt of benefits. It was then amended to ease the restriction, disqualifying striking employees only when the labor dispute caused a \u201cstoppage of work\u201d at the place of employment. St. 1937, c. 421. <em>Boguszewski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>410 Mass. at 341.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The term \u201cstoppage of work\u201d is not defined in the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>The Supreme Judicial Court has periodically addressed the meaning of the term, refining the concept so that it is clear that the \u201cwork\u201d which is at issue in the concept of \u201cstoppage of work\u201d is the work and operations of the employer, not merely the work of individual employees, and that a \u201cstoppage of work\u201d does not require a complete cessation of the employer\u2019s activities. <em>Adomaitis </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>334 Mass. 520, 524 (1956). <em>General Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>349 Mass. 358, 361, 363 (1965). <em>Boguszewski, supra </em>at 341-342, 344 (\u201csubstantial curtailment\u201d). In the course of this development, the court has identified various considerations which have a bearing upon the determination whether a \u201cstoppage of work\u201d has occurred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Review of the cases follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Upholding an interpretation of the board, the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Adomaitis, supra </em>at 524, held that \u201cwhere a labor dispute blocks a substantial amount of work which would otherwise be done it has stopped that much of the work and there is therefore a \u2018stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute.\u2019 \u201d Having determined that a stoppage of work embraced stoppage of \u201ca substantial amount of work\u201d (as opposed to <em>all </em>of the work), the court subsequently held that, where a strike forced the employer to \u201cfarm out\u201d part of its production in order to avoid substantially greater layoffs and a substantial reduction in production, there could be a stoppage of work even though end product deliveries had not been materially curtailed. <em>General Electric, supra </em>at 362. This time reversing the board, the court stated: \u201cThe pressure exerted by the strike . . . has prevented the company from having a substantial amount of work performed in its own plant. We think that the statutory language and its apparent policy require us to treat this prevention of work as a \u2018stoppage of work\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 25(6).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Notwithstanding the court\u2019s earlier treatment of the absence of a material curtailment in end product deliveries as not by itself determinative in the analysis of whether there has been a stoppage of work, the court thereafter upheld a finding that there was no stoppage at a combined radio and television station where the station continued normal levels of broadcasting (except for short periods when there were power failures) and where all Federal Communications Commission requirements were satisfied despite the labor dispute. <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>378 Mass. 51, 53, 56 (1979). Consistent with <em>Adomaitis </em>and <em>General Electric, </em>the court identified the proper inquiry to be \u201cwhether the employer\u2019s operations were substantially curtailed as the result of a labor dispute.\u201d <em>Westinghouse, supra </em>at 55. However, it then accepted the conclusion of the board that there had been no substantial curtailment of the employer\u2019s operations because there had been neither a drop in production nor the farming out of bargaining unit work. <em>Id. </em>at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The <em>Westinghouse </em>case, with its emphasis upon ultimate production and the farming out of work, was reconciled with other cases in <em>Boguszewski, supra. </em>There, the court treated the <em>Westinghouse </em>decision as showing \u201cdeference to administrative decision-making,\u201d but explained that the decision did not \u201cestablish a rule that a \u2018stoppage of work\u2019 requires a disruption in an employer\u2019s output or revenues.\u201d 410 Mass. at 342 n.7. The <em>Boguszewski </em>opinion provides a statement of applicable principles leading us to our conclusion that the board erred in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Building upon <em>Adomaitis </em>and <em>General Electric, </em>the court in <em>Boguszewski </em>stated: \u201cPast cases have attempted no precise definition of the term \u2018stoppage of work,\u2019 but have instead adopted a general definition which requires a \u2018substantial curtailment\u2019 of the employer\u2019s \u2018operations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boguszewski, supra </em>at 341. It is the \u201ctotality\u201d of those \u201coperations\u201d upon which the relevant inquiry focuses, and cases construing \u00a7 25(6) \u201chave never made curtailment of production or revenues a necessary element for invoking the labor dispute disqualification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342. Thus, \u201c[w]hile output and revenues remain important factors for the board to consider, they will not necessarily be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>dispositive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344. The court reinstated the board\u2019s decision and reversed the judge, who had concluded that there had been no stoppage of work because the employer had suffered no \u201cimmediate or long-term adverse consequence, financial or otherwise,\u201d and because \u201cthe employer\u2019s primary business function . . . proceeded without interruption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340. Acknowledging that the employer, an electric utility, had maintained 100 per cent of its generation and distribution services, the court determined that \u201cthe cessation or curtailment of maintenance, inspection, testing, installation, replacement, clerical, and administrative functions, constituted substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s conclusion\u201d that a stoppage of work had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">3. <em>Application of the statutory standard. </em>In the present case, the subsidiary findings of the board are supported by substantial evidence and are not challenged by the parties. The question for decision is whether the board\u2019s ultimate finding that there was no stoppage of work is \u201c[bjased upon an error of law\u201d or otherwise \u201c[unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c) and <em>(e), </em>as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3. Here, the board in its conclusions of law correctly phrased the governing standard, stating that the proper inquiry in determining whether there has been a stoppage of work for the purposes of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(h), is \u201cwhether the employer\u2019s operations were substantially curtailed as the result of a labor dispute.\u201d <em>Westinghouse, </em>378 Mass. at 55. The board also correctly cited <em>Adomaitis, </em>334 Mass. at 524, which defined a work stoppage as existing \u201cwhere a labor dispute blocks a substantial amount of work which would otherwise be done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">However, we agree with Hertz that the board then implicitly altered these principles in its application of them to the facts of the case (as set forth in the board\u2019s own subsidiary findings). The board concluded \u201cthat the normal activities and daily operations of the employing unit were not substantially curtailed because of the labor dispute.\u201d In support thereof, the board noted that \u201cHertz continued its essential function and basic business activity of renting cars and other vehicles, and there was no substantial evidence presented that Hertz suffered a substantial curtailment <em>of that </em>activity\u201d (emphasis supplied). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The board also cited stable rentals and revenues; no increase in customer complaints (but contrast the board\u2019s own subsidiary findings to the contrary); no reduction in \u201chours of operation\u201d; no financial loss from delay of two construction projects (see note 5 above); and minimal loss at the Nantucket facility and at the used car location at McLellan Highway. Accordingly, the board concluded that, \u201cwhile some of the functions normally performed by both management and bargaining unit positions were diminished because of the labor dispute, there was no substantial evidence that there was a decrease in rentals or revenues and . . . the minor reduction in . . . back office operations did not constitute a substantial work stoppage because of the dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">In focusing almost exclusively upon what it considered to be the employer\u2019s \u201cessential function and basic business activity,\u201d and in measuring that function principally on the basis of vehicles rented, hours devoted to such rentals and the absence of losses, the board disregarded the principle that the analysis called for by G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 <em>25(b), </em>must consider \u201cthe totality of the employer\u2019s operations, and [has] never made curtailment of production or revenues a necessary element for invoking the labor dispute disqualification.\u201d <em>Boguszewski, </em>410 Mass. at 342. \u201cOperations\u201d are not limited to production, which is one factor among many to be considered. <em>Id. </em>at 344. See <em>General Electric, </em>349 Mass. at 363-364, concluding that a stoppage of work had occurred even given \u201cthe absence of a substantial and continuing disruption of end product deliveries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In placing what we believe was undue emphasis upon rentals and revenues, the board gave insufficient weight to \u2014 and in some respects contradicted \u2014 its own subsidiary findings. Those findings demonstrate that Hertz experienced cessation of, or substantial reduction in, a variety of its normal functions. These included activities involving market planning, fleet management, accounting, budgeting, pricing, maintenance, financial analysis, road service (which was contracted out, compare <em>id. </em>at 362), retail sales and other vehicle dispositions, training, employee relations, and necessary record keeping and paperwork. The board\u2019s inattention to the significance of these aspects of the employer\u2019s business is inconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>requirement that the inquiry focus upon the totality of the employer\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The board argues that the <em>Westinghouse </em>case stands for the proposition that it is the \u201cmain business\u201d of the employer that is at issue, and that <em>Boguszewski </em>merely expands the definition of \u201cmain business\u201d because a utility company was involved. This argument ignores those cases <em>(Adomaitis, General Electric, </em>Boguszewski) which make it clear that attention must be paid to <em>all </em>of the employer\u2019s operations in deciding whether there has been a stoppage of work under \u00a7 <em>25(b). </em>The Supreme Judicial Court has rejected the idea that curtailment of production or revenues is a necessary element. <em>Boguszewski, supra </em>at 342. Likewise, the court has expressly stated that there is no special rule for utility companies. <em>Id. </em>at 345. The nature of the company involved does not alter the general criteria to be considered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">We are mindful of the deference normally accorded to administrative findings. <em>Id. </em>at 342. Here the board\u2019s subsidiary findings are not challenged. However, the board applied to those findings an erroneous view of applicable law, thereby generating an ultimate finding (i.e., no stoppage of work) that is not supported by its own subsidiary findings. The decision must consequently be set aside both because it is based upon an error of law (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14[7][c]) and because it is unsupported by substantial evidence (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14[7][e]).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">4. <em>Disposition. A </em>reviewing court \u201cmay affirm the decision of the agency, or remand the matter for further proceedings before the agency; or the court may set aside or modify the decision, or compel any action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). Here, further action by the board serves no purpose. With the proper legal standard applied, the board\u2019s subsidiary findings require a determination that there was a stoppage of work as that term is used in G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 <em>25(b). </em>The judgment of the District Court is vacated. A new judgment is to enter that a stoppage of work occurred as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>a result of the labor strike, and the defendant employees are not entitled to unemployment benefits for the period of June 10, 1996, to July 22, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\">While the appeal is from the decision of the judge of the District Court, in the present case that decision determined only that the decision of the board was \u201cfree of legal error\u201d; was supported \u201cby sufficient and credible evidence\u201d; was \u201cnot arbitrary or capricious\u201d; and was \u201cmade in conformance with the requirements of M.G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7) and M.G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42,\u201d and that therefore the decision should be affirmed. Consequently, the appeal to this court is essentially a judicial review of the decision of the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 1(6) and 14(7)(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Hertz presented no evidence of revenues lost from operations as a result of the strike. The board drew no negative inferences from this apparently strategic decision, but given the absence of evidence on the subject, found, properly in our view, that there were no lost revenues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The board found in addition that a construction project designed to triple available parking at the Logan Airport site had to be postponed, and that award of a contract to reconfigure maintenance garages at the McLellan Highway location was delayed. General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25(6), focuses upon a \u201cstoppage of work\u201d as the condition which triggers the withholding of unemployment benefits. Decisions interpreting the statute examine the extent to which \u201coperations\u201d are affected. <em>General Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>349 Mass. 358, 363 (1965). <em>Boguszewski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>410 Mass. at 341-342. Because capital projects arguably are not \u201coperations,\u201d we give no weight to the board\u2019s findings regarding these two items.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The statute appears somewhat counter-intuitive, since its effect is that the more effective the strike (i.e., the more likely it is to bring about a stoppage of work), the more likely the strikers are to lose their unemployment compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>tion benefits. It was suggested at oral argument that the legislative purpose is to prevent the employer from being penalized twice: once by a substantial reduction in its operations, a second time by the impact of unemployment compensation payments and the related effect upon the employer\u2019s obligation to contribute to the unemployment compensation trust fund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\">These decisions have inspired no response by the Legislature, which has been content to leave the term \u201cstoppage of work\u201d otherwise undefined for sixty-four years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The suggestion at oral argument that the \u201coperations\u201d to be examined in deciding whether there has been a stoppage of work are those of bargaining unit employees only has support neither in the statute nor in the cases, the latter making it abundantly clear that all of the employer\u2019s operations must be considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
