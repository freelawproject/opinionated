The plaintiffs appealed both that denial and the application of the town of Chatham\u2019s (town) zoning by-law to the existing structures in a complaint to the Land Court. After three days of evidentiary hearings, a judge of that court dismissed the complaint and entered judgment for the board and town. The plaintiffs pursued their dream here, but it dissolves on the shoals of appellate standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\"><em>Factual background. </em>The essential facts (according to the judge, whose findings are unchallenged by the plaintiffs, and as reflected in undisputed portions of the record) are as follows. In 1936, well before the town enacted its zoning by-law, the United States Coast Guard, under a lease from the then owners, the Cabot family, constructed a boathouse and connected timber launchway on Stage Island and in Stage Harbor. The facility was intended to serve and was in fact exclusively used as a lifesaving station.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Except for minor maintenance, and wear and tear, the two structures remain essentially as constructed by the Coast Guard and have never been altered. The Coast Guard abandoned the facility and its lifesaving operations in 1976. The structures have not been used for any purpose since 1976 and have never been used for private boat storage or moorings or any other private recreational boating purpose. They do not</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>conform dimensionally to the town\u2019s zoning by-law in numerous material respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In 1950, David M. Davis acquired the property (locus) on which the Coast Guard facility was sited from the Cabots and in 1979 purchased the abandoned boathouse and launchway from the United States Government. The locus is subject to an easement enjoyed by forty or more persons living on the adjacent Morris Island to access the harbor thereover for the purposes of launching and landing boats, but not entitling them to any rights to use the former Coast Guard structures. Over the years, Davis has also conveyed a number of undivided fractional interests in the locus and the boathouse to the other plaintiffs herein. Appurtenant to each such interest was the exclusive right to use a fifteen foot section of the launchway\u2019s catwalks to tie up a boat or boats (to a maximum of sixteen on each side of the launch-way\") \u201cif authorized by the harbor master of the Town of Chatham.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Stage Harbor, which is part of the town\u2019s Coastal Conservancy District,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is a popular recreational area that is congested with craft during boating seasons. The available mooring field is fully occupied, and the town\u2019s harbor master maintains a lengthy waiting list for spaces (numbering over eighty people at the time of the hearing). Stage Harbor also is the town\u2019s most heavily concentrated shellfishing ground, attracting both commercial and recreational fishermen (all under municipal license) and is regularly seeded to maintain and enhance the shellfish population.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\"><em>Procedural background. </em>Commencing in 1986, the plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>attempted to realize their dream by a series of requests for town permission to convert the launchway for the purpose of private recreational boating. The instant litigation arose from their most recent effort, which sought a special permit \u201cto reconstruct the 300 foot former Coast Guard pier<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and railway facility at the site,\u201d which they presented as a change, alteration or extension of a \u201clawfully existing\u201d nonconforming structure or use under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, and \u00a7 V.B. of the by-law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Their application proposed to (1) remove approximately 150 feet from the seaward end of the launchway; (2) narrow the width of the launchway to six feet; (3) reconstruct the remaining portion of the launchway into an elevated pier; (4) construct an extensive ramp and float system extending perpendicularly from ramps on each side of the resulting pier to a width of fifty-eight feet; and (5) construct berthing or slips along the pier for ten boats. Although the launchway would be shortened to about fifty percent of its present length under the plaintiffs\u2019 plan, the footprint of the proposed structure would be approximately 1,340 square feet larger than at present because of the increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>width required to accommodate the boat mooring apparatus. No changes were proposed to the boathouse. The locus, boathouse, and launchway are located in a Coastal Conservancy District (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>in which construction of a private pier is permitted only upon a finding that it will not be detrimental to waterway safety or access, water quality, equity of interest in utilizing waterways and the protection of aesthetic values, and in which pier length is limited to eighty feet and pier width to four feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The board noted that the nonconforming structures at issue had gone unused since 1976. Consequently, they were no longer preexisting nonconforming structures subject to c. 40A, \u00a7 6, and could not be reestablished except under and in conformity with the zoning by-law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since the proposed pier would exceed the maximum size permitted in the zoning district, the board acknowledged that it could deny the application on that ground but decided, \u201cin the interest of equity,\u201d to consider the matter under the statutory and regulatory provisions governing changes in lawful nonconforming uses and structures. That consideration led the board to deny the permit on the basis of its findings that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201cthe proposed structure and use would be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming structure. The area of Stage Harbor consumed by the proposed pier and boat slips is greater than that currently occupied by the existing . . . facility. This reduction in available square footage would result in the loss of existing boat moorings in Stage Harbor. In addition, this reduction would occur in the sub-tidal area of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the harbor, significantly increasing the impediment to the harvesting of shellfish.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Land Court in a two-part complaint. Count I (pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17) challenged the board\u2019s denial of their proposed reconstruction as unsupported by evidence and based upon an improper standard. Count II (pursuant to G. L. c. 240, \u00a7 14A) sought a judicial determination that the zoning by-law allowed, as of right, their use of the existing launchway to tie up ten boats as well as the use of the boathouse, not only to store boats and boating gear but also as an apartment (for a security person, as later testified to by Davis). After a three-day trial de novo, at which eight witnesses testified and numerous exhibits were introduced into evidence, the judge found the pertinent facts as previously described, <em>supra </em>at 350-351, emphasizing in particular that the Coast Guard facility was licensed as a boathouse and timber launchway; there had been no use of the boathouse or launchway since 1976; those structures were only licensed and utilized for the Coast Guard\u2019s lifesaving operations and had never been used as a pier or for any private recreational boating purposes; the area proposed to be utilized under the plaintiffs\u2019 application would be approximately 1,340 square feet larger than the present configuration; the project would result in the loss of at least ten mooring spaces in Stage Harbor; that harbor is already congested,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the mooring field is fully occupied and closed to new moorings, and there were approximately eighty names on a waiting list for mooring locations; and the project would render inaccessible a large area for shell-fishing as a result of the new locations of pilings, floats, and the plaintiffs\u2019 moored boats.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">On the basis of the facts found and the applicable provisions of G. L. c. 40A and the zoning by-law, the judge concluded as to count I that (1) the proposal constituted a change in use triggering the need for special permit approval under the tests of <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Barnstable, </em>363 Mass. 648, 653, 662-663 (1973); (2) the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the board utilized an improper standard (by comparing the proposed structures to a situation of no structures at all rather than to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>existing stractores) was belied by the explicit language of the board\u2019s decision; (3) the pier resulting from the proposed modification of the launchway would not conform to the dimensional requirements of the zoning by-law; and (4) the loss of moorings, increase in navigational congestion, and interference with shellfishing were significantly detrimental effects on the Stage Harbor neighborhood, any one of which constituted a permissible reason to sustain the board\u2019s decision to deny a special permit, which was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">As to count II, seeking a declaration of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to use the existing launchway and boathouse specifically for recreational boating purposes, the judge held that the launchway could not be used under the by-law as a pier to tie up the plaintiffs\u2019 boats without a special permit, even though recreational boating is a permitted activity in the Coastal Conservancy District. He also noted that the plaintiffs had admitted that the proposed use of the boathouse as a residential apartment would necessitate alterations, including raising the floor, thereby subjecting it to a special permit requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\"><em>Denial of the special permit application. </em>On a G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, appeal, review of the board\u2019s decision, while based upon de novo fact finding, is nonetheless \u201ccircumscribed. . . . [That decision] \u2018cannot be disturbed unless it is based on a legally untenable ground, or is unreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., </em>429 Mass. 478, 486 (1999), quoting from <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>356 Mass. 635, 639 (1970). Even if the record reveals that a desired special permit could lawfully be granted by the board because the applicant\u2019s evidence satisfied the statutory and regulatory criteria, the board retains discretionary authority to deny the permit, see <em>Gulf Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Framingham, </em>355 Mass. 275, 277-278 (1969); <em>Nugent </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Granby, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 909, 910 (1986); <em>Blasco </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Winchendon, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 32, 39 (1991), so long as that denial is not based upon a legally untenable or arbitrary and capricious ground. See <em>Gamache </em>v. <em>Achushnet, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 220-221 (1982); <em>Nugent, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. at 910-911; <em>Schiffone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Walpole, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>981, 983-984 (1990); <em>ACW Realty Mgt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Westfield, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 242, 246-247 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Even when a zoning board cites no particularized reasons or any specific evidence for its denial decision, its action will be upheld, as will that of a judge affirming that action under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, if a rational basis for the denial exists which is supported by the record. See <em>Cefalo </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Boston, </em>332 Mass. 178, 181 (1955); <em>Ferrante </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Northampton, </em>345 Mass. 158, 162 (1962); <em>Brockton Pub. Mkt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Sharon, </em>357 Mass. 783 (1970); <em>Board of Aldermen of Newton </em>v. <em>Maniace, </em>429 Mass. 726, 732 (1999); <em>Croteau </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Hopkinton, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 922, 924 (1996). So long as \u201cany reason on which the board can fairly be said to have relied has a basis in the trial judge\u2019s findings and is within the standards of the zoning by-law and The Zoning Enabling Act, the board\u2019s action must be sustained regardless of other reasons which the board may have advanced.\u201d <em>S. Volpe &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wareham, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 357, 360 (1976).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The board\u2019s decision easily complies with these standards. Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>reliance on the undesirable enlargement of the existing nonconformity that would result from the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed project would itself be sustainable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A zoning policy inimical to such enlargement is consistent with the statutory mandate of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, which disfavors extensions of existing non-conformities and places the burden on parties seeking them to persuade the local authorities of the lack of substantially increased detriment resulting therefrom. Such a policy also accords with the legislative history of \u00a7 6, which demonstrates that \u201cstrict regulation of changes in nonconforming uses [and structures] is justified by policy considerations which generally favor their eventual elimination.\u201d <em>Blasco </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Winchendon, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 39 (citations omitted). Increasing a nonconformity when such an increase is not shown to be necessary can reasonably be deemed contrary to the public welfare and the appropriate utilization of land in the community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u2014 recognized purposes of both the zoning statute, see St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 2A, and the town\u2019s zoning by-law (see <em>Tranfaglia </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Winchester, </em>306 Mass. 495, 503-504 [1940]) \u2014 and constitutes a valid basis for permit denial. <em>Ibid. </em>See Report of the Department of Community Affairs Relative to Proposed Changes and Additions to the Zoning Enabling Act, at 39 (1972) (House of Rep. Bill No. 5009) (\u00a7 6 reflects a \u201cunanimity of opinion among zoning and planning authorities that the ultimate objectives of zoning would be furthered by the eventual elimination of nonconformities in most cases\u201d). Compare <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Yarmouth, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 972, 973 (1985); <em>Asack </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of West-wood, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 733, 735-736 (1999) (voluntarily increasing nonconformities is disfavored under the zoning law).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We are also persuaded that the board\u2019s other stated reasons for the denial of a special permit for the proposed pier \u2014 loss of mooring space in an already saturated harbor and injury to both commercial and recreational shellfishing \u2014 were rational and independently appropriate grounds for its action and were amply supported by the judge\u2019s express findings. The regulation of the appropriate uses of bodies of water within the town, the avoidance of undue concentration and congestion of vehicular traffic of any kind, the provision of public access to waterways, the protection of natural resources (which include inlets, harbors, bays, fish, and shellfish), and the preservation of community amenities and of citizens\u2019 customary means of earning a living are all valid interests which a zoning by-law is entitled to recognize and enforce and which the board\u2019s decision reflects. See St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 2A; Chatham Zoning Bylaw \u00a7 I.B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>(both setting forth the multifarious purposes zoning regulations may permissibly seek to vindicate). See also G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 10A; G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 52 (delegating to municipal authorities the power to issue mooring and shellfishing licenses); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>152 Mass. 230, 240-244, 248-249 (1890); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>174 Mass. 29, 31-33 (1899) (fish, including shellfish, are protectable natural resources of the citizens of Massachusetts and of each community therein).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In short, as the judge correctly held, the board was empowered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>to consider the impact of the project on the activities of other affected persons in the immediate area, whether on land or on water. The plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the board was without authority to base a decision on concerns for mooring spaces and the protection of shellfishing because mooring and shellfishing licensees \u201clack protected property rights in the vicinity . . . [and therefore] do not make up the \u2018neighborhood\u2019 for . . . Section 6\u201d purposes, is unpersuasive, unsupported as it is by any authority or reasoned argument. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 argument also ignores the fact that the \u201cneighborhood\u201d of the Coastal Conservancy District in which the locus lies literally and explicitly encompasses the intertidal flats adjacent to Stage Island and surrounding the launchway, as well as other natural undeveloped areas including beaches, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>coastal banks, marshes, and wetlands of all types. The water-dependent activities sought to be protected by the board and the judge from the adverse impact of the proposed pier are not only legitimate subjects of zoning regulation by statute and ordinance (see <em>supra </em>at 358-359; note 14, <em>supra), </em>but actually occur in the immediate environs of the proposed pier and could properly be deemed part of its \u201cneighborhood,\u201d as the judge correctly concluded.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The flexibility of the term \u201cneighborhood\u201d as used in G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 6, and the Chatham by-law facilitates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>exercise of the wide discretion which reviewing courts accord zoning authorities when they consider and balance localized interests of whatever kind or character (so long as such interests are relevant to the legitimate purposes of zoning) that may be affected by any proposed alteration in an existing nonconforming structure or use. Here, the specific adverse effects foreseen by the board and the judge \u2014 the existing moorings that would be displaced and the specific shellfishing areas that would be rendered inaccessible by the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed reconstruction \u2014 unquestionably were within the immediate geographic vicinity of the project and could properly be considered in the reckoning of increased neighborhood detriment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><em>Rights to use existing structures under the by-law. </em>The plaintiffs have not demonstrated any error in the judge\u2019s rejection of their demand for a declaration that they can use the existing structures (the launchway and boathouse) as a pier and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>a residence for recreational boating purposes without obtaining town permission. The judge\u2019s ruling can be affirmed for several reasons. Foremost, the plaintiffs\u2019 underlying premise that the existing launchway is a \u201cpier\u201d is unsound (see note 7, <em>supra). </em>Its use as a private pier would require a special permit under \u00a7 IV.A.6.C. of the by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Further, the judge found that the plaintiffs proposed to use the launchway to tie up at least ten boats (the number designated in their application to the board); that the plaintiffs could, by conveyance, entitle up to thirty-three boat owners to use the locus; that under the zoning by-law any number of boats at such a facility over nine would constitute a marina (\u00a7 HB.63), which would be a prohibited use in that zoning district in the absence of a special permit (\u00a7 HI.C.l.c.3); and that the plaintiffs had failed to present any evidence or legal basis supporting their contentions that one of the proposed ten spaces was to be reserved exclusively for governmental use or that such a reservation would provide an exemption from designation of the facility as a marina. We agree with those findings on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We note, additionally, that, although the judge found insufficient evidence to support the board\u2019s statement that the plaintiffs had intended to abandon the structures on the locus,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> he did not comment on the fact that the undisputed nonuse of the structures for many more than two years would trigger the \u201cabandonment by discontinuance\u201d provision of \u00a7 V.A. of the by-law, as supplemented and applied to nonconforming structures by \u00a7 IV.A.6.d.l, which together required any future use thereof to be in conformity with the by-law. See note 9, <em>supra; Murray </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 479 (1986) (explicit cross references in zoning by-law create restrictions on otherwise unqualified provisions). That state of fact and law is itself sufficient to dispose of the plaintiffs\u2019 count II (which the judge may indeed have intended when he entered an amended judgment that mandated, \u201cAny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>future use of the structures [the launchway and the boathouse] is subject to the Chatham Zoning Bylaw\u201d). See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Lowell Sun Publishing Co., </em>404 Mass. 9, 11 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 observation that \u201cboating\u201d and \u201coutdoor recreational activities\u201d are permitted in the Coastal Conservancy District, to support their claim to be able to attach their boats to the existing launchway, avails them naught. Their argument again fails the basic test of Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975), by presenting nothing to establish that \u201cboating\u201d \u2014 a word undefined in either the zoning statute, the zoning by-law, or any referenced Massachusetts decision \u2014 inherently includes the right to tie up, dock, or moor boats. To the contrary, the term \u201cboating\u201d conventionally means \u201c[t]o travel by boat. . . [t]o ride a boat for pleasure.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 209 (3d ed. 1992). The word denotes a transient activity that would not normally create a spatial or physical obstruction to the boating of others; whereas the mooring or tying of a boat to a structure is stationary and of longer duration and necessarily creates a barrier to the boating and mooring rights of others entitled thereto.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As the judge found, the existing launchway has never been used to moor recreational or private boats, and mooring rights in Stage Harbor are not available to all those engaged in boating but only to those who have obtained the requisite mooring licenses.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, the absence of historical precedent confirms customary usage in not linking boating and mooring.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Finally, the use of the existing boathouse (described in the evidence as an empty, barn-like shell that is nonconforming in several material respects) as a residential dwelling unit would, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>as proposed, entail installing a septic system and plumbing for a bathroom and a kitchen, as well as raising the lower floor to elevate it at least one foot above the \u201c100-year flood\u201d elevation (because the structure is also within the overlay Flood Plain District, under \u00a7 FV.B.4.b. of the by-law). This proposed renovation would be impermissible without a special permit authorizing such an extensive alteration of a preexisting nonconforming use under \u00a7 IV.B. of the by-law, see <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeal of Cambridge, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 631, 632-634 (1988) \u2014 even assuming that the boathouse\u2019s long nonuse does not prohibit any future use without bringing it into dimensional conformity with the present by-law, see <em>supra </em>at 353; note 9, <em>supra, </em>and that its proposed use as a residential dwelling unit would not in fact be prohibited in the Coastal Conservancy District where the locus lies. See and compare \u00a7 I.C. and \u00a7\u00a7 IV. 2. and 4. of the zoning by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The thirty foot by sixty foot boathouse extends ten feet seaward beyond the mean high water mark.

The transcript of the hearing before the judge is devoid of evidence presented on behalf of the plaintiffs on the subject of detriment to the neighborhood. Their position on the issue is limited to the factually erroneous assertions that the board\u2019s finding as to detriment was a mere \u201cparroting\u201d of the statutory standard which disguised the board\u2019s alleged application of a legally untenable standard (i.e., supposedly assuming the long unused launchway to be an unlawful structure not entitled to consideration under c. 40A, \u00a7 6, and comparing the proposed project to a situation of no existing structure at all, see <em>supra </em>at 354-355), and that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that such use [as they propose] will de-stabilize property values in the neighborhood\u201d (a matter of subsidiary significance to the valid enforcement of the zoning laws, see <em>Tranfaglia </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Winchester, </em>306 Mass. 495, 503-504 [1940]).

Although the word \u201cneighborhood\u201d is undefined in the zoning statute and the Chatham zoning by-law and has not been definitively construed in any appellate decision to which our attention has been directed, its mandated application to special permit determinations arising in every one of the diverse zoning districts in a municipality requires it to be viewed as an elastic, comprehensive term the specific meaning of which will depend on the facts and circumstances of each particular situation. Compare <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Orleans, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 15, 23 (1987) (zoning board\u2019s decision denying a special permit to enlarge a house \u201cgave no indication what it considered the \u2018neighborhood\u2019 to be. The board referred loosely to \u2018surrounding property owners,\u2019 but we do not know whether it had in mind the owners of lots contiguous to or across [the street] from the plaintiff\u2019s lot, [or] all the fifteen owners to whom notice of the public hearing was given . . . [or] the owners of all the other 229 lots in the subdivision which includes the plaintiff\u2019s lot, or something else\u201d). There is nothing in the legislative history or provisions of G. L. c. 40A that suggests, as do the plaintiffs, that the necessarily expansive concept of \u201cneighborhood\u201d can be defined only in terms of residences and other structures and their inhabitants. \u201cThe term \u2018neighborhood\u2019 generally refers to the immediate environs of the subject property,\u201d Bobrowski, Massachusetts Land Use and Planning Law \u00a7 6.3.2, at 232 n.11 (1993). Such a broad meaning is reflected in numerous special permit decisions in which the zoning neighborhood or district around a proposed project and in which its likely effects were measured was described as including water, coastal areas, and wetlands. See cases cited in note 14, <em>supra, </em>and <em>Rockwood </em>v. <em>Snow Inn Corp., </em>409 Mass. 361, 364-370 (1991); <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>417 Mass. 299, 300-306 (1994); <em>Farrugia </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Marshfield, </em>14 Mass.

App. Ct. 344, 345-348 (1987). This accords with the guiding principle that words undefined by zoning laws and ordinances are to be construed in accordance with common understanding and usage. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Inspector of Buildings of Belmont, </em>341 Mass. 188, 191 (1960); <em>Langevin </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Pub. Bldgs. of Worcester, </em>5 Mass.

This position is not persuasive. Given the deference and latitude accorded zoning boards, especially in connection with denials of special permits, see <em>Cefalo </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Boston, </em>332 Mass. at 181; <em>Board of Aldermen of Newton </em>v. <em>Maniace, </em>429 Mass. at 732; <em>Nugent </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Granby, </em>22 Mass.
