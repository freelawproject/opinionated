R. Crim. R 30(a) and (b) is whether the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, who was also his counsel on the direct appeal, provided ineffective assistance to the defendant by failing to object to the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>instructions, and by failing to request a Castle law instruction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">A statement of material facts appears in our decision on the defendant\u2019s direct appeal, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peloquin, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 960, 960-961 (1991). In brief, the defendant shot and killed his half-brother (victim) in the course of an argument between the two men in the defendant\u2019s apartment. In the present appeal, we must view the facts presented at trial in the light most favorable to the defendant in deciding whether, as defendant argues, omitted instructions should have been given. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>429 Mass. 44, 49 (1999). To this end, we have augmented the facts contained in our prior decision with relevant material from the trial record.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The defendant produced evidence of the victim\u2019s large size, propensity for violence, his possession of a gun in the defendant\u2019s apartment, his previous assault on the defendant, and threats by the victim of imminent serious bodily harm to the defendant during the argument preceding the shooting. A witness at the scene of the shooting heard the victim tell the defendant to put his gun \u201caway or I will stick it up your ass . . . [and that] he was going to rip [the defendant\u2019s] head off . . . you\u2019re nothing without your guns.\u201d According to the testimony, the defendant \u201ckept telling . . . [the victim] to leave [the defendant\u2019s apartment], but he stayed ... He told [the victim] to leave the house . . . several times . . . [but] he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">There was also evidence that as the argument with the victim escalated the defendant became frightened. He saw the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>pull out a gun and stated that he had thought, \u201che\u2019s going to shoot me.\u201d It was at that point that the defendant \u201cdove out of the chair [he] was sitting in and fired the gun twice at [the victim, killing him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The evidence of the victim\u2019s refusal' to leave the defendant\u2019s apartment, if credited by the jury, would be sufficient to present the question whether the victim was unlawfully in the defendant\u2019s apartment and, if so, to present the issue of th\u00e9 availability of Castle law instructions. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>388 Mass. 789, 794 (1983) (\u201c[a] criminal defendant is entitled to an instruction on self-defense if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to him, is sufficient to raise the issue\u201d). See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 120 (\u201c[w]hoever . . . <em>remains </em>in . . . the dwelling house . . . after having been forbidden to do so by the person who has lawful control of said premises, shall be punished ... A person who is found committing such trespass may be arrested . . .\u201d) (emphasis added). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>429 Mass. at 49 (the law of trespass is \u201ca guide\u201d to determine whether the victim was unlawfully in a dwelling).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Because there was some record evidence from which the jury could infer that the victim became a trespasser in the defendant\u2019s apartment and that the defendant reasonably believed that the victim was about to inflict bodily injury or death upon the defendant, the judge would have been required, upon counsel\u2019s request, to instruct the jury that if they made such findings the defendant would be entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the Castle law.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">As noted, <em>supra, </em>that statute provides, in substance, that an occupant of a dwelling charged with killing or injuring a person unlawfully in the occupant\u2019s dwelling, may defend on the ground that he acted in the reasonable belief that the trespasser or intruder was about to inflict great bodily injury or death upon him. See <em>supra </em>note 2. In such a case, the occupant may use reasonable means to defend himself, and he has <em>no duty </em>to retreat from the person unlawfully in his dwelling. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>429 Mass. at 49, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>Cyr, </em>425 Mass. 89, 98 (1997), for the proposition that an occupant of a dwelling has \u201cno duty to retreat from trespasser.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAEc\">Because \u2014 the defendant\u2019s argument continues \u2014 his counsel neither objected to the judge\u2019s instructions regarding retreat,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor did he request the instructions to which he was entitled under the Castle law, and because the judge gave the jury forceful instructions that the <em>defendant\u2019s first </em>duty was to retreat if at all feasible, see <em>supra </em>note 4, the defendant was effectively deprived of his defense that the defendant shot the victim in self-defense. The consequence was, the defendant argues, that defendant\u2019s counsel was ineffective at the critical point of the defense, and that his attorney\u2019s lapse materially affected the outcome of the trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">We are persuaded that the lapses in the performance of defendant\u2019s counsel fell below what is minimally required by art. 12 and that as a result a viable defense was indeed lost. For its part, the Commonwealth argues that even if defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>faltered, the trial outcome was not affected, because retreat was never a live issue at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That argument misses the key issue on appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Retreat would become an issue at the trial only if and when the jury failed to find that the defendant was entitled to the protection provided by the Castle law. However, as discussed above, the defendant presented sufficient evidence for the jury to find that he was entitled to Castle law instructions. Consequently, the judge\u2019s instruction that the defendant was unconditionally <em>obliged </em>to \u201cuse[] any avenues of escape that were reasonably available before resorting to force to protect himself. . . ,\u201d see note 4, <em>supra, </em>was palpable error as a result of the failure of performance of defendant\u2019s counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 651, 652-653 (1984) (judgment reversed where judge\u2019s instructions \u201cwere substantially in accord with the law prior to the enactment of \u00a7 8A\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In sum, the failure of counsel to request the proper jury instructions from the judge, coupled with the judge\u2019s faulty instructions to which defendant\u2019s counsel made no objection, deprived the defendant of his only defense to the murder charge: self-defense, unencumbered by any duty to retreat. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). That is enough in the circumstances here to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. While this issue could have been raised in the defendant\u2019s first appeal \u2014 potentially providing a basis for waiver of the claim \u2014 the defendant is relieved of any such procedural impediment by virtue of the fact that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>represented in his first appeal by his trial attorney. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanoue, </em>400 Mass. 1007, 1008 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The judgment is reversed and the verdict is set aside. The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for such further proceedings as the Commonwealth may elect to pursue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Defendant\u2019s counsel did not raise these issues on the direct appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peloquin, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 960 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b503-9\">General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 8A, provides as follows: \u201cIn the prosecution of a person who is an occupant of a dwelling charged with killing or injuring one who was unlawfully in said dwelling, it shall be a defense that the occupant was in his dwelling at the time of the offense and that he acted in the reasonable belief that the person unlawfully in said dwelling was about to inflict great bodily injury or death upon said occupant or upon another person lawfully in said dwelling, and that said occupant used reasonable means to defend himself or such other person lawfully in said dwelling. There shall be no duty on said occupant to retreat from such person unlawfully in said dwelling.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The enactment of \u00a7 8A was in response to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>367 Mass. 508 (1975), in which the court declined \u201cto adopt the majority rule that one assaulted in his own home need not retreat before resorting to the use of deadly force.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 651, 652 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The judge gave pattern instructions on self-defense. He included instructions that \u201c[t]he defendant was permitted to use deadly force in self-defense only if he had reasonable belief that he was being attacked or immediately about to be attacked and that he was in immediate danger of being killed or seriously injured. <em>Before resorting to force a person must first use every reasonable means that is available to him to avoid combat. This means that the defendant was permitted to use physical force in self-defense only if he could not get out of the situation in some other way that was available and reasonable at the time. The defendant must have used any avenues of escape that were reasonably available before resorting to force to protect himself if this could be done without exposing himself to further danger </em>.... The issue is whether the defendant\u2019s use of force reasonably seemed to be <em>the only way </em>to protect himself in the circumstances. In some situations a person might have a clear field and be able to escape by walking away or otherwise getting to safety. . . In other cases such escape routes may not be available\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b505-9\">As the defendant acknowledges, there can be no remedy for attorney error in most cases unless it is shown that the misstep \u201cmaterially influence[d] the guilty verdict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13 (1999). That is to say, the issue is whether the error was \u201csufficiently significant in the context of the trial to make plausible an inference that the jury\u2019s result might have been otherwise but for the error.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The Commonwealth also argues that the defendant was not entitled to a Castle law instruction because the victim was <em>lawfully </em>on the defendant\u2019s premises. Whether the victim was unlawfully on the premises, using G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 120, as a guide, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>429 Mass. at 49, was a question for the jury to decide on the evidence presented and upon proper instructions from the judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>313 Mass. 632, 637 (1943). See also Model Jury Instruction for Use in the District Courts, Instruction 5.34 (1995 revision).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b506-13\">The scene of the homicide was the defendant\u2019s apartment. Obviously there was an escape route \u2014 the front door of the apartment. In that context the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that retreat was not a live issue at the trial ignores what every reasonable juror would know \u2014 that there is a door in every apartment that provides ingress and egress. It was that sure knowledge that made the judge\u2019s erroneous instructions so harmful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">We note that the jury convicted the defendant of murder in the second degree. In the event of a re-trial, \u201c[i]f any view of the evidence supports the inference that [the defendant] used excessive force in repelling the [victim], a charge on manslaughter would be appropriate.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>425 Mass. 89, 98 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>433 Mass. 617 (2001).
