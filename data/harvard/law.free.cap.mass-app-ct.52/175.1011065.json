She brought this action against three agencies of the Commonwealth<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and three employees of the Academy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging that during her illness she was required to participate in physical activities contrary to a physician\u2019s advice, was deprived of sufficient water, and suffered other humiliations and hazing. As a result, she became fearful for her health and found it necessary to resign. She contends that the defendant agencies were negligent in providing her with medical care and, citing G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 17, see note 7, <em>infra, </em>that the defendants, by allowing her to be hazed by Academy personnel, constructively discharged her in violation of public policy. She also claims that one of the individual defendants, Trooper Cambria, violated her civil rights. She sought damages for physical and emotional distress, loss of compensation and benefits, attorneys\u2019 fees, and reinstatement as a cadet at the Academy. A judge of the Superior Court granted motions for summary judgment for all the defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Although the defendants deny that the plaintiff was deprived of rest, water or medicine, for purposes of reviewing the motion judge\u2019s ruling, we assume the facts to be as alleged by the plaintiff and make all logically permissible inferences in her favor. <em>Willitts </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 202, 203 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">1. <em>Negligence. </em>The plaintiff recognizes that under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24, unless an employee expressly preserves his or her common law rights of action, a claim alleging negligence of an employer or of a coemployee is foreclosed by the exclusivity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation act (act).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy., </em>407 Mass. 640, 641 n.3 (1990). The plaintiff, however, argues that her common law claim of negligence is not barred because her illness, initially a severe cold, may have arisen from sources outside her employment and hence is not compensable under the act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This argument is without merit, as her negligence claims are premised upon allegations that Academy personnel exacerbated her medical condition by misdiagnosing her condition and by negligently denying her requests for water, rest, and medication. If these claims were sustained at trial, the harm caused by the defendants\u2019 conduct would be compensable under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as such conduct was at least a major cause of her disability or need for treatment. The exclusivity provisions of the act would, therefore, control and preclude her negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The plaintiff also urges that her negligence claims are not barred because of the \u201cdual persona\u201d doctrine which provides that an employer\u2019s conduct may in some instances be regarded as conduct of a third party and be subject to liability despite the exclusivity provisions of G. L. c. 152. Under this theory, an employer may be subject to suit if its \u201cliability to the injured employee \u2018derives from a second persona so completely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>independent from and unrelated to his status as employer that by established standards the law recognizes it as a separate legal person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>408 Mass. 614, 617 (1990), quoting from <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>406 Mass. 615, 620-621 (1990), in turn quoting from 2 A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 72.80, at 14-229 (1988). That doctrine, which has not been explicitly adopted in Massachusetts, although it has been alluded to favorably, <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Rodgers, supra </em>at 617, does not aid the plaintiff\u2019s cause. The acts and omissions of the medical personnel claimed to be wrongful were an integral part of the Academy\u2019s role of providing medical assistance to cadets. The plaintiff did not see the medical personnel as a private patient, but rather as a cadet entitled to medical services. See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp., </em>23 Kan. App. 2d 156, 160 (1996) (malpractice action against company medical personnel barred by workers\u2019 compensation statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">2. <em>Constructive discharge. </em>Claims for emotional or physical injuries because of wrongful termination or constructive discharge are also precluded by the workers\u2019 compensation act, <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 1007, 1007-1008 (1985); see <em>Anzalone </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>403 Mass. 119, 124-125 (1988), unless they are sustained in connection with claims that are not barred by the exclusivity provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation act. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. 551, 560-561 (1996). For this reason, the plaintiff argues that her claim of constructive discharge seeks contract damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although it is dubious that she can show that she was constructively discharged, that is, that her employer created \u201cworking conditions ... so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee\u2019s shoes would have felt compelled to resign,\u201d <em>GTE Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>421 Mass. 22, 34-36 (1995), quoting from <em>Alicea Rosado </em>v. <em>Garcia Santiago, </em>562 F.2d 114, 119 (1st Cir. 1977), we will again assume for purposes of reviewing the summary judgment motion that she can sustain the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Recognizing that an at-will employee may be terminated at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>any time for any reason or for no reason at all, <em>Upton </em>v. <em>JWP Businessland, </em>425 Mass. 756, 757 (1997), the plaintiff points out that liability may be imposed on the employer if the employee is terminated \u201cfor a reason that violates a clearly established public policy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The plaintiff claims that G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 17, is such a policy. That statute, set out fully in the margin,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> defines \u201chazing\u201d as \u201cany conduct or method of initiation into any <em>student organization, </em>whether on public or private property, which wilfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person\u201d (emphasis supplied). The \u201cbrutal treatment or forced physical activity\u201d made criminal by the statute is directed at student organizations, not at the educational institutions themselves. The \u201clengthy statement\u201d of Attorney General Shannon mentioned in <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>409 Mass. 398, 400 (1991), and made a part of the record on this appeal, also considers the statute as applying solely to student organizations. Compare <em>Shepard, supra </em>at 400 n.3, where the trial judge found that State troopers and employees of the Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training Council may have violated the hazing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Our cases interpret the public policy exception narrowly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>418 Mass. 576, 582 (1994).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Upton </em>v. <em>JWP Businessland, </em>425 Mass. at 759, a mother was not permitted to invoke public policy to bring an action for wrongful discharge where, because of childcare commitments, she could not work the long hours required by her employer. The court so held despite the strong policy favoring the care and protection of children, which is reflected in the possible eligibility for unemployment compensation in such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Moreover, \u201cthe internal administration, policy, functioning and other matters of an organization cannot be the basis for a public policy exception to the general rule that at-will employees are terminable at any time with or without cause.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>418 Mass. at 583. The requirements of police training and the rigors to which cadets are subjected are internal matters of the Academy. See the portion of the Police Academy Handbook set out in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Here, there is no Legislative directive or enunciated public policy that precludes the Academy, a quasi military training institution, from discharging a cadet who cannot tolerate the rigors and discipline required of other recruits or from discharging a cadet without any cause at all. The Academy need not \u201cadjust its expectations, based on a case-by-case analysis of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>at-will employee\u2019s [fears for her or his health], or face liability for having discharged the employee.\u201d <em>Upton </em>v. <em>JWP Businessland, </em>425 Mass. at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">3. <em>Civil rights claims. </em>Claims under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA), G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, are not barred by the exclusivity provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation act. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>381 Mass. 545, 553 (1980). The claim here is that the defendant Trooper Cambria refused to allow the plaintiff to obtain sufficient water, and violated the MCRA by hazing and by depriving her of a safe work environment and appropriate medical care. To establish a claim under the MCRA, a plaintiff must prove that \u201c(1) [her] exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of either the United States or of the Commonwealth, (2) have been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with, and (3) that the interference or attempted interference was by \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion.\u2019 <em>Swanset Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>423 Mass. 390, 395 (1996).\u201d <em>Brunelle </em>v. <em>Lynn Pub. Schools, </em>433 Mass. 179, 182 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s claims founder on the first requirement and we need not reach the other two. She has not, as required, \u201cclearly identified any \u2018secured right\u2019 with which [Trooper Cambria] interfered.\u201d See <em>Flesner </em>v. <em>Technical Communications Corp., </em>410 Mass. 805, 818 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">As indicated earlier, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 17, the hazing statute, is not applicable to the Academy, as it is not a student organization, but rather a school, an educational institution. Moreover, even if the statute were applicable, in order \u201cto seek redress through [MCRA as under its Federal analog, 42 U.S.C.]<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u00a7 1983 ... a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal [or State] <em>right, </em>not merely a violation of federal [or State] <em>law.\u201d Blessing </em>v. <em>Freestone, </em>520 U.S. 329, 340 (1997) (emphasis in original). Our courts are \u201creluctant to infer a private cause of action from a statute in the absence of some indication from the Legislature supporting such an inference.\u201d <em>Loffredo </em>v. <em>Center for Addictive </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Behaviors, </em>426 Mass. 541, 544 (1998). Moreover, \u201cpenal statutes [G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 17, is such a statute] have been construed as creating a new cause of action ... if, and only if, that appears by express terms or by clear implication to have been the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States Steel Corp., </em>348 Mass. 168, 169-170 (1964), quoting from <em>Mezullo </em>v. <em>Maletz, </em>331 Mass. 233, 238 (1954). No such intent is evident in the hazing statute. \u201c[I]t would be anomalous, on the facts of this case, to allow a remedy under the State Civil Rights Act where a legislative remedy was not made available under [c. 269, \u00a7 17].\u201d <em>Willitts </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston, </em>411 Mass. at 210 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In addition to the hazing statute, the plaintiff cites to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 5, and 6, to sustain her claim that she has a secured right to a safe working environment. Section 3 provides for \u201cinspection and investigation\u201d by the Attorney General of \u201call places of employment,\u201d and \u00a7 5 permits him or her to investigate conditions existing in any industry, and to receive complaints \u201cconcerning alleged violations of any laws enforced under his direction.\u201d Section 6 permits \u201cany person aggrieved\u201d by the violation of any \u201crule, regulation or requirement made by the department\u201d of labor and workforce development to file a complaint in the District Court. Assuming, without deciding, that such a violation creates a secured right, but see <em>Loffredo </em>v. <em>Center for Addictive Behaviors, </em>426 Mass. at 545-546, the plaintiff has not pointed to any rule or regulation that has been violated. See <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Harker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 126-129 (1992) (no Federal due process right to a safe working environment; such a claim is \u201cunprecedented\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The plaintiff has made no argument within the meaning of Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975), in support of her contention that she is entitled to appropriate medical care under the MCRA, and, accordingly, we do not reach that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Since there are here no genuine issues of material fact, and the record as presented shows that the defendants are entitled to judgment as matter of law, the motion judge was correct in granting summary judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Executive Office of Public Safety, Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training Council, and Department of State Police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-11\">Leslie Bodor, Johanna Lawlor, and Lorraine Cambria.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The parties, and hence we, proceed on the premise that cadets at the Academy are employees covered by the workers\u2019 compensation act.
