The interpretation of the following provision is at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">\u201cBased upon the present existing financial status and an equal division of the present marital assets, the wife makes no present claim for alimony and waives her rights to be supported by the husband except in the event that the husband\u2019s financial situation improves due to a material change of circumstances whereby the husband receives a substantial inheritance which increases his income and, in addition, if at that time the wife\u2019s income from all sources is $35,000 or less, then, in that event, the wife shall have the right to file a new Complaint for Alimony to establish alimony payments to her. The provisions of this paragraph shall not establish an obligation on the part of the husband to pay any alimony, nor establish a waiver on the part of the wife to receive any alimony. It is the intention of the parties that the terms contained herein shall specifically establish the wife\u2019s right to file an independent Complaint for Alimony for the sole and specific purpose of obtaining alimony or support for herself if the Court finds, after hearing, that the wife requires alimony so as not to deplete her assets for ordinary living expenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Two judges of the Probate Court were involved in this case. The first judge, although initially denying the wife\u2019s complaint for alimony, on her motion for relief from judgment vacated the judgment, finding on an agreed statement of facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the husband\u2019s receipt, albeit in trust, of $435,000 from his father\u2019s estate constituted the receipt by him of a substantial inheritance. He also found that the wife\u2019s income was under $35,000, and that her expenses exceeded her income. Based on these findings, he concluded that the wife had established a prima facie case consistent with the separation agreement. The matter was set down for further hearing. For a reason not apparent on the record, a second judge held that hearing and thereafter awarded the wife alimony of $2,600 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>In his appeal the husband claims (1) that the judges erred as a matter of law as the husband never received a substantial inheritance that increased his income; (2) that the separation agreement provided for a cap of $35,000 for the wife\u2019s annual income and the judge erred in giving her more than the amount needed to bring her income up to $35,000; and (3) that the judge erred in treating her action as a complaint for alimony under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, instead of as a complaint for modification under c. 208, \u00a7 37. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">We take our facts from the findings of the second judge and from the agreed statement of facts. At the time of the divorce, the parties\u2019 assets were divided approximately in half. The husband\u2019s stock portfolio was then worth approximately $487,000 and the wife\u2019s $462,000. To increase her income, the wife converted many of her long-term growth stocks into income producing investments and, as a result, incurred capital gains taxes of approximately $60,000. Since her divorce she has substantially reduced her standard of living and has had to deplete her assets to meet ordinary living expenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge found that the wife, who was 67 at the time of trial, will have spent all of her assets by age 83. Her annual income is $29,692.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">In 1992, the husband\u2019s parents created an irrevocable spendthrift trust giving the husband a special power of appointment at his death. The trust also provided that the trustee shall pay the husband \u201cand his issue living from time to time, so. much of the annual net income and principal of the trust property as the trustee may deem to be necessary or desirable for the support, comfort, maintenance, education or benefit of such beneficiary or beneficiaries .... Any income not so distributed shall be accumulated and added to principal.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqK7\">After the death of the husband\u2019s father in 1994, $435,000 \u2014 forty percent of his father\u2019s estate after estate taxes and expenses \u2014 went to the husband, forty percent to one sister of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>the husband, and twenty percent to another sister. The marriages of the sisters were described in the agreed statement as \u201cintact,\u201d and they received their shares outright. The husband\u2019s share, however, was paid to the trust.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As of the date of the agreed statement of facts, April 8, 1998, the trust had assets valued at $937,508 and the husband\u2019s stock portfolio, which was not invested in income producing stock, was worth $984,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">In 1996, the husband received $7,000 from the trust \u2014 the judge mistakenly found that he received this amount annually. He conceded at the hearing that he had told the trustee that he did not want any income.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The husband\u2019s mother, stipulated to be 94 years old, and having assets worth between three and four million dollars, gives him $10,000 per year. Since his divorce the husband has lived with his mother. As she pays for all his needs, his expenses are $52 per week. He also gives substantial sums to the three adult children of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The judge concluded that the wife had met the conditions for bringing the action under the separation agreement: the husband had inherited substantial funds from his father, the wife has income of only $29,692 per year, and she needs alimony because she has to deplete her assets in order to meet ordinary living expenses. The judge also ruled that although, ordinarily, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 37, would apply since the issue of alimony was expressly addressed in the agreement incorporated in the divorce judgment, see <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 722 (1997), here \u201cthe parties specifically agreed that the issue of alimony would be addressed in a complaint for alimony not a complaint for modification. ... By including such language in the Agreement, they bound themselves to apply the factors under section 34 rather than the traditional material change in circumstances standard in\u201d c. 208, section 37. Proceeding to apply the factors under c. 208, \u00a7 34, the judge concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>husband \u201chas the ability to pay a reasonably substantial amount of alimony due to the amount of income he currently receives, his virtual lack of expenses, and his access to additional funds if he need[s] or want[s] them.\u201d She then awarded the wife $2,600 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">1. <em>Substantial inheritance. </em>The husband claims that he did not receive a substantial inheritance because the trust is a spendthrift trust and because payment of income and principal to him is not within his control but is wholly within the discretion of the trustee. Whether partly a factual determination as urged by the wife or a legal conclusion as contended by the husband, the judge\u2019s ruling that the husband had received a substantial inheritance was warranted. Although payments to the husband are discretionary with the trustee, the trust provides the husband \u201cwith a substantial insurance policy against economic hardship.\u201d <em>Comins </em>v. <em>Comins, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 28, 32 (1992). In such circumstances the transfer to the trust in 1994 was a substantial inheritance within the meaning of the separation agreement. The amount received, $435,000, was almost as much as was allocated to each party in the original division of assets and such a sum was undoubtedly considered to be substantial by the parties at the time of the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">This conclusion does not entirely resolve the matter as the separation agreement speaks of a substantial inheritance which \u201cincreases\u201d the husband\u2019s income. On this question we defer to the factual determination of the trial judge. Although the husband lays stress on the fact that he received only one distribution of $7,000 from the trust, he acknowledged at trial that he told the trustee that he did not want any income. In view of the broad purposes for which the trustee may make payments to the husband, and in view of the husband\u2019s statement to the trustee, the judge\u2019s finding that the husband had access to additional funds if he needed or wanted them is not clearly erroneous. The slight uncertainty of his access to income because of the discretion vested in the trustee and the spendthrift provision is not in these circumstances dispositive. See <em>David</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number><em>son </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 364, 372 (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A party\u2019s potential income rather than his actual income as limited by his voluntary action may be considered by a trial judge. See <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. 366, 374 (1981), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Keller </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>425 Mass. <em>774, 777 </em>n.7 (1997); <em>Bassette </em>v. <em>Bartolucci, </em>38 Mass App. Ct. 732, 735 (1995); <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 51, 53 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">2. <em>$35,000 cap. </em>The husband\u2019s argument that the provision provides a ceiling on the amount to be awarded to the wife is without merit. The amount is directed to the wife\u2019s right to seek alimony and not to the amount the judge may award.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">3. <em>The proper standard, c. 208, \u00a7 34, or \u00a7 37. </em>This question is somewhat more troublesome because the provision, as the husband points out, speaks of a \u201cmaterial change of circumstances,\u201d which is the standard to be employed under \u00a7 37. See <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. at 368; <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 720. We, however, consider the trial judge\u2019s interpretation warranted. The use of the phrase \u201cmaterial change of circumstances\u201d in the agreement defines the conditions under which the wife may seek alimony and does not appear to be directed to the standard to be employed by a judge. An examination of the separation agreement as a whole indicates a sophisticated use of terminology and knowledge of the intricacies of divorce law by its drafters.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In such circumstances the use of the term \u201can independent Complaint for Alimony\u201d should be accorded its literal meaning. Compare <em>Cherrington </em>v. <em>Cherrington, </em>404 Mass. 267, 269-270 (1989). Unlike the situation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number><em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, supra </em>at 720, it may not be inferred that the parties \u201cimplicitly agreed that any future alimony request would be governed by the \u00a7 37 material change in circumstances standard.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The wife may apply for an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees, in accordance with the procedures set forth in <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 20 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Although the husband objected to some of the facts on the ground of relevancy, he accepted them \u201cas agreed, if the court deems them admissible over [his] objection.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\">At the time of trial in November, 1998, her assets were $370,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\">The husband takes issue with the suggestion of the first judge that payment for the husband\u2019s \u201cbenefit\u201d could include his obligations under a court order. We need not reach this question. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts c. 12, \u00a7 59 (Tent. Draft No. 2, 1999). See also <em>Gershaw </em>v. <em>Gershfield, ante </em>81, 92 n.18 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The judge found \u201cthat it is highly likely that a principal reason for [the husband] being treated differently from his siblings (by having his inheritance placed in trust rather than given to him outright) was in order to defeat any claim for alimony that [the wife] could make if Peter received a \u2018substantial inheritance\u2019 as anticipated in the divorce agreement.\u201d We do not rely on this finding as it is unnecessary to our interpretation of the separation agreement. But see <em>Lauricella </em>v. <em>Lauricella, </em>409 Mass. 211, 216 n.7 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Indeed, the trustee would be under a duty to provide income from the trust to the husband should the trustee determine, upon inquiry, that the husband needed it. <em>Marsman </em>v. <em>Nasca, </em>30 Mass.

When a separation agreement, fair and reasonable at the time of the divorce and not the product of fraud and coercion, is incorporated into the judgment but has independent legal significance, <em>more </em>than a material change in circumstances is required before a judge is justified in modifying the agreement. <em>Stansel </em>v. <em>Stansel, </em>385 Mass. 510, 515 (1982). See <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, </em>371 Mass. 433, 437 (1976). Even where the. agreement merges in the judgment and does not survive, to the extent possible, the expressed desires of the parties should be taken into account. <em>Bercume </em>v. <em>Bercume, </em>428 Mass. 635, 643-644 (1999). <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>51 Mass.
