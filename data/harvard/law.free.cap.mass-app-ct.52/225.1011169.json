We conclude that an entering has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant, William Cotto, was charged in two sets of indictments based on two separate incidents. The January 4, 1997, charges consisted of assault with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>murder Shirley Suarez while armed with a flammable liquid, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18(h); breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit murder, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 15; and arson, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 1. The January 10, 1997,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> charges included assault against Nilsa Wong by means of a dangerous weapon, a baseball bat, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15(b); and kidnapping Wong, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">After his conviction on all counts, Cotto now appeals, claiming that the judge (1) provided the jury with erroneous instructions on the breaking and entering count; and (2) abused his discretion by joining the two sets of indictments for trial. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\"><em>Facts. </em>The Commonwealth sought to prove that the events of January 4 and 10 were connected, stemming from an ongoing feud between the defendant\u2019s family and Francisco Martinez. The jury could have found these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">On September 15, 1996, Francisco Martinez was allegedly shot in the abdomen by Garribel Bautista,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s brother. On January 3, 1997, at nine in the evening, the alleged shooter, Bautista, was found lying in a road in Milton, beaten, stabbed, and gagged. Hours later, shortly after midnight, the defendant and two others set fire to Martinez\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Shirley Suarez, who was staying at Martinez\u2019s apartment that evening, heard glass breaking. Going into the living room to investigate, she saw a white plastic bottle being thrown through the broken window. It was later determined that the bottle contained gasoline, and that it caused a fire in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Frightened, she ran to the back door and saw three people outside the apartment. She recognized the defendant as one of the group of three vandals. She then ran upstairs to warn the other tenants. She heard the fire alarm go off and smelled smoke. The fire department was summoned. Ultimately, the damage to the apartment consisted of the walls of the living room and bedroom being completely covered with soot; the heat from the fire caused children\u2019s plastic toys to melt in the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Not content with that evening\u2019s mischief, one week later the defendant kidnapped Nilsa Wong, Martinez\u2019s girlfriend. During the kidnapping, the defendant demanded to know the whereabouts of Martinez and threatened Wong with a baseball bat, stating that he should beat her \u201cto leave Francisco Martinez another message.\u201d He also told Wong that he had set fire to Martinez\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><em>The entering. </em>The defendant argues that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury that an entry occurs when an instrument or weapon controlled by the defendant physically enters the dwelling. He urges us to hold that an entry by instrument can only be found where the instrument is being used, not only to commit the felony within, but also as the means of committing the break.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Here, it is evident that the window was broken, by either the defendant or one of his two cohorts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The precise manner in which it was broken is unknown. The sole evidence of entry consisted of the infernal device<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> being thrown into the living room through the broken window. We must now decide whether an entry for the purpose of the burglary statutes occurs when an instrument, used to commit the felony therein,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> crosses the threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Burglary is an offense against property. See Nolan &amp; Henry, Criminal Law \u00a7 401, at 299 (2d ed. 1988). \u201cIt is the purpose of burglary statutes ... to prohibit that conduct which violates a person\u2019s right of security in a place universally associated with refuge and safety, the dwelling house.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gold-off, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 458, 462 (1987). \u201cBy not defining the term [entering] in the burglary statutes, the Legislature is presumed to have intended to incorporate the common law definition of that phrase, at least in so far as it is not inconsistent with the terms or the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ricardo, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 345, 356 (1988) (internal quotations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>omitted). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>431 Mass. 188, 191 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"AmQ\">\u201c[T]here must be both a <em>breaking </em>and an <em>entering </em>to constitute the crime of burglary. They are distinct and separate acts.\u201d <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>1 Leach 406, 406 (1785) (emphasis in the original). At common law, \u201cany intrusion into a protected enclosure by any part of a defendant\u2019s body was enough to satisfy the legal requirement of entry.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, 392 </em>Mass. 688, 690 (1984), citing <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>Russ &amp; Ry. 341 (1818); <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>Russ &amp; Ry. 499 (1823); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glover, </em>111 Mass. 395 (1873).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">In cases where only an instrument crossed the threshold of the dwelling house, there is no entry where the instrument was only used for the breaking. See <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>1 Leach at 407. However, where the instrument is used to commit the felony within, there is an entry. See <em>ibid. </em>\u201cAnd in those cases where an instrument has formed any part of the question, it has always been taken to mean, not the instrument by which the breaking was made, but the instrument, as a hook, a fork, or other thing by which the property was capable of being removed.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See <em>Burke, supra </em>at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">This view is in conformity with a majority of jurisdictions, which has held that an entry can occur if an instrument, \u201cbeing used to commit the felony intended,\u201d passes the line of the threshold, regardless of whether the instrument was used in the breaking. 3 Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 323 (15th ed. 1995). See Nolan &amp; Henry, Criminal Law \u00a7 403; Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law 254 (3d ed. 1982) (\u201c[W]here a tool or other instrument is intruded, without any part of the person being within the house, it is an entry if the insertion was for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>purpose of completing the felony but not if it was merely to accomplish a breaking\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ison, </em>744 P.2d 416, 418-419 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>587 S.W.2d 636, 638 (Mo. Ct. App. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">A minority of jurisdictions hold that an entry can occur if any instrument, whether or not intended for use to commit a felony, crosses the threshold. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>18 Cal. 4th 712, 717 (1998); <em>Hebron </em>v. <em>State, </em>331 Md. 219, 237-238 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tixier, </em>89 N.M. 297, 298-99 (Ct. App. 1976).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Today we agree with the majority of jurisdictions and hold that an entry occurs when any part of the defendant\u2019s body, or an instrument which is used to commit the intended felony, crosses the threshold. We so hold because \u201c[b]y permitting an instrumental entry to satisfy this element of the offense only when the instrument is to be used in connection with the ulterior crime, we properly differentiate between attempted burglary, burglary, and the commission of the ultimate [crime].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ison, </em>744 P.2d at 419.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The position we adopt differentiates between breaking and entering and an attempt to break and enter. For example, assume in the case at bar that the defendant had broken the window, but upon seeing Suarez, dropped the infernal device and ran. In this scenario, he may be found guilty of attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>breaking and entering as well as attempted arson, but not of arson or breaking and entering.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We turn to the actual instructions given in this case. The trial judge stated: \u201cAn entry is the unlawful making of one\u2019s way into a dwelling house of another. Entry occurs if any part of the defendant\u2019s body, even a hand or foot or any instrument or weapon controlled by the defendant, physically enters the dwelling house.\u201d The judge failed to state that, in the unusual facts of this case, entry can be found only where the instrument that entered is intended for use in the commission of the felony within.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">However, the error was harmless. There was no dispute at trial that the container thrown into the apartment contained an accelerant and that it was the cause of the fire. Since this was not a live issue at trial (the only issue at trial was identification), there was no prejudice to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>430 Mass. 348, 350 (1999) (\u201cwhere the identity of the killer is the only live issue at trial, any error in the malice instruction is not prejudicial because the defendant\u2019s state of mind is not in dispute. The issue is the identity of the perpetrator\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\"><em>Joinder. </em>The defendant argues that he did not receive a fair trial as a result of the joinder for trial of the two sets of indictments \u2014 the arson, breaking and entering, and assault with intent to murder counts (the January 4 indictments), with the kidnapping and assault by means of a dangerous weapon charges (the January 10 indictments).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Rule 9(a)(3) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, 378 Mass. 859 (1979), provides that \u201c[i]f a defendant is charged with two or more related offenses . . . [t]he trial judge shall join the charges for trial unless he determines that joinder is not in the best interests of justice.\u201d The decision is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. 336, 345 (1998). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of showing that joinder was improper.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Offenses are related when \u201cthey are based on the same criminal conduct or episode or arise out of a course of criminal conduct or series of criminal episodes connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan.\u201d Mass.R.Crim.P. 9(a)(1), 378 Mass. 859 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 416 (1990). Whether the joinder of the charges resulted in undue prejudice \u201cturns, in large measure, on whether evidence of the defendant\u2019s other offenses would have been admissible at a separate trial on each set of indictments.\u201d. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Here, the defendant\u2019s motive for the January 4 arson and the January 10 kidnapping was to exact revenge on Martinez. The defendant\u2019s confession to Nilsa Wong on January 10, that he burned Martinez\u2019s apartment, would have been admissible in a severed trial on the January 4 indictments. Similarly, evidence about the January 4 arson would have been admissible in a severed trial on the January 10 indictments to put the defendant\u2019s statements in context and to prove the defendant\u2019s motive.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There was no abuse of discretion.

And the special rule in regard to a tool or instrument was developed to insure that the mere insertion of the key would not be held sufficient to complete the burglary.\u201d Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law 254.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Other jurisdictions appear to hold to a more conservative view, finding an entry only where the instrument which crosses the threshold is also used to break into the premises.

If the tool is inserted simply to accomplish the breaking, there is no entering for purposes of burglary; but, if the tool or instrument is inserted to accomplish the felony, the insertion is sufficient for the requirement of entering. If a bullet is fired for purpose of breaking the lock, though the bullet lands inside, it would probably not constitute a burglarious entering if fired solely to break the lock. If fired to kill a person inside, probably an entering could be found.\u201d Nolan &amp; Henry, Criminal Law \u00a7 403 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>10 Mass.
