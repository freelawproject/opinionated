L. c. 90, \u00a7 23, second par., by operating a motor vehicle after his license to operate had been revoked pursuant to a violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, operating under the influence of liquor (GUI). He appeals, claiming that (1) the trial should have been bifurcated; (2) the notices sent to him from the Registry of Motor Vehicles (registry) informing him that his license had been revoked were inadmissible hearsay, or, in the alternative, should have been redacted prior to their being introduced in evidence; and (3) there was insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction. While we agree that the extraneous entries contained in the notices should have been redacted, we find the error harmless and affirm for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">1. <em>Facts. </em>On July 31, 1997, Hanson police Officer Paul O\u2019Brien pulled over a car driven by the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer O\u2019Brien ran a check on the defendant\u2019s license and found that it had been revoked. Officer O\u2019Brien did not arrest the defendant at that time because there were four children and a passenger with a valid driver\u2019s license in the car. Instead, Officer O\u2019Brien cited the defendant under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The defendant told Officer O\u2019Brien that his current address was 161 Winter Street, Hanson, even though the address printed on the license stated 750 Nantasket Avenue, Hull. Officer O\u2019Brien wrote the citation using the 750 Nantasket Avenue address as there was no change of address sticker on the defendant\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">2. <em>Redaction. </em>At trial, the Commonwealth introduced certified copies of three registry notices addressed to the defendant at 161 Winter Street, Hanson, informing him that his right to operate a motor vehicle had been revoked. The notices were dated July 1, 2, and 3, 1997. The notices showed that the defendant had been convicted of \u201cDWI Liquor\u201d a number of times from 1990 till 1995. The notices also showed that the defendant had been convicted of driving to endanger, having no liability insurance policy, and leaving the scene of an accident after causing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>property damage. The trial judge admitted the notices over the defendant\u2019s objection and denied the defendant\u2019s request to redact the information about the prior offenses other than \u201cDWI-Liquor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The defendant argues that the notices were inadmissible because they contained highly prejudicial and irrelevant information, and \u201cexposed the jury to extensive bad acts evidence suggesting that [the defendant] had propensity to commit driving violations.\u201d The defendant contends that the notices diverted the jury from the \u201cquestion of the defendant\u2019s guilt to the question of the defendant\u2019s bad character.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466, 469 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The notices were indeed admissible under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 30, \u201cto prove the facts contained therein.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While impermissible to demonstrate bad character, the notices were admissible to prove that the defendant had notice that his driver\u2019s license had been revoked, and that the reason for the revocation was for driving under the influence, \u201cessential elements] of the offense with which he was charged.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parzyck, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 655, 657 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u201cWhile the better practice would have been to redact any extraneous entries [such as driving to endanger, leaving the scene, and having no liability policy], in these circumstances, we perceive no risk that the jury impermissibly convicted the defendant of [driving after revocation of license] on the basis of those entries.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The error was harmless in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>overwhelming evidence against the defendant. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>397 Mass. 298, 300-302 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">3. <em>Bifurcation of trial. </em>General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, provides that if a defendant is charged with a crime which has a more severe punishment in the case of a second or subsequent offense, he is entitled to a separate trial on the second or subsequent offense. The defendant contends the trial judge violated G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11A, and his Federal and State due process rights by placing him on trial for operating a motor vehicle after his license to operate had been revoked, while at the same time placing him on trial as a subsequent offender under the sentencing enhancement provisions of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 23, second par. The defendant argues that under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 23, second par., the fact that the defendant had had his license revoked due to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence is not an element of the crime of driving after revocation of a license. According to the defendant, it is a sentencing enhancement provision. Thus, he argues that G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument is not supported by a clear reading of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 23, second par, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">\u201cAny person convicted of operating a motor vehicle after his license to operate has been suspended or revoked pursuant to a violation of paragraph (a) of subdivision (1) of section twenty-four, . . . and prior to the restoration of such license or right to operate or the issuance to him of a new license to operate shall be punished . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 23, second par., charges an independent crime, i.e., driving with a license suspended or revoked due to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dowler, </em>414 Mass. 212, 215 (1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The reason for the suspension or revocation of the license \u2014 operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol \u2014 is an element of the crime with which the defendant was charged. Here, the defendant was not charged with a subsequent offense of driving under the influence, but with an independent, freestand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>ing crime. Compare <em>Bynum </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 705, 708-709 (1999) (because G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(d), </em>is a sentencing enhancement statute and does not state a separate crime, c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, applies), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zuzick, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 71, 74-75 (1998) (c. 278, \u00a7 11A, applicable to second and subsequent OUI charge under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">4. <em>Sufficiency of evidence. </em>Finally, the defendant argues that the Commonwealth did not present sufficient evidence to prove that he was the person who had been previously convicted of operating under the influence. The defendant contends that the Commonwealth was required to introduce certified copies of the defendant\u2019s convictions and could not rely on the registry notices. As stated earlier, the Commonwealth was not required to do so to satisfy its burden of proof. See n.2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">At trial, the defendant argued that he should be found not guilty as the notices from the registry were mailed to the wrong address. This issue is disposed of simply by acknowledging that the defendant told the police officer at the scene that he lived at 161 Winter Street, the address to which the notices were ultimately sent. \u201cProper mailing of a letter is prima facie evidence of receipt by the addressee.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, </em>421 Mass. 295, 303-304 (1995). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lora, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 136, 143 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Lastly, the defendant asserts that since the notices used the abbreviation \u201cDWI\u201d as opposed to \u201cOUI,\u201d there is no evidence that he had been convicted under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(a)(1). This argument is also meritless, as the notices also referred to \u201cLiquor.\u201d The jury could have reasonably inferred that a conviction for \u201cDWI Liquor\u201d constituted a conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and that it was the present defendant who was previously convicted thereunder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 511 (2000), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>427 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1998) (jury may draw reasonable and possible inferences from circumstantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The propriety of the initial stop is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 30, states that \u201c[c]ertified copies of such records of the registrar, attested by the registrar or his authorized agent, shall be admissible as evidence in any court of the commonwealth to prove the facts contained therein.\u201d The Commonwealth was not required to introduce certified copies of the defendant\u2019s actual court convictions.
