L. c. 148, as amended by St. 1989, c. 306, requires that every building or structure more than seventy feet high built before January 1, 1975, have an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u201cadequate system of automatic sprinklers in accordance with the provisions of the state building code.\u201d That general provision has several exemptions. It is the interpretation of the exemption for \u201crooms or areas of a telephone central office equipment building,\u201d that is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\"><em>Procedural history. </em>In July, 1998, the Framingham fire department (fire department) ordered the plaintiff, AT&amp;T, to install automatic sprinkler equipment in the areas and rooms of its building at 825 Waverly Street that do not house telephone equipment. AT&amp;T appealed this decision to the Automatic Sprinkler Appeals Board (board) claiming that it fell within the exemption referred, to above. The board affirmed the order of the fire department. AT&amp;T then appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. A judge of the Superior Court upheld the board\u2019s decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\"><em>Applicable law. </em>General Laws c. 148, \u00a7 26A V2, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">\u201cEvery building or structure of more than seventy feet in height . . . and constructed prior to January [1, 1975], shall be protected with an adequate system of automatic sprinklers in accordance with the provisions of the state building code; provided, however, that sprinklers shall not be required to be installed in patient rooms in hospitals, or in public or private libraries, or in houses of religious worship ... [or buildings submitted to the condominium law, G. L. c. 183A]; and provided, further, that automatic sprinklers shall not be required in <em>rooms or areas of a telephone central office equipment building when such rooms or areas are protected with an automatic fire alarm system\u201d, </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The fire safety commission has promulgated regulations under \u00a7 26A V2 in language virtually identical to the statute. See 530 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.01(3) (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">AT&amp;T argues here, as it did before the board and the Superior Court, that \u00a7 26A V2 clearly exempts the entire building at 825 Waverly Street from the sprinkler requirements because all the rooms and areas in that building are protected by an automatic fire alarm system. AT&amp;T\u2019s reading of the exemption as applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>to it would be: \u201cautomatic sprinklers [are] not required in [any] rooms or areas of [the] telephone central office equipment building [at 825 Waverly Street because all the] rooms [and] areas are protected with an automatic fire alarm system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The board, on the other hand, asserts that the exemption is clearly limited to rooms and areas containing telephone equipment, if those rooms or areas have fire alarms. It argues that the telephone exemption should be read in context, and points out that two of the exemptions refer to \u201crooms\u201d \u2014 \u201cpatient rooms in hospitals\u201d and \u201crooms ... of a telephone central office equipment building\u201d \u2014 and three refer to entire buildings \u2014 \u201cpublic or private libraries, . . . houses of religious worship,\u201d and buildings subject to the condominium law. According to the board, if the Legislature had intended that the entire building could be subject to the exemption, it would have used the word \u201cbuilding,\u201d rather than the words \u201crooms\u201d or \u201careas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In a postargument letter pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 16(1), as amended, 386 Mass. 1247 (1982), the board directs our attention to the State Building Code chapter on fire protection systems, 780 Code Mass. Regs. The applicable regulation concerning \u201cfire suppression systems,\u201d 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 904.1 (1997), provides an exception for telecommunications equipment buildings. The specifics of that exception are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">\u201cIn telecommunications equipment buildings, an automatic fire suppression system shall not be required in those spaces or areas occupied exclusively for telecommunications equipment, associated electrical power distribution equipment, batteries and standby engines, provided that those spaces or areas are equipped throughout with an automatic fire detection system in accordance with 780 CMR 918.0 and are separated from the remainder of the building with fire separation assemblies [meeting certain standards]\u201d (emphasis omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Earlier versions of the building code contained similar language but were limited to \u201ctelephone central office equipment buildings.\u201d See 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1202.19.1 (1980); 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1002.22.1 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>Legal analysis: </em>\u201cWhere . . . statutory language is clear, it must be given its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>397 Mass. 416, 420 (1986).. We do not \u201cconsider . . . legislative history or agency interpretations\u201d when the meaning of a statute is clear. <em>Brook House Condominium Trust </em>v. <em>Automatic Sprinkler Appeals Bd., </em>414 Mass. 303, 306 (1993). On the other hand, \u201c[w]hen a statute is \u2018capable of being understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses,\u2019 it is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 748, 753 (1996), quoting from 2A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 45.02, at 6 (5th ed. 1992). (See 6th ed. 2000, at 11-12.) The parties argue that the language of \u00a7 26A <em>1h </em>is clear, albeit they disagree about its meaning. We conclude that \u00a7 26A <em>lh </em>is ambiguous and we therefore proceed to consider the statute\u2019s legislative history and to examine the agency\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In holding for the board, the Superior Court judge noted that \u00a7 26A <em>lh. </em>was enacted \u201cin the aftermath of a serious fire at the Prudential Building, which then lacked a sprinkler system,\u201d citing <em>1010 Memorial Drive Tenants Corp. </em>v. <em>Fire Chief of Cambridge, </em>424 Mass. 661, 667 n.l (1997) (Greaney, J., dissenting). The legislation was entitled \u201cAn Act Requiring the Installation of Automatic Sprinklers in Buildings Over Seventy Feet in Height.\u201d See St. 1986,. c. 633. Thus, the purpose of the statute appears to be fire prevention and protection. \u201c[Ljegislation on a matter of public safety should be construed so as to best effectuate its purpose.\u201d <em>1010 Memorial Drive Tenants Corp. </em>v. <em>Fire Chief of Cambridge, supra </em>at 667, and cases cited (Greaney, J., dissenting). Sprinklers control the spread of fire. Alarms serve to warn of a fire but do nothing to control its spread. Presumably the exemption reflects the intent not to subject sensitive telephone equipment to water damage, where the telephone system itself may be important to public safety. Such an interpretation is not only consistent with the clear overarching intent that tall buildings should have sprinkler systems, but is consistent with the rule of statutory construction that exemptions be construed narrowly. See <em>ibid., </em>citing <em>District Attorney for the Plymouth Dist. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Middleborough, </em>395 Mass. 629, 632-633 (1985). Compare <em>1010 Memorial Drive </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Tenants Corp. </em>v. <em>Fire Chief of Cambridge, supra </em>at 663, quoting from <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>402 Mass. 611, 628-629 n.12 (1988) (viewing omission of cooperatives from exemptions under G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 26A <em>1/z, </em>as a \u201cgap[] in the statutory provisions,\u201d and construing exemption for condominiums to include cooperatives).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Although \u201c[t]he duty of statutory interpretation is for the courts . . . [w]here the [agency\u2019s] statutory interpretation is reasonable ... the court should not supplant [that interpretation with its own] judgment.\u201d <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>425 Mass. 523, 525 (1997), quoting from <em>Massachusetts Med. Soc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>402 Mass. 44, 62 (1988). We conclude that the board\u2019s interpretation is reasonable, based on the legislative history and rules of statutory construction governing exceptions. The building code provision lends support to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The opening clause of \u00a7 26A <em>lh </em>requires that buildings be protected with automatic sprinklers \u201cin accordance with the provisions of the state building code.\u201d The board\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the building code. That code, as set out in 780 Code Mass. Regs., limits the telecommunications exemption to rooms and areas used for equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">AT&amp;T objects to our consideration of this regulation because it was not raised at any of the earlier stages of this litigation. However, the regulation was available for our consideration with or without the rule 16(1) letter, because the regulation is subject to judicial notice. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 6. Therefore, we could have affirmed the board\u2019s decision on the basis of that regulation in any case. Cf. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Lowell Sun Publishing Co., </em>404 Mass. 9, 11 (1989), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>389 Mass. 743, 746 (1983) (appellate court may consider issue not addressed by the parties and \u201cmay decide cases on issues or theories not raised\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
