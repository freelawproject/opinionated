Inspector &amp; Bldg. Commr. of Falmouth, ante </em>422 (2001). Frederick Bernstein and two other unit owners of the \u201cCape Codder\u201d brought this related action in the Superior Court to block the construction of the final phase of the Cape Codder condominium complex in Falmouth. Their complaint, stripped of detail, alleges that the vote of the unit holders to extend the time prescribed in the master deed for completion of the final phase was a nullity. A discrete issue is whether the Falmouth conservation commission improvidentially granted a wetlands permit to the developers. A judge of the Superior Court decided both matters in favor of the defendants on cross motions for summary judgment and other related motions. He ruled that the trustees had properly conducted the vote on the extension and that the appeal of the Department of Environmental Protection\u2019s (DEP) order of conditions was untimely. We conclude that the judge\u2019s ruling was correct as to these claims and affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">1. <em>Undisputed facts concerning the vote to extend development rights. </em>By 1989 the defendant developers and their predecessors-in-interest had completed twenty units of the Cape Codder condominium. Under the condominium\u2019s 1989 master deed, the developers reserved the right to increase the number of units by constructing an additional structure, \u201cBuilding Five\u201d (building five). The master deed explicitly limited the developers\u2019 right to expand construction to ten years \u2014 expiring on October 19, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>By letter to all twenty unit owners dated March 10, 1999, the Cape Codder trustees sent written proposals to extend development rights for two months to December 31, 1999, with provisions for additional extensions of up to thirty-four months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Included with the proposal was a ballot form to express consent and a letter indicating that, if the unit owners were in agreement with the proposed extension, they should sign and return the form \u201cwithin 60 days of receipt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The responses to this proposal were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">(1) The owners of thirteen units consented to the proposed extension as written<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>;</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">(2) The owners of two units assented to a limited extension of the developers\u2019 rights beyond December 31, 1999; one to April 19 and the other to April 30<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>;</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">(3) The owners of five units did not assent to an extension and signed an \u201cObjection to Proposed Extension of Development Rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The trustees concluded that fifteen out of twenty (seventy-five percent of the units) assented to an extension to April 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>2000. The trustees ratified the extension vote on October 8, 1999, and recorded a certificate of the extension of the reserved rights at the Barnstable Registry of Deeds on October 18, 1999. The certificate limited the extension to April 19, 2000. The defendant developers did not ultimately exercise their extension rights beyond December 31, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">2. <em>Analysis. </em>The assent of seventy-five per cent of a condominium\u2019s unit owners is required to extend developers\u2019 rights beyond those specifically set forth in a master deed. G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 5(6)(2)(iii).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that the trustees improperly recorded the certificate extending the developers\u2019 rights because seven of the twenty unit owners did not assent to the proposed extension as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The plaintiffs argue correctly that if either of the two ballots containing limitations on the extension period were to be counted as objections, the trastees would have improperly recorded the certificate. It would, however, elevate form over substance to count the votes in this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">First, we do not agree that it is determinative that one of the two limited assents was returned on a form captioned \u201cObjection to Proposed Extension of Development Rights,\u201d rather than on one captioned \u201cConsent to Proposed Extension of Development Rights.\u201d While a caption may illuminate a document\u2019s text, we do not disregard the document\u2019s substance. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vaidulas, </em>433 Mass. 247, 252 (2001) (finding no prejudice to defendant merely because Commonwealth\u2019s notice of appeal may have been miscaptioned). Here, the text contained in the ballot extended development rights until April 30, 2000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>and can only be read as an assent to extend development rights to at least April 30, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 better argument is that neither one of the two disputed votes was a limited assent, but, instead, each represented objections coupled with offers to amend the original proposal. Under this reasoning, the initial proposal was substantially altered by the amendments, and the proposal was defeated. The two unit owners, however, apparently construed the proposal as offering two options: (1) that the development rights be extended for two months, and if so (2) that additional future extensions (limited to an additional thirty-four months) be exercisable on a month-to-month basis. Although these options were not presented as separate questions, the unit voters could logically distinguish the first from the second option.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Even if we were to agree in theory with the plaintiffs\u2019 tally of the votes, we would not invalidate the certificate on that basis alone because we do not see how the plaintiffs were prejudiced. The remedy for a defective ratification would be resubmission to the unit owners. Nothing in the record or pleadings suggests that a new vote would result in a different outcome. Fifteen of the twenty units impliedly agreed to the extension of development rights beyond October 19, 1999, and the developers did not exercise their (disputed) rights under the certificate to seek monthly extensions beyond December 31, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Neither the master deed nor the governing statute precludes the trustees from ratifying a vote that represents an expressly limited compromise. We find no practical or legal flaw in the Superior Court judge\u2019s framing of the issue and agree that seventy-five per cent of the voters assented to an extension beyond the October 19, 1999, deadline. Thus, we affirm the Superior Court summary judgment ruling in favor of the defendants on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">3. <em>Bernstein\u2019s appeal of the DEP decision. </em>On June 16, 1998, the town of Falmouth conservation commission sent the defendant developer an \u201corder of conditions\u201d wetlands permit to construct building five. Bernstein appealed the permit to the DEP. On October 15, 1998, the DEP issued a \u201csuperseding order of conditions\u201d related to a Falmouth conservation commission permit for building five, essentially affirming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>original permit. Bernstein appealed the DEP\u2019s \u201csuperseding order of conditions\u201d to an administrative law judge (ALJ). On April 9, 1999, the ALJ dismissed the appeal because Bernstein \u201clack[ed] standing, individually to appeal a wetlands superseding order of conditions allowing [the] work . . . because [ ] G. L. c. 183A, \u00a7 10(b)(4) vests authority to litigate claims concerning a condominium\u2019s common areas exclusively in the condominium association.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">On May 12, 1999, the ALJ denied Bernstein\u2019s motion for rehearing and request for extension of the date for intervention by other parties. A party unknown to Bernstein signed a United States Postal Service return receipt of this final judgment on May 14, 1999. Over thirty days later, on June 16, 1999, Bernstein sought review of the ALJ\u2019s dismissal in a complaint to the Barnstable Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Bernstein received legal notice of the DEP\u2019s rehearing decision on Friday, May 14, 1999, when an unidentified person signed the certified mail receipt of the decision. We do not reach the merits of his appeal, dated June 16, 1999, because it was filed after the statutory deadline. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(1) (requiring requests for review to be filed within thirty days after receipt of notice of agency decisions unless good cause for an extension is shown).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Bernstein argues that he had good cause to request an extension, because his secretary date-stamped the decision when she received it on Monday, May 17. We do not reach Bernstein\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d argument, however, because he does not attempt to distinguish our cases holding that a request for an extension must come within the statutory period, and not after it has already expired. See <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 668, 669 (1984); <em>Wolbach </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>20 Mass.
