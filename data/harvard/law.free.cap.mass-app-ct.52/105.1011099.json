See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31 (death benefits) and \u00a7 33 (burial benefits). The issue before us is whether the provisions of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7A, as amended in 1991 (see St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 21, set out in the margin),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are available to this claimant. Section 7A establishes,</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>in certain cases, \u201cprima facie evidence of causal relationship between the employment and the injury or fatality.\u201d See <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>373 Mass. 813, 816-817 (1977) (presumption available where employee found dead at his place of employment). We conclude that the presumptions are not available in this case, and that the claimant is not entitled to the benefits she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We recapitulate the summary of the material facts that appear in the decision of the board, supplemented by unchallenged facts found by the administrative judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Donald Costa (Costa) worked for Colonial Gas Company from 1971 until his death, at age forty-three, on March 23, 1992. He made residential calls to service household appliances, some of which are regarded as heavy appliances. Costa routinely lifted and moved these heavy appliances. He worked long hours \u2014 up to sixty hours per week in busy seasons. In December, 1991, he was admitted to Lowell General Hospital and was diagnosed as having suffered a myocardial infarction. After a cardiac catheterization, he improved and was discharged. Nevertheless, his physical condition deteriorated.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">On March 22, 1992, Costa arrived for work at 4:00 p.m. to start his eight-hour shift. Sometime before 5:00 p.m. he left the shop for a repair job in Westford. He did not feel well and he never arrived at the Westford job. Instead, he turned around and headed back to the shop. By coincidence, the claimant saw Costa, on his way back to the shop, parked by the side of the road. Costa told the claimant he did not feel well, and after returning the truck to the shop he returned home, had something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>to eat, and fell asleep watching television. Around 5:00 a.m. the claimant heard strange noises from Costa; attempts to resuscitate him failed, and he was taken by ambulance to the hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">At the hearing before the administrative judge, Costa\u2019s family physician, Dr. Jeffrey Byrne, testified that Costa\u2019s work activities on March 22 contributed to his death. Dr. Lawrence Baker also testified for the claimant, expressing the opinion that Costa\u2019s activities on March 22 were a major contributing factor to the fatal myocardial infarction. However, at his deposition, he was asked his opinion on the hypothetical assumption that there was no evidence of any exertion by Costa on March 22. Dr. Baker testified that in that event he would be unable to make a causal connection between Costa\u2019s work and his myocardial infarction.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Dr. Elliot Sagall testified for the insurer. Based on the absence of any significant work activity on March 22, Dr. Sagall opined that Costa\u2019s activities on that day did not contribute to Costa\u2019s myocardial infarction.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The administrative judge rejected the claimant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 7A was available. He concluded \u201cthat the connection, both in time and in substance, between the employee\u2019s condition while at work on March 22, 1992[,] and his condition in the early morning hours of March 23, 1992, is not so direct and strong as to warrant a finding that the employee was \u2018killed or found dead at his place of employment.\u2019 \u201d Further, the judge denied the claimant\u2019s \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 33 claims; he adopted \u201cthe medical opinion of the insurer\u2019s expert . . . [and found] that the employee\u2019s death was not related to any work activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The board overruled its prior decisions in <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Courier Citizen Co., </em>9 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 333, 340-341 (1995) (\u201cWhere the employee is deceased, \u00a7 7A operates as it had in the past, as prima facie evidence that the employee was performing his or her regular duties on the date of death\u201d), and <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Light Metal Platers, </em>11 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 563, 565 (1997), and affirmed the decision of the administrative judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">We review the board\u2019s decision under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2), as amended through St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 32A, in accordance with the standards expressed in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 <em>14(7)(a)-(d), </em>(f), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>and <em>(g).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 257-258 (1994). In this case we consider whether the board correctly decided that the administrative judge had properly determined that \u00a7 7A was not available to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The narrow question before us, not previously considered by our appellate courts, is whether the special provisions of \u00a7 7A \u2014 which permit a death claim to constitute prima facie evidence that the employee was performing his regular duties on the day of the incident, see note 3, <em>supra </em>\u2014 are available when, as in this case, the employee is neither killed nor found dead at his place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The claimant argues that \u201c[b]y using the word killed [and taking that word to mean \u2018every person that is dead has been deprived of life, or \u201ckilled\u201d \u2019] and not limiting it those killed at their place of employment, the Legislature intended the [\u00a7] 7A presumption to apply to employees who are dead (\u2018have been killed\u2019) as well as to employees who are found dead at their place of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We reject the argument. Without regard to questionable validity of the argument regarding \u00a7 7A prior to the 1991 amendment, it fails to recognize the change effected by the 1991 amendment. Prior to the 1991 amendment, \u00a7 7A provided that \u201cwhere the employee has been killed, or found dead at his place of employment . . . ,\u201d the presumptions are available. The 1991 amendment, inter alia, deleted the comma after the word \u201ckilled.\u201d The effect of that deletion is that the phrase, \u201cat his place of employment,\u201d now qualifies the entire phrase, \u201cwhere the employee has been killed or found dead . . . .\u201d See <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Brookline Rent Control Bd., </em>385 Mass. 228, 232 (1982) (\u201cpunctuation . . . may be resorted to when it tends to throw light upon the meaning of the language\u201d), quoting from <em>Greenough </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>206 Mass. 247, 252 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Simply put, the statutory phrase \u2014 \u201ckilled or found dead at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>his place of employment\u201d \u2014 is plain language that \u201cmust be interpreted in accordance with the usual and natural meaning of the words.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>AMIWoodbroke, Inc., </em>418 Mass. 92, 94 (1994). The particular phrase, \u201cat his place of employment,\u201d is a description of the employee\u2019s workplace, and \u00a7 7A may not be given an interpretation that attributes no purpose or meaning to the language.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t is clear that \u00a7 7A was amended to address the problem of over-extending the benefit of statutory protection for testimonial incapacities [including death] to situations that did not result from the industrial accident.\u201d Koziol, Massachusetts Worker\u2019s Compensation Reform Act \u00a7 10.7, at 298 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Because Costa\u2019s death did not occur at his workplace, \u00a7 7A was not available to the claimant, and for the reason stated herein, the \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 33 claims must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\n<em>Decision of Industrial Accidents Reviewing Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b127-15\">Section 7A, as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 21, which is applicable to this case, provides in material part as follows: \u201cIn any claim for compensation where the employee has been killed or found dead at his place of employment or, in the absence of death, is physically or mentally unable to testify, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>such testimonial incapacity is causally related to the injury, it shall be prima facie evidence that the employee was performing his regular duties on the day of injury or death and that the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Prior to the 1991 amendment, \u00a7 7A, as appearing in St. 1947, c. 380, amended by St. 1971, c. 702, provided, in material part, as follows: \u201cIn any claim for compensation where the employee has been killed, or found dead at his place of employment or is physically or mentally unable to testify, it shall be prima facie evidence that the employee was performing his regular duties on the day of injury or fatality or death or disability and that the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The facts appearing in the decision of the board follow closely the facts found by the administrative judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Clause (e) of \u00a7 14(7) having been omitted from \u00a7 12(2) of c. 152, we do not review to determine whether the board\u2019s judgment was \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d For this, reason, we do not review the finding of the administrative judge, undisturbed by the board, that the claimant did not carry her burden of showing that Costa\u2019s death was causally related to a workplace injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The claimant\u2019s argument would make \u00a7 7A available in all death cases: those employees who are \u201ckilled\u201d as a result of any event, and those who are found dead at their place of employment, thereby rendering the required location \u2014 place of employment \u2014\u2022 surplusage.
