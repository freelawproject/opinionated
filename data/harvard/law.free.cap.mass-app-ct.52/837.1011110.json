See G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 10; <em>Baxter Health Care Corp. </em>v. <em>Harvard Apparatus, Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 204, 208 (1993) (award of attorney\u2019s fees precluded in arbitration proceedings unless provided in arbitration agreement). In their cross appeals, they challenge the arbitrator\u2019s method of calculating the attorney\u2019s fees and the modifications imposed by two Superior Court judges. (There is no challenge to the damage award.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">The underlying contract was a \u201cSoftware License and Marketing Agreement\u201d (agreement) between the plaintiff, Soft-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>key, Inc., formerly known as Spinnaker Software Corporation (Softkey), and the defendant, Useful Software, Inc. (Useful), in which Softkey agreed to \u201cpublish and distribute computer software programs\u201d created by Useful. The relationship between the parties was rancorous from the beginning. Probably as a result, these proceedings have been protracted. After hearing, an arbitrator issued a twenty-three page award, followed by the parties\u2019 cross appeals to the Superior Court, which remanded the case to the arbitrator with instructions. The arbitrator then issued a supplemental award, which the parties again cross-appealed. A second Superior Court judge then issued an order and entered judgment on September 23, 1997, modifying the supplemental award. The same judge later denied Softkey\u2019s subsequent motion for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in Superior Court and entered a second judgment on January 14, 1998, ordering Softkey to make payment to Useful as provided in the modified supplement award.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\"><em>The arbitration provision and prior proceedings. </em>The provisions regarding attorney\u2019s fees are found in par. 10(a) of the agreement, captioned \u201cDispute Resolution.\u201d After establishing that \u201c[a]ny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with [the] [agreement shall be determined and settled by arbitration,\u201d par. 10(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-6\">\u201cAll costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, of all parties incurred in any dispute which is determined and/or settled by arbitration pursuant to this paragraph 10 shall be borne by the party determined to be liable in respect of such dispute; provided, however, that if complete liability is not assessed against any one party, the parties shall share the total costs in proportion to their respective amounts of liability so determined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">As set out in his initial award, the arbitrator found that \u201c[a]lthough the findings/conclusions ... are mixed, Useful is substantially the prevailing party as to a key portion of its breach of contract claim and [Softkey] avoids damages under Useful\u2019s tort [misrepresentation/fraud] and chapter 93A claims.\u201d He also observed that \u201c[Softkey\u2019s] stonewalling in discovery [made] ascertainment of damages i;fficult,\u201d but concluded that he was able to make \u201creasoned est rates.\u201d \u201cThe [intent of the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>relief fashioned was to set Useful free with a return of its intangible property . . . and with a cash award . . . and allocation of costs and attorney[\u2019]s fee shifting in accord with the . . . [agreement (modified by some fee shifting re attorney conduct).\u201d He awarded Useful damages for lost royalties of $170,000 with \u201clegal interest (12%)\u201d as well as equitable relief releasing it from most of its obligations under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">In calculating attorney\u2019s fees, the arbitrator \u201c[took] into account the extent to which each party prevailed (in relation to its reasonable expectations), and discovery conduct.\u201d He ordered that Softkey reimburse Useful for two-thirds of Useful\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, less one-third of Softkey\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, provided that Softkey\u2019s fees and costs as so computed did not exceed one-half of Useful\u2019s. He added that he would have awarded Softkey one-half (rather than one-third) of its attorney\u2019s fees but for Softkey\u2019s \u201cstonewalling\u201d in the course of the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">On appeal, Softkey claims there was error (1) in confirming the arbitrator\u2019s use of what Softkey terms a \u201cqualitative\u201d component in the calculation and allocation of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs; and (2) in denying Softkey\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees associated with its appeal(s) to the Superior Court. In its cross appeal, Useful challenges (1) the limitation of its attorney\u2019s fees award by its contingent fee agreement; and (2) the rejection of the arbitrator\u2019s consideration of Softkey\u2019s conduct in awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\"><em>Standard of review. </em>It is well established that \u201cthe scope of judicial review of the arbitration proceedings is narrow.\u201d <em>Grobet File Co. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>RTC Sys., Inc., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 135 (1988). \u201cIf the arbitrator[] in assessing damages commit[s] an error of law or fact, but do[es] not overstep the limits of the issues submitted to [him], a court may not substitute its judgment on the matter.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. 18, 28-29 (1980). See <em>Barletta </em>v. <em>French, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 87, 93-94 (1993). Among other limitations, an arbitrator may not \u201ctranscend[] the limits of the contract of which the agreement to arbitrate is but a part.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, supra </em>at 28. However, although \u201cthe arbitrator may not ignore the plain words of the contract ... the limiting boundaries [on an arbi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>tral award] . . . must be set forth with clarity, and the limiting words must be plain. If there is room for doubt or interpretation on the question, then the issue properly lies within the broad authority conferred upon arbitrators of civil disputes.\u201d <em>Grobet File Co. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>RTC Sys., Inc., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 134-135. The question of the interpretation of an arbitration agreement is for the arbitrator. <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Softk\u00e9y argues that the arbitrator \u201clacked the authority to invent or estimate the sort of \u2018qualitative\u2019 component he used in the calculation of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs,\u201d apparently referring to the arbitrator\u2019s decision to consider each party\u2019s \u201creasonable expectations\u201d in determining which party prevailed. See G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 12(a)(3). Softkey claims that the sum of Useful\u2019s claims for damages under various theories was more than $2.24 million, and that therefore Softkey actually prevailed \u201cas to 92.9% of the dispute\u201d because Useful recovered less than ten per cent of the total it claimed. As the Superior Court judge ruled, the determination of which party prevailed and to what degree was clearly within the arbitrator\u2019s authority to interpret the inconclusive terms of the arbitration agreement. See <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., supra; Grobet File Co. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>RTC Sys., Inc., supra. </em>Useful\u2019s argument that it prevailed entirely and. should receive one hundred per cent of its fees and costs is, for the same reason, without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">As to the arbitrator\u2019s consideration of Softkey\u2019s conduct during the arbitration, there is nothing in the agreement that explicitly prevents such consideration. See <em>id. </em>at 134-135. It was within the authority of the arbitrator to conclude that the sharing of costs in \u201cproportion to their respective amounts of liability\u201d could reflect the degree to which the parties participated constructively in the arbitration process, particularly when he concluded that the determination of damages was impaired by Softkey\u2019s conduct. \u201c[Arbitrators have broad authority to establish a balance between the parties.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The second Superior Court judge ruled that \u201cthe contingency fee cap must be applied\u201d based on the \u201cplain words\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>agreement, which he construed as requiring the arbitrator to \u201cfollow substantive rules of law.\u201d According to the judge, <em>Winthrop Corp. </em>v. <em>Lowenthal, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 180 (1990) (contingent fee controlled where one party prevailed and contingent fee agreement not disclosed to arbitrator or court), constitutes such a substantive rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The plain words of par. 10(a) on which the judge was relying are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-6\">\u201cThe party submitting [a] dispute [to arbitration under this paragraph] shall request the American Arbitration Association to (i) appoint an arbitrator who is knowledgeable in the microcomputer area and familiar with the data processing industry and who will follow substantive rules of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The import of the words \u201csubstantive rules of law\u201d at issue here is not clear. Useful argues that the clause refers to the substantive law governing the technicalities of microcomputers and data processing. Such an interpretation would have been within the arbitrator\u2019s authority. See <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. at 1007. Indeed the arbitrator did discuss the law governing the parties\u2019 activities in several places in the award. Assuming, without deciding, that <em>Winthrop Corp. </em>v. <em>Lowenthal, supra, </em>is not distinguishable, the arbitrator\u2019s deviation from the holding in that case was at most an error of law, and therefore not subject to review. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>380 Mass. at 28-29. Cf. <em>Grobet File Co. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>RTC Sys., Inc., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 135 (\u201cCourts will not disturb the arbitrator\u2019s findings and conclusions even if [in the court\u2019s view] they are grossly erroneous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The arbitrator\u2019s original award was within his authority, and should be reinstated. The subject of attorney\u2019s fees was committed to arbitration. Cf. <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>372 Mass. 86, 87 n.2 (1977) (where insurance policy limited arbitration to \u201cquestions concerning the insured\u2019s rights against the . . . uninsured [motorist],\u201d arbitrator exceeded authority in deciding question of insurer\u2019s liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">The judgments entered on September 23, 1997, and January 14, 1998, are vacated. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court, where a new judgment shall enter making a net award of $52,292 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Useful (consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>section m of the arbitrator\u2019s supplemental award), and striking all other provisions in the supplemental award incorporating the Superior Court order that Useful\u2019s contingent fee agreement be treated as a cap. The Superior Court may take further action not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Finally, we note our agreement with the reasoning of the Superior Court judge as set out in his memorandum and order denying Softkey\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
