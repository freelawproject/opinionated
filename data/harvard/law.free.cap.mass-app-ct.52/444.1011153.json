L. c. 152, \u00a7 65A, has been designated to issue a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy to an employer as an assigned risk, may unilaterally rescind, or otherwise terminate, the policy issued upon realizing that the initial premium fee has not been paid, without complying with the procedures set forth in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65B. We conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, it may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">On March 26, 1996, Daniel Cummings, an employee of Demolition Specialists, Inc. (Demolition Specialists), was injured on a construction job. There is no dispute that his injury is covered under the work\u00e9rs\u2019 compensation act. Less clear is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the party responsible for his payments: AIU Insurance Company (AIU),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Eastern Casualty Insurance Company (Eastern),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund (Trust Fund),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or Demolition Specialists.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>Facts. </em>On February 1, 1996, Jeffrey Kukene, president of Demolition Specialists, completed an application for insurance through the assigned risk pool.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Along with his application, he tendered a check for $9,010, the initial premium amount, to the Massachusetts Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau (Rating Bureau).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">On February 21, 1996, the Rating Bureau issued a notice of assignment stating that Eastern was the assigned carrier for Demolition Specialists effective February 10, 1996, and that a policy had been issued. Also on February 21, 1996, the Rating Bureau forwarded Demolition Specialists\u2019 check for the premium to Eastern which Eastern deposited. On March 6, 1996, the check was returned to Eastern due to insufficient funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Eastern notified Demolition Specialists by letter dated March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>12, 1996, that the check had been returned marked insufficient funds. In the letter, Eastern informed Demolition Specialists that \u201cthe notice of assignment had been rescinded and that no coverage had been provided.\u201d Eastern also advised Demolition Specialists to submit a new application for insurance to the Rating Bureau.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Demolition Specialists received Eastern\u2019s letter on March 13, 1996, and promptly sent a new application to the Rating Bureau accompanied by a cashier\u2019s check for the premium due. A new notice of assignment was issued on April 23, 1996, indicating that Demolition Specialists was again covered by Eastern, effective March 28, 1996. The accident involving Cummings occurred two days prior to the effective date of this new policy. Eastern deposited the cashier\u2019s check on May 3, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">An administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department), concluding that the policy had issued on February 10, 1996, found that Eastern had provided coverage for Cummings\u2019s claim, and that it had not properly terminated the policy as of the date of Cummings\u2019s injury, as it had failed to notify the Rating Bureau of its rescission until April of 1996. The reviewing board summarily affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision. Eastern appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\"><em>Background. </em>The purpose of G. L. c. 152 is to ensure that financial assistance is made readily and speedily available to injured employees. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Leighton, </em>385 Mass. 757, 761 (1982). As a necessary corollary, it is essential that the Rating Bureau know, with as much accuracy as possible, who is insured. <em>Frost </em>v. <em>David C. Wells Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 305, 308 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In cases where an employer is unable to obtain insurance on its own, it may apply to the commissioner of insurance. G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>c. 152, \u00a7 65A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The commissioner will then assign an insurance carrier, from the assigned risk pool, to the employer if all.the requirements are met. <em>Ibid. </em>This process is administered by the Rating Bureau. The risks taken by the insurance carriers for providing insurance to these high-risk employers is distributed equitably among the insurers. <em>Ibid. </em>If the insurer wishes to cancel or otherwise terminate a policy issued under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65A, it must provide written notice to the Rating Bureau and the insured employer of its intention. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65B. The termination is effective unless the employer files objections within ten days after receipt of the notice. See <em>ibid; Armstrong\u2019s Case, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 693, 696 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Had Demolition Specialists\u2019 initial check cleared, there would be no question as to the liability of Eastern. However, since the check was returned for insufficient funds on March 6, Eastern contends that a condition precedent (i.e., payment) for issuing the policy was not met and, thus, no policy was in effect on the date of the employee\u2019s injury. Eastern bases its argument on the common law doctrine of rescission<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and on the language in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65A, which provides that \u201cthe commissioner shall designate an insurer who shall forthwith, <em>upon the receipt of the payment for the premium therefore, </em>issue to such employer a policy of insurance\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>The language in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65A, upon which Eastern relies, is difficult to rationalize with the actual method by which assigned risk policies are issued. Coverage is bound as of the date the notice of assignment states the policy was issued, irrespective of when the premium funds are actually in the insurer\u2019s hands.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See note 11, <em>infra. </em>This practice apparently has evolved in light of the necessity of ensuring that coverage is provided for injured employees<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the time it may take for a check to clear. Indeed, Eastern\u2019s Director of Underwriting testified, and acknowledged, that this is the manner in which coverage is obtained.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore are constrained to rule that a policy was issued by Eastern effective as of February 10, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We now turn to the question whether Eastern properly canceled or otherwise terminated the policy. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65B.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In <em>Armstrong\u2019s Case, </em>the insurer issued a workers\u2019 compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>tion assigned risk policy to the employer for the period covering May 13, 1988, to May 13, 1989. On November 14, 1988, the insurer mailed the employer a letter indicating that the policy would be canceled in two weeks unless a premium payment was made. When the payment was not forthcoming, the insurer canceled the policy. The cancellation was held to be ineffective in that the insurer failed to fully comply with the notice requirements of \u00a7 65B by not sending a copy of the notice to the department.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 47 Mass. App. Ct. at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">A similar result was reached in <em>Frost, </em>where the workers\u2019 compensation policy expired by its own terms. \u201cOn September 24, 1975, [the insurer] issued a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy for a period of nine months and, on November 17, sent written notice of that fact to the [department], pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 63.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] The notice stated that the policy was issued for a period of nine months [and expired in June, 1976]. No other notice was sent to the [department by the insurer].\u201d 14 Mass. App. Ct. at 306-307. This court rejected the assertion that the November 17 letter satisfied the notice requirements of the statute. We held that where the insurer failed to comply with the statutory requirements of termination, coverage continued.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cIf [the insurer\u2019s] contention were correct, not only would the [department\u2019s] task [to ensure coverage by employers] be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>more onerous by requiring it to keep a file of the dates of expiration of all employers\u2019 policies, but also the [department] would be unable to ascertain from its records whether an employer had coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">There are similar policy considerations in the case at bar. If Eastern wished to cancel the policy, it had to conform to the requirements of \u00a7 65B, which it failed to do when it did not notify the Rating Bureau in a timely manner. A contrary decision would \u201cbe disruptive of the time and energy of the [Rating Bureau] and hence contrary to the principles of sound administrative procedure,\u201d <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Arrow Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 636 (1983), and would defeat the purpose of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 63 and 65B, which allow the department to know with certainty whether an employer is insured. <em>Frost, supra </em>at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Since Eastern could not unilaterally rescind the policy, and since it did not comply with the requirements of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65B, it insured Demolition Specialists, effective February 10, 1996, and provided coverage on the date of Cummings\u2019s injury on March 26, 1996.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The decision of the reviewing board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">AIU Insurance Company covered the general contractor, Boston Development Construction (BDC), for workers\u2019 compensation claims. One of BDC\u2019s subcontractors at the time was Demolition Specialists. Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18, the insurer of an independent contractor is liable for workers\u2019 compensation claims brought by employees of an uninsured subcontractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Cummings filed his claim against AIU because he believed Demolition Specialists was uninsured. AIU joined Eastern on the theory that Eastern had improperly canceled or terminated Demolition Specialists\u2019 original policy. Subsequently, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund as well as Demolition Specialists were joined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b467-10\">The Trust Fund is liable for the payments in cases where the employer is uninsured and no other insurance company is liable. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b467-11\">If the Trust Fund is found liable, it can recover its losses from the uninsured employer. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-12\">Massachusetts law requires employers to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance; failure to do so is a criminal offense. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25C. Since some employers are unable to obtain such insurance in the voluntary market, the Massachusetts Workers\u2019 Compensation Assigned Risk Pool was created to aid employers in satisfying their obligations under the law. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65A. Employers who demonstrate that their application for workers\u2019 compensation insurance has been rejected by two insurers may apply to the assigned risk pool. <em>Ibid. </em>If the employer meets all the requirements under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65A, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau of Massachusetts, designated to administer the pool, will assign the employer an insurance carrier. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Kszepka\u2019s Case, </em>408 Mass. 843, 848 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Eastem contended that it sent a copy of this letter to the Rating Bureau; however, since no return receipt was found, there is no proof of the Rating Bureau\u2019s receipt of the letter. In contrast, Eastern\u2019s file contained a return receipt for the letter sent to Demolition Specialists. If this letter had been received by the Rating Bureau, the policy would have been rescinded, subject to the ten-day appeal period. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65B. The Rating Bureau did receive, on April 16, 1996, a notice of rescission, which Eastern mailed on April 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The relevant portion of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65A, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u201c(1) Any employer whose application for workers\u2019 compensation insurance has been rejected or not accepted within five days by two insurers may appeal to the commissioner of insurance and if it shall appear that such employer has complied with or will comply substantially with all laws, orders, rules and regulations in force and effect relating to the welfare, health and safety of his employees, and shall not be in default of payment of any premium for such insurance, then the commissioner shall designate an insurer who shall forthwith, upon the receipt of the payment for the premium therefore, issue to such employer a policy of insurance contracting to pay the compensation provided for by this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Rescission is an equitable remedy granted when there has been a mutual mistake of fact or fraud between the parties.
