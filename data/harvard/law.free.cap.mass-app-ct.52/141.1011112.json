This appeal presents us with another worker\u2019s compensation case in which we are asked to determine whether the employee was the prevailing party<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, thus, entitled to at-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tomey\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the applicable regulation, 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) (1997).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Reversing an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the employee by an administrative judge after a hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11, the reviewing board (board) of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) ruled that the employee was not a prevailing party and, thus, not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the applicable statute and regulation. On appeal, the employee argues (1) that the regulation is invalid and his entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees under the statute is mandated by our prior decisions in <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 35 (1996), and <em>Cruz\u2019s Case, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 26 (2001); or alternatively (2) that he is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the statute and regulation. We affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The employee incurred an injury in December, 1993, in the course of his employment for Back Bay Restaurant Group, Inc. The insurer accepted the claim and began paying temporary total incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34. On or about October 11, 1995, the insurer filed a complaint with the department to discontinue or modify benefits on the basis that the employee was able to resume some level of employment and, therefore, was no longer totally disabled. On January 25, 1996, an administrative judge issued a conference order pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, authorizing the insurer to terminate payment of temporary total incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\u00a7 34, but ordering it to begin paying temporary partial incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, at a rate of $218.08 per week from January 25, 1996, and continuing based on an assigned earning capacity of $175 per week for the employee. Both the employee and the insurer filed an appeal from the conference order, but in July, 1996, the insurer subsequently withdrew its appeal. At the February, 1997, hearing before the administrative judge on the employee\u2019s appeal, the employee sought temporary total disability benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, and benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 30, for payment of medical and hospital expenses. After the hearing, the administrative judge ordered the insurer to pay temporary partial disability benefits pursuant to \u00a7 35, in the sum of $209.08 per week from December 20, 1996, and continuing based on an increased earning capacity of $190 assigned to the employee. The judge also ordered the insurer to pay attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5), based upon the fact that his decision modified but did not discontinue the employee\u2019s benefits. The judge also made a general award of \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 30 benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The insurer appealed the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the board. The board reversed the award of attorney\u2019s fees, based upon its conclusion that the employee was not a prevailing party under \u00a7 13A(5) and 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) where the employee\u2019s appeal did not result in increased benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We address first the employee\u2019s attack on the regulation. The employee argues that it is inconsistent with the statute because it alters the meaning of the words \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the statute. Although the words \u201cprevailing party\u201d are not defined in the statute, the employee relies upon the meaning ascribed to those words in other worker\u2019s compensation cases decided by us. We have said that an employee is considered the prevailer if he \u201csucceeds on any significant litigation issue, achieving \u2018some of the benefit\u2019 sought in the controversy.\u201d <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 38. <em>Cruz\u2019s Case, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 28. Relying on that formulation, the employee argues that, because his appeal put in jeopardy the award of temporary partial disability benefits from January 25, 1996, and he retained those benefits even though they could have been eliminated or reduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>based on the increased earning capacity assigned to him as a result of the hearing which resulted in a reduction of weekly temporary partial disability benefits from $218.08 to $209.08 beginning on December 20, 1996, he achieved success on a significant, disputed issue and, thus, is entitled to his attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In determining the validity of the subject regulation, we recognize that an administrative regulation is \u201cnot to be declared void unless [its] provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate, and enforcement of such regulation]] should be refused only if [it is] plainly in excess of legislative power.\u201d <em>Dowell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>424 Mass. 610, 613 (1997), quoting from <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 595-596 (1992). Further, a party who questions the facial validity of a regulation \u201cbears the heavy burden of \u2018proving on the record \u201cthe absence of any conceivable ground upon which [the regulation] may be upheld\u201d \u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 612. We are of the opinion that, in the circumstances presented, the employee has failed to meet that heavy burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The regulation is simply an attempt to clarify what is meant by a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the statute. It provides that, in all cases where compensation is ordered or not discontinued, the employee shall be deemed to have prevailed except in those cases where an employee but not the insurer appeals a conference order and the employee does not receive any increase in his benefits. It is not unreasonable for the regulation to provide that an employee shall not be considered to have prevailed under \u00a7 13A(5) when it is the employee\u2019s own appeal, rather than the insurer\u2019s appeal, that has placed the employee\u2019s benefits in jeopardy and the employee gains no increased benefits from the appeal. Contrast <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 37 (in self-insurer\u2019s and employee\u2019s appeal all the benefits were at stake); <em>Cruz\u2019s Case, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 28 (the insurer\u2019s appeal placed the employee\u2019s entire benefits in jeopardy). Also, it is generally recognized that one of the purposes for the award of attorney\u2019s fees in worker\u2019s compensation cases is to discourage unnecessary litigation. See <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 180, 187 (1932); <em>Daly\u2019s Case, </em>405 Mass. 33, 41 (1989). To the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>that the regulation achieves this purpose, we do not consider it in conflict with the provisions of \u00a7 13A. For these reasons, we conclude the regulation is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Nor do we think that the formulation that we have ascribed to the prevailing party in <em>Connolly\u2019s Case </em>warrants a contrary result. That formulation is based on a determination of who is a prevailing party under the Federal civil rights statute. <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 38. <em>Gonzalez\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 39, 41-42 (1996). The focus of that formulation is on the results achieved in the litigation. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, </em>384 Mass. 444, 452-453 (1981), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>456 U.S. 947 (1982). <em>Kadlick </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, </em>431 Mass. 850, 852-853 (2000). See <em>Nadeau </em>v. <em>Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 278-279 (1st Cir. 1978); <em>Bagby </em>v. <em>Beal, </em>606 F.2d 411, 415 (3d Cir. 1979); <em>Dahlem </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of Denver Pub. Schs., </em>901 F.2d 1508, 1511-1514 (10th Cir. 1990); <em>Stivers </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>71 F.3d 732, 751 (9th Cir. 1995). Here, the employee certainly did not appeal the conference order to achieve the status quo<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or to have his benefits reduced, which was the result of his appeal. Thus, focusing on the result of the employee\u2019s appeal, we think that the employee could not under the formulation applied in <em>Connolly\u2019s Case </em>or any definition<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of prevailing party be considered to have prevailed where he did not increase his benefits by his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">This case, in any event, is distinguishable from both <em>Connolly\u2019s Case </em>and <em>Cruz\u2019s Case </em>because in both of those cases the insurer appealed and, thus, the exception under the regulation would have been inapplicable. Contrary to the employee\u2019s argument, where there was no appeal by the insurer from the conference order in this case, the board was correct in ruling that under both \u00a7 13A(5) and 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>employee, who received no increased benefits from his appeal, was not the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The decision of the reviewing board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-14\">See <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass.
