The plaintiff, David McNamee, is a sergeant with the Arlington police department, and the defendants, Richard Jenkins and Lisa Chinal, are patrol officers who were under the plaintiff\u2019s supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">A brief sketch of the factual background is necessary for an understanding of the underlying controversy. On November 7, 1991, the Arlington Patrolman\u2019s Betterment Association filed a grievance on behalf of Officer Jenkins for racial discrimination. In the course of the investigation, both Officers Jenkins and Chinal were instructed by the director of police services (\u201cdirector\u201d) to submit statements detailing the alleged wrongful conduct. The gist of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is that certain facts alleged in those statements, taken together, defamed him, and as a result he was transferred to another shift and suffered a loss in salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">In his affidavit, dated November 19, 1991, Officer Jenkins alleged that on November 2, 1991, Sergeant McNamee uttered a racial slur directed at Officfer Jenkins while in the police garage area.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There were no witnesses to this incident, and Sergeant McNamee denied the allegations. Officer Jenkins also alleged that Sergeant McNamee filed a false report concerning an incident involving Officer Jenkins in his official capacity as a police officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sergeant McNamee\u2019s allegedly false report stated that Officer Jenkins\u2019s cruiser was parked in an inappropriate location while on patrol on September 21, 1991. Officer Jenkins, in his affidavit, asserted that he was in the appropriate location.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In her affidavit, dated November 21, 1991, Officer Chinal related her observation of the location of Officer Jenkins\u2019s cruiser on September 21, 1991, while she was on duty. Officer Chinal did not assert that Sergeant McNamee filed a false report, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>nor did she reference his report. The plaintiff argues that Officer Chinal\u2019s report contradicted his own, and as such Officer Chinal impliedly accused him of filing a false police report.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Upon investigation of Officer Jenkins\u2019s grievance, the town\u2019s director of labor relations determined that Officer Jenkins did not meet his burden of proving that the discrimination had taken place. Officer Jenkins then filed an action in Superior Court, seeking to enjoin the town from scheduling him to work under McNamee\u2019s supervision \u201cpending [Jenkins\u2019s] pursuit of remedies available with appropriate State and Federal agencies.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That action became moot when in January 1992, the director caused McNamee to be transferred from a night shift to a day shift, where he no longer supervised the defendants. As a result of the transfer he no longer received the eight percent night differential in salary and faced a reduction in certain other benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">A judge of the Superior Court granted summary judgment for both defendants on the basis that the plaintiff had no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of his case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991); <em>Alba </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 311, 312 (1998). The judge found that there was no evidence of malice and insufficient evidence that the defendants interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s business relationship through improper motive or means.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">1. <em>Defamation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Police officers are \u201cpublic officials\u201d for the purposes of defamation, see <em>Rotkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sadowsky, </em>431 Mass. 748, 752 (2000), and the plaintiff \u201cmay not recover damages for defama<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>tion related to his [ ] public office unless [he] proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant made the false statement with actual malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755, citing <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 279-80 (1964). In the context of defamation, actual malice means that the \u201cdefamatory falsehood was published with knowledge that it was false or reckless disregard of whether it was false.\u201d See <em>Rotkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sadowsky, </em>431 Mass. at 755, quoting from <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 867 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">While summary judgment is favored in defamation cases, it is sometimes inappropriate where there exist contested facts as to actual malice, which involves a determination of the defendant\u2019s state of mind. See <em>Godbout </em>v. <em>Cousens, </em>396 Mass. 254, 258 (1985). \u201cThe inquiry is a subjective one as to the defendant\u2019s attitude toward the truth or falsity of the statement rather than the defendant\u2019s attitude toward the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Rot-kiewicz </em>v. <em>Sadowsky, supra. </em>For reckless disregard there must be evidence that the defendant entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the publication. See <em>Tosti </em>v. <em>Ayik, </em>394 Mass. 482, 491 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">(a) <em>Defendant Jenkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Jenkins claimed that McNamee made a racial slur. McNamee denies it and asserts that, because Jenkins made the allegation with knowledge that it was false, the actual malice requirement is satisfied. Both McNamee and Jenkins submitted affidavits attesting to the truth of their statements. If McNamee in fact did not make the statement, the circumstances of this case would permit the jury to infer Jenkins\u2019s knowledge of falsity from proof of falsity itself. It, therefore, is appropriate for a trier of fact, presented with a question of credibility on the issue of falsity, to determine whether to believe one party or another. See <em>McAvoy </em>v. <em>Shufrin, </em>401 Mass. 593, 597-598 &amp; n.4 (1988) (where plaintiff claimed defendant threatened him and defendant denied it). See also <em>Tosti </em>v. <em>Ayik, </em>394 Mass. at 494-495.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The plaintiff also claims Jenkins defamed him by alleging that McNamee made a false report.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Once again both McNamee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>and Jenkins submitted affidavits attesting to the appropriateness of Officer Jenkins\u2019s location. Viewing the summary judgment materials in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party (here, the plaintiff), there has been a sufficient showing from which a fact finder could find that the defendant acted with actual malice. The plaintiff, as defendant Jenkins\u2019s supervisor, had written several reports concerning deficiencies in Jenkins\u2019s job performance. Also, just prior to the submission of Jenkins\u2019s affidavit, a work-related dispute arose between McNamee and Jenkins. Therefore, based on the materials in the summary judgment record, if a jury concluded that Jenkins\u2019s allegations were false, they permissibly could infer malice. \u201cIn order to determine the defendant\u2019s state of mind, the jury are entitled to draw inferences from the objective evidence.\u201d <em>Tosti </em>v. <em>Ayik, </em>394 Mass. at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">(b) <em>Defendant Chinal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Chinal did not assert that Sergeant McNamee filed a false report, or even refer to his report. The plaintiff, by focusing on those portions of her report that contradicted his own version, argues that she impliedly accused him of filing a false report. This argument is of no avail, as we believe no such implication permissibly can be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The plaintiff must show that the allegedly defamatory words were \u201cof and concerning the plaintiff.\u201d See <em>Godbout </em>v. <em>Cousens, </em>396 Mass. at 263, quoting from <em>New England Tractor-Trailor Training of Conn. </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>395 Mass. 471, 474 (1985); <em>McAvoy </em>v. <em>Shufrin, </em>401 Mass. at 597. In truth, the statements made by Chinal that conflict with the plaintiff\u2019s statements are not of and concerning the plaintiff, but are about her observations of and interaction with Officer Jenkins. Although defendant Chinal\u2019s report was written in the course of investigating Jenkins\u2019s claims against McNamee and may have been used to support his position, it was not defamatory. Her statements do not imply or insinuate that the plaintiff filed a false report. Any incongruence between the two reports could be explained by the fact that they did not observe Officer Jenkins at precisely the same time, or by a mistake or misrecollec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>tion by either McNamee or China!.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such writing does not tend to injure the plaintiff\u2019s reputation or discredit him. See <em>Mabardi </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>347 Mass. 411, 413 (1964), quoting from <em>Muchnick </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co., </em>332 Mass. 304, 305-306 (1955). Summary judgment in favor of defendant Chi-nal was correctly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">2. <em>Interference with advantageous relationship.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">There are four elements required to establish interference with advantageous business relations: (1) the plaintiff has a business relationship for economic benefit with a third party, (2) the defendants knew of that relationship, (3) the defendants interfered with that relationship through improper motive or means, and (4) the plaintiff\u2019s loss of the advantage resulted directly from the defendants\u2019 conduct. See <em>Kurker </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 184, 191 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">(a) <em>Defendant Jenkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Based on the summary judgment materials, the plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of proving all four elements as to defendant Jenkins. There is evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s position as a sergeant on the night shift was advantageous in light of the salary differential, and that Jenkins knew of that relationship. The defendants\u2019 argument that the plaintiff\u2019s assignment on the night shift was not a contractual right is without merit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is not necessary that the business relationship be one to which the plaintiff is contractually entitled. See, e.g., <em>Shafir </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>431 Mass. 365, 370 n.10 (2000). The nature of the relationship, for purposes of the defendants\u2019 interference, is not affected by the discretion of a third party. The plaintiff had a reasonable expectation that the director\u2019s discretion would not be wrongly influenced by an outside party.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">As to the third element, because the defendants\u2019 statements were made in the course of an established grievance procedure, proper means were used. Therefore the plaintiff must show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>the defendants\u2019 statements were made with improper motive, namely with malice. See <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Community Teamwork, Inc., </em>434 Mass. 761, 781-782 (2001). Here, there is sufficient evidence in the record from which a fact finder could infer malice. For example, a jury could conclude that, on a number of occasions, Officer Jenkins had received performance counseling from his police captain, and that when counseled, Jenkins opined that various sergeants were \u201cpicking on him.\u201d Additionally, a jury could have found that Jenkins harbored resentment toward the plaintiff due to several incidents where the plaintiff, acting as Jenkins\u2019s supervisor, had noted and commented on Jenkins\u2019s alleged performance deficiencies. Needless to say, we express no opinion on the credibility of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The final element of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, whether the plaintiff\u2019s loss of advantage was the direct result of Jenkins\u2019s interference, also should be determined by the fact-finder. There is evidence in the record that McNamee\u2019s transfer was directly related to Jenkins\u2019s accusations of racial discrimination. Jenkins argues that the plaintiff chose the day shift over another night shift, where he would have retained the salary differential and any benefits. However, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, there is support for a finding that there effectively was no other choice. Where the evidence conflicts, it is for a jury to determine what to believe. See <em>McAvoy </em>v. <em>Shufrin, </em>401 Mass. at 599-600. The judgment is accordingly reversed as to defendant Jenkins, and remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">(b) <em>Defendant Chinal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The plaintiff has offered no evidence to show malice on the part of Chinal except that her statement was supportive of Jenkins\u2019s position as to his location on September 21, 1991. The summary judgment material is silent as to any facts about the relationship between McNamee and Chinal, other than that she was under his supervision. Summary judgment for defendant Chi-nal in this regard was correctly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The judgment is affirmed as to Chinal and reversed as to Jenkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">OfBcer Jenkins alleges that Sergeant McNamee muttered, \u201cf-ing gooks.\u201d Officer Jenkins is Japanese-American.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The filing of a false police report is a misdemeanor under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 6A, and the \u201c[i]mputation of criminal conduct is defamatory per se.\u201d See <em>McAvoy </em>v. <em>Shufrin, </em>401 Mass. 593, 597-598 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The plaintiff was not a party to the action against the town.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b527-10\">These benefits included opportunities to work occasional day assignments for extra pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b527-11\">In his original complaint, the plaintiff included certain allegations made by Officer Jenkins against Sergeant McNamee that appeared in the Arlington Advocate newspaper. However, we do not address this, as it is unsupported in the record and was not raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Both defendants also brought counterclaims in this action against the plaintiff and the town of Arlington, alleging harassment, employment discrimination on the basis of race and sex, and retaliation. Summary judgment was granted for plaintiffs McNamee and the town by a different judge. The defendants have not pursued an appeal in this court from that judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Because this is defamatory per se, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>the burden is ordinarily on the defendant to prove the truth of the statement as an affirmative defense. See <em>McAvoy </em>v. <em>Shufrin, </em>401 Mass. at 597, citing <em>Maloof </em>v. <em>Post </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>Pub. Co., </em>306 Mass. 279, 280 (1940). Nonetheless, because the plaintiff is a \u201cpublic official,\u201d he still must prove actual malice to prevail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b530-10\">In any event, McNamee\u2019s affidavit cannot be seen as creating any issue of fact respecting Chinal\u2019s version of the facts as, at least as to her, McNamee\u2019s allegations are inadmissible and not made on personal knowledge. McNamee cannot speak to where Officer Chinal was or what she observed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The argument is that, since the director of police services has discretion in assigning personnel, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 97A, the plaintiff had no reasonable expectation of staying on the night shift or receiving the salary differential.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
