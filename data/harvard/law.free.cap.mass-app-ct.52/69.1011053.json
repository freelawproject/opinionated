In <em>Thibodeau </em>v. Seekonk, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 367 (1996), this court concluded that the 1991 demotion was ineffective due to the town\u2019s failure to file a fair summary of facts at that time with the local retirement board, but the case was remanded to the Superior Court to consider the effect of a subsequent July 27, 1993, filing of a fair summary of the facts. Thibodeau contends that on remand the judge (1) erred in determining the effective date of his demotion; and (2) erroneously calculated the interest due to him as running from the date that he filed his complaint in Superior Court rather than from the date of his invalid removal from the fire captain position.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">On remand from this court, the judge ruled that Thibodeau\u2019s August 26, 1991, demotion from his position as captain of firefighters with the town of Seekonk became effective on July 27, 1993. The judge also awarded damages consisting of back pay of $16,489.44, the pay difference between the fire captain and lieutenant positions for the period preceding the effective date of the demotion, \u201cplus interest at the statutory rate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We reject Thibodeau\u2019s claim that the judge erred in his determination of the effective date of his demotion. Prior to its repeal, effective November 7, 1996, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), as amended through St. 1982, c. 630, \u00a7 21, provided that the removal of an employee with Thibodeau\u2019s level of service was \u201cnot . . . effective unless and until a written notice thereof containing a fair summary of the facts upon which such action was based has been filed with the [local retirement] board.\u201d As a result, when the town demoted Thibodeau without filing a fair summary of facts on August 26, 1991, it did so in violation of the process required by \u00a7 16(2). On July 27, 1993, the town filed a fair summary of facts with the local retirement board. Section 16(2) entitled Thibodeau at that point to a hearing on the demotion, if requested. Section 16(1)(6), provides that \u201c[i]f no such request is so filed, the facts . . . shall be deemed to be admitted.\u201d The judge correctly found that the letter Thibodeau sent in response to the town\u2019s fair summary of facts, although purporting to be a \u201cnotice of appeal,\u201d did not contain a request for a hearing, and therefore \u201c[i]n the absence of a timely request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>for a hearing,\u201d the statute provided that \u201cthe facts as contained in the summary are deemed to be admitted.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As Thibodeau failed to request a hearing, his demotion was proper and effective as of July 27, 1993.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Thibodeau\u2019s second argument is that the interest due on his back pay award should be calculated from the date of his demotion in August, 1991, rather than from the date he filed his action in Superior Court, over two years later. The judge\u2019s February, 1997, memorandum of decision on remand referred, without elaboration, to \u201cinterest at the statutory rate.\u201d On April 8, 1997, Thibodeau filed his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In June, 1997, the parties filed a \u201cjoint motion for entry of judgment with calculation of interest and for issuance of an execution upon said judgment.\u201d The joint motion was allowed, and an execution issued in July, 1997, calculating interest running from the date Thibodeau filed the action in Superior Court. Thibodeau moved for a return of execution in September, 1997, in which he argued for the first time that interest on his back pay award should have been calculated \u201cfrom the time of the reduced pay.\u201d In November, 1997, the motion was denied by another Superior Court judge who ruled that the execution as issued was proper. No notice of appeal was ever filed in connection with the judge\u2019s denial of the motion for return of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The town contends that Thibodeau has waived any right of appeal concerning interest because his April, 1997, notice of appeal referred only to the court\u2019s decision on remand and denial of the motion for reconsideration, and he did not separately appeal the November, 1997, denial of the motion for return of execution. Thibodeau responds that when he appealed the decision, which included an award of $16,489.44 \u201cplus interest at the statutory rate,\u201d his appeal necessarily subsumed the interest question. We conclude that the original appeal was sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>preserve the interest issue; the denial of the motion for return of execution did not necessitate a separate appeal. See <em>Patten </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 660 (1987) (\u201cunder Mass.R.A.P. 3(a) . . .we are authorized to-exercise our independent judgment whether to let an appeal proceed in a given case\u201d); <em>Mac-iuca </em>v. <em>Papit, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 540, 545 (1991). We therefore turn to the substance of the interest issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The remedy provision in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), expressly referred only to restoring a wrongly discharged employee to his former position \u201cwithout loss of compensation\u201d and included no reference to interest. The town therefore argues that the interest calculation properly falls under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6H. Section 6H, as inserted by St. 1983, c. 652, \u00a7 1, provides that \u201c[i]n any action in which damages are awarded, but in which interest on said damages is not otherwise provided by law, there shall be added ... to the amount of damages interest thereon at the rate provided by section six B to be determined from the date of commencement of the action . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In contrast, c. 231, \u00a7 6C, as amended by St. 1982, c. 183, \u00a7 3, provides: \u201cIn all actions based on contractual obligations, . . . interest shall be added . . . from the date of the breach or demand[, if established].\u201d We must therefore determine whether \u00a7 6C or \u00a7 6H applies to violations of c. 32, \u00a7 16(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 16, is referenced in c. 32, \u00a7 25(5), as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>amended by St. 1956, c. 525, which states, \u201cThe provisions of sections one to twenty-eight . . . shall be deemed to establish and to have established membership in the retirement system as a contractual relationship under which members who are or may be retired for superannuation are entitled to contractual rights and benefits, and no amendments or alterations shall be made that will deprive any such member or any group of such members of their pension rights or benefits provided for thereunder . . . .\u2019\u2019In determining which interest provision applies to violations of \u00a7 16(2), we must therefore take into account that it is encompassed within the \u201ccontractual relationship\u201d established in G. L. c: 32. See <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 697, 701 (2000) (\u201cThe State retirement system creates a contractual relationship between its members and the State\u201d). As a result, we conclude that \u00a7 25 implicates G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C. The fact that the contractual relationship was created legislatively does not detract from our conclusion, as the Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that under c. 231, \u00a7 6C, there is \u201cno distinction between [contractual] obligations that derive from an agreement and those imposed by statute.\u201d <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562, 563, 576 (1979) (finding \u00a7 6C applicable to the enforcement of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 59A, as inserted by St. 1968, c. 601, \u00a7 1, which provided that the \u201cpaying governmental unit may maintain an action of contract to recover\u201d portions of pension reimbursement owed by another town).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that, pursuant to G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>c. 231, \u00a7 6C, interest shall commence on August 26, 1991, the date of Thibodeau\u2019s demotion in violation of c. 32, \u00a7 16(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The judgment is to be modified to provide that interest is to run from August 26, 1991. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-8\">We note that Thibodeau requested a hearing on prior and subsequent occasions before the board, but did not do so in response to the July 27, 1993, filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b93-11\">We further agree with the judge that \u201c[t]he town\u2019s filing of subsequent summaries of the facts does not alter the above conclusion,\u201d as the uncertainty generated by the pending appeal apparently led the town to make repetitive filings to ensure that its interests were protected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Commencement of the action refers to commencement of the action in the Superior Court. See <em>Gill </em>v. <em>North Shore Radiological Assocs., Inc., </em>385 Mass. 180, 182 (1982) (\u201cwords . . . \u2018from the date of commencement of the action\u2019 . . . are to be interpreted literally\u201d); <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Local 1526, Am. Fedn. of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, </em>399 Mass. 341, 354 (1987) (in seniority dispute that began with union grievance process in 1977 and continued with the filing of unfair labor practice charges with the Labor Relations Commission in 1979, interest properly awarded from Superior Court filing date in 1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson Insulation, </em>425 Mass. 650, 665 n.15 (1997) (\u201cG. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, allows interest from the commencement of the action, and not from the date of the injury\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\">We do not agree with Thibodeau that this question was settled by <em>Campana </em>v. <em>Board of Directors of the Mass. Hous. Fin. Agency, </em>399 Mass. 492 (1987). There, a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court had determined that the plaintiff was entitled to \u201cbenefits and back pay, with interest, from the date of the ineffective discharge . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499. The full court, however, did not comment explicitly on the correctness of the single justice\u2019s ruling, and stated generally, in language akin to that in the order of the Superior Court judge in the instant matter, that the plaintiff was entitled to \u201cback <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>wages from the date of the ineffective termination to the present, plus interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504. (We note that, for purposes of construing \u00a7 16[2], \u201ctermination\u201d or \u201cdischarge\u201d [at issue in Campana], is - equivalent to \u201cdemotion,\u201d at issue in the case at hand.) See <em>Thibodeau </em>v. <em>Seekonk, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 369.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b95-9\">We note that our decision concluding that a claim based on c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), is a claim based on a contractual obligation for purposes of interest calculation does not mean \u00a7 16(2) provides a \u201cvested contractual right,\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, 366 </em>Mass. 779, 784 (1975), within the \u201ccore expectations protected by \u00a7 25(5)\u201d from impairment or repeal. <em>Prudential Comm, of Centerville-Osterville-Marstons Mills Fire Dist. </em>v. <em>Barnstable County Retirement Assn., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908 (2000). See <em>Dupont </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Essex County, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 235, 239 n.10 (1999) (the \u201ccharacteriz[ation of] pension rights ... as contractual\u201d does not preclude repeal of \u00a7 16[2]).
