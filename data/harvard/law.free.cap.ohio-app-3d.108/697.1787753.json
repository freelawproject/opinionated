Thomas, appeals from the order of the probate court adopting the referee\u2019s report finding her \u201ca mentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order.\u201d We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">On February 24, 1995, Andrew Thomas, Linda Thomas\u2019s son, filed an affidavit with the probate court alleging that his mother \u201c[represents a substantial risk of physical harm to others as manifested by evidence of recent homicidal or other violent behavior or evidence of recent threats that place another in reasonable fear of violent behavior and serious physical harm.\u201d Pursuant to R.C. 5122.11, Thomas was detained and admitted to Cuyahoga Falls General Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>On March 3,1995, a hearing was conducted before a referee at Cuyahoga Falls General Hospital. The referee found, upon clear and convincing evidence, that Thomas was a mentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order pursuant to R.C. 5122.15. Thomas was ordered into the care of the Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services Board of Summit County (\u201cADAMHS\u201d) for a period not to exceed ninety days. The probate court overruled Thomas\u2019s objections to the referee\u2019s report and adopted the report as the court\u2019s final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">On May 1, 1995, ADAMHS moved the probate court to order termination of Thomas\u2019s commitment. The motion was granted May 16, 1995. Thomas timely appeals the probate court\u2019s order overruling her objections to the referee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Thomas presents three assignments of error, the first two relating to the sufficiency and weight of the evidence and the third stating that the court failed to order the least restrictive means in treating her condition. We need not address Thomas\u2019s third assignment of error as both parties conceded at oral argument that it is moot. Because Thomas\u2019s first and second assignments of error both require an examination of the evidence presented to the referee, we will consider them jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">In her first assignment of error Thomas argues the probate court erred in determining that there was clear and convincing evidence that she was mentally ill and subject to hospitalization pursuant to R.C. 5122.01. Thomas\u2019s second assignment of error states the finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">R.C. 5122.01(A) defines \u201cmental illness\u201d as a \u201csubstantial disorder of thought, mood perception, orientation, or memory that grossly impairs judgment, behavior, capacity to recognize reality, or ability to meet the ordinary demands of life.\u201d The stat\u00fate further defines a \u201c[mjentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order\u201d as a mentally ill person who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\">\u201c(1) Represents a substantial risk of physical harm to himself as manifested by evidence of threats of, or attempts at, suicide or serious self-inflicted bodily harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">\u201c(2) Represents a substantial risk of physical harm to others as manifested by evidence of recent homicidal or other violent behavior, evidence of recent threats that place another in reasonable fear of violent behavior and serious physical harm, or other evidence of present dangerousness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">\u201c(3) Represents a substantial and immediate risk of serious physical impairment or injury to himself as manifested by evidence that he is unable to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>for and is not providing for his basic physical needs because of his mental illness and that appropriate provision for such needs cannot be made immediately available in the community; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">\u201c(4) Would benefit from treatment in a hospital for his mental illness and is in need of such treatment as manifested by evidence of behavior that creates a grave and imminent risk to substantial rights of others or himself.\u201d R.C. 5122.01(B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The evidence supporting a finding that a person is mentally ill and subject to court ordered hospitalization must be clear and convincing. R.C. 5122.15(C). See, also, <em>In re Burton </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 147, 150, 11 OBR 465, 467-468, 464 N.E.2d 530, 534-535.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has defined \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">\u201cThat measure or degree of proof which is more than a mere \u2018preponderance of the evidence,\u2019 but not to the extent of such certainty as is required \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 in criminal cases, and which will provide in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Massengale </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 121, 122, 568 N.E.2d 1222, 1223, citing <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N. E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\">\u201cWhere the proof required must be clear and convincing, a reviewing court will examine the record to determine whether the trier of facts had sufficient evidence before it to satisfy the requisite degree of proof.\u201d <em>State v. Schiebel </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 564 N.E.2d 54, 60. However, the appellate court must be ever mindful of its responsibility to refrain from substituting its judgment for that of the trial court where there exists competent, credible evidence supporting the lower court\u2019s determination. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">The above standard applies when evaluating whether a judgment in a civil case is against the manifest weight of the evidence. \u201cJudgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">Two experts testified at Thomas\u2019s hearing, Dr. Ranga Pakeeree and Dr. James Karpawich. Dr. Pakeeree stated he had treated Thomas for anxiety resulting from her ongoing divorce two to three times approximately one and one-half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>years prior to the hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He treated her again upon her admission to Cuyahoga Falls General Hospital. Pakeeree stated that he believed Thomas was suffering from a circumscribed, paranoid delusional disorder. Most of the facts he testified to in support of this opinion were <em>from </em>the history provided to him by Thomas\u2019s husband and son. Pakeeree testified that his recommendation was to keep Thomas in the hospital against her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">However, on cross-examination Pakeeree admitted that Thomas did not have a substantial disorder of memory, mood, orientation or perception. He also admitted that he had no personal knowledge of her paranoid behavior other than that related to him by Thomas\u2019s husband and son. When asked, Pakeeree acknowledged that Thomas was not impaired in her ability to meet the ordinary demands of life and was able to take care of her basic physical needs. Pakeeree also admitted that he had not witnessed any behavior that represents a substantial risk of physical harm to others. His only awareness of any violent behavior on Thomas\u2019s part again came from Thomas\u2019s husband and son, and that was merely one threat made some six to nine months earlier. Pakeeree conceded the threat would not be characterized as recent. Pakeeree also testified on cross-examination that Thomas had been compliant since her admission to Cuyahoga Falls General Hospital and that she presented no danger to herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Concerning the danger Thomas presents, Pakeeree testified as follows on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">\u201cQ. Your testimony was that she may be dangerous to the family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">\u201cQ. May be dangerous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\">\u201cA Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-11\">\u201cQ. She has not presented a danger in the past, based upon your information or knowledge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-12\">\u201cA. Based on my information from the family, there have been threats. There have been threats in the past. I don\u2019t when these were, but there were some. I don\u2019t know when these occurred. I don\u2019t know when, but, you know * * *. That is a concern I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-13\">\u00ab \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-14\">\u201cQ. Would she then become an immediate risk of harm and evidence behavior \u2014 homicidal or other violent behavior?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u201cA. This may happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\"><em>U </em>* # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">\u201cQ. And it may not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\"><em>(i % </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">\u201cQ. * * * Right now you have not seen any evidence of homicidal behavior?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-9\">\u201cA. No, I haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-10\">\u201cQ. Any evidence of violent behavior?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-11\">\u201cA. No, I haven\u2019t seen that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-12\">\u201cQ. Nor have you seen any threats?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-13\">\u201cA. I haven\u2019t seen any threats.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">Dr. James Karpawich testified that he first met Thomas in October 1994 when he was appointed by the domestic relations court to evaluate her. Karpawich testified that he met with Thomas for four hours on October 28, 1994 and on November 18, 1994. He also made a home visit on November 22, 1994 and met with her again on March 2, 1995 to evaluate Thomas prior to her hearing. Karpawich also met with Thomas\u2019s husband, son, daughter, and sister. Karpawich testified that he believed Thomas was suffering from a very circumscribed, delusional disorder wherein she believes her estranged husband is having her followed due to an ongoing divorce proceeding. Karpawich testified that this paranoia is limited to her husband and that she does not believe other people are having her followed, nor does she seem fearful of people in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">Karpawich testified that this thought disorder was not substantial. He also stated that during their discussions Thomas indicated that she may have given \u201ctoo much credence to things that were not that important.\u201d Karpawich testified that Thomas acknowledged during their most recent interview that she was \u201ctoo hypersensitive * * * reading too much into things that weren\u2019t there.\u201d He also testified that the family reported that Thomas had not made any claims of being followed for the previous two months. Karpawich also said, \u201cShe did not think I was part of the conspiracy. She didn\u2019t think I was hired by her husband. She did not believe the people she met in the hospital were part of it. She did have concerns with Dr. Pakeeree. Dr. Pakeeree has had a long-standing relationship with her husband. That\u2019s not delusional, that\u2019s legitimate. She was not pulling other people into the conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-16\">Karpawich further stated Thomas\u2019s delusion is very circumscribed and represents only a limited impairment of her thoughts. He, like Pakeeree, felt that she had no substantial mood, memory, or orientation disorder. Karpawich testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>that Thomas\u2019s judgment is not impaired except for the circumscribed area concerning her husband and that she is perfectly able to meet the ordinary demands of life. Concerning the danger Thomas presents to her family or others, Karpawich testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">\u201cQ. Have you seen any evidence of recent homicidal or other violent behavior exhibited on behalf of or by Linda?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">\u201cA. In my time with her, I have never seen her or heard her make any kind of homicidal threats or any kind of homicidal behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">\u201cQ. Have any of the people that you talked to, the father the \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, her son, her sister, or her daughter indicated to you that they have observed any homicidal behavior or any other type of violent assaultive behavior?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">\u201cA. No one that I talked to and none of the records have confirmed assaultive or homicidal behavior. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Ultimately, Karpawich testified, based upon his own examination and interviews and examination of Thomas\u2019s medical records, that he did not believe Thomas met the criteria for involuntary hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Thomas\u2019s son Andrew, who filed the affidavit against her, testified that his mother had boards with nails sticking up from them at various places on her property and that she claims her house is bugged. Andrew admitted that he had not witnessed his mother placing the boards about her property and also admitted that his mother had never threatened him or his family. His only awareness of any threats made to his father was from his father; Andrew had never heard his mother threaten his father. Andrew testified that his mother was a recovering alcoholic and had been doing well with her sobriety. Although stating that he loved his mother and cared for her very much, Andrew admitted, upon cross-examination regarding his motives for filing the affidavit against his mother, to leaving the following message on his mother\u2019s answering machine at 1:30 in the morning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-11\">\u201cYeah, I\u2019m calling for Linda the Lunatic. You there, mom? You know, I\u2019m just wondering what it\u2019s like to be you. Why do you have to hang around somebody like Steve and Linda King? You used to have friends like Susie Leigh. So why are you going from Susie Leigh to Linda King?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-12\">\u201cI\u2019d hate to be you, having to look at yourself in the mirror and see what you\u2019ve done to your retarded daughter and your family, your grown children, and your neighbors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-13\">\u201cHow anyone can stand to even look at you or be around you is amazing, because you really turned out to be a nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>\u201cI\u2019m so grateful that Grandma Holton passed away where she wouldn\u2019t have to see what her daughter has become. It would have broke Grandma\u2019s heart.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Thomas\u2019s estranged husband, Gale, testified that one night during an argument in which Thomas was accusing him of having her followed, she said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop this, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d On cross-examination Gale admitted that that was the only time during their thirty-seven-year marriage that Thomas had ever threatened him. He also admitted that the incident had occurred approximately six months prior to the filing of the affidavit against Thomas. Gale corroborated his son\u2019s testimony about the boards with nails on Thomas\u2019s property and similarly admitted that he had not seen his wife either make them or place them about. Gale testified that Thomas had placed \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs on her property and had posted surveillance cameras outside the house.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Gale also stated that he had not hired anyone to follow his wife and that she constantly called him to demand that he stop having her followed. Gale testified that his wife was a recovering alcoholic and to his knowledge had been sober since December 1991. He also testified that Thomas had removed all the covers to the electrical outlets and light switches in her house because she believed they were bugged.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Finally, Thomas testified on her own behalf. She admitted to being an alcoholic and to having undergone treatment for approximately three and one-half years. Thomas testified that she has maintained sobriety since December 1991. Thomas also admitted to threatening to kill her husband during an argument some six to nine months prior to the affidavit being filed against her. Thomas stated that her husband had been spontaneously stopping by her home two to three times a day, telling her she needed to get help because she was sick. She testified that she allowed the unannounced visits to agitate her to the point of confrontation. Thomas drove to her husband\u2019s apartment and told him to stop interfering in her life. Thomas testified that her husband \u201cwas making more remarks such as Tf you Would just go get help, you wouldn\u2019t get upset.\u2019\u201d Finally, Thomas stated that she told her husband, \u201cI could kill you. I could really kill you.\u201d Thomas testified that she then walked out of her husband\u2019s apartment and he slammed the door behind her.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Thomas further testified that that single incident was the only time she had ever threatened her husband and that after the incident the two went to Las Vegas in an attempt to reconcile. Thomas stated that her husband had threatened to kill her as well. She also testified that she did not seriously intend to kill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>her husband and that it \u201cwas just the frustration is why I said it. Everyone married has said it some time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Thomas testified that the boards with nails in them were to prevent raccoons from climbing on her deck. She stated that raccoons would climb onto her deck and leave droppings. Thomas asked her handyman to do something about the problem and directed him to use some means that would not cause permanent harm. She claimed that the type of device and where to place it was his idea, but that she had instructed him not to place them around the house where someone could step on one. Thomas also testified that the boards are no longer in place and have been thrown away. Ultimately, Thomas testified that she would be willing to follow up her counselling on an outpatient basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In determining whether a person is subject to hospitalization under R.C. 5122.01(B), a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test should be utilized. <em>Burton, </em>11 Ohio St.3d at 149, 11 OBR at 467, 464 N.E.2d at 534. The test \u201cbalances the individual\u2019s right against involuntary confinement in deprivation of his liberty, and the state\u2019s interest in committing the emotionally disturbed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Factors to be considered include (1) whether the individual currently represents a substantial risk of physical harm to himself or others, (2) psychiatric and medical testimony as to the present mental and physical condition of the alleged incompetent, (3) whether the person has insight into his condition, (4) the grounds upon which the state relies for the proposed commitment, (5) any past history which is relevant to establish the individual\u2019s degree of conformity with the laws, rules, regulations, and values of society, and (6) if there is evidence the alleged incompetent\u2019s mental illness is in remission, what constitutes the cause and degree of the remission and the probability the individual will continue treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 149-150,11 OBR at 467, 464 N.E.2d at 533-535.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Reviewing the totality of the record, we do not find competent and credible evidence to support a determination that the state proved by clear and convincing evidence that Linda Thomas is an individual subject to court-ordered hospitalization pursuant to the criteria set forth in R.C. 5122.01(B). The evidence submitted by the state showed, at best, that Linda Thomas is paranoid concerning her ongoing divorce proceedings and the actions of her husband. The only threat Thomas ever made was not recent and was during an argument with her estranged husband. Such threats are not uncommon between friends or loved ones during heated arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Thomas exhibited no other violent behavior and the witnesses agreed that she could function in society and provide for herself. The credibility of her son was shown to be very questionable. While Linda Thomas may have some paranoia, exhibit some eccentric behavior, and have a family which might be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>dysfunctional, there is not clear and convincing evidence to support a finding that she presents a substantial risk of physical harm to herself or others, that she cannot provide for her basic needs, or that her behavior creates a grave and imminent risk to substantial rights of others or herself. R.C. 5122.01(B). The finding that Linda Thomas is an individual subject to court-ordered hospitalization is against the manifest weight of the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Thomas\u2019s first and second assignments of error are upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The judgment of the probate court finding Linda Thomas to be an individual subject to court ordered hospitalization pursuant to R.C. 5122.01(B) is reversed. Accordingly, judgment is ordered in Linda Thomas\u2019s favor pursuant to App.R. 12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b740-9\">Baird, P.J., and Slaby, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-15\">.
