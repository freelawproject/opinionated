At issue is the policy\u2019s intentional-acts exclusion. This issue depends upon the scope of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Physicians Ins. Co. of Ohio v. Swanson </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 189, 569 N.E.2d 906, regarding the extent to which an injury must be intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">While there is no transcript of the trial proceedings or statement of the \u00e9vidence below, the following facts are undisputed. Eric Gordon struck Aaron Dawson on the head with a metal \u201cclub-like\u201d object. Dawson died as a result of this single blow to his head. The club, appellee\u2019s counsel explained in oral argument, was \u201cjust that, a club,\u201d designed for use as an anti-theft device to lock an automobile steering wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The administrator of Dawson\u2019s estate, Susan Horvath (plaintiff-appellee), made a claim against the homeowners\u2019 insurance policy which Gordon\u2019s parents maintained with defendant-appellant, Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company. Appellant refused coverage on the ground that the policy expressly excludes bodily injury which is intended or expected by the insured. Thereafter, appellee brought this lawsuit, and both parties filed motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Appellee\u2019s motion alleged that the injury was not intended and that the insurance claim could not be excluded from coverage. In support of her motion, appellee attached both Nationwide\u2019s and Eric Gordon\u2019s responses to her requests for admission. Appellee relied, in particular, on Gordon\u2019s statement that he did not intend or expect Dawson\u2019s death. Additionally, appellee attached the transcript of Eric Gordon\u2019s testimony taken during his sentencing proceeding. Apparently, Gordon had pled guilty to negligent homicide. In his sentencing testimony, Gordon testified that he did not intend or expect to kill anyone but that he knew someone was behind him when he swung his body around with the metal club in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Appellant, Nationwide, argued, in its cross-motion for summary judgment, that it was entitled to judgment because the nature of the insured\u2019s conduct was such that the injury was intended or at least substantially certain to occur. The proper focus, appellant argued, was not the tortfeasor\u2019s self-serving statements denying intent to cause Dawson\u2019s death but, rather, the tortious conduct itself and whether, based upon that conduct, injury was intended or substantially certain to occur. According to appellant, the exclusion applies because the injury was substantially certain to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">The trial court denied both motions, finding triable issues both with respect to intent to cause the act and intent to cause the injury. The case proceeded before a jury. The jury found in favor of appellee. Four interrogatories were submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>ted, and the jury specifically found that the insured did not intend or expect to cause the injury to or death of Aaron Dawson.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">On appeal to this court, appellant raises the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">I. \u201cThe trial court erred in denying defendant-appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">II. \u201cThe trial court erred in instructing the jury on the meaning of the term \u2018expected\u2019 as it applied to the intentional acts exclusion clause in the Nationwide insurance policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-8\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment. While error in denying a motion for summary judgment is rendered moot or harmless where a subsequent trial on the same issues demonstrates that there were genuine issues of fact supporting a judgment for the party opposing the motion, the error is not harmless where the denial is predicated upon a pure question of law. <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. Whittington </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 150, 642 N.E.2d 615. For reasons more fully explained below, we conclude that appellant was held to an incorrect burden of proof and that, consequently, a review of the merits of its motion for summary judgment is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Key to the trial court\u2019s decision and the matter here is the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Swanson. </em>We conclude that the law as stated therein requires the insurance company to show that the injury was intentionally inflicted or substantially certain to occur before coverage may be excluded under the intentional-acts exclusion. It is not sufficient to merely show that the act was intentional. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">We feel it to be reasonable to apply the law of <em>Swanson </em>to the facts shown here in the following manner: Here, the insured hit a person on the head with an iron club during a fight. The blow to the head was with such force that it fractured the victim\u2019s skull and created a hole large enough that the brains seeped out. While the trial court, in ruling on appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, cited <em>Swanson </em>and held that appellant had the burden of showing that the insured intended the injury that resulted from the act, we do not believe that the law in <em>Swanson </em>goes so far as to require the insurer to prove that death was intended. The insurer does not need to prove the crime of murder in order for the intentional acts exclusion to apply. It was error therefore to require appellant to .demonstrate that the insured intended to cause death.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">Upon reviewing appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in a manner consistent with our holding above, we hold that reasonable minds could only conclude that both the act and injury were intended. That the act was intended is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>apparently not in dispute. As required under <em>Swanson, </em>the injury was also intended. Hitting a person\u2019s head with a metal club with enough force to cause the victim\u2019s brains to flow out certainly tends to show an intent to do physical harm. Appellee\u2019s evidence of the insured\u2019s statement that he did not intend or expect death does not rebut this. Even construing the evidence most strongly in appellee\u2019s favor, we conclude that the intentional-act exclusion applies and appellant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">In its second assignment of error, appellant claims the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the meaning of \u201cexpected\u201d as it applied to the policy\u2019s intentional acts exclusion clause. Unfortunately, there is no transcript or record of the trial court\u2019s instructions. Absent proof in the record, this court must presume the correctness of the trial proceedings. <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 314, 528 N.E.2d 523, 535, fn. 4. In any event, our disposition of the first assignment of error renders this matter moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Appellee has filed a notice of cross-appeal conditioned upon this court\u2019s favorable resolution of appellant\u2019s appeal. She raises the following single assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to grant Susan Horvath\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">In essence, appellee alleges that reversal of the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment necessarily involves a weighing of the credibility of the evidence. While appellee presented evidence that the insured did not intend to cause Dawson\u2019s death, appellee did not produce evidence that the insured did not intend to cause the physical injury. There was no weighing of the evidence. As noted above, intent to cause death is not the appropriate standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">Appellee\u2019s cross-appeal is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled, and appellee\u2019s cross-appeal is overruled. The judgment of the trial court is reversed and this cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Deshler and Close, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b771-5\">Robert E.
