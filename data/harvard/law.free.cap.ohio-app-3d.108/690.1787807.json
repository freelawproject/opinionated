Young, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b725-17\">Appellants Walnut Creek Nursing Center and the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services (\u201cOBES\u201d) appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment reversing an earlier OBES ruling and awarding Eileen Janovsky unemployment benefits. In their sole assignment of error, the appellants claim that the trial court erred when it concluded that Walnut Creek fired Janovsky without just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-18\">Janovsky\u2019s discharge stems from a co-worker\u2019s tip to Walnut Creek administrators that Janovsky possessed an open bottle of wine in her car. The vehicle was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>parked in an employee parking lot on Walnut Creek property immediately behind the nursing center.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Walnut Creek\u2019s employee handbook provides that employees may be terminated for violating \u201cClass I\u201d work rules, which include \u201c[b]eing in possession of, using, or selling alcoholic beverages, narcotics or illegal drugs while on the premises.\u201d Janovsky had received and reviewed a copy of the handbook containing this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">As a result of its handbook policy, Walnut Creek administrators called a police officer to the facility on October 7, 1993. The officer and four Walnut Creek managers met Janovsky in the parking lot as she left work, and Janovsky admitted having an open container of alcohol in her car. At the officer\u2019s request, Janovsky retrieved the wine bottle, which had a broken seal and was partially empty, and poured its contents on the ground. A nursing facility administrator then fired Janovsky for violating Walnut Creek\u2019s rule prohibiting possession of alcoholic beverages on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Janovsky subsequently applied for unemployment benefits, and the administrator of the OBES granted her application, finding no just cause for her dismissal. Thereafter, Walnut Creek filed a request for reconsideration, and the OBES administrator\u2019s decision was affirmed. The nursing center then instituted an appeal to the OBES Board of Review, which reversed the OBES administrator\u2019s decision and disallowed Janovsky\u2019s claim for benefits. The review board held that Janovsky\u2019s violation of Walnut Creek\u2019s prohibition against possessing alcoholic beverages on the premises constituted just cause for her dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">After the review board rejected Janovsky\u2019s application to institute a further appeal, she sought relief in the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, which reversed the review board\u2019s ruling and reinstated the OBES administrator\u2019s decision awarding Janovsky unemployment benefits. The OBES and Walnut Creek subsequently filed timely appeals, claiming that the trial court erred in finding the review board\u2019s decision unreasonable, unlawful, and against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Like the trial court, we begin our resolution of the appellants\u2019 claim by adopting a \u201cmanifest weight of the evidence\u201d standard of review. In <em>Tzangas, Plakas &amp; Mannos v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 694, 696-697, 653 N.E.2d 1207, 1210-1211, the Ohio Supreme Court explained that the Revised Code section \u201csetting forth the appeals process for unemployment compensation cases does not create distinctions between the scope of review of common pleas courts and appellate courts.\u201d Consequently, the court concluded that applying the same review standard at each appellate level is proper. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 653 N.E.2d at 1210. See, also, <em>Biles v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1995), 107 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>App.3d 114, 121, 667 N.E.2d 1244, 1249 (interpreting <em>Tzangas, Plakas &amp; Mannos </em>to mean that \u201creviewing courts are not to review the decision of the trial courts under an abuse of discretion standard, but rather are to review the decisions of the board with the same standard as must be used by the trial court, that is, whether a decision of the board is unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence\u201d); <em>Galluzzo v. Ohio Bur. Emp. Serv. </em>(Nov. 29, 1995), Champaign App. No. 95-CA-6, unreported, 1995 WL 704193 (citing <em>Tzangas, Plakas &amp; Mannos </em>and concluding that an appellate court\u2019s standard of review in \u201cjust cause\u201d unemployment benefits cases \u201cis the same as the trial court, that is, whether the decision of the board is [unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The central issue for our review is whether the trial court erred when it concluded that \u201ca reasonable person would not comprehend that the employee handbook prohibited temporary storage of alcohol within the employee\u2019s vehicle located in the employer\u2019s parking lot.\u201d The trial court reached this conclusion based upon its belief that a reasonable person would not construe the nursing home\u2019s prohibition against alcohol \u201con the premises\u201d to include alcohol located outside the building but still on Walnut Creek property.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The trial court supported its interpretation of \u201con the premises\u201d by reading the phrase in light of the purpose underlying Walnut Creek\u2019s anti-alcohol policy. In so doing, the trial court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">\u201cThe obvious goal of this rule is to protect the patients of Walnut Creek. Possession and use of alcohol within the nursing home clearly violates this purpose. An intoxicated nurse lacks the physical and intellectual faculties to insure the well-being of the patients. The presence of alcohol in the facility also threatens the patients. The patientsf] close proximity to the alcohol increases the likelihood that the patients will obtain possession of the alcohol and endanger their health. Thus, the use and possession of alcohol within the employer\u2019s facility violates the purpose of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">\u201cPossession of alcoholic beverages outside of the physical facilities alone, however, does not violate the purpose and goal of the company rule. Possession outside of the facility decreases the likelihood of a patient improperly gaining access to the alcohol. The presence of alcoholic beverages within an employee\u2019s automobile does not threaten the health and safety of the nursing home residents. A reasonable person, understanding the purpose and goal of the employer\u2019s rule, would not interpret the rule to include alcohol located within [an employee\u2019s] automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Based upon this analysis, the trial court found no just cause supporting Walnut Creek\u2019s decision to fire Janovsky. Since Walnut Creek had not informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Janovsky, either expressly or through a reasonable interpretation of its employee handbook, that it prohibited storing or placing alcohol in a vehicle on its property, the court held Janovsky\u2019s termination unjustified. \u201cAbsent a finding of intentional disregard for a known company rule, the Board of Review\u2019s reversal was unreasonable, unlawful, and against the manifest weight of the evidence,\u201d the trial court explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">We disagree with the trial court\u2019s holding. Ohio law provides that no individual discharged for just cause may receive unemployment benefits. <em>Tzangas, Plakas &amp; Mannos, supra, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 697, 653 N.E.2d at 1210-1211; R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a). As the trial court properly notes, however, \u201c[t]he critical issue is not whether the employee has technically violated some company rule.\u201d <em>Piazza v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 353, 357, 594 N.E.2d 695, 698. Rather, just cause for dismissal exists when an employee\u2019s actions demonstrate an unreasonable disregard for an employer\u2019s best interests. <em>Id.; Kiikka v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1985), 21 Ohio App.3d 168, 169, 21 OBR 178, 179-180, 486 N.E.2d 1233, 1234. Furthermore, a just cause termination requires some demonstration of fault on the employee\u2019s part. <em>Tzangas, Plakas &amp; Man-nos, supra, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 697-698, 653 N.E.2d at 1210-1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In the present case, we believe Janovsky ignored a clear prohibition against alcohol on Walnut Creek\u2019s premises. By possessing alcohol in her car, she disregarded her employer\u2019s best interests, and she is at fault. She is not \u201cthe victim of fortune\u2019s whims, but is instead directly responsible for h[er] own predicament.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred in reversing the review board and reinstating the OBES administrator\u2019s ruling. The review board\u2019s decision was not unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">We base this holding on the trial court's unduly narrow interpretation of the phase \u201con the premises.\u201d Although \u201cpremises\u201d is not defined in R.C. Chapter 4141 or the Walnut Creek employee handbook, words or phrases not defined by Ohio statutory law should \u201c \u2018be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Isreal </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 696, 699, 621 N.E.2d 793, 795, quoting R.C. 1.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The Twelfth District Court of Appeals has defined \u201cpremises\u201d as a \u201cspecified piece or tract of land with the structures on it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1789. Likewise, the Tenth District in <em>State v. Brittman </em>(Feb. 10, 1994), Franklin App. No. 93AP-1005, unreported, 1994 WL 41308, defined \u201cpremises\u201d as \u201c \u2018a tract of land including its buildings\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018a building together with its grounds or other appurtenances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Random House Dictionary of the English Language (2 Ed.1987). Additionally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the Eleventh District in <em>Faber v. R.J. Frazier Co. </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 9, 13, 593 N.E.2d 410, 413, concluded that an employer\u2019s fenced property, \u201cwhich includes the plant, parking lots, and access road, comprised the employment premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Similarly, portions of the Revised Code not at issue in the present appeal also define \u201cpremises\u201d to include not only a building, but also the surrounding land. See R.C. 1533.18(A) (defining \u201cpremises\u201d in the context of Ohio\u2019s recreational user statute as \u201call privately-owned lands, ways, waters, and any buildings and structures thereon, and all state-owned lands, ways, and waters leased to a private person, firm, organization, or corporation, including any buildings and structures thereon\u201d); R.C. 5321.01(C) (defining \u201cresidential premises\u201d as \u201ca dwelling unit for residential use and occupancy and the structure of which it is a part, the facilities and appurtenances in it, and the grounds, areas, and facilities for the use of tenants generally or the use of which is promised the tenant\u201d); R.C. 2925.01(R) (defining \u201cschool premises\u201d as \u201cthe parcel of real property on which any school is situated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We acknowledge, however, that \u201cpremises\u201d may have a narrower meaning in a particular context. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1991) 818 (defining premises generally as \u201cland with its appurtenances and structures thereon,\u201d but noting that \u201c[pjremises is an elastic and inclusive term, and it does not have one definite and fixed meaning; its meaning is to be determined by its context and is dependent on circumstances in which used, and may mean a room, shop, building, or any definite area\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Nevertheless, in the present case we construe the employment handbook\u2019s use of \u201cpremises\u201d as encompassing all Walnut Creek property and not just the nursing building. In an analogous case, <em>Xenia v. Berry </em>(Jan. 19, 1994), Greene App. No. 93-CA-39, unreported, 1994 WL 12494, this court considered whether the appellant had violated a temporary protection order prohibiting her from entering her husband\u2019s \u201cresidence.\u201d A police officer had issued the appellant a citation after finding her standing in her husband\u2019s driveway. Holding that \u201cresidence\u201d included more than just a house, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">\u201cWe need not, however, rely simply on a dictionary definition of the term in question. When used in a legal document, the true inquiry is what is the purpose of the document, for its purpose informs the meaning of the words used in the document. The purpose of a temporary protection order is to provide the aggrieved spouse with protection from the advances, threats, annoyances, or any other type of hostile behavior by the aggressive spouse at the locations mentioned in the order. * * * An aggrieved spouse is certainly entitled to the understanding that a safe haven at his home encompasses the grounds which he owns and upon which the home is located and which, in effect, complete the totality of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>residence by providing certainly desirable and sometimes necessary features such as a garage, a driveway, lawns, plantings, and other accouterments that convert a mere building into a \u2018home.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Similarly, in the present case we look to the purpose of Walnut Creek\u2019s rule prohibiting the possession of alcohol \u201con the premises.\u201d We agree with the trial court that the rule is designed to protect Walnut Creek\u2019s patients. We also agree that a nurse\u2019s possession or use of alcohol in the nursing home violates this purpose. As the trial court recognized, an intoxicated nurse is a danger to her patients, and the mere presence of alcohol increases the likelihood that patients will become intoxicated and endanger their health.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">However, we reject the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a nurse\u2019s possession of alcohol outside the nursing home, but on the property, does not threaten patients\u2019 safety. The trial court correctly reasoned that possession outside the home would be unlikely to result in patients obtaining the alcohol. Furthermore, we agree that mere possession of alcohol, standing alone, would not result in intoxicated nurses. The danger that the Walnut Creek rule recognizes, however, is that \u201cpossession\u201d increases the likelihood that \u201cuse\u201d will follow. The rule represents a rational attempt to prevent staff drunkenness by limiting employees\u2019 access to alcohol during work hours. The potential harm to patients\u2019 safety lies in a nurse\u2019s ability to enter her automobile during lunch or work breaks and consume alcohol. Indeed, in the present case a co-worker alleged that Janovsky \u201coften goes to Meijers or Krogers, which is right around the corner, and often drinks from a brown paper bag that was in the back of her car.\u201d Although the board of review made no findings regarding Janovsky\u2019s actual use of alcohol, the allegation illustrates the type of problem that Walnut Creek\u2019s rule seeks to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Additionally, as the appellants stress, under the trial court\u2019s narrow interpretation of \u201cpremises,\u201d Janovsky actually could consume alcohol on the Walnut Creek parking lot. As we explained above, the trial court determined that Walnut Creek\u2019s parking lot was not part of the \u201cpremises.\u201d Consequently, the rule prohibiting the possession, use, or sale of alcohol \u201con the premises\u201d would not apply. We do not believe Walnut Creek intended such a result when it drafted its employee handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Finally, the language of Walnut Creek\u2019s rule supports our conclusion. The rule bans possessing alcohol \u201con the premises.\u201d We find this phrase distinguishable from language forbidding alcohol \u201cin the premises.\u201d We believe that the former provision, which Walnut Creek adopted, encompasses a broader area than the latter provision, which indicates \u201cinclusion, location, or position within limits.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1983) 607. If Walnut Creek had intended to limit its anti-alcohol policy to the nursing home only, the employee handbook would have prohibited alcohol \u201cin the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Construing \u201cpremises\u201d as synonymous with \u201cbuilding,\u201d as the trial court did in the present case, however, creates a rule prohibiting alcohol possession \u201con the building.\u201d Such an interpretation is meaningless. The trial court\u2019s interpretation would make sense only if the rule prohibited alcohol \u201cin the premises.\u201d Since the rule bans alcohol \u201con the premises,\u201d however, we find Walnut Creek\u2019s use of \u201cpremises\u201d synonymous with \u201cproperty.\u201d Therefore, the rule forbids alcohol possession \u201con the property.\u201d This construction of the phase is meaningful and in conformity with the purpose underlying Walnut Creek\u2019s anti-alcohol policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Accordingly, we sustain the appellants\u2019 assignment of error' and reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b731-7\">Brogan and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
