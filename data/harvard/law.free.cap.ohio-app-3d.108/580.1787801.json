First, Collie did not own a gun and there was none in the house. Second, based on Mrs. Collie\u2019s past experiences, Collie became violent when drunk, and she considered him a violent man when he drank. Third, on the morning in question, he appeared to her to be drunk. Fourth, he did not yell or strike her, and the situation did not get violent. Finally, fearing that Collie would harm her and that he would pass out while watching their children, she left the house under the guise of buying cigarettes for her husband and went to the police instead. She was described by the officers as shaken and frightened, and afraid to return to remove her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Two police officers entered the Collie house with a key given to them by Mrs. Collie. Collie was described as calmly making oatmeal for his children for breakfast, still drunk, and verbally abusive to the officers. He was placed under arrest. Following a bench trial, he was convicted of domestic violence and sentenced to one hundred eighty days in jail, suspended; fined $1,000; and placed on probation for three years, a condition of which is substance-abuse treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In his first assignment of error, Collie argues that the trial court erred in not granting his Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case. Specifically, Collie argues that the state failed to produce any evidence indicating that the threat of harm to Mrs. Collie was \u201cimminent,\u201d which is an element of the offense with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Collie\u2019s statement, \u201c[i]f I had a gun, I would shoot you,\u201d is what is known in law as a conditional threat. A conditional threat can constitute a violation of the menacing laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>State v. Bayer </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 172, 183, 656 N.E.2d 1314, 1321; <em>Columbus v. Hutchins </em>(July 30, 1991), Franklin App. No. 91AP-18, unreported, 1991 WL 151222 (\u201cI will bust you if you do not let go of my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>wife.\u201d); <em>State v.

James </em>(Sept. 15, 1988), Franklin App. Nos. 87AP-1218 and 87AP-1222, unreported, 1988 WL 96240 (\u201cYou come in here and I\u2019ll kick your ass.\u201d); <em>State v. Sharp </em>(June 30, 1982), Medina App. No. 1128, unreported, 1982 WL 5077 (\u201cKeep your hand off my wife\u2019s knee or I\u2019ll kick your ass.\u201d); <em>State v.

Schwartz </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 484, 602 N.E.2d 671; <em>State v. Roberts </em>(Sept. 26, 1990), Hamilton App. No. C-890639, unreported, 1990 WL 410625; Committee Comment to R.C. 2903.22(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Collie was charged with a violation of R.C. 2919.25(C), which provides that \u201c[n]o person, by threat of force, shall knowingly cause a family or household member to believe that the offender will cause imminent physical harm to the family or household member.\u201d Unlike the menacing laws, this provision of the domestic violence statute contains the element of \u201cimminence.\u201d \u201cImminent\u201d means \u201cthreatening to occur immediately.\u201d Webster\u2019s Second International Dictionary (1959) 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The state chose to charge Collie under the domestic violence statute rather than under one of the menacing statutes. While there are very sound reasons for this, since a prior conviction for domestic violence will enhance the penalty on the next offense, the state must prove all the elements of the offense charged. Sections of the code defining offenses must be strictly construed against the state. R.C. 2901.04(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">On review of the denial of a motion under Crim.R. 29(A), the appellate court construes the evidence in a light most favorable to the state. An entry of acquittal is improper \u201cif the evidence is such that reasonable minds can reach different conclusions as to whether each material element of a crime has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Bridgeman </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 261, 9 O.O.3d 401, 381 N.E.2d 184, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Under the facts of this case, while Collie could well have been convicted of one of the menacing offenses, the state has failed to prove an essential element of the domestic violence statute with which he was charged, namely the <em>belief of </em>a family member that the offender will cause <em>imminent </em>physical harm. R.C. 2919.25(C). Nevertheless, because of our recognition of the unique nature of domestic violence cases, and our concern for the victims thereof, we today announce a test which the state shall be permitted to use in the future in cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>brought under R.C. 2919.25(C). We hold that in order to prove the element of the belief of a family member that the offender -will cause imminent physical harm, evidence of \u201cother acts\u201d against the same victim will be admissible with appropriate safeguards as herein set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">As noted above, R.C. 2919.25(C) has, as an element, the <em>belief </em>of a family member that the offender will cause <em>imminent </em>physical harm. Evidence of specific past acts toward the same victim cannot be used to show conforming conduct, an impermissible use of such evidence under Evid.R. 404(B). It can be used to establish the basis of the victim\u2019s belief that the offender is about to cause imminent physical harm, an element of this crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this regard, although the roles of the victim and the defendant are reversed, this is analogous to permitting evidence of a victim\u2019s prior specific instances of conduct to show the defendant\u2019s state of mind in a self-defense case, where the defendant\u2019s state of mind is crucial in determining whether self-defense was justified under the circumstances. There, as here, such prior acts would not be properly admitted unless knowledge of the specific acts prior to the confrontation was established by the party who needed to prove the requisite state of mind. Cf. <em>State v. Marsh </em>(1990), 71 Ohio App.3d 64, 69, 593 N.E.2d 35, 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Because of the great potential for prejudice arising from \u201cother acts\u201d testimony, in a domestic violence case brought under R.C. 2919.25(C), testimony of other acts of violence toward the same victim must be completely specific as to time and place. Properly particularized past behavior should be permitted to prove this element of the offense; generalizations should not. An excellent example of this distinction is found in <em>State v. Bolds </em>(Jan. 19, 1993), Stark App. No. CA-9058, unreported, 1993 WL 35578.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In <em>Bolds, </em>much as in this case, the defendant, while drunk, approached the apartment of the mother of his two children, stood outside, and repeatedly yelled and threatened to harm her. He did not get inside, and no actual harm occurred. The woman was able to call the police from a neighbor\u2019s apartment. When the police arrived, they found the woman very shaken, and Bolds taunting.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Bolds was charged under R.C. 2919.25(C). At trial, the court allowed evidence of <em>specific </em>prior acts (which included dates and descriptions of exactly what had happened) to prove the element of the victim\u2019s belief that the defendant would imminently harm her when he stood on the porch yelling threats. The court specifically <em>disallowed </em>testimony that the defendant \u201chad done many things\u201d to her in the past and directed counsel for the state to keep the victim\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>specific as to time and place. Finally, the court instructed the jury that the evidence of specific other acts could be considered only to prove the victim\u2019s belief that harm was imminent. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction on this basis, noting that \u201cthe event triggering prosecution is generally a conclusion to a series of events and is not always the most serious conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In the application of this analysis to the case at bar, apparently Collie\u2019s state of drunkenness had triggered his violence towards Mrs. Collie in the past. However, there is nothing specific in the record about these past incidents as there was in <em>Bolds: </em>no dates, places, and specific descriptions of what happened. Unfortunately, an objection to the state\u2019s attempt to develop this specificity was sustained by the trial court, which, in fairness, did not have the benefit of this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We believe that when coupled with the conditional threat in this case, specific acts in the past tying Collie\u2019s drunkenness to violent behavior probably would have provided the evidence necessary to prove Mrs. Collie\u2019s belief that harm was imminent; without it, however, the prosecution must fail. The evidence otherwise presented by the state was insufficient to create a question in the mind of the fact finder that the threatened harm was imminent. The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Because of our disposition of the first assignment of error, the second assignment of error is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Therefore the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the defendant is discharged from further prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b619-10\">Sundermann and Shannon, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b619-11\">Raymond E.
