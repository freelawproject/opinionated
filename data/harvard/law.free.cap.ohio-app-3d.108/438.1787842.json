After a hearing on April 12, 1995, the trial court granted the motion to suppress evidence because it found that police violated the knock-and-announce requirements of R.C. 2935.12. The state now appeals, setting forth the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the substantial prejudice of the state of Ohio by granting the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">The state argues that the \u201cknock and announce\u201d procedure set forth in R.C. 2935.12 was properly followed. R.C. 2935.12 provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-13\">\u201c(A) When making an arrest or executing an arrest warrant or summons in lieu of an arrest warrant, or when executing a search warrant, the peace officer, law enforcement officer, or other authorized individual making the arrest or executing the arrest or summons may break down an outer or inner door or window of a dwelling house or other building, if, after notice of his intention to make the arrest or to execute the warrant or summons, he is refused admittance, but the law enforcement officer or other authorized individual executing a search warrant shall not enter a house or building not described in the warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">The record indicates that three police vehicles pulled into appellee\u2019s driveway: a black and white twelve-passenger van marked with a light bar and a thirteen-inch diameter seal bearing the designation \u201cSheriff\u2019 on the side and back, a marked sheriffs patrol car, and an unmarked police car. Upon their arrival, seven to ten police officers, shouting \u201cdeputy sheriff, search warrant,\u201d ran to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>various positions around the house. The police officers included drug unit officers wearing ski masks and caps indicating \u201cDeputy Sheriff,\u201d deputies of the sheriffs department wearing standard uniforms, and members of a \u201cS.W.A.T.\u201d team wearing helmets, goggles and jackets with \u201cDeputy Sheriff\u2019 written across the chest with five-inch yellow letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The officers continued to shout their notice after they assumed their positions around appellee\u2019s house. Deputy Sheriff Christopher Heist testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress that when he arrived at appellee\u2019s home, he \u201cpounded\u201d on the casement of an outer storm door \u201cabout as hard as [he] could hammer on it,\u201d while continuing to shout his notice \u201cabout as loud as [he] could,\u201d until all of the members of the sheriffs department were in place around appellee\u2019s home. Heist testified that after hearing no response from the occupants inside, he tried to open the storm door and found that it was locked. Heist, acting upon a \u201cconstructive refusal to admit,\u201d then applied a pry bar in an attempt to open the storm door. See <em>State v. Castillo </em>(June 17, 1988), Wood App. No. WD-87-44, unreported, 1988 WL 62988.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The record indicates that during this time other members of the sheriffs department were still screaming \u201csearch warrant, Sheriffs Office.\u201d Heist eventually succeeded in prying the storm door open on his third attempt. Heist testified that he held the storm door open with his back and began pounding on the main wooden entry door while shouting his notice. After hearing no response from the occupants inside, Heist, again \u00e1cting upon a constructive refusal to admit, tried to gain access to the house through the entry door and found the door secured. Heist motioned to a fellow sheriffs deputy to apply a battering ram so that members of the sheriffs department could enter the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Our review of the record indicates that the sheriff\u2019s department under the facts and circumstances of this case did precisely what was required to be done as a precondition to entry as required by R.C. 2935.12. See <em>Miller v. United States </em>(1958), 357 U.S. 301, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is well taken and the judgment of the trial court granting appellee\u2019s motion to suppress is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-9\">Walsh, P.J., and William W.
