Raymond Jones was employed by defendant-appellee Multi-Color Corporation. During an employer-sponsored fitness day, Jones collapsed and died of a heart attack after running a foot race. Caron and Laura Jones, his wife and daughter and plaintiffs-appellants herein, filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim seeking death benefits as the result of Jones\u2019s death. The claim was denied at all levels administratively. The Joneses properly filed a <em>de novo </em>appeal pursuant to-R.C. 4123.519 (now R.C. 4123.512), naming the Administrator of .the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, the Industrial Commission and Multi-Color as defendants. Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed. The trial court granted summary judgment to all defendants. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">All parties agree that the facts in this case are undisputed. Jones was an employee of Multi-Color. Caron and Laura Jones were his dependents. Jones elected to participate in his employer\u2019s fitness-day program. Before doing so, he signed a waiver form entitled \u201cWaiver of Workers\u2019 Compensation Benefits for a Voluntary Participant in an Employer-Sponsored Recreation or Fitness Program/Activity\u201d (\u201cthe waiver\u201d). The waiver, which was on a form obtained from the Industrial Commission for this purpose, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-14\">\u201cThe undersigned declares that he or she is a voluntary participant in the employer\u2019s sponsored recreation fitness activity(s) listed above and hereby waives and relinquishes all rights to Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits under Chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>4123 of the Revised Code for any injury or disability incurred while participating on an annual basis in the listed activity(s).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Normally, an injury, occupational disease, or death of an employee occurring in the course of and arising out of employment is compensable exclusively under the workers\u2019 compensation system. <em>Waller v. Mayfield </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 118, 121, 524 N.E.2d 458, 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">An injury for workers\u2019 compensation purposes is defined in R.C. 4123.01(C) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">\u201cany injury, whether caused by external accidental means or accidental in character and result, received in the course of, and arising out of the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Further, as a general rule, an agreement by an employee to waive his or her rights to workers\u2019 compensation benefits is invalid. R.C. 4123.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Over the years, the subject of injuries received during employer-sponsored recreational activities was often litigated. Courts struggled in determining whether such injuries were \u201creceived in the course of, and arising out of the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Apparently in response to the large number of employer challenges to compensation for recreational injuries and the employers\u2019 desire to continue such activities, in 1986, the legislature enacted two statutes to address the problem. Both statutes are exceptions to the general rules allowing for workers\u2019 compensation. R.C. 4123.01(C)(3) provides that an \u201cinjury\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation purposes does not include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">\u201cInjury or disability incurred in voluntary participation in an employer-sponsored recreation or fitness activity if the employee signs a waiver of his rights to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>compensation or benefits under this chapter prior to engaging in the recreation or fitness activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">R.C. 4123.80(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">\u201cAn employee may waive his rights to compensation or benefits as authorized pursuant to division (C)(3) of section 4123.01 of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The first statute, R.C. 4123.01(C)(3), provides that if an employee signs a waiver, he cannot suffer an injury that is compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation system at an employer-sponsored recreation or fitness event. The second statute, R.C. 4123.80(B), recognizes that an employee may suffer an otherwise compensable injury at an employer-sponsored recreation or fitness event, but by virtue of his voluntary participation and his signing of the waiver, he waives his rights to this compensation in order to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The sole basis of the administrative rulings denying benefits, and the argument now urged upon us by appellees, was that Jones signed a waiver contemplated by the statute, and that because of the express provisions of R.C. 4123.01(C)(3), all such injuries by definition are not in the course of or arising out of employment, and therefore are not compensable injuries under the workers\u2019 compensation system. Without a compensable injury to Jones, his dependents could not recover death benefits. The trial court apparently agreed and granted summary judgment to all defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">In their first assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to all appellees herein. They advance several arguments in support of their position, all challenging the effect of the waiver on their entitlement to death benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">The resolution of this case depends on the interpretation of the two code sections authorizing the waiver, R.C. 4123.01(C) and 4123.80(B), and on the effect of the waiver on appellants\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">We do not agree with appellees that by virtue of R.C. 4123.01(C)(3), Jones\u2019s injury is not in the course of or arising out of employment. If we were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>allow this interpretation, which would remove such injuries from the workers\u2019 compensation system, employees injured in recreational activities could sue their employers for common-law negligence, and in the event of a fatal injury, dependents could bring wrongful death claims. Such an interpretation is completely at odds with the entire workers\u2019 compensation scheme. \u201c * * * The Act [R.C. Chapter 4123] operates as a balance of mutual compromise between the interests of the employer and the employee whereby employees relinquish their common law remedy and accept lower benefit levels coupled with the greater assurance of recovery and employers give up their common law defenses and are protected from unlimited liability * * <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 614, 23 O.O.3d 504, 508, 433 N.E.2d 572, 577. Further, such an interpretation conflicts with R.C. 4123.74, which furthers the goal of the workers\u2019 compensation system by specifically providing immunity to complying employers from common-law liability for \u201cany injury, occupational disease, or bodily condition, received or contracted by an employee in the course of or arising out of his employment, or for any death resulting from such injury, occupational disease, or bodily condition * * *.\u201d Finally, such an interpretation also conflicts with Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u201cFor the purposes of providing compensation to workmen and to their dependents, for death, injuries or occupational disease, occasioned in the course of such workmen\u2019s employment, laws may be passed establishing a state fund to be created by compulsory contribution thereto by employers, and administered by the state, determining the terms and conditions upon which payment shall be made therefrom. <em>Such compensation shall be in lieu of all other rights to compensation, or damages, for such death, injuries, or occupational diseases, and any employer who pays the premium or compensation provided by law, passed in accordance herewith, shall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute for such deaths, injuries or occupational disease. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) Cf. <em>Brady v. Safety-Kleen Corp. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 624, 633-634, 576 N.E.2d 722, 728-729.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Thus, we first hold that the waiver which Jones signed does not remove his injury from the course of his employment and thus from the workers\u2019 compensation system. We are dealing only with an injury for which workers\u2019 compensation arguably can be waived, not with an injury which can be removed from the course of employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It does not remove the injury from the workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The next question we must answer is whether the release Jones signed effectively waived the rights of his dependents to death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Looking first at the release itself, even if a worker could waive benefits other than his own, we hold that the release in this case is wholly insufficient in law to accomplish such a waiver. It simply does not inform Jones that he is or might be waiving the right of his dependents to any death benefits. The form does not even mention death benefits. <em>Any </em>limitation on workers\u2019 compensation benefits must be strictly construed to effect the purposes of the act as set forth in R.C. 4123.95. <em>Mentzer v. Westinghouse Corp. </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 198, 201, 10 OBR 271, 274, 461 N.E.2d 24, 26. Further, the form itself must be strictly construed against the drafter, in this case one or all of the defendants. See <em>O\u2019Neill v. German </em>(1951), 154 Ohio St. 565, 571, 44 O.O. 11, 14, 97 N.E.2d 8, 11; <em>Farmers\u2019 Natl. Bank v. Delaware Ins. Co. </em>(1911), 83 Ohio St. 309, 94 N.E. 834, paragraph seven of the syllabus. This is especially so when we are dealing with statutes that are exceptions to the general rules allowing for workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Many years ago, in discussing the nature of workers\u2019 (then workmen\u2019s) compensation, the Ohio Supreme Court wrote that \u201cwe particularly agree that the law is founded on the principle of insurance, and that it is in no sense a pension, or bounty, or gratuity.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Crawford v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1924), 110 Ohio St. 271, 143 N.E. 574. Therefore, some analogies to insurance waivers and releases are appropriate in further analyzing the sufficiency of the release in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In order to be effective, a waiver \u201cmust be voluntary, that is intentional, with knowledge of the facts and of the party\u2019s rights * * <em>List &amp; Son Co. v. Chase </em>(1909), 80 Ohio St. 42, 51, 88 N.E. 120, 122. In <em>Ady v. West Am. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 593, 599, 23 O.O.3d 495, 499, 433 N.E.2d 547, 550-551,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Ohio Supreme Court, in invalidating an uninsured motorist exclusion, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">\u201c[F]urthermore, an exclusion must be conspicuous and in terminology easily understood by a customer. A customer must be aware of the provision, understand the meaning and voluntarily agree to any restrictions on the full coverage statutorily mandated.\u201d See, also, <em>Erie Ins. Group v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 741, 750-751, 585 N.E.2d 464, 470-471; <em>Sachs v. Am. Economy Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 440, 446-447, 605 N.E.2d 403, 406-407.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The release in this case absolutely fails to inform Jones about the effect of his waiver on his dependents\u2019 benefits, and on this basis alone it would not operate as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>a waiver even if such a waiver were permissible. However, we also hold that even if the form Jones signed adequately advised him of what he was waiving, Jones could not, in law, waive his dependents\u2019 death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u201cIt is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that statutes relating to the same subject matter should be construed together. In construing such statutes <em>in pari materia, </em>they should be harmonized so as to give full application to the statutes.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State ex rel. Thurn v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 289, 294, 649 N.E.2d 1205, 1209. \u201cThe interpretation and application of statutes must be viewed in a manner to carry out the legislative intent of the sections.\u201d <em>United Tel. Co. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 369, 372, 643 N.E.2d 1129, 1131. As we have mentioned several times in this opinion, it is significant that R.C. 4123.01(C)(3) and 4123.80(B) are both exceptions to the general rules allowing compensation for work-related injuries. They must be read in conjunction with R.C. 4123.95, which provides that the workers\u2019 compensation system \u201cshall be liberally construed in favor of the employees and the dependents of the deceased employees.\u201d Pursuant to R.C. 4123.80(B), an employee may waive <em>his </em>rights to compensation or benefits under R.C. 4123.01(C)(3). We take this to mean that regardless of what an employee can do with his own rights, he cannot waive those of his dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In arguing that Jones could not waive his dependents\u2019 death benefits, appellants analogize the situation to wrongful death claims; appellees find this argument \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d In 1953, the Ohio Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">\u201cAlthough it is true that the liability of an employer to dependents of an employee in case of his death must have its origin in a compensable injury to the employee which caused his death, it is a mere contingent liability until the death occurs. [Citation to prior code section omitted.] Dependency under the statute here involved can never arise unless and until the employee dies. Until then, the liability of the employer necessarily remains contingent. Whether there be any dependents and their identity can not be determined until the death of the employee. Consequently, although the right of a dependent to such award has its origin in the injury which causes death, it can not possibly arise or accrue until the death of the employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">\u201cAn analogous situation prevails in wrongful death actions where the deaths result from injuries caused by the wrongful acts of others.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Dickerson </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 223, 226, 52 O.O. 86, 87, 115 N.E.2d 833, 834. See, also, <em>Indus. Comm. v. Davis </em>(1933), 126 Ohio St. 593, 596-597, 186 N.E. 505, 506.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Just as a person cannot waive the wrongful death benefits of his next of kin, a worker cannot waive his dependents\u2019 death benefits. See <em>Thompson v. Wing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 176, 183, 637 N.E.2d 917, 922; <em>Mahoning Valley Ry. Co. v. Van Alstine </em>(1908), 77 Ohio St. 395, 83 N.E. 601, paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>Phillips v. Community Traction Co. </em>(1933), 46 Ohio App. 483, 485, 189 N.E. 444, 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">While there must be a compensable injury in order for dependents to receive death benefits, the two sets of entitlements are separate and distinct. R.C. 4123.01(C) and 4123.59; <em>Indus. Comm. v. Davis </em>(1933), 126 Ohio St. 593, 186 N.E. 505, paragraph two of syllabus. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Manns v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 188, 190, 529 N.E.2d 1379, 1381; <em>State ex rel. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel, supra, </em>160 Ohio St. at 230, 52 O.O. at 89, 115 N.E.2d at 834-835; <em>State ex rel Bessler v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 297, 302, 47 O.O. 179, 182, 105 N.E.2d 264, 267 (noting that the opinion in <em>Davis </em>\u201cstresses the independent character of the two causes of action \u2014 that of the employee for compensation which arises at the time of the injury and that of the dependents which obviously can not accrue prior to the death of the employee\u201d); <em>State ex rel Gaddis v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1938), 133 Ohio St. 553, 11 O.O. 266, 15 N.E.2d 146, paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>Wells v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 433, 437, 590 N.E .2d 1315, 1317. See, also, Annotation, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u2014 Release or Waiver of Claim by Employee as Affecting Right of Dependents in Event of his Death as Result of Injury (1936), 101 A.L.R. 1410; 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1995) 11-195, Section 64.00 (\u201cThe dependent\u2019s right to death benefits is an independent right derived from statute, not from rights of the decedent. Accordingly, death benefits are not affected by compromises or releases executed by decedent * * *.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Thus, we hold that the recreational waiver signed by Jones in this case did not and could not operate as a bar to the death benefit claims of the appellants. We believe this conclusion is solidly supported by the public policy of this state, as articulated in R.C. 4123.95 and Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. The trial court thus incorrectly granted summary judgment to appellees, and the first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In their second assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred in overruling their motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">In order for dependents to get death benefits, they must first prove that there was a compensable injury. <em>Johnson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 297, 58 O.O. 90, 130 N.E.2d 807, paragraph one of the syllabus; see, also, <em>Farrier v. Connor </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 219, 221, 12 OBR 303, 304-305, 466 N.E.2d 557, 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">We have held <em>supra </em>that the recreational waiver in this case was ineffective in law to remove the underlying injury from the workers\u2019 compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>tion system. This does not, however, mean that appellants are automatically entitled to death benefits. It only allows appellants the right to proceed to prove the necessary compensable injury as if there were no waiver at all, just as the employer is free to contest the compensability of the underlying injury. See <em>Mentzer v. Westinghouse Corp. </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 198, 10 OBR 271, 461 N.E.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Appellants filed for summary judgment, arguing that they were legally entitled to death benefits. In support of their position they presented competent medical evidence that Jones died from a preexisting cause which was accelerated by an injury that he experienced in the workplace. In response to appellants\u2019 motion, appellees did not present any material demonstrating the existence of a factual dispute. They never attempted to argue in this <em>de novo </em>proceeding that even without the waiver the heart attack would not have been a compensable injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They relied solely on the waiver to prove there was no compensable injury in this case. Thus, appellees failed to meet their burden under <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The only competent evidence before the trial court was that which was presented by appellants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Reviewing this evidence <em>de novo, </em>we hold it established as a matter of law that Jones had a compensable injury. <em>Swanton v. Stringer </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 356, 71 O.O.2d 325, 328 N.E.2d 794; <em>McKee v. Electric Auto-Lite </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 77, 5 O.O.2d 345, 151 N.E.2d 540, syllabus. Accordingly, the trial court erred in overruling appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and their second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and final judgment is entered for appellants granting them the right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation system for death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b432-9\">Painter, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A7W\">Gorman, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-11\">.

Barry </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 536, 539, 602 N.E.2d 419, 421, jurisdictional motion overruled (1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 1463, 590 N.E.2d 757.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Gorman, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A7p\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">I commend the majority for its attempt to craft a, result which provides for the deceased\u2019s widow and family, but I cannot accept its analysis. Therefore, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">R.C. 4123.01(C)(3) provides that if an employee signs a recreational waiver, then any injury experienced by that employee as a result of his or her voluntary participation in an employer-sponsored recreation or fitness activity is not an injury covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Without a compensable injury, it follows that there can be no basis for paying workers\u2019 compensation benefits to either the employee or the employee\u2019s dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The majority, however, concludes that it cannot \u201callow this interpretation\u201d because the common law of torts would then apply to any injury suffered by the employee. According to the majority, such a result would be \u201ccompletely at odds with the entire workers\u2019 compensation scheme.\u201d The <em>only </em>reason offered by the majority to support this statement is the general principle of exclusivity which holds that workers\u2019 compensation is in lieu of all other rights to damages or benefits <em>for a covered injury. </em>It is a complete <em>non sequitur, </em>however, to suggest that the exclusivity principle prohibits an employer from being sued under the common law for a <em>noncovered </em>injury. This is particularly true where the employer, pursuant to legislative authority, has voluntarily removed the injury from the workers\u2019 compensation scheme by having the employee sign a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Phillip J. Fulton, in his treatise on Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law, acknowledges that one possible effect of a recreational-release waiver is to \u201cexpose the employer to potential liability in a civil action for negligence since the injury no longer falls within the exclusivity protection of workers\u2019 compensation legislation.\u201d Fulton, Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1991) 155, Section 7.11. The author of the law review article cited by the majority, Wambaugh, Comment, Recreational Injuries: Ohio Employers\u2019 Dilemma Resolved? (1989), 16 N.Ky. L.Rev. 593, 6\u00d31, arrives at the same conclusion, noting that the compromise effect of the recreational waiver is to place the employer back \u201cwithin the purview of negligence concepts rather than under no-fault workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d Significantly, neither author finds this result antithetical to the workers\u2019 compensation scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">I grant that the workers\u2019 compensation statutes \u201cshall be liberally construed in favor of employees and the dependents of deceased employees.\u201d R.C. 4123.95. It is well settled, however, that the principle of liberal construction cannot be used to provide compensation for an injury falling outside the system. <em>Georgejakakis v. Wheeling Steel Corp. </em>(1949), 151 Ohio St. 458, 461-462, 39 O.O. 276, 277-278, 86 N.E.2d 594, 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>I also consider misplaced the majority\u2019s heavy reliance on analogies to insurance waivers and releases in private contracts of insurance to judge the sufficiency of the waiver in this case.' Such analogies are inappropriate since the workers\u2019 compensation system is a statutory <em>compensation </em>scheme and is \u201cneither charity, nor pension, nor indemnity, <em>nor insurance, </em>nor wages\u201d although containing certain elements common to all. (Emphasis added.) <em>Austin Co. v. Brown </em>(1929), 121 Ohio St. 271, 277, 167 N.E. 874, 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">As a practical matter, the majority\u2019s holding that Jones \u201ccannot, in law, waive his dependents\u2019 death benefits\u201d by signing a recreational waiver will most likely effectively eliminate its use. The Act makes no express provision for a recreational waiver signed by dependents. Absent such a provision, employers will presumably stop employing recreational waivers, and sponsoring the activities they involve, since they offer no protection from dependents\u2019 benefits. Even if it is assumed that such a provision could be found for dependents to sign on to such a waiver, this would require the employee to, in effect, get permission from all of his or her dependents, <em>including minor children, </em>before participating in a company picnic for which the employer requires an waiver. In fact, under the majority\u2019s holding, the dissenting minor children, or children too young to make an intelligent decision, would arguably be entitled to the appointment of a guardian or next friend. The result is Orwellian.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The canons of construction enlisted by the majority to ignore the plain meaning of R.C. 4123.01(C)(3) are simply inapplicable here. The statute is neither ambiguous nor shaded by nuance. It provides clearly that a waiver, once signed by Jones, removes the injury incurred at a recreational activity from the definition of workplace injuries covered by the Act. While conceding to the majority that a dependent\u2019s right to death benefits is an independent right derived from statute, I note that it is also a right \u2014 as the majority acknowledges but then ignores \u2014 which depends entirely for its existence upon the employee suffering a compensable injury. According to statute, once Jones signed the waiver in this case, his subsequent injury at the recreational activity of his employer was unequivocally not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">As noted by Wambaugh in his article, recreational waivers are the legislature\u2019s attempt to restore \u201cequilibrium to the compensable status of injuries sustained by employees during employer-sponsored recreation in Ohio.\u201d Wambaugh, <em>supra, </em>at 602. The majority\u2019s holding, I believe, disrupts that equilibrium and sends the whole process reeling. I would, therefore, overrule both assignments of error in this case and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
