He also avers that, after an immigration judge found him deportable, the Board of Immigration Appeals reversed that decision and the board\u2019s decision has not been appealed. Relator further avers that he has an action pending which could result in his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-18\">Relator complains that respondents \u2014 Enforcement Counsel for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) and INS \u2014 have refused to notify the proper authorities of the state of Ohio to release a \u201cholder\u201d which was placed upon relator during the deportation proceedings. Relator requests that this court compel respondents to \u201cdrop the \u2018holder\u2019 \u201d against relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>For the reasons stated below, we dismiss this action <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In <em>McClung v. Silliman </em>(1821), 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 598, 5 L.Ed. 340, the plaintiff asserted a preemptive interest in a tract of land in Ohio. The plaintiff sought a writ of mandamus against the register of the land office of the United States. After the federal court determined that \u201cCongress has vested it with no such controlling power over the acts of the ministerial officers in the given case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 599, 5 L.Ed. at 340, the plaintiff sought a writ of mandamus in state court. Although the Supreme Court of Ohio determined that it had jurisdiction over the register, it held against the plaintiff on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 5 L.Ed. at 341. The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed that judgment but held that \u201cthe said Supreme Court of the State of Ohio had no authority to issue a mandamus in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 5 L.Ed. at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Likewise, this court lacks the authority to grant relief in mandamus against respondents in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">\u201c[T]here is strong authority for the proposition that, by virtue of <em>McClung v. Silliman </em>doctrine, a state court cannot entertain a mandamus proceeding to direct the action of a federal officer or agency relative to a matter committed to the officer or agency * * *.\u201d 1 Moore, Federal Practice (1978) 245, Paragraph 0.6[5].</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Clearly, relator\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">\u2018While <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint without notice is generally inappropriate, it is proper where the complaint is frivolous or the claimant obviously cannot prevail on the facts alleged in the complaint. See <em>State ex rel. Edwards v. Toledo City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 106, 108, 647 N.E.2d 799, 801, citing <em>Baker v. Dir., U.S. Parole Comm. </em>(C.A.D.C.1990), 916 F.2d 725, and <em>English v. Cowell </em>(C.A.7, 1993), 10 F.3d 434.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Peeples v. Anderson </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 559, 560, 653 N.E.2d 371, 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">In light of <em>McClung, supra, </em>relator in this case \u201cobviously cannot prevail on the facts alleged in the complaint.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Accordingly, relator\u2019s complaint is dismissed <em>sua sponte. </em>Relator to pay costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">\n<em>Writ dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b613-13\">Dyke, P.J., Harper and Patton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
