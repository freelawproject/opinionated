The trial court awarded summary judgment upon American States\u2019 action for declaratory relief, in which the company claimed it was not bound under the terms of its homeowner\u2019s policy to extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>coverage or a defense to its insured, Alverda Guillermin (\u201cAlverda\u201d), defendant below.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">American States issued a homeowner\u2019s policy to Alverda which was effective from December 20, 1992 to December 20, 1993. The policy insured Alverda\u2019s residence, located at 320 Ashwood in Dayton (the \u201cinsured location\u201d). Alverda also owns a fifty-two-acre farm in Brown County, Ohio. The policy did not include the farm within its coverage terms. Although Alverda did not reside on the farm and only visited there intermittently, she permitted her sons, Jerry Guillermin (\u201cJerry\u201d) and Ronald Guillermin (\u201cRonald\u201d), defendants below, access to the farm. The sons testified that they kept horses and other animals on the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">On August 8, 1993, Lee John Kimberly allegedly was attacked and mauled while on property occupied by the Kimberlys by a lion that the appellants claim escaped from Alverda\u2019s farm. The Kimberlys filed suit against the Guillermins on September 16, 1993, alleging that, with Alverda\u2019s permission and Ronald\u2019s assistance, Jerry harbored the animal on the farm. The Kimberlys charged that the Guillermins were negligent for allowing the lion \u201cto remain unattended on the premises without sufficient precautions to prevent [it] from leaving the premises.\u201d The Guillermins sought coverage and legal defense under the terms of Alverda\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">On April 12, 1994, American States sought declaratory judgment in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. The company alleged that it was not obligated to provide either coverage or defense for the Guillermins under the terms of the policy. American States asserted two theories: (1) that Jerry and Ronald were not \u201cinsureds\u201d; and (2) that Alverda\u2019s farm was not an \u201cinsured location:\u201d Following discovery, American States and the Kimberlys filed motions for summary judgment and their respective memoranda in opposition to the motions. In addition to their assertion that Jerry and Ronald were \u201cinsureds,\u201d the Kimberlys also claimed that the policy should cover Alverda\u2019s allegedly tortious act of harboring the lion on her property. The trial court determined that neither son was an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy and that the farm was not an \u201cinsured location.\u201d The court did not address the Kimberlys\u2019 claim of coverage based on Alverda\u2019s purported harboring of the animal. The court granted American States\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied the Kimberlys\u2019 summary judgment motion. From that judgment, the Kimberlys appeal. The Guillermins did not take an appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">We consolidate the appellants\u2019 two assignments of error for our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">\u201cI. The trial court erred as a matter of law in granting American States\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\u201cII. The trial court erred as a matter of law in denying appellants[\u2019] (the Kimberlys[\u2019]) motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The Kimberlys present two issues for our disposition. First, they argue that Jerry is a resident of his mother\u2019s household and, therefore, is an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy. The Kimberlys do not argue on appeal that Ronald is an \u201cinsured.\u201d Next, they claim the policy should extend coverage to Alverda\u2019s allegedly tortious acts. Arising necessarily from their second issue is their argument that the policy exclusion to payment for personal liability or medical treatment for \u201c \u2018bodily injury* * * * arising out of a premises * * * owned by an \u2018insured\u2019 * * * that is not an \u2018insured location\u2019 \u201d is inapplicable under the facts of this case. The appellants do not challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that the farm is not an \u201cinsured location.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Before a court may grant summary judgment, the successful party must satisfy a three-pronged test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">\u201cThe appositeness of rendering a summary judgment hinges upon the tripartite demonstration: (1) that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 74, 375 N.E.2d 46, 47. See, also, Civ.R. 56(C).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Because it avoids a trial, summary judgment circumvents the normal litigation process. Therefore, \u201cthe burden is strictly upon the moving party to establish, through the evidentiary material permitted by the rule, that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>AAAA Ent., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redev. Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597, 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Once the movant meets its burden, the nonmoving party may not simply rely on the mere allegations of its pleadings to survive a motion for summary judgment, but must set forth specific facts showing there exists a genuine issue for determination at trial. <em>Savransky v. Cleveland </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 118, 119, 4 OBR 364, 365, 447 N.E.2d 98, 99. Moreover, the nonmoving party must produce evidence on any issue for which it bears the burden of production at trial. <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>Brads v. First Baptist Church of Germantown, Ohio </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 328, 333, 624 N.E.2d 737, 741, jurisdictional motion overruled (1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 1506, 622 N.E.2d 654. Courts have interpreted <em>Wing </em>to mean that the nonmovant must produce evidence on \u201cany issue upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>which the movant meets its initial burden.\u201d <em>Stewart v. B.F. Goodrich Co. </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 35, 41, 623 N.E.2d 591, 595, jurisdictional motion overruled (1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 1489, 621 N.E.2d 410. See <em>Few v. Cobblestone, Inc. </em>(Oct. 17, 1991), Montgomery App. No. 12490, unreported, 1991 WL 216413.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Because a trial court\u2019s determination of summary judgment concerns a question of law, we apply the same standard as the trial court in our review of its disposition of the motion; in other words, our review is <em>de novo. Children\u2019s Med. Ctr. v. Ward </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 504, 508, 622 N.E.2d 692, 695, jurisdictional motion overruled (1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 1481, 620 N.E.2d 854. We \u201caccept the evidence properly before [us] and, with respect to the merit issues involved, construe the evidence most strongly in favor of the claims of the party against whom the motion is made.\u201d <em>Buckingham v. Middlestetter </em>(Mar. 22, 1993), Montgomery App. No. 13575, unreported, 1993 WL 81827. Therefore, our decision, like the trial court\u2019s, is founded on the record before us, including the evidence submitted by the parties in support of their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Similarly, since the interpretation of an insurance contract is a matter of law, <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Guman Bros. Farm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 107, 108, 652 N.E.2d 684, 685; <em>Johnson v. Lincoln Natl. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 249, 254, 590 N.E.2d 761, 764, we review its terms <em>de novo, Guman Bros. Farm, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 108, 652 N.E.2d at 685, citing <em>Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 145, 147, 593 N.E.2d 286, 287. When construing the provisions of an insurance policy, we are mindful that \u201c[generally, * * * words in a policy must be given their plain and ordinary meaning, and only in situations where the contract is ambiguous and thus susceptible to more than one meaning must the policy language be liberally construed in favor of the claimant who seeks the benefits of coverage.\u201d <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Rose </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 528, 531-532, 575 N.E.2d 459, 461, overruled on other grounds by <em>Savoie v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 500, 620 N.E.2d 809. Accord <em>Leber v. Smith </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 548, 557, 639 N.E.2d 1159, 1165; <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus; <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. Price </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St.2d 95, 99, 68 O.O.2d 56, 58, 313 N.E.2d 844, 846; <em>Ohio Farmers Ins. Co. v. Wright </em>(1969), 17 Ohio St.2d 73, 78, 46 O.O.2d 404, 406, 246 N.E.2d 552, 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The concept of strict interpretation applies with \u201cgreater force to language that purports to limit or to qualify coverage.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Brown </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 160, 164, 646 N.E.2d 485, 487, discretionary appeal not allowed in (1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 1458, 644 N.E.2d 1030. \u201cHowever, the rule of strict construction does not permit a court to change the obvious intent of a provision just to impose coverage.\u201d <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>St.3d 657, 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096, 1102, certiorari denied (1992), 507 U.S. 987, 113 S.Ct. 1585, 123 L.Ed.2d 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Initially, we address the matter of Jerry\u2019s status as regards the policy. The policy defines \u201cinsured\u201d as \u201c[Alverda] and residents of your household who are * * * y0ur relatives.\u201d There is no question but that Jerry is Alverda\u2019s son and, therefore, her relative. Thus, the issue is whether Jerry is a \u201cresident[ ] of [her] household.\u201d The term \u201chousehold\u201d is not defined in the policy. The plain and ordinary meaning of this undefined term is \u201c \u2018 * * * those who dwell under the same roof and compose a family: * * * a social unit comprised of those living together in the same dwelling place,\u2019 \u201d <em>Shear v. </em>W. <em>Am. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 162, 166, 11 OBR 478, 481, 464 N.E.2d 545, 548, quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, or, alternatively, \u201c \u2018the inmates of a house collectively; an organized family, including servants or attendants, dwelling in a house; a domestic establishment,\u2019 \u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Davidson </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 101, 106, 621 N.E.2d 887, 891, quoting the Oxford English Dictionary, motion to certify record overruled (1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 1438, 617 N.E.2d 688. Similarly, the phrase \u201cresident of your household\u201d has been defined as referring to \u201cone who lives in the home of the named insured for a period of some duration or regularity, although not necessarily there permanently, but excludes a temporary or transient visitor.\u201d <em>Farmers Ins. of Columbus, Inc. v. Taylor </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 68, 528 N.E.2d 968, syllabus. The <em>Shear </em>court also stressed the nontemporary nature of the domestic living arrangements as a factor when determining if relatives are members of the same household. <em>Shear, </em>11 Ohio St.3d at 166, 11 OBR at 481, 464 N.E.2d at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The evidence presented by the appellants fails to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding Jerry\u2019s status as an \u201cinsured.\u201d Viewing the evidence most favorably for the appellants, we conclude that he is not covered by the policy. He testified at his deposition that he was born in 1951. Since 1993, he has lived in Arcanum with his children and their mother. However, he lists his mailing address as 320 Ashwood in Dayton \u2014 his mother\u2019s address and the policy\u2019s \u201cinsured premises.\u201d Jerry has stayed with his mother at the Ashwood residence on an \u201cinconsistent\u201d or \u201coccasional\u201d basis: he resided with his mother continuously for a month at some time between October 1993 and October 1994; he stayed with Alverda for two days between August and October 1994; he moved in and out of her home up to six times since he was eighteen \u2014 one stay could have been as long as ten months. Jerry kept bedroom furniture and some clothes at the Ashwood residence. Furthermore, he performs remodeling work and other chores at Alverda\u2019s residence, \u201cchecks on\u201d her at different times, and regularly stops to pick up his mail. Nevertheless, he stated: \u201cAshwood is a mailing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>address. That\u2019s my mother\u2019s. I\u2019m not actually living there. I\u2019m living in Arcanum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The appellants argue that this evidence is sufficient to raise a material question regarding Jerry\u2019s status as a resident of Alverda\u2019s household or, at the very least, establishes an issue of dual residency. We disagree. Although courts will consider other factors when determining whether an individual is a resident of the insured household, including mail delivery and storage of belongings, <em>Davidson, supra, </em>and the layout and use of the residential dwelling, <em>Renwick v. Lightning Rod Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 708, 710-711, 595 N.E.2d 1007, 1008-1010, the primary consideration is the nontemporary nature, <em>Shear, supra; Taylor, supra; Napier v. Banks </em>(1969), 19 Ohio App.2d 152, 156, 48 O.O.2d 263, 265, 250 N.E.2d 417, 419, or regularity of the living arrangements, <em>Bunch v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Jan. 11, 1983), Montgomery App. No. 7897, unreported 1983 WL 5014.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The appellants\u2019 evidence does not establish a genuine issue of an intent to stay at the insured premises for more than a temporary period. Although Jerry received his mail at the Ashwood address, he testified that this was for his convenience so that he would not receive mail at more than one location. The appellants did not present any evidence that Jerry\u2019s one-month stay with his mother between October 1993 and October 1994 was intended to be anything other than part of a pattern of \u201cinconsistent,\u201d \u201coccasional,\u201d or irregular visits. Furthermore, the Kimberlys did not show that this period was effective on the date of the mauling, let alone within the applicable policy period; the same may be said for his extended ten-month stay, which occurred sometime after his eighteenth birthday. We do not find the storage of some clothes or furniture at his mother\u2019s residence, alone, persuasive on this issue. Moreover, Jerry\u2019s statement that he .lives in Arcanum is compelling evidence that he did not intend these visits, at least those beginning in 1993, to be more than temporary arrangements. Therefore, we conclude that the appellants failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The appellants maintain that this evidence is sufficient to survive summary judgment on this issue because it raises a question of Jerry\u2019s dual residency. Dual residency was recognized in <em>Taylor, supra, </em>39 Ohio App.3d 68, 70-71, 528 N.E.2d 968, 969-970, but the clear majority of cases applying this principle involves \u201cminor children of divorced parents.\u201d <em>Still v. Fox </em>(1994), 67 Ohio Misc.2d 67, 69, 644 N.E.2d 1133, 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">\u201cAfter reviewing Ohio caselaw in this area, we have discovered that two prominent factual elements appear in a majority of the cases in which a minor is found to be a dual resident of separate households: (1) the minor has divorced parents with whom the minor alternately resides under a custody or visitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>arrangement; and (2) the minor\u2019s dual residency generally involves a consistent living pattern between the two households which exists for a period of some duration or regularity.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co. </em>(July 20, 1994), Summit App. No. 16639, unreported, 1994 WL 376768, discretionary appeal not allowed in (1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 1423, 642 N.E.2d 388. See, also, <em>Snedegar v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 64, 541 N.E.2d 90, motion to certify record overruled (1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 712, 532 N.E.2d 142; <em>Taylor, supra; United Ohio Ins. Co. v. Bolin </em>(Apr. 11, 1989), Miami App. No. 88 CA 21, unreported, 1989 WL 35885, jurisdictional motion overruled (1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 705, 545 N.E.2d 1283; <em>Bolin v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Mar. 25, 1988), Miami App. No. 87 CA 46, unreported, 1988 WL 35291.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The appellants cite <em>Ziegler v. Workman </em>(Mar. 30, 1994), Muskingum App. No. 93-28, unreported, 1994 WL 140755, for the proposition that dual residency may apply to emancipated children. In <em>Ziegler, </em>the court affirmed a summary judgment which found that the emancipated son of the insured was covered by the insured\u2019s automobile insurance policy. The court held that the son established dual residency when he testified that he resided in his parents\u2019 household twenty-five percent of the time, and at his girlfriend\u2019s residence seventy-five percent of the time. The son also received his mail at his parents\u2019 home. The court reasoned that the emancipated status of the son was \u201ca distinction without a difference\u201d because the son was a relative of the insured, and the policy language did not \u201crestrict coverage to exclusive residents [of the insured\u2019s household], or * * * allow dual residency only concerning minors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We need not reach the issue of dual residency for emancipated children because, for the reasons previously stated, we find that the appellants did not produce evidence of a regular pattern of residency approximating that found in <em>Ziegler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">We turn now to the issue which the trial court declined to address: whether the policy extends coverage to Alverda based on her allegedly tortious conduct. Section Two of the policy delineates the liability coverage (\u201cCoverage E\u201d) provided by American States. The policy extends personal liability coverage and defense \u201c[i]f a claim is made or a suit is brought against an \u2018insured\u2019 for damages because of \u2018personal injury\u2019 * * * caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 to which this coverage applies[.]\u201d There is no question but that Alverda is the \u201cinsured.\u201d The policy defines \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as including \u201cbodily injury,\u201d which it designates as \u201cbodily harm, sickness or disease, including required care, loss of services and death that results.\u201d The policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident * * * which results, during the policy period, in * * * personal injuryf.]\u201d This policy section also provides medical payments (\u201cCoverage F\u201d) \u201cto a person off the \u2018insured location\u2019, if the \u2018bodily injury\u2019 * * * is caused by an animal owned by or in the care of an \u2018insured\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Generally, an occurrence which gives rise to liability coverage is construed as an event that occurs outside the expectation of the insured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201c[A]n \u2018accident\u2019 is an event proceeding from an unexpected happening or unknown cause without design and not in the usual course of things; an event that takes place without one\u2019s expectation; an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event; an event which proceeds from an unknown cause or is an unusual effect of a known cause and, therefore, unexpected.\u201d <em>Toronto v. Westfield Cos. </em>(Sept. 18, 1995), Jefferson App. No. 94-J-46, unreported, 1995 WL 555672.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201c[T]his court finds that the word \u2018occurrence,\u2019 defined as \u2018an accident\u2019 was intended to mean just that \u2014 an unexpected, unforeseeable event.\u201d <em>Randolf v. Grange Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 25, 28-29, 11 O.O.3d 110, 112, 385 N.E.2d 1305, 1307. Indeed, the typical policy definition of an \u201coccurrence\u201d includes terms that indicate that the \u201caccident * * * results in injury or damage which the insured did not intend or expect.\u201d <em>Hybud Equip. Corp., supra, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 666, 597 N.E.2d at 1102. Although the American States\u2019 policy definition is less extensive, we construe \u201coccurrence\u201d here in the same fashion: an accident that the insured did not intend or expect. If Alverda harbored the lion, we conclude that her actions would constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d according to the policy provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">For the Kimberlys to survive summary judgment, we must find that they have raised a genuine issue of material fact on the question of whether the policy extends coverage to its insured upon the allegations of this unfortunate incident. See <em>Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. v. Thompson </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 78, 80, 23 OBR 208, 209, 491 N.E.2d 688, 690 (insurer has duty to defend when allegations of complaint bring action within policy coverage). We believe this entails two separate analyses: (1) whether, based on the evidence presented by the appellants, a genuine issue is raised regarding Alverda\u2019s liability for the lion attack; and, (2) if so, whether as a matter of law, any policy exclusion relieves American States of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">If an issue exists as to Alverda\u2019s potential liability, it must arise upon a showing that she was a harborer of the lion, which the Kimberlys alleged her to be in their underlying complaint. At common law, a harborer of \u201ca wild animal * * * is subject to the same liability as if he were in possession of it.\u201d 3 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1977) 24, Section 514. A \u201charborer\u201d of an animal is distinguished from an \u201cowner\u201d or a \u201ckeeper\u201d because \u201c \u2018[i]n determining whether a person is a \u201charborer\u201d * * * the focus shifts from possession and control over the [animal] to possession and control of the premises where the [animal] lives.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flint v. Holbrook </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 21, 25, 608 N.E.2d 809, 812, quoting <em>Godsey v. Franz </em>(Mar. 13, 1992), Williams App. No. 91WM000008, unreported, 1992 WL 48532, jurisdictional motion overruled (1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 1443, 596 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>N.E.2d 473. \u201cThus, a harborer is one who has possession and control of the premises where the [animal] lives, and silently acquiesces to the [animal\u2019s] presence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Sengel v. Maddox </em>(C.P.1945), 31 O.O. 201, 16 Ohio Supp. 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We are aware that Comment <em>a </em>to the Restatement may be read to preclude liability as a harborer in some situations. The comment points out that, typically, liability turns on whether the animal is brought into the harborer\u2019s household. See 3 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1977) 24-25, Section 514, Comment <em>a. </em>In this instance, we do not follow that rationale. Although Section 514 applies to harborers of wild or \u201cabnormally dangerous domestic animal[s],\u201d the comment raises hypothetical situations involving dogs. At common law, knowledge of a dog\u2019s dangerous propensities is a prerequisite to liability as an owner, keeper, or harborer. See <em>McAuliffe v. W. States Import Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 534, 537, 651 N.E.2d 957, 959; <em>Bora v. Kerchelich </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St.3d 146, 147, 2 OBR 692, 692, 443 N.E.2d 509, 510; <em>Hayes v. Smith </em>(1900), 62 Ohio St. 161, 56 N.E. 879, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Flint, </em>80 Ohio App.3d at 26, 608 N.E.2d at 812. Where wild animals, such as lions, are involved, the common law imposes strict liability upon owners, keepers, or harborers, following <em>Rylands v. Fletcher </em>(1868), L.R. 3 H.L. 330. <em>Morrison v. Nolan Amusement Co. </em>(May 1, 1985), Muskingum App. No. CA-84-31, unreported, 1985 WL 9216 (Turpin, J., dissenting). \u201cNo member of such a species, however domesticated, can ever be regarded as safe, and liability does not rest upon any experience with the particular animal.\u201d Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5 Ed.1984) 542, Section 76. Therefore, since knowledge of a wild animal\u2019s vicious tendencies is presumed, nothing is added by requiring a harborer to gain personal experience with the animal by bringing it into the harborer\u2019s household. Mere acquiescence to the animal\u2019s presence on the premises is sufficient for a harborer\u2019s liability to attach. Cf. <em>Hayes, </em>62 Ohio St. at 183, 56 N.E. at 882 (\u201cOne may thus negligently keep and harbor a vicious dog, knowing him to be such, without being the owner of the animal; and he may thus keep and harbor a vicious dog without even owning or controlling the premises where he may be kept, and he may be chargeable with notice of the viciousness of the dog through his neglect to take notice of its vicious habits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">First of all, we conclude that Alverda is not entitled to coverage for medical payments pursuant to Section Two of the policy. The policy terms provide medical payments \u201cif the \u2018bodily injury\u2019 * * * is caused by an animal owned by or in the care of an \u2018insured.\u2019 \u201d The Kimberlys complaint charged that Alverda \u201callowed [Jerry and Ronald] to keep and harbor a wild lion on the premises and failed to take any action to remove the lion from said premises.\u201d The Kimberlys do not assert, nor do they present any evidence to show, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Alverda was an owner or keeper of the lion. Coupled with our finding that Jerry is not an \u201cinsured,\u201d there is no question but that the lion was not owned or cared for by an insured. The trial court providently granted summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">However, we find that the appellants have presented a genuine issue of material fact regarding Alverda\u2019s liability as a harborer. The evidence, construed in favor of the Kimberlys, shows that Alverda acquired the Brown County farm in 1978; thirty-seven acres of the land are farmed by a tenant farmer; the farm property is improved with a residence, barn, and some outbuildings; Alverda visits the property regularly; Alverda permitted Jerry and Ronald, at their request, to keep horses there; Jerry kept one lion and two tigers in chain-link cages on the property; and Jerry built five cages, measuring twenty-five by fifty by twelve feet to house the cats.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Alverda testified that she had no independent knowledge of the wild animals that Jerry owned and kept on the farm property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">\u201c[THOMAS JENKS, Plaintiffs Counsel]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">\u201c * * * Jerry had some exotic type animals down there; some tigers and a lion; is that your understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">\u201c[ALVERDA]: I understand he did, but I never was down there enough actually to know what he had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">\u201cQ. I take it you never saw them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">\u201cQ. They were not your animals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-13\">\u201cA. No, they weren\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-14\">\u201cQ. Those were Jerry\u2019s tigers and Jerry\u2019s lion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-15\">\u201cA. Whatever he had there were his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-16\">\u201cQ. And they were not your animals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-17\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-18\">\u201cQ. Did you have any interest in those animals of a financial way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-19\">\u201cA. No, because I didn\u2019t know exactly what he had down there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-20\">\u201cQ. Did you have any control over those animals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-21\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-22\">She also testified that Jerry did not ask her permission to keep the cats on her property, as he had with his horse; Jerry originally told her the cages were built <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>to house ostriches; she saw the support posts for the cages, but never saw the cages themselves; and she never heard any unusual noises.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In response, the Kimberlys submitted affidavits from neighbors of Alverda\u2019s farm. The neighbors testified that Alverda visited her farm \u201cregularly almost every weekend since before 1992\u201d and that they were aware of the presence of lions and tigers on the premises because (1) for two years prior to the attack, they could hear the cats from their residence; and (2) one neighbor was on Alverda\u2019s farm approximately three months prior to the mauling and was able to \u201cobserve large cats,\u201d although he was unable because of his distance from the cages, to determine whether the cats were lions or tigers.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Jerry testified that his lion did not attack Lee John Kimberly. In addition to Jerry\u2019s assertion that there are other \u201ccat compounds\u201d in the vicinity of Alverda\u2019s farm, he claimed that he had no wild cats at the time of the attack. He stated that his lion died more than a year prior to the incident and that his tigers died three months before the attack. The appellants presented affidavits of the Brown County Sheriff and a deputy sheriff. The officers testified that they responded to the report of the mauling; while the deputy was at the scene, Ronald arrived with a tranquilizer gun and \u201cstated that it was his brother\u2019s lion\u201d; when Ronald\u2019s attempt to tranquilize the lion failed, the officers killed it; Ronald became \u201cirate\u201d and \u201chostile\u201d; the officers visited Alverda\u2019s farm one or two days later; the deputy observed the caged area, saw a dead chicken which had been there \u201ca day or so\u201d and \u201cquite a bit of fur around the cage\u201d; the lion the officers killed \u201chad most of its mane gone\u201d; the deputy believed an animal or animals had been in the cage within the prior forty-eight hours; both officers saw a \u201chole\u201d or \u201cseparation\u201d in the caged area, \u201cabout the width of a lion\u2019s body\u201d; the cages were located between one hundred and three hundred feet behind the house; and there was a clear view of the cages from the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">We conclude that this evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding Alverda\u2019s liability as a harborer of the lion. Our review of the evidence indicates that reasonable minds could differ upon whether Alverda permitted or acquiesced in the lion\u2019s presence on her farm. We also find that the Kimberlys have raised a triable question on the issue of whose lion attacked the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The key remaining issue is whether the policy\u2019s coverage exclusion of liability coverage for \u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 * * * arising out of a premises * * * owned by an \u2018insured\u2019 * * * that is not an \u2018insured location\u2019 \u201d is applicable to deny coverage based upon these facts. The appellants argue that the exclusionary language should be interpreted to require a direct, causal link between the injury and some condition upon the land before American States can deny coverage. The Kimberlys claim the exclusion is not effective because the injury can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>attributed directly to Alverda\u2019s alleged negligence, and not to any condition upon the land. The appellee urges us to construe the provision as being effective because of a direct, causal connection between the injury and the alleged harboring of the lion upon, and the lion\u2019s escape from, the farm property; in other words, the injury arose out of the premises because that is where Jerry purportedly caged the lion. Furthermore, American States argues that the risks associated with ownership of a farm sixty to seventy miles distant from the insured premises could not have been within the bargain agreed to by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Both sides have directed us to cases, primarily from our sister jurisdictions, in support of their positions. While there are no Ohio cases on all fours, the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals construed a somewhat analogous policy exclusion in <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Turner </em>(1986), 29 Ohio App.3d 73, 29 OBR 83, 503 N.E.2d 212. <em>Turner </em>involved a wrongful death action filed against the estate of the insured. The court of appeals reversed a finding of summary judgment in favor of the insurer because it found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the allegedly tortious conduct by the insured arose out of the \u201c \u2018ownership, maintenance or use of the real * * * property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 29 OBR at 87, 503 N.E.2d at 217. \u201c \u2018Arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the real * * * property\u2019 generally means \u2018flowing from\u2019 or \u2018having its origin in.\u2019 The phrase generally indicates a causal connection with the insured property, not that the insured premises be the proximate cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph four of the syllabus. See <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 37 Ohio App.3d 199, 525 N.E.2d 508, at paragraph two of the syllabus, motion to certify overruled (Sept. 2, 1987), No. 87-941, unreported (causal connection, not proximate cause, must exist between accident or injury and \u201cownership, maintenance or use\u201d of insured\u2019s vehicle, when construing automobile insurance policy covering damages \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or use\u201d of insured\u2019s vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The Kimberlys rely primarily on <em>Lititz Mut. Ins. Co. v. Branch </em>(Mo.App.1977), 561 S.W.2d 371, in support of their interpretation of the exclusionary language. In <em>Branch, </em>the insured\u2019s dog bit a girl while it was tethered on the insured\u2019s business property \u2014 property that was not covered by the terms of the insured\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy. Although the policy provided liability coverage for an \u201coccurrence,\u201d the insurer won a declaratory judgment in the trial court based on a policy exclusion for \u201cbodily injury or property damage arising out of any premises, other than an insured premises, owned, rented or controlled by any insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372, fn. 1. The appellate court reversed, finding that \u201c * * * \u2018premises\u2019 in common parlance and in the policy itself contemplates the land and more or less permanently affixed structures contained thereon. It does not contemplate easily moveable property which may be located on the property at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>given time or even on <em>a </em>regular or permanent basis. A dog, whether permanently kenneled or tethered on the property, is not a part of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">\u201cIt cannot therefore be said that a dog bite arises out of \u2014 originates from, grows out of, or flows from \u2014 the premises. That it occurs upon the premises does not establish a causal connection between the bite and the premises. We find that the language used does not contemplate that the exclusion applies to liability arising from a dog bite occurring on the * * * business property. * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The court found that the policy provided two types of liability coverage: \u201cfirst, that liability which may be incurred because of the condition of the premises insured; secondly, that liability incurred by the insured personally because of his tortious personal conduct, not otherwise excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374. The court noted the policy limited the geographic scope of the former coverage, but did not so limit the latter coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">\u201c * * * There appears to be little reason to exclude personal tortious conduct occurring on owned but uninsured land, as little correlation exists between such conduct and the land itself. Liability for injuries caused by an animal owned by an insured arises from the insured\u2019s personal tortious conduct in harboring a vicious animal, not from any condition of the premises upon which the animal may be located. * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>Accord <em>MFA Mut. Ins. Co. v. Nye </em>(Mo.App.1980), 612 S.W.2d 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">In <em>Lanoue v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Am. Ins. Cos. </em>(Minn.1979), 278 N.W.2d 49, a minor employee of the insured\u2019s grocery store broke into the insured\u2019s locked office and took one of several bottles of whiskey that the insured had received as Christmas gifts from suppliers, but had not yet taken home. Later that night, another minor drank some of the stolen liquor and was involved in a subsequent traffic accident. Neither Lanoue\u2019s business liability insurer nor the provider of his homeowner\u2019s policy agreed to defend against the dram shop complaint filed against him. Fireman\u2019s Fund claimed an exception under its homeowner\u2019s policy for \u201cbodily injury or property damage arising out of any premises, other than an insured premises, owned, rented or controlled by any insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53. The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed a declaratory judgment in favor of Fireman\u2019s Fund based, in part, upon its construction of Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s \u201cother premises\u201d exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">\u201cThis court * * * has considered the \u2018arising out of language in other contexts and concluded that causation is implied. * * * Thus, the premises must bear some causal relationship to the liability. Such a relationship is apparent when a claimant trips over improperly maintained steps. In this case, however, causation is more difficult to perceive. The fact that something occurs at a place is not sufficient by itself to imply causation as to that place. It is more appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>under the facts of this case to focus on the personal property \u2014 the whiskey \u2014 as being allegedly carelessly possessed by Lanoue at his office. Thus the liability is causally related to the whiskey, not the premises involved!\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 54.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The Kimberlys also cite <em>Eyler v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(Ky.1992), 824 S.W.2d 855. <em>Eyler </em>involved farm property upon which the owner stored more than a million used vehicle tires. The owner conveyed the property to the insured, who attempted to clean the property by hiring an individual to roll the tires around a building and down a hill on the property. During the process, Eyler was struck and sustained serious injuries. She sued the insured. The insured sought coverage and defense from Nationwide through his homeowner\u2019s policy, but the insurer declined. Subsequently, the insured assigned his rights to Eyler, who recovered judgment against Nationwide. The court of appeals reversed, finding that an exclusion \u201cfor an occurrence \u2018arising out of premises owned or rented to an insured but not an insured location,\u2019 \u201d defeated coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 857. The Kentucky Supreme Court reversed, holding that \u201cthis [exclusion] suggests the necessity for a causal connection between the premises and the injury. Ordinarily, \u2018arising out of does not mean merely occurring on or slightly connected with but connotes the need for a direct consequence or responsible condition. As we view it, to satisfy the \u2018arising out of exclusion in the policy, it would be necessary to show that the premises, apart from the insured\u2019s conduct thereon, was causally related to the occurrence. While most of the endeavors of mankind occur upon the surface of the earth and without it, harm could not occur, the law nevertheless imposes liability for negligent personal conduct upon the recognition that, in most cases, human behavior is the primary cause of the harm and the condition of the earth only secondary.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The court agreed with <em>Branch </em>that the \u201cdichotomy of causation between negligent personal conduct and dangerous condition of the premises\u201d was dispositive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The appellee counters by citing a trio of cases in support of its construction of its \u201coff premises\u201d exclusion. In <em>Natl. Farmers Union Prop. &amp; Cas. Co. v. W. Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(Utah 1978), 577 P.2d 961, a horse escaped from a sheriffs department\u2019s mounted patrol drill grounds when a fence gate was left open by the patrol captain. The horse wandered onto a highway and was struck by a vehicle, causing serious injury to a passenger in the vehicle. The department was covered by the plaintiff insurer\u2019s liability coverage policy, which named the captain, as the executive officer, as the insured. The captain also carried a homeowner\u2019s policy, issued by the defendant insurer. The plaintiff settled and sought contribution from the defendant. The defendant refused contribution, and relied on a homeowner\u2019s policy exclusion for \u201cbodily injury or property damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>arising out of any premises, other than an insured premises, owned, rented, or controlled by any insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 962. Affirming summary judgment for the defendant, the Utah Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\u201cThe active force leading to injury in plaintiff\u2019s complaint was an escaping horse. The term \u2018escape\u2019 connotes a removal from a geographical location caused by a loss of control by the one responsible for confinement. To confine the animal to the drill field, there was an enclosure around the uninsured premises. Captain Story\u2019s alleged negligence was his failure to close the gate and thus prevent the escape. The alleged acts arose from, originated, and were connected with the uninsured premises, and the exclusion in his homeowner\u2019s policy was applicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The Minnesota Supreme Court, in <em>Arndt v. Am. Family Ins. Co. </em>(Minn.1986), 394 N.W.2d 791, found the insurer was entitled to summary judgment based on an exclusion in its \u201cfarm family liability policy.\u201d The plaintiff was injured while helping the insured unload frozen cornstalks from a \u201cchopper box.\u201d The farm property upon which he was injured was not covered under the terms of the liability policy. The insurer claimed an exclusion for \u201cany bodily injury or property damages: * * * arising out of the ownership, use or control by or rental to any insured of any premises, other than insured premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 794. The trial court granted summary judgment for the insurer, but the court of appeals reversed, based upon <em>Lanoue, supra. </em>The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed, and distinguished <em>Lanoue:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\u201cApplying <em>Lanoue, </em>the Court of Appeals found that Jeffrey Arndt\u2019s injuries arose out of Ronald Kieffer\u2019s negligent use of the chopper box, rather than his ownership, use, or control of the property. <em>Lanoue </em>is factually distinguishable, however. In <em>Lanoue, </em>we did not look to the causal relation between Lanoue\u2019s liability and his ownership, use or control of the superette because the exclusion did not contain those words. The court instead focused on whether a causal relation existed between Lanoue\u2019s liability and the premises to satisfy the terms \u2018arising out of the premises.\u2019 In contrast, exclusion 1(d) applies to injuries arising out of Kieffer\u2019s <em>acts of </em>ownership, use or control of uninsured premises. It is clear that defendant would not have been negligently using the chopper box on New Year\u2019s Day but for his desire to provide bedding for the barn located on the uninsured * * * property. The task of providing bedding for the barn is a part of Kieffer\u2019s ownership and use of the * * * property. We conclude that a causal relation exists between Kieffer\u2019s liability and his ownership, use and control of the uninsured premises, and that exclusion 1(d) therefore bars recovery against American.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 794-795.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The appellee also relies on a case cited by the <em>Arndt </em>court: <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(W.D.Va.1980), 501 F.Supp. 136. Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Company of North America (\u201cINA\u201d) issued a liability policy to the joint owners of vacation property, with a liability limit of one hundred thousand dollars. INA also issued separate homeowner\u2019s policies on the owners\u2019 respective residences. St. Paul was the excess insurer on the jointly owned property. The owners burned an outbuilding on the vacation property to remove it. The fire spread to the property of adjoining landowners and caused a quarter-million dollars in damage. INA paid to its limits under the vacation property policy, and St. Paul paid the excess. St. Paul sought indemnification from INA under the insureds\u2019 homeowner\u2019s policies, claiming that an exception for \u201cbodily injury or property damage arising out of any premises, other than an insured premises, owned, rented or controlled by any insured * * * \u201d did not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 138. The court disagreed, and found that the exception barred indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\u201cWithout defining its outer perimeter, the phrase is certainly broad enough to encompass a fire which spreads from a building on the premises to adjoining land. Accordingly, the insureds\u2019 liability <em>arose out </em>of their * * * premises. Second, the court finds St. Paul\u2019s suggested interpretation of the phrase \u2018arising out of to be unreasonable. St. Paul argues that it was the insureds\u2019 negligence which led to their liability and not some condition of the premises. Obviously, except in cases of strict liability, liability has to be predicated upon a violation of a duty or standard of care. St. Paul must mean, therefore, that a condition of the premises which has resulted from negligence must form the basis of the insureds\u2019 liability for the exclusion to apply. That interpretation, however, reads a term into the exclusion not put there by the insurer. Had INA intended to exclude only bodily injury or property damage resulting from a <em>condition </em>of the premises, it could have so stated. Instead, INA used the more encompassing phrase\u2014 \u2018arising out of,\u2019 and the court is constrained to give the phrase its established meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\"><em>U </em>* * &gt;{;</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">\u201cContrary to St. Paul\u2019s major premise, the facts of the present case do establish a causal nexus between the premises and the insureds\u2019 negligence giving rise to liability. There would have been no fire but for the building which the insureds desired to remove. Accordingly, the insureds\u2019 liability resulting from the fire arose out of their * * * premises.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic). Id. </em>at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">American States finds support in these cases for its claim that, <em>if </em>there had been no farm property, there would have been no lion, no escape, and no injury to Lee John Kimberly. Hence, the appellee claims, the injury arose out of the property and the exclusion applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Appellee attempts to distinguish <em>Branch </em>and <em>Eyler, supra. </em>American States asserts that the key difference in <em>Branch </em>is that the dog bite occurred on the uninsured premises. According to the appellee, if the dog had escaped from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>premises, \u201cany ensuing damages would have had a causal connection to the uninsured premises\u201d and the <em>\u201coff </em>premises\u201d exclusion would have applied. American States argues that <em>Eyler </em>is inapposite because \u201cthe premises had nothing to do with the loss; rather, the loss had its sole roots in the carelessness of the employee and the manner in which he rolled the tires down the hill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">We are persuaded that the appellants\u2019 position is the proper one in determining the construction of this exception. We are mindful that, as a corollary to the premise that ambiguous insurance contract language is interpreted in favor of the insured, \u201cin construing exceptions, \u2018a general presumption arises to the effect that that which is not clearly excluded from the operation of [the] contract is included\u2019 in its operation.\u201d <em>Weaver v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 836, 839, 577 N,E.2d 703, 705, citing <em>Home Indemn. Co. v. Plymouth </em>(1945), 146 Ohio St. 96, 32 O.O. 30, 64 N.E.2d 248, at paragraph two of the syllabus, motion to certify record overruled (1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 711, 545 N.E.2d 906. We are convinced that the weight of authority construing identical or similar \u201coff premises\u201d exclusions recognizes the \u201cdichotomy of causation between negligent personal conduct and dangerous condition of the premises\u201d spoken of by the <em>Eyler </em>court, <em>supra, </em>824 S.W.2d at 857. These jurisdictions believe that the \u201ckey factor\u201d determinative of the applicability of this exclusion \u201crelates to the <em>condition </em>of the uninsured premises and not to tortious acts committed thereon.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Marshall v. Fair </em>(1992), 187 W.Va. 109, 112, 416 S.E.2d 67, 70. See, <em>e.g., Sea Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co. </em>(S.D.N.Y.1994), 849 F.Supp. 221, affirmed (C.A.2, 1995), 51 F.3d 22; <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Hale </em>(Cal.App.1983), 140 Cal.App.3d 347, 189 Cal.Rptr. 463; <em>Hanson v. Gen. Acc. Fire &amp; Life Ins. Corp., Ltd. </em>(Fla.Dist.App.1984), 450 So.2d 1260; <em>Economy Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Green </em>(1985), 139 Ill.App.3d 147, 93 Ill.Dec. 656, 487 N.E.2d 100; <em>Kitchens v. Brown </em>(La.App.1989), 545 So.2d 1310; <em>Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Heroux </em>(R.I.1988), 549 A.2d 265; <em>Marshall, supra; Newhouse v. Laidig, Inc. </em>(App.1988), 145 Wis.2d 236, 426 N.W.2d 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The Kimberlys allege that Alverda negligently harbored Jerry\u2019s lion. This assertion does not implicate any condition upon the land as a direct, causal link to the injury; rather, it looks to Alverda\u2019s alleged tortious conduct in not taking adequate precautions to prevent the lion\u2019s escape. We agree with the <em>Branch </em>court\u2019s comment that, had American States desired to limit the geographic scope of its coverage for personal tortious conduct, it expressly could have done so. In this case, as in <em>Branch, </em>the insurer did not insert any such limiting language.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The cases offered in support by American States do not persuade us. The court in <em>Natl. Farmers Union Prop. &amp; Cas. Co., supra, </em>noted that the horse\u2019s escape was caused by the captain\u2019s negligence in failing to confine the animal, but then held that the escape arose from the premises. We simply disagree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>court\u2019s integration of personal tortious conduct and conditions upon the premises upon the facts of that case. As the <em>Arndt </em>court itself mentioned, the exclusionary language in that case differs from the terms at issue here, in that Alverda\u2019s policy does not mention the use of the property; we conclude that the <em>Lanoue </em>case provides a closer analogy. The courts in <em>Marshall </em>and <em>Newhouse </em>considered the decision in <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., supra, </em>to be \u201caberrational and * * * \u2018inconsistent\u2019\u201d with strict interpretation of exclusionary language against the insurer. <em>Marshall, supra, </em>187 W.Va. at 114, 416 S.E.2d at 72, quoting <em>Newhouse, supra, </em>145 Wis.2d at 241, 426 N.W.2d at 91. We agree and reject the result in <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, we hold that the exclusion of coverage for \u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 * * * arising out of a premises * * * owned by an \u2018insured\u2019 * * * that is not an \u2018insured location\u2019 \u201d refers to the condition of the uninsured premises and does not exclude coverage for the insured\u2019s alleged tortious acts on the uninsured premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Because the Kimberlys have raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding Alverda\u2019s status as a harborer of the lion, and because we find that American States\u2019 \u201coff premises\u201d exclusion does not apply as a matter of law, we sustain the appellants\u2019 first assignment of error in part. We conclude that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of American States on the issue of personal liability coverage but properly granted summary judgment for American States on the issue of medical coverage. We overrule the Kimberlys\u2019 second assignment of error, however, because triable questions remain on the issue of Alv\u00e9rda\u2019s alleged harboring of the lion. We conclude that the trial court did not err when it denied summary judgment for the Kimberlys.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court in part and remand this case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b600-8\">Fain, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b600-9\">Grady, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-12\">. The district court in <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., supra, </em>implied that it might have held the exclusion ineffective had it been faced with an issue of strict liability. See <em>id., </em>501 F.Supp. at 139. We note that, although an issue of Alverda\u2019s strict liability as a harborer might have been raised by the Kimberlys in their underlying complaint, they chose to limit their theories of liability to negligence, gross negligence and/or wanton conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b600-10\">Grady, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Add\">concurring and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">I respectfully dissent from the decision of the majority sustaining the second assignment of error. I would affirm the summary judgment for appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>American States Insurance Company because its policy with appellant Alverda Guillermin creates no coverage for Guillermin with respect to the claims alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">A policy of liability insurance imposes a duty on the insurer to defend and indemnify the insured against claims of third persons for injuries and losses that arise out of an insured risk, occurrence of which creates potential legal liability for the insured. The insurer\u2019s duty of \u201ccoverage\u201d is therefore determined in the first instance by the occurrence of a risk identified in the policy, not by the potential liability of the insured resulting from it. See 43 American Jurisprudence 2d (1982), Insurance, Section 703.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">Section II of the policy before us provides coverage for claims against an insured for personal injury or property damage and for necessary medical expenses caused by an occurrence to which the coverage applies. The Exclusions Clause within that Section states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">\u201cCoverage E \u2014 Personal Liability and Coverage F \u2014 Medical Payments to Others do not apply to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">\u201ce. arising out of a premises:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">\u201c(1) owned by an \u2018insured\u2019 * * * that is not an \u2018insured location\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">The definitions section of the policy states that \u201c \u2018insured location\u2019 means * * * e. vacant land, other than farm land, owned by or rented to an \u2018insured\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">Whether an injury and the claims of legal liability it creates \u201carise out of\u2019 a location is determined by the causal connection between the property and the injury alleged. <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Turner </em>(1986), 29 Ohio App.3d 73, 29 OBR 83, 503 N.E,2d 212. The test is functional, therefore, and does not involve a concept of fault, though fault is necessarily involved in the negligent act or omission from which the landowner\u2019s legal liability results. With respect to the occurrence that triggers the duty of coverage, therefore, the conduct of the insured is irrelevant. The only relevant inquiry is whether the chain of events resulting in the injury alleged was unbroken by the intervention of any event unrelated to the land or its particular use.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">According to the allegations involved in this claim, Alverda Guillermin was negligent in allowing a lion to be kept on her land without taking adequate precautions against its escape. She is potentially liable for the injuries which Lee John Kimberley suffered as a proximate result, whether that liability results from a hazardous condition on the land or her tortious acts or omissions. In either event, however, American States has no duty of coverage under the policy because Lee John Kimberly\u2019s injuries are the direct result of an \u201coccurrence\u201d arising out of farm land for which coverage is expressly excluded under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>I would overrule the second assignment of error on the foregoing analysis. I concur with Judge Brogan\u2019s decision overruling the first assignment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
