(\u201cConcord\u201d) appeals from the dismissal of its appeal by the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, from a decision by the Industrial Commission of Ohio (\u201cICO\u201d) denying Concord\u2019s application for handicap reimbursement under R.C. 4123.343. Pursuant to R.C. 4123.519 (amended and recodified at R.C. 4123.512), for its appeal below Concord named as parties the appellees herein: the claimant, Michael S. York, Sr., and the administrator of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cbureau\u201d). Upon the bureau\u2019s motion, the trial court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear Concord\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Concord employed York on all dates relevant to his claim. York filed a claim with the bureau in 1987 for an employment-related injury. The bureau allowed the claim based on the diagnosed condition of \u201cchronic low back pain, mild L-5, S-l degenerative disk disease, bulging disk disease, L-4-5, S-l, left S-l radiculopathy.\u201d Subsequently, York filed an occupational disease claim, citing \u201cherniated nucleus pulposus L5-S1, degenerative disc disease L5-S1, bulging disc disease L4-5 &amp; L5-S1, chronic low back pain\u201d as the nature of the disease. On May 8, 1992, Concord filed an application for handicap reimbursement with the ICO. The appellant asserted that York\u2019s occupational disease aggravated a preexisting disability, arthritis. See R.C. 4123.343(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">An ICO staff hearing officer denied Concord\u2019s application. The officer found that \u201cthe evidence on file shows only a pre-existing degenerative disc disease which is not found to be pre-existing arthritis.\u201d Concord brought an appeal to the ICO, which affirmed the officer\u2019s decision. Concord appealed ICO\u2019s decision to the trial court on October 20,1993. The appellant filed a motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>judgment to which the bureau responded with a combined memorandum in opposition and motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Based on the authority of <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175, the court agreed that it was devoid of subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed the case. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Concord assigns one error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred, as a matter of law, by dismissing appellant\u2019s claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Concord maintains that the relevant underlying issue in this case concerns its right to participate in the State Surplus Fund, created under R.C. 4123.34(B) as a branch of the State Insurance Fund, from which handicap reimbursements are disbursed. R.C. 4123.343(B). Therefore, according to the appellant, its appeal is proper under R.C. 4123.512. The bureau argues that only final ICO decisions that are determinative of a <em>claimant\u2019s </em>right to participate or continue to participate in the State Insurance Fund may be appealed to a common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The General Assembly enacted the handicap reimbursement program to encourage employers \u201cto employ and retain in their employment handicapped employees as defined in this section.\u201d R.C. 4123.343. Under the statute, employers are eligible for total or partial reimbursement for \u201ccompensation and benefits paid to a claimant where (1) the injury or occupational disease would not have occurred but for the pre-existing condition, or (2) the disability arising from an industrial injury was caused at least in part through aggravation of the preexisting condition.\u201d <em>State ex rel. First Natl. Supermarkets, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 582, 584, 639 N.E.2d 1185, 1188, citing R.C. 4123.343(D)(1) and (2). One of the qualifying pre-existing conditions is arthritis. R.C. 4123.343(A)(4). Reimbursement to the employer is a substantive right, <em>State ex rel. Am. Seaway Foods, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 50, 52, 577 N.E.2d 1085, 1086, that vests \u201cwhen the Industrial Commission determines a causal relationship between the handicap and the injury or disability which entitles the employer to handicap reimbursement for that claim[,]\u201d <em>Columbus &amp; S. Ohio Elec. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 119, 592 N.E.2d 1367, paragraph one of the syllabus. Here, the ICO determined that no nexus existed between York\u2019s occupational disease and his preexisting arthritic condition and the commission denied reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">Concord claims that it followed the procedures governing administrative appeals provided in R.C. 4123.511 and properly brought its appeal to the court below according to R.C. 4123.512. See R.C. 4123.511(E) (ICO orders are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>appealable to common pleas court pursuant to R.C. 4123.512). The pertinent portion of the statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">\u201cThe claimant or the employer may appeal an order of the industrial commission made under division (E) of section 4123.511 [formerly division (B)(6) of section 4121.35] of the Revised Code in any injury or occupational disease case, other than a decision as to the extent of disability, to the court of common pleas * * *.\u201d R.C. 4123.512(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The Supreme Court previously granted similar wording in R.C. 4123.519 broad application to permit appeal of any decision except those concerning the extent of disability. <em>Seabloom Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Co. v. Mayfield </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 108, 110-111, 519 N.E.2d 358, 360-361, overruled by <em>Afrates, supra; State ex rel. O.M. Scott &amp; Sons Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 341, 343, 28 OBR 406, 408, 503 N.E.2d 1032, 1034, overruled by <em>Afrates, supra. </em>Of late, however, the court has narrowed the interpretation of this language to permit appeal only of those ICO decisions \u201cthat are final and that resolve an employee\u2019s right to participate or to continue to participate in the State Insurance Fund.\u201d <em>Felty v. AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 234, 238, 602 N.E.2d 1141, 1145. Accord <em>Afrates, </em>63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175, at paragraph one of the syllabus. An appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction may not be invoked on direct appeal unless the ICO order \u201cfinalizes the allowance or disallowance of the employee\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 236, 238, 594 N.E.2d 609, 611. Decisions subsequent to the disposition of the claimant\u2019s right to participation, save for an order terminating that right, are not appealable. <em>Felty, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 240, 602 N.E.2d at 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The potential for payment to the employer under the handicap reimbursement program necessarily does not arise before the ICO allows the employee\u2019s claim. The former version of R.C. 4123.343, effective at the time Concord filed its application, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">\u201cApplication for a determination shall only be made in cases where a handicapped employee as defined in this section or his dependents <em>claims or is receiving an award of compensation </em>as a result of an injury or occupational disease occurring or contracted on or after the date on which division (A) of this section first included the handicap of such employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4123.343(C).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The statute mandated that the commission\u2019s determination of the amount of compensation, if any, to be charged to the State Surplus Fund could not occur before the commission awarded compensation to the employee. See R.C. 4123.343(D). Considering the foregoing and the fact that the employer\u2019s right to reimbursement may not vest prior to the commission\u2019s finding of a causal link <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>between the handicap and the injury or disability which serves as the basis for the award of compensation, it is plain that the commission\u2019s threshold determination of the employee\u2019s right to participate in the insurance fund must precede its decision whether to grant reimbursement to the employer. Therefore, we conclude that an ICO decision granting or denying an employer\u2019s application for handicap reimbursement pursuant to R.C. 4123.343 is not appealable to a common pleas court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The facts of the instant case reveal that the trial court providently dismissed the cause for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Concord filed its application for reimbursement on May 8, 1992, subsequent to the commission\u2019s allowance of York\u2019s claim. Under controlling Supreme Court precedent, <em>Felty </em>and <em>Afrates, supra, </em>the ICO\u2019s allowance of York\u2019s claim was the only commission order appealable by Concord. Thus, we overrule the appellant\u2019s assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Concord argues that its position is analogous to that of a claimant because the ICO\u2019s decision denied it participation in the State Surplus Fund. Moreover, Concord maintains that the trial court erroneously read <em>Afrates </em>to \u201cexclude employers as the class who may appeal Industrial Commission decisions.\u201d In support of its latter contention, the appellant cites dicta from <em>Afrates </em>which states, \u201cThere may be times when a dispute does not involve a claimant but, rather, the dispute lies between an employer and the commission. Such a situation may arise in a handicap reimbursement case * * *.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id., </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 26, 584 N.E.2d at 1179. Since we believe that Concord is not a claimant as defined by the Supreme Court, and that the appellant has mischaracterized both the consequence of the <em>Afrates </em>holding and the context in which the quoted language appears, we disagree with its contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">We agree with Concord that its posture in this case is somewhat analogous to a claimant because it is seeking participation in the State Surplus Fund. That is where the analogy begins and ends, however. Concord\u2019s application to participate in the State Surplus Fund does not equate to a \u201cclaim\u201d that might provide the basis for an appeal. In <em>Felty, </em>the Supreme Court clarified the meaning of \u201cclaim\u201d in terms of an appealable commission order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>\u201cA \u2018claim\u2019 in a workers\u2019 compensation case is the basic or underlying request by an employee to participate in the compensation system because <em>of </em>a specific work-related injury or disease. A decision by the commission determines the employee\u2019s right to participate if it finalizes the allowance or disallowance of an employee\u2019s \u2018claim.\u2019 The only action by the commission that is appealable under R.C. 4123.51[2] is this essential decision to grant, to deny, or to terminate the employee\u2019s participation or continued participation in the system.\u201d <em>Felty, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 239, 602 N.E.2d at 1145.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The appellant is not a claimant in this case. <em>Afrates </em>and its progeny do not deprive employers of their right to appeal from appropriate ICO orders. By the plain words of the statute, employers and claimants are free to appeal commission decisions \u201cother than a decision as to the extent of disability.\u201d R.C. 4123.512(A). That the Supreme Court has limited appealable decisions to those which dispose of a claimant\u2019s participation in the insurance fund does not exclude either employers or claimants from direct appeal of proper orders. Moreover, \u201c[b]e-cause the workers\u2019 compensation system was designed to give employees an exclusive statutory remedy for work-related injuries, \u2018a litigant has no inherent right of appeal in this area.\u2019 \u201d <em>Felty, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 237, 602 N.E.2d at 1144, quoting <em>Cadle v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 28, 33, 74 O.O.2d 50, 52, 340 N.E.2d 403, 406, overruled on other grounds by <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 8, 30 OBR 16, 505 N.E.2d 975. Those rights of appeal enjoyed by litigants are conferred by statute and, limited though they may be, are in keeping with the purpose underlying the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">While not specifically stated in its brief, Concord apparently maintains that, upon \u201ccareful reading,\u201d the <em>Afrates </em>dicta would support an exception to the limitation on appeals for disputes between the employer and the commission. To the contrary, the cited language supports the board\u2019s stance. The court\u2019s comment came during its examination of the former procedural statute, R.C. 4123.519. The court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">\u201cThe purpose of R.C. 4123.519 is clear. The statute provides, in six separate places, that the issue presented by an R.C. 4123.519 appeal is the claimant\u2019s right to participate or continue to participate in the fund. For instance, the statute provides that it is the claimant who is required to file a petition \u2018 * * * showing a cause of action to participate or to continue to participate in the fund. * * *\u2019 There may be times when a dispute does not involve a claimant but,-rather, the dispute lies between an employer and the commission. Such a situation may arise in a handicap reimbursement case * * *. It would make little sense for the claimant, who is not a party to the action and who may be receiving benefits, to file a petition. Further, R.C. 4123.519 provides that the court, or the jury if demanded, \u2018 * * * shall determine the right of the <em>claimant </em>to participate in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>fund upon the evidence adduced at the hearing of such action.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4123.519 appeals are subject to <em>de novo </em>review. * * * The General Assembly could not possibly have intended that each and every decision of the commission be the subject of a <em>de novo </em>review. Requiring a <em>de novo </em>factual review of <em>all </em>decisions would only prolong a determination as to whether the claimant is entitled to participate\u2019 or continue to participate in the fund.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic. </em>and footnotes omitted.) <em>Afrates, supra, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 26, 584 N.E.2d at 1178-1179.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The court\u2019s discussion of handicap reimbursement points out that an ICO reimbursement decision could not be appealed because a claimant would not file a petition as required by the statute; the comments are not offered to create an exception to limited appeals. Furthermore, <em>de novo </em>review of a such an order would frustrate the purpose of the statute and the compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">This is not to say that an employer barred from appeal is without remedy. \u201cLitigants may seek judicial review of commission rulings in three ways: by direct appeal to the courts of common pleas under R.C. 4123.51[2], by filing a mandamus petition in this court or in the Franklin County Court of Appeals, or by an action for declaratory judgment pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2721.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Felty, supra, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 237, 602 N.E.2d at 1144. The appropriate procedural avenue depends on the nature of the commission\u2019s decision. <em>Id.; </em>see <em>State ex rel. Evans, supra, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 238, 594 N.E.2d at 610. In <em>State ex rel. Riser Foods, Inc. v. Trimble </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 259, 648 N.E.2d 1362, and <em>State ex rel. First Natl. Supermarkets, Inc., supra, </em>employers sought writs of mandamus to challenge, at least <em>inter alia, </em>the denial of handicap reimbursement. Also instructive are <em>State ex rel. McGinnis v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 81, 568 N.E.2d 665, and <em>Miraglia v. B.F. Goodrich Co. </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 128, 15 O.O.3d 163, 399 N.E.2d 1234, where the court held that mandamus was the proper remedy by which employers could seek setoffs against disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Having overruled the appellant\u2019s assignment of error, we affirm the judgment of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b716-9\">Wolff and Frederick N. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\">. The General Assembly amended R.C. 4123.343, effective October 20, 1993, in Am.Sub.H.B. No. 107. Among other changes, the legislature added subsection (H), which states, \"An order issued by the administrator pursuant to this section is appealable under section 4123.511 of the Revised Code but is not appealable to court under section 4123.512 of the Revised Code.\u201d This provision clearly precludes direct appeal as an available remedy to an employer under this section. We need not address the issue of the statute\u2019s retroactive application because of our holding in the case <em>sub judice; </em>nevertheless, we find this language helpful in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
