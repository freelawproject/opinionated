Hilton was filed in the Circuit Court of Loudoun County by Freddie F. Fayen, an infant, who sued \u201cby his father and next friend, Carl F. Fayen.\u201d The petition alleged that Jessie F. Hilton was indebted to the infant plaintiff in the sum of $4,389.64, which sum \u201cwas advanced to Mariana Field and the defendant, Jessie F. Hilton, co-partners, trading and doing business as \u2018Green Pastures\u2019.\u201d On July 2, process was issued and duly executed by levy on the property of Jessie F. Hilton and by service of the writ upon the defendant in her own proper person. The defendant filed an affidavit of substantial defense, and notified the plaintiff of that fact. On December 12, 1952, the plaintiff having failed to give bond within ten days from the service of such notice, the trial court on motion of the defendant dismissed the attachment; but retained the cause on the docket, without objection, as an action at law. Virginia Code, 1950, \u00a7 8-557.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">A bill of particulars was filed by the infant plaintiff, in which he stated that, in the year 1943, he had \u201cthrough his father, Carl F. Fayen, loaned to Mariana Field and the defendant, Jessie F. Hilton, co-partners trading and doing business as \u2018Green Pastures,\u2019 the sum of $4,389.64,\u201d and that the loan remained unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Defendant filed grounds of defense, denying that any funds of the infant were loaned to her as alleged in the bill of particulars. She averred that, in 1942, and subsequently, she, together with her husband, Homer Hilton, her daughter, Mariana Hilton Fayen, and Carl F. Fayen, who at that time was the husband of her said daughter, had purchased certain farm lands with the intention of operating them as a joint venture; that it was agreed by them to contribute equal amounts in the operation of said venture; and that she assumed that the funds advanced by Carl F. Fayen to the venture were his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>On January 8, 1953, the defendant moved the court in writing to add Carl F. Fayen as a party defendant to the action. She alleged that Carl F. Fayen, Homer Hilton, Jessie F. Hilton and Mariana Hilton Fayen were partners trading as \u201cGreen Pastures;\u201d that the partnership was dissolved in 1947; and that Carl F. Fayen had received his share of the partnership assets in full settlement of any and all claims against it; and that Carl F. Fayen \u201cis hable for any debts of said co-partnership to the same extent as this defendant.\u201d Carl F. Fayen filed a written reply asserting that the court was without jurisdiction to make him a third party defendant, (Rule of Court 3:9.1) and that the motion did not state a cause of action against him. No order was entered by the trial court dealing with this motion prior to the date of trial, September 8, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Freddie F. Fayen is the infant son of Carl F. Fayen and Mrs. Mariana Hilton (Fayen) Field, the former wife of Carl F. Fayen. Homer Hilton and Jessie F. Hilton, his wife, are the parents of Mrs. Field and the maternal grandparents of Freddie F. Fayen. At the time of the alleged loan of the infant\u2019s money, the two families, Fayen and Hilton, lived in the same house in Loudoun County. Mr. and Mrs. Hilton subsequently removed to California, and at the time of the institution of this action resided there.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">The proceedings at the trial will be set out somewhat in detail because of the confusion relating to the issues prior to the submission of the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Immediately after the jury had been sworn, Carl F. Fayen, by counsel, advised the court that, because he was partly responsible for lending the infant\u2019s funds, he was willing to be made a party defendant. Thereupon, counsel for the defendant said: \u201cI think the way it stands is all right.\u201d The court announced: \u201cI think, if we go ahead with it today that we should let the pleadings stand as they are.\u201d There was no objection or exception to this ruling, and the case proceeded to trial. In his statement to the jury, counsel for the defendant said: \u201cI represent Mrs. Hilton, who is the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>in this cause, and our defense is, merely, that there was no loan made to any partnership in which she had any interest, from the funds of Freddie F. Fayen to her knowledge. She never recognized or understood any obligation to this boy, and she denies any obligation to pay this sum or any part of it, as has been demanded by the plaintiff in this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Carl F. Fayen testified that he made two loans in May and August, 1943, to the partnership, one in the sum of $3,989.64, and another in the sum of $400, from funds belonging to his infant son, who was then three years of age; and that the loans had never been repaid. There were no notes or evidence of debt given to Fayen, but the books of the partnership showed receipt of the two amounts, with a notation that they were received as loans from Freddie Fayen.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">The money of the infant represented the proceeds of a gift from his paternal grandmother. The $3,989.64 was deposited in a bank to the joint account of Carl F. Fayen and Mariana H. Fayen. The $400, which came from interest thereon, was deposited in a special account in the name of Carl F. Fayen, which he said he held as trustee for his son. Two checks evidencing the loans were drawn payable to \u201cGreen Pastures,\u201d the larger one being signed by Mariana H. Fayen, and the smaller one drawn and signed by Mrs. Fayen in the name of \u201cCarl F. Fayen, trustee\u201d for the infant. Each check bore the endorsement, \u201cDeposit to account of Green Pastures.\u201d Mr. Fayen said he discussed the loan with each of the partners of \u201cGreen Pastures,\u201d and that each of them was fully aware of the fact that the money belonged to the infant, and they agreed to repay the infant from the profits of their joint venture. The infant had no legal trustee or guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, counsel for the defendant moved the court to strike the evidence on the ground that it was insufficient to prove a loan, and further, that the action should have been brought by Carl F. Fayen as guardian or trustee and not by the infant. A discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>ensued, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked counsel for defendant if he wanted to bring in all of the partners and make them parties. The court advised counsel for the defendant that it would do so if it was agreeable to him, and the latter replied: \u201cI stopped agreeing years ago, Your Honor.\u201d The court then said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be proper to strike the evidence on that ground. I think the remedy would be to add the other parties under the statute,\u201d (Code, \u00a7 8-96), to which counsel for defendant replied: \u201cWell, you see, the point I am pressed with is that you don\u2019t have the proper party plaintiff * * Again the court stated: \u201cI will do this, I will add these parties if you like, at this time.\u201d Counsel for plaintiff then said that they had been willing to add Carl F. Fayen as a party but had changed their minds because of the change of the position of the defendant. Thereupon the court overruled defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">The defendant then introduced her evidence, which clearly and convincingly showed that the infant\u2019s money was loaned to the partnership with the knowledge and acquiescence of each partner, and that they originally planned to repay the infant out of the profits of their joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">At the conclusion of defendant\u2019s evidence, her counsel made the following statement to the court: \u201cThis is at the completion of the case for the defendant. The defendant renews her motion previously made, that the court strike the evidence presented on behalf of the plaintiff, and that is all we will do.\u201d The plaintiff then moved to strike defendant\u2019s evidence. Both motions were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">The defendant inquired whether there would be any instructions. Counsel for plaintiff replied: \u201cI think we can give the court this instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">\u201cThe Court instructs the jury that partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts of a partnership, and the said loan has not been repaid, then you shall find your verdict for the plaintiff, in this action Freddie Fayen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Defendant\u2019s counsel said: \u201cThat would be about the only one I would want to put in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Plaintiff then suggested that the jury be further instructed as follows: \u201cThe Court further instructs the jury that, in view of all the evidence if you find there was not a loan, then you shall find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Counsel for defendant stated: \u201cI object to granting that latter part in keeping with my motion to strike. I contend that there is no evidence upon which a jury could determine that.\u201d The objection to the latter part of the proposed instruction was overruled, and the court then instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">\u201cThe Court instructs the jury that partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts of a partnership. If you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the sum of $4,-389.64, belonging to Freddie Fayen, an infant, was loaned to the partnership, and that said loan has not been repaid, then you shall find a verdict for the plaintiff in this action, Freddie Fayen.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">\u201cThe Court further instructs the jury that after consideration of all of the evidence in the case you believe it was not a loan you shall find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">After argument of counsel, the jury returned the following verdict: \u201cWe the jury upon the issues joined find for the plaintiff, Freddie Fayen, in the sum of $4,389.64.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">No motion was made for a new trial, that the verdict be set aside as contrary to the law, or as contrary to the evidence, or without evidence to support it. Judgment was entered for the infant, without objection or exception by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">Upon appeal the defendant assigns error to the action of the trial court in refusing to add Carl F. Fayen as a party defendant, in refusing to strike the evidence of the plaintiff, and in refusing to dismiss the action as having been improperly brought, because it was an action against an individual for a partnership debt. In his brief, he relies upon the last assignment only. Plaintiff, on the other hand, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>tends that the nature of the claim of the infant was such as to make the partners in the \u201cGreen Pastures\u201d venture jointly and severally liable. He contends that whenever several adults, constituting a partnership, appropriate an infant\u2019s funds to the use of their partnership, the law implies an obligation on the part of each person using such funds to repay the entire amount, relying upon Code, \u00a7 50-13, \u00a7 50-14(a) and \u00a7 50-15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">It will be remembered that the defendant first contended that no money of the infant was advanced to the partnership. She next contended that Carl F. Fayen should be joined as a party defendant because he was responsible for the funds of the infant. However, by her counsel she agreed that the proceeding continue against her alone. She made no proper objection or exception to the rulings of the court. She subsequently waived all prior objections by joining in the request for the first paragraph of the instruction given to the jury. Her objection to the second paragraph of the instruction was without merit, in that the evidence fully showed that the loan was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">The question whether the action could have been properly maintained against one of the members of the partnership without naming the remaining partners as defendants is interesting; but its consideration is not necessary here, in view of the instruction which both plaintiff and defendant asked for and induced the court to give. In requesting it, defendant waived all objections theretofore made, thereby eliminating all prior questions of error from our consideration. The instruction became the law of this case and as such is binding on the parties to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">It has long been settled in this jurisdiction that a party cannot complain of an instruction given at his instance. Only errors assigned in accordance with Rule of Court 5:1, \u00a7 4 will be noticed by this court. It is due to the trial court that the grounds of objections be specified, so that the opposing party may have an opportunity to meet the objection, Rule of Court 1:8.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>Where both plaintiff and defendant have asked for and have induced the court to give an instruction upon a given theory of the law, neither will be permitted after a verdict to question that theory. In other words, the parti\u00e9s cannot invite the court to commit an error, and then complain of it. Right or wrong, the instruction given in this case became the law of the case on that point, and was binding upon both the parties and the jury. <em>Richmond Traction Co. </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>101 Va. 382, 392, 43 S.
