Miller, brought this suit for divorce <em>a mensa et thoro </em>from his wife, Arlene Davis Miller, on the ground of desertion. Code \u00a7 20-95. The court below was of opinion that the evidence he offered was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>sufficient to support the charge but tended rather, to. prove a separation by mutual consent and accordingly denied the divorce and dismissed the bill. .</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The defendant was personally served with process but filed no answer and offered no evidence. She was likewise served with notice of the taking of depositions and was represented by counsel when they were taken, but her counsel did not cross-examine complainant\u2019s witnesses nor did he appear on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The complainant is a doctor of medicine practicing in the town of Elltton, Rockingham county, where he and his wife made their home after their marriage on November 4, 1942. At the time of their separation he was sixty-two years old and she was thirty-nine. There were no children of the marriage. He testified that she willfully and without cause deserted and abandoned him on August 21, 1953; that at different times during the past four or five years she had threatened to leave him; that she did leave on one occasion and stayed away approximately two weeks until he brought her back home; that on the night of August 21, 1953, she left his home with her sister, Mrs. Lam, sometime before ten o\u2019clock and before he returned from his office work, taking all of her clothing with her; that the next afternoon Mr. Lam, defendant\u2019s brother-in-law, brought his truck and a helper and moved all of her personal property and some of his out of the house. The defendant was present when this was done and said she was moving to the home of her sister, Mrs. Lam. Miller testified that she had never been back to his home since then and that was the last time he had seen her.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The complainant\u2019s son, also a doctor, testified that on the day his stepmother left he stopped by his father\u2019s house and she said she was leaving his father and was not coming back; that she gave no reason for leaving except to say that she was leaving and would not be back, and that so far as he knew she had no reason for leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">The defendant\u2019s brother-in-law, Reese O. Lam, testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>that the defendant \u201casked me whether I would move her stuff and she said she and Doc had busted up; and I asked her where she was going to move it to, and she said she had asked my wife to move it to our place; that Doc had give her two or three acres on Route 33 and she was going to build a house and move it all over there. So she stayed with us two or three days after I moved her stuff and then she went to her Dad\u2019s.\u201d He said that as far as he knew she had no reason to leave her husband. The man who helped Lam load the truck testified that when they began to carry the things out of the house he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on around here? I thought I was only going to help move a couple pieces of furniture. And she [defendant] said, \u2018I am moving my stuff out from here \u2014 I am leaving here.\u2019 \u201d \u201cAnd Doc came in and never said nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ak3\">Mrs. Lam, defendant\u2019s sister, testified that the defendant left Dr. Miller\u2019s home with her and that they took some of her personal belongings with them that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">We cannot agree with the trial court that the only reasonable conclusion from this evidence is that the separation of this couple was prearranged and by mutual consent. On the contrary it establishes, we think, a desertion on the part of the wife which entitles the husband to a divorce. It is true, as the trial court observed, that Dr. Miller voiced no objection to his wife\u2019s departure at the time she left, but it was her conduct and. purpose and not his state of mind that determined whether there was desertion. He was not required either then or thereafter to make an offer of reconciliation if she in fact deserted him. Code \u00a7 20-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">In the first divorce case to reach this court, <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bailey, 62 </em>Va. (21 Gratt.) 43, 47, it was said: \u201cDesertion is a breach of matrimonial duty, and is composed first, of the actual breaking off of the matrimonial cohabitation, and secondly, an intent to desert in the mind of the offender. Both must combine to make the desertion complete.\u201d In the same case it was also stated: \u201cUnder our statute,' no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>particular- period is prescribed in which the desertion shall continue to entitle a to a divorce <em>a mensa, et thoro\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"AA1\">In the many cases since that time that rule has not been changed but its application has resulted in a denial or a granting of a divorce according to the facts of each case. In <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>120 Va. 410, 91 S. E. 180, cited by the trial court, the husband was denied a divorce because the evidence was too meager. The circumstances of the departure and the accompanying intention of the wife were not shown in that case as they are shown in this case, and the efforts at reconciliation necessary but absent there are now unnecessary under the present statute. In the <em>Walker </em>case not enough facts and circumstances were shown to establish that the desertion was willful. Desertion in the case in judgment is shown by direct proof of the act of leaving and of the intention accompanying the act. That being true, it is not essential that the evidence show the reason for the desertion. It may be without reason, as the evidence shows was the case here, and still be desertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The facts proved in the present case establish desertion as firmly as do those proved in <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>180 Va. 200, 22 S. E. (2d) 29, and in the cases cited in that opinion, in which divorces were granted. As said in <em>Good </em>v. <em>Good, </em>122 Va. 30, 31, 94 S. E. 176, 177, cited in the <em>Bowman </em>case, \u201cwe do not feel at liberty to ignore the uncontroverted and unimpeached testimony of these witnesses, all of whom sustain the charge in the bill of willful desertion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Unhappily there still exists the hardness of heart which the Galilean said was the reason for the presence of the divorce provision in the Mosaic law, Matthew 19:8, and \u201c(W)hen the legislature provides for divorces, it is not for the courts to say they shall not be granted. Their business is to see that they are either allowed or refused, in cases coming before them, in accordance with a cautious but reasonable and just interpretation and application of the statute.\u201d <em>Ringgold </em>v. <em>Ringgold, </em>128 Va. 485, 496-7, 104 S. E. 836, 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>The decree appealed from is reversed and.the cause is remanded with direction to the circuit court to enter a decree granting to the complainant a divorce <em>a mensa et thoro </em>from the defendant, and to take such further proceedings as may be proper with respect to the additional prayers of the complainant\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
