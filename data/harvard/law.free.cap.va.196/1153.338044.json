Cohen, as principal, and United States Casualty Company, as surety, executed a bond in the penalty of $21,000 guaranteeing the performance of the \u201ccontract\u201d <em>(sic). </em>There was a trial before a jury which resulted in a verdict and judgment of $21,000 in favor of the plaintiff against both defendants, and to review that judgment the present writ of error was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-14\">Mayflower Corporation owns a large 16-story brick apartment building with an adjacent one-story brick shopping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>center located near the ocean front at Virginia Beach. Shortly after the completion of the buildings serious leaks developed in both of them, and to correct this condition the plaintiff asked for bids for waterproofing the buildings. The written bids of Cohen to do the work, and the acceptances thereof by the plaintiff, are printed in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\">The performance bond, which is in the usual form, was executed on May 1, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>Cohen started work on the contracts in May, 1952, and on June 26 wrote the plaintiff that the work had been completed and that the balance was due. In this letter Cohen stated in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">\u201cThis work has been completed as of this date and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>will appreciate a check <em>* * * </em>which covers the following contracts:</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\">\u201c1. Waterproofing of the Mayflower Apartments $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">\u201c2. Waterproofing of the shopping center $895.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">.V. J/, Jf. Jt Jf, Jf,</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">'fr -7,' \u25a0Jp . \u25a0?? 7i* \u2022Tv' W</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">\u201cAs you understand, while we believe this job is one hundred per cent waterproofed right now, there is always the possibility of some small leaks appearing. Please do not hesitate to call us if this should occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">On or about July 31, 1952, the plaintiff paid Cohen the amount due under the contracts. Shortly thereafter it was found that the buildings were still leaking badly in the locations which Cohen had attempted to remedy. Cohen was notified and on several occasions from the fall of 1952 through the early summer of 1953 he returned and attempted to correct the situation, but was unable to do so. Finally, by letter dated August 28, 1953, the plaintiff notified Cohen that in view of his failure to perform the contracts the plaintiff would have the work done by someone else and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>would look to Cohen and the surety for reimbursement for the cost thereof. A copy of this letter was sent to the surety company. In reply, both Cohen and the surety- company took the position that there had been no breach of the \"contracts and denied liability. Thereupon the plaintiff engaged another contractor, Harry E. Paul, to waterproof the buildings at a cost of $23,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">The evidence on behalf of the plaintiff showed that the work done by Cohen had not corrected the leaks, that numerous window frames had not been properly caulked, and that many open mortar joints in the brick walls of the apartment building had not been properly filled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">There is further evidence that Paul, the second contractor, was successful in correcting these conditions and stopping the leaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">At the trial in the lower court the defendant admitted that the leaks had not been corrected and the buildings had not been waterproofed by Cohen\u2019s work. But they contended that under the terms of the contracts Cohen was not obligated to waterproof the buildings;, that his undertaking was merely to perform certain specified work, namely, to apply mortar where required, caulk the window frames, caulk the copings, and apply waterproof paint to the outside surface of the bricks, and that this was done. It was further contended that the provision in the contract that \u201cThe above work is covered by our standard two-year guarantee against the penetration of water through the surfaces treated by \u00fcs,\u201d bound Cohen to \u201cservice\u201d for a period of two years the work done by him; that is, during the specified period Cohen would, at his own expense, attempt to correct any leaks which might develop.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-7\">These contentions are entirely devoid of merit. Cohen admitted that before he submitted his bids he examined the buildings, knew of the conditions which caused the leaks, and knew that the plaintiff wanted these corrected. It is absurd to say that in this situation the parties contemplated that Cohen was bound merely to furnish and apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>specified materials and do the specified work, regardless o\u00a3 whether the desired results were accomplished. Moreover,, when Cohen wrote the plaintiff on June 26 that the work had been completed he demanded payment for \u201cWaterproofing of the Mayflower Apartments $20,000,\u201d and \u201cWaterproofing of the shopping center $895.\u201d In the same letter he said, \u201cwhile we believe this job is one hundred per cent waterproofed right now, there is always the possibility of some small leaks appearing. Please do not hesitate to call us if this should occur.\u201d This letter clearly shows that the defendant, Cohen, interpreted the contracts as placing upon him the obligation to stop the leaks and waterproof the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\">Accordingly, the trial court correctly instructed the jury that under the provisions of the contracts the defendant, Cohen, undertook to waterproof the walls, window frames, etc., \u201cso as to prevent the penetration of water through these areas for a period of two years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">The main question in the case and that which prompted the granting of this writ of error is, What effect did the failure of the defendant, Cohen, to register as a contractor and obtain the license required by the provisions of Chapter 7, Title 54, of the Code of Virginia (\u00a7\u00a7 54-113 to 54-145,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> inclusive), have upon the right of the plaintiff, Mayflower Corporation, to maintain this action?</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">The defendants argue that since \u201cthe aggregate amount of the contracts * * * was for more than $20,000,\u201d and since Cohen had not registered and had not obtained the license required by the provisions of the chapter, the contracts were \u201cillegal and void\u201d under our holding in <em>Bowen Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>194 Va. 92, 100, 72 S. E. (2d) 388, 393, and that consequently an action for-damages for breach of the contracts and the performance bond cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">The statute applies \u201cwhen the cost of the undertaking * * * is twenty thousand dollars or more.\u201d Code, \u00a7 54-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>While there were actually two separate contracts, one for $20,000 and the other for $895, the case was tried in the lower court and presented to us on the basis that it involved the breach of a single contract for $20,895, the performance of which was guaranteed by a single bond. There was no apportionment of damages between the two contracts. However, if the contracts be treated as separate, the claim of illegality would, of course, apply only to the contract for $20,000, which would be within the statute. No question could then arise as to the illegality of the contract for $895, and the right to sue for its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">It is, of course, elementary that \u201cA void contract is no contract at all; it binds no one and is a mere nullity. Accordingly, an action cannot be maintained for damages for its breach.\u201d 12 Am. Jur., Contracts, \u00a7 10, p. 507. See also, Corbin on Contracts, Vol. 5, \u00a7 993, p. 7; 17 C. J. S., Contracts, \u00a7 10, pp. 331, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">An agreement may be void and of no legal effect because public policy forbids that a contract be entered into with respect to the subject matter. An example of this is found in <em>Roller </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>112 Va. 780, 72 S. E. 665, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1202, Ann. Cas. 1913B 1088, relied on by the defendants. In that case we held that a contract whereby an attorney had agreed to carry on litigation at his own expense was \u201ccontrary to public policy and void\u201d and that there could be no recovery either on the agreement or for services rendered thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">Again, an agreement may be void and of no legal effect because the statute forbids an agreement with respect to the subject matter with which the parties are undertaking to contract. For example, where the statute forbids the sale of intoxicating liquor an agreement for such sale is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-7\">But the contract with which we are here concerned suffers from neither of these infirmities. There is nothing immoral or contrary to public policy in a construction contract involving $20,000 or more. Neither does the statute (Code, \u00a7 54-113 <em>ff.), </em>either expressly or impliedly, forbid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>such a contract. It merely prohibits unqualified persons\u2014 that is, those who have not registered or taken out the required license \u2014 from entering into such an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-4\">There is a wealth of authority on the legal effect and consequences of contracts entered into by persons who have failed to procure licenses required by law. See Williston on Contracts, Rev. Ed., Vol. V, \u00a7 1630 ff., p. 4560 <em>ff; Id., </em>Vol. VI, \u00a7 1765 <em>ff., </em>p. 5007 <em>ff; </em>Corbin on Contracts, Vol. 6, \u00a7 1510 <em>ff., </em>p. 961 <em>ff; </em>33 Am. Jur., Licenses, \u00a7 68 <em>ff., </em>p. 384 <em>ff; </em>53 C. J. S., Licenses, \u00a7 59 <em>ff., </em>p. 711 <em>ff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">While such contracts are frequently termed \u201cvoid,\u201d the authorities which have considered the subject agree that they are not totally void in the sense that they are without legal effect. See Corbin on Contracts, Vol. 6, \u00a7 1510, p. <em>962;, </em>Williston on Contracts, Rev. Ed., Vol. V, \u00a7 1630, p. 4564., note 7, citing a number of cases recognizing that such contracts are not totally void. As Mr. Williston points out, a denial of recovery in such cases rests upon \u201cthe illegality of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct, not the nature of the transaction.\u201d Williston on Contracts, Rev. Ed., Vol. V, \u00a7 1630, p. 4562.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\"><em>Roller </em>v. <em>Murray, supra, </em>recognizes the difference between an agreement which from its nature is illegal and void and one which is \u201ctreated as void merely because it is not enforceable\u201d for \u201comission of a legal formality.\u201d 112 Va., at page 782. See also, <em>Ricks, Adm'r. </em>v. <em>Sumler, </em>179 Va. 571, 576, 19 S. E. (2d) 889, 891; Burks Pleading and Practice, 4th Ed., \u00a7 92, p. 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">We have held in a number of cases that a contract entered into by one who fails to obtain a license or to register, as required by statute, is void in the sense that it is illegal and unenforceable by him in an action against an innocent party. See <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>173 Va. 42, 3 S. E. (2d) 176; <em>Colbert </em>v. <em>Ashland Construction Co., </em>176 Va. 500, 11 S. E. (2d) 612; <em>Bowen Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Foley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">In <em>Bowen Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Foley, supra, </em>relied upon by the defendants, this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Smith, held that a construction contract, involving more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>$20,000, entered into by an unlicensed contractor \u201cis void and there can be no recovery thereon.\u201d 194 Va., at page 100, 72 S. E. (2d), at page 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">In <em>Surf Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Standing, </em>195 Va. 431, 444, 78 S. E. (2d) 901, 908, again speaking through Mr. Justice Smith, we interpreted the <em>Bowen </em>case as holding that \u201ca contractor who is not licensed and registered under the aforementioned statutes cannot recover the balance claimed to be due for work performed when the cost of the undertaking was more than $20,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">In <em>Rohanna </em>v. <em>Vazzana, </em>196 Va. 549, 551, 84 S. E. (2d) 440, 441, we interpreted the <em>Bowen </em>case as holding that, \u201cA failure to comply with the statute precludes a recovery by the contractor on his contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">The precise question with which we are here concerned, whether an innocent party may maintain an action for damages for breach of a contract entered into between him and an unlicensed person, has not been previously presented to this court. But it has been frequently considered in other jurisdictions and the authorities are in accord that such an action may be maintained. As is said in Corbin on Contracts, Vol. 6, \u00a7 1510, p. 962, \u201cThere can be no doubt that a bargain made by an unlicensed guilty dealer, broker, or lawyer with another person who is innocent of offense is not totally void. It would be a rare or nonexistent case in which such an innocent person could not maintain some kind of action for a breach of the agreement by the guilty party who was wrongfully engaged in business, just as an innocent girl can maintain suit for breach of promise against a man who became engaged to her, concealing the fact that he was already married to a living wife. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-7\">This view is based upon the principle that such innocent party is among the class of persons designed to be protected by such statutes, that he is not <em>in pari delicto </em>with the unlicensed party, and is therefore entitled to relief. Or, \u2022to state the matter another way, to deny relief to the in\u2022jiocent party in such cases would defeat the purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>statute and penalize the person intended to be protected thereby. See Corbin on Contracts, Vol. 6, \u00a7 1540, p. 1070, etc.; Williston on Contracts, Rev. Ed., Vol. V, \u00a7 1631, p. 4568, etc.; Restatement of the Law of Contracts, \u00a7 601, p. 1116, etc.; 17 C. J. S., Contracts, \u00a7 278-b, p. 666; 12 Am. Jur., Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 217, 218, pp. 734-6; <em>Elmers </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>91 Cal. App. (2d) 741, 205 P. (2d) 1052, 1060; <em>Fergus County </em>v. <em>Osweiler, </em>107 Mont. 466, 86 P. (2d) 410, 411, 120 A. L. R. 1457, and authorities there cited; <em>Deming </em>v. <em>State ex rel. Miller, </em>23 Ind. 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-4\">Some courts allow recovery by the innocent party upon the principle that the guilty unlicensed party is estopped to assert as a defense his failure to comply with the provisions of the statute. See <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Sutphen, </em>8 Ill. 547; <em>Romano </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>125 N. J. L. 293, 15 A. (2d) 818, 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">Similarly, it has been uniformly held that the surety who guarantees the performance of a contract by an unlicensed person will be held liable for damages for the principal\u2019s breach of the contract. Williston on Contracts, Rev. Ed., Vol. IV, \u00a7 1217, p. 3502 <em>ff., </em>in discussing \u201cIllegality of the creditor\u2019s contract with the principal as a defense to the surety,\u201d points out that where the illegality of the contract is of a kind which would prevent recovery against the principal, the surety may likewise take advantage of that defense. As illustrative of this class of cases, that authority cites (at page 3503) <em>Basnight </em>v. <em>American Mfg. Co., </em>174 N. C. 206, 93 S. E. 734, relied on by the defendant surety in the case now before us, in which recovery against the principal and surety was denied on a bond guaranteeing the performance of an illegal lottery contract; and <em>Boylston Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>O'Neill, </em>231 Mass. 498, 121 N. E. 411, 2 A. L. R. 902, in which recovery against the principal and surety was denied on a bond guaranteeing the performance of an illegal contract to deliver intoxicating liquors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">But, as the author goes on to say, \u201cwhere the non-enforcement of an illegal contract would impose a penalty on those intended to be protected by the law, the obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>will be enforced\u201d against the surety. Williston on Contracts, Rev. Ed., Vol. IV, \u00a7 1217, p. 3503. See also, Restatement of the Law of Contracts, \u00a7 601, p. 1117; 72 C. J. S., Principal and Surety, \u00a7 255, p. 703; 50 Am. Jur., Suretyship, \u00a7 141, p. 998; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Zweben </em>(D. C., S. D. N. Y.), 13 F. Supp. 554, 555, and authorities there cited; <em>State </em>v. <em>Seabrook, </em>42 S. C. 74, 20 S. E. 58. The basis of this view is that unless the bond provides otherwise, or the surety has been released by some act of the obligee, the obligation of the surety is measured by that of the principal, and the surety may assert no defense which is not available to the principal. See 50 Am. Jur., Suretyship, \u00a7 30, p. 921; <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 140, p. 997; 72 C. J. S., Principal and Surety, \u00a7 92, p. 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">In the present case, since the bond contained no provision limiting the liability of the surety and there was no evidence of its release by any act of the obligee plaintiff, the trial court properly instructed the jury that the obligation of the surety was \u201cthe same as that of the defendant Cohen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">The final contention of the surety is that the plaintiff\u2019s action was prematurely brought because the bond provided that it was executed and delivered upon the condition that all disputes, claims or questions arising under the construction contract \u201cshall be subject to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Article 40 of the General Conditions of the Contract for the Construction of Buildings contained in the Fifth Edition of such Standard Documents aforesaid, anything to the contrary contained in such aforesaid contract notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">It clearly appears, however, from Article 40, which is attached to and made a part of the bond, that this provision requiring arbitration refers to \u201cdisputes, claims or questions\u201d arising during the course of the work and before final payment. The article expressly states that \u201cin no case, however, shall the demand (for arbitration) be made later than the time of final payment.\u201d The present case does not involve a dispute or controversy which arose during the course of the work and before final payment. It involves a disppte which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>arose after both of these events and therefore not within the scope of the arbitration clause. See 3 Am. Jur., Arbitration and Award, \u00a7 45, p. 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">The other assignments of error are entirely without merit. In our opinion the judgment of the lower court is plainly right and accordingly it is</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AeDR\">\u201cDEECEE ASSOCIATES</p>\n<p id=\"Amh\">\u201cPainting and Waterproofing Contractors</p>\n<p id=\"AEi\">\u201c515 West 25th Street</p>\n<p id=\"AKz6\">\u201cNorfolk, Virginia</p>\n<p id=\"pAxO\">\u201cApril 17, 1952</p>\n<p id=\"AQ1\">\u201cMr. Robert B.
