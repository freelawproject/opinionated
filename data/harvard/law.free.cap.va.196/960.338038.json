Olds and Helen B. Olds, trading as \u201cOO\u201d Beauty Products Company, seeking to recover damages for personal injuries received by her as a result of a fire which allegedly occurred while the plaintiff was using \u201cOO\u201d oil shampoo, a product manufactured by and purchased from the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">The motion alleged that it was the duty of the defendants \u201cto use due and proper care in manufacture and sale of said shampoo fluid, to give proper and complete instructions as to its use, including the proper labelling thereof, so that same might safely be used for the purposes for which it was intended\u201d; that the defendants disregarded said duties and as a proximate result plaintiff suffered personal injuries and resultant damages to the extent of $50,000. The defendants filed their answer denying the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">The case was tried before a jury. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence and again upon the completion of all the evidence the defendants moved to strike on the ground of insufficiency, which motions were overruled, and proper exceptions were noted. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $15,000. A motion to set the verdict aside as being contrary to the law and the evidence was also overruled and the court, over the objection of defendants, entered judgment thereon. We granted the defendants a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">Defendants rely upon eight assignments of error. In our view of the case it is only necessary for us to consider one question; <em>i.e., </em>was there any proof of actionable negligence on the part of the defendants?</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s husband, Charles Wood, testified that he purchased a pint bottle of \u201cOO\u201d oil shampoo from the defendants, who had manufactured it. The bottle contained these directions: \u201cA shampoo to be used without soap or water. Heat until warm, pour through the hair a little at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>time. Massage well, dry well with towel until the oil is out. Apply \u2018OO\u2019 working oil to the scalp and \u2018OO\u2019 pressing oil only to the scalp and press.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">He further testified that on the same afternoon the shampoo was purchased he proceeded to heat the substance in a pan until \u201clukewarm\u201d and then began to shampoo his wife\u2019s hair by pouring the liquid on the hair and massaging her scalp. After applying the shampoo he dried plaintiff\u2019s hair with a towel and combed the hair back from her face. At this point plaintiff placed a cigarette in her mouth and struck a match \u201cholding it at arms length in front of her\u201d. Upon lighting the match there was \u201ca flash of flame\u201d, which engulfed plaintiff in and about her hair and clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">The foregoing account of how the accident happened as testified to by the husband was corroborated by his wife, the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">Plaintiff states in her brief that \u201cthe cigarette was never lit and when later picked up off the floor it was found not to have been touched by fire. The shampoo was being administered in the kitchen of plaintiff\u2019s home, which was heated only by a gas cook stove and this stove was cut off immediately after the heating of the \u2018OO\u2019 oil shampoo. * * * The plaintiff\u2019s husband, children and mother attempted to extinguish the flames which enveloped the plaintiff but not before the plaintiff had been seriously injured.\u201d ,</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-8\">A portion of the liquid remaining in the bottle was analyzed by plaintiff\u2019s witness, William R. Maynard, Jr., a chemist employed by the State of Virginia, and by defendant\u2019s witness, B. J. Peters, a chemist with Frohling and Robertson, Inc., of Richmond. All of the liquid placed in the pan was used in the shampooing operation and none was available for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-9\">Maynard testified that the flash point of the shampoo taken from the bottle was 171 degrees Fahrenheit, and Peters testified that his analysis revealed it to be 172 degrees. The chemists agreed that the one degree variation was inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>The chemists testified that \u201cflash point was defined as the minimum temperature where a volatile liquid will give off vapors and with an external source of ignition give a momentary flash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">It was established on interrogatories that \u201cthe ingredients of \u2018OO\u2019 oil shampoo was insecti-sol with about a teaspoon of oil of wintergreen added to five gallons. * * *\u201d The oil of wintergreen was for the purpose of giving a pleasant odor to the preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">There was no proof that the shampoo used in the operation ever reached 171 or 172 degrees Fahrenheit. The husband stated that the liquid was never more than \u201clukewarm\u201d. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, defines lukewarm as \u201cmoderately warm; neither cold nor hot; tepid; * * * It was admitted that had the temperature of the shampoo reached 171 or 172 degrees it would have been too hot to apply with comfort and there was no testimony as to any discomfort to plaintiff from the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">There was no conflict in the evidence of the two chemists. However, B. J. Peters, the chemist introduced on behalf of the defendants, was asked whether or not it would have been possible under the conditions described for the liquid analyzed to have ignited and caused the fire, to which he replied \u201c* * * It would not have been possible for it to happen.\u201d No such question was asked by plaintiff of her witness, Maynard, and no attempt was made by her to refute the positive answer made by Peters that the fire could not have happened in the manner and under the conditions described.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-8\">Plaintiff failed to prove the allegations that the defendants failed \u201cto use due and proper care in the manufacture and sale of said shampoo fluid\u201d, and she failed to establish the allegation that defendants failed to \u201cgive proper and complete instructions as to its use\u201d. These were the acts of negligence alleged, and there was no proof in the record establishing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>Plaintiff argues in her brief that \u201ca manufacturer or seller of an article which is inherently and imminently dangerous to human life or health, or which, although not dangerous in itself, becomes so when applied to its intended use in the usual and customary manner, is liable to any person, who, without fault on his part, sustains an injury which is the natural and proximate results of negligence in the manufacture or sale of the article.\u201d Citing 65 C. J. S., Negligence, \u00a7 100, p. 618; 46 Am. Jur., Sales, \u00a7\u00a7 814, 815, pp. 938, 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">We recognize the correctness of the quoted statement but the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witness, Maynard, negatives the fact that the substance analyzed by him and claimed to have been used by plaintiff was inherently and imminently dangerous to human life or health when applied to its intended use in the usual' and customary manner. The husband testified that the shampoo was applied in the usual and customary manner, <em>i.e., </em>by heating the substance to a \u201clukewarm\u201d temperature and applying it to plaintiff\u2019s hair. Maynard testified unequivocally that the shampoo would not give off vapors and would not \u201cflash\u201d from an external source of ignition until it had reached a temperature of 171 degrees Fahrenheit. The quoted statement therefore does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">We are reminded that when we have a jury\u2019s verdict, approved by the trial judge, we should view the case practically as upon a demurrer to the evidence (\u00a7 8-491, Code of Va., 1950); that in such a situation plaintiff\u2019s evidence and all fair inferences which may be drawn therefrom must be accepted as true, and evidence in conflict therewith is waived. <em>McDowell </em>v. <em>Dye, </em>193 Va. 390, 395, 69 S. E. (2d) 459, 463. Applying the rule in the instant case, there is no evidence of negligence upon which to base the verdict of the jury, and a judgment entered on such a verdict should not be allowed to stand. <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Somers, </em>177 Va. 231, 13 S. E. (2d) 330; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>The United Co., </em>183 Va. 263, 31 S. E. (2d) 889. Here we have allegations of negligence with no proof establishing them. The happening of the accident was no proof of negligence, and where affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>and preponderating proof of negligence is not established there can be no recovery. 13 M. J., Negligence, \u00a7 58, p. 583; <em>Southern Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>108 Va. 388, 61 S. E. 747; <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>108 Va. 448, 62 S. E. 269; <em>Richter </em>v. <em>Seawell, </em>183 Va. 379, 32 S. E. (2d) 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">For the reasons stated the judgment of the trial court is reversed and final judgment is here entered for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
