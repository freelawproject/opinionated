Halstead, a director and for 22 years the business manager of the Association, to enjoin Halstead from acting and receiving a salary for his services as manager, and also to enjoin the Association from paying him money for such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">The bill alleged that Halstead was a director of the Association and acting as such; that Code, \u00a7 13-266 (c) and the by-laws of the Association provide that a director shall not receive a salary as business manager of the Association while a director; and that \u201ccontrary to both the spirit and letter\u201d of Code, \u00a7 13-266(c) and the by-laws of the Association, the directors elected Halstead business manager at an annual salary of $5,000. The Association and Halstead answered admitting as facts the material allegations of the bill, but denying that payment for the latter\u2019s service as business manager was illegal. The cause was submitted on the bill and answer and by its decree the trial court denied the relief prayed and dismissed the bill, to which decree we granted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">The single question presented is whether Halstead, a director of the Association, may during his term of office receive compensation for services as a business manager. The answer to this question rests upon a proper construction of Code, \u00a7 13-266(c), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">\u201cAn association may provide for the payment of a fair remuneration for the time actually spent by its officers and directors in its service. No director, during the term of his office, shall be a party to a contract for profit with the association differing in \"any way from the business relations accorded regular members or holders of common stock of the association, or to any other kind of contract differing from terms generally current in that district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">This section of the Code contains no express restriction or limitation prohibiting a director of a Co-Operative Farm Product Marketing Association from acting and receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>compensation as its business manager. The first sentence authorizes the Association to pay a \u201cfair remuneration for the time actually spent by its officers and directors in its service.\u201d In addition to the requirement that the remuneration be fair, the second sentence provides that no director \u201cshall be a party to a contract for profit with the association differing in any way from the business relations accorded regular members or holders of common stock of the association, or to any other kind of contract differing from terms generally current in that district.\u201d There is no allegation that Halstead\u2019s contract of employment is unfair; therefore, our inquiry is confined to the determination of whether his salary is paid under a \u201ccontract for profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">The word \u201cprofit\u201d is defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (3rd ed.) as \u201cThe advance in the price of goods sold beyond the cost of purchase. The gain made by the sale of produce or manufactures, after deducting the value of the labor, materials, rents, and all expenses, together with the interest of the capital employed.\u201d There is a clear distinction between \u201cprofit\u201d and \u201cwages\u201d or compensation for labor. \u201cCompensation for labor can not be regarded as profit within the meaning of the law. The word \u2018profit\u2019, as ordinarily used, means the gain made upon any business or investment \u2014 a different thing altogether from mere compensation for labor.\u201d <em>The Commercial League Association of America </em>v. <em>The People ex rel. Thomas B. Needles, Auditor, </em>90 Ill. 166. \u201cReasonable compensation for labor or services rendered is not profit.\u201d <em>Laureldale Cemetery Association </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>354 Pa. 239, 47 A. (2d) 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">When Code, \u00a7 13-266 (c) receives a reasonable construction it is clear that a contract under which a director of the Association is also employed for a fair remuneration as business manager does not constitute a \u201ccontract for profit.\u201d The primary purpose of this'statute is to authorize fair remuneration for the services of directors and officers and to prevent a director from gaining any contractual pref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>erences with the association not available to the general membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Code, \u00a7 13-250 provides: \u201cThe provisions of the general corporation laws of this State, and all powers and rights thereunder, shall apply to the associations [Co-Operative Farm Product Marketing Associations] organized hereunder, except where such provisions are in conflict with or inconsistent with the express provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">We have been directed to no provision of the general corporation law which prohibits a director from acting for fair compensation as business manager of his corporation. Furthermore, there are no express provisions in Chapter 15, Title 13 of the Code nor any provisions of the Association\u2019s by-laws,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> which are in conflict with the general corporation law that a director may also serve his corporation in some other capacity for a fair remuneration. In fact this is common practice and sanctioned by the law if the contract of employment is otherwise fair and honest. <em>Sterling </em>v. <em>Trust Company of Norfolk, </em>149 Va. 867, 141 S. E. 856; <em>Ransome Concrete Machinery Co. </em>v. <em>Moody, 282 </em>Fed. 29; 4 Michie\u2019s Jur., Corporations, \u00a7 166, p. 700 <em>et seq.; </em>5 Fletcher on Corporations, (1952 Revised Volume), \u00a7 2126, p. 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">Consequently, we hold that the \u201ccontract for profit\u201d referred to in Code, \u00a7 13-266 (c) does not include a contract of employment and does not prohibit the payment of a \u201cfair remuneration for the time actually spent\u201d by Halstead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>as business manager of his association. Therefore, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1125-8\"> The pertinent by-laws of the Association read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">\u201cArticle VII \u2014 Duties of the Directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-10\">\u201cSection 1. The board of directors shall manage the business of the association and shall make the necessary rules and regulations not inconsistent with law or with these by-laws, for the management of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-11\">\u201cSection 2.
