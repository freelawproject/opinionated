L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. The Commonwealth had previously appealed (G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E) from an order by the Superior Court, after a pre-trial hearing, suppressing evidence seized by natural resource officers and consisting of the lobster pots allegedly stolen. The Supreme Judicial Court \u201con the facts shown on this record\u201d reversed the order. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colella, </em>360 Mass. 144, 150-151 (1971). The opinion in that case sets out most of the pertinent evidence. We treat the defendant\u2019s assignments of error in the order argued in his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">1. Assignment 9. The defendant renewed his motion to suppress on the basis that he would \u201cgo into further facts which were not brought out [previously] . . ..\u201d See Rule 101B of the Superior Court, as amended effective June 1, 1971 (\u201c [T]he court in its discretion may entertain such motions at any time or at the trial.\u201d). At the hearing on the renewed motion, the transcript of the original pretrial hearing which had been before the Supreme Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Court was introduced by the defendant, and a natural resource officer who had testified at that hearing also testified at the hearing on the renewed motion. However, our examination of the transcript indicates that nothing of substance was added to the record previously before the Supreme. Judicial Court, and the defendant\u2019s brief does not suggest any difference in the present record. Rather it asks us to reexamine the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court. This request is more appropriately addressed to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">2. Assignment 1. It was not an abuse of discretion to refuse the defendant\u2019s request for particulars \u201cstating whether he [the defendant] was being charged with receiving, buying, or aiding in the concealment of the lobster pots.\u201d The defendant, in effect, thus sought to require an election among these three. The trial judge was not required thus to limit the Commonwealth where, as here, there was substantially no question that the indictment and the particulars gave the defendant \u201creasonable knowledge of the nature and grounds of the crime charged . . ..\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>359 Mass. 500, 508 (1971). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallo, ante, </em>636, 638-639 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valleca, </em>358 Mass. 242, 244-245 (1970); G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">3. Assignments 2, 4, 5, 7. These assignments attack the denial of various discovery motions. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">(a) The very general motion for exculpatory evidence is substantially the same as the motion for exculpatory evidence in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>359 Mass. 368, 370-371, and fn. 1 (1971), and the reasons for the denial of that motion are substantially applicable to the motion in this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>354 Mass. 598, 613 (1968), cert. den. 393 U. S. 1056 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>French, </em>357 Mass. 356, 399, A-2 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">(b) There is no indication that the Commonwealth had in its possession the criminal records or probation records of witnesses which the defendant\u2019s motion sought. \u201c [T]his motion was not simply a mode of discovery of the contents of prosecution files but rather a request to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>the prosecution to take affirmative action to get these records. ... [I]t is not required that the prosecution take affirmative steps in behalf of the defendants to collect their criminal records.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>363 Mass. 467, 474 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">(c) There is nothing to indicate that the denial of the motion requesting generally \u201cany and all statements, admissions, and/or confessions made by the defendant . . . whether or not . . . [in] writing\u201d was an abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamattina, ante, </em>203, 209 (1974) (oral statements). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>359 Mass. 500, 507 (1971) (oral statements). So far as appears, no request was made in the Superior Court at the hearing on the motion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> specifically for any written statement made by the defendant; nor is there any mention of. such a statement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the defendant\u2019s brief. We have no reason to believe that the defendant\u2019s written statement would have been denied to him if specifically requested. \u201cAs a practical matter, most if not all Superior Court Justices will permit the defendant to examine or be given a copy of all statements of the defendant that have been reduced to writing.\u201d Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 613, p. 309 (1970). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamattina, supra </em>at 210 (1974). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallo, supra </em>at 639 (1974). The short answer to the argument that oral statements might be necessary in asserting rights provided in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (1966), is that the defendant did not seek to suppress evidence on the basis that he had not been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">(d) The defendant\u2019s motion to inspect evidence was also general, and there is nothing to indicate that, had the judge who heard the motion been made aware of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>particular desire by the defendant\u2019s counsel to inspect the lobster pots, he would not have followed the practice of \u201c[pjractically all Superior Court Judges [to] allow defense counsel reasonable latitude in examining the physical evidence before trial.\u201d Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 615, p. 310, fn. 15 (1970). See, e. g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>356 Mass. 604, 609 (1970). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>French, </em>357 Mass. 356, 399, A-2 (1970). For aught that appears, this is being raised for the first time in the defendant\u2019s brief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>354 Mass. 598, 613 (1968), cert. den. 393 U. S. 1056 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>358 Mass. 219, 225 (1970).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">4. Assignments 12 and 14.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These assignments of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">(a) A natural resource officer, Lawrence M. Nagle, testified that he put the pots on a truck and they were removed to Bradley Palmer State Park. He \u201csealed them up in the garage at Topsfield.\u201d Boyce, also a natural resource officer, testified that since the lobster pots had been secured in the garage he had seen them about once a week or once every two weeks. Natural resource officer Como also testified that he had observed them periodically. Under the circumstances, it is trifling to raise the contention that it was reversible error to permit the question to Officer Nagle whether the lobster pots were \u201ckept in the custody and control of the Department of Natural Resources . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">(b) The defendant objects to testimony by Officer Como to what the defendant characterizes as a \u201cconversation\u201d between the officer and one Martinson, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>owner of some of the stolen lobster pots. This was in answer to the question, \u201cWhat took place between Mr. Martinson and yourself?\u201d and contained a description of Martinson\u2019s acts as he identified his lobster pots. To the extent that there were intermingled in the answer spoken words which may be deemed a conversation with Martinson reported by Officer Como and objectionable as hearsay<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as to the ownership of the pots, such words were subject to a motion to strike <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>294 Mass. 59, 61 [1936]), which was not made. In any event, this testimony was merely cumulative. There was an abundance of testimony by Martinson and others, much of it without objection, as to Martinson\u2019s identification of the lobster pots.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">5. Assignment 15. The defendant\u2019s contention that there was insufficient evidence of possession by the defendant of the stolen lobster pots is not borne out by the transcript. They were found on the premises owned by the defendant\u2019s parents where the defendant lived. When the defendant was confronted on the premises by claimants of the lobster pots which were lying there, there was testimony that he said that he had bought them, that \u201che owned them and his partners owned them,\u201d and that they had been there for some time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guerro, </em>357 Mass. 741, 752-753 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mott, ante, </em>47, 53-54 (1974). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frongillo, </em>359 Mass. 132, 138 (1971) .</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-12\">The indictment charges that the defendant \u201cdid buy, receive or aid in the concealment of thirty-eight lobster pots, more or less . . ..\u201d See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 60; G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79 (form for \u201cReceiving stolen property\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">No transcript of a hearing on this motion or any of the other discovery motions has been furnished us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b723-9\">It appears that the only written statement made by the defendant was a waiver of rights by the defendant when he approached the Attorney General\u2019s office for an interview.

In any event, it has no merit. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamattina, supra </em>at 209-211 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The defendant also argues (Assignment 10) that certain evidence was the fruit of the search for and seizure of the lobster pots, which the defendant contends was invalid. We have previously dealt with this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b725-9\">We assume arguendo the validity of the defendant\u2019s contention that, though the defendant was present, this testimony was not admissible as an adoptive admission because the defendant had been warned under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (1966), that he had a right to keep silent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>346 Mass. 9, 14 (1963). However, we need not decide, and do not in any way imply, that the spoken words in this answer were objectionable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b725-10\">When the natural resource officers took the lobster pots, the defendant accepted a receipt for them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
