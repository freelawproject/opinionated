J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9q\">The defendant, having been indicted for armed robbery and for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (a shoe), was convicted by a jury of larceny from the person and assault and battery. There was evidence that between 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon on May 7, 1971, a group of from 150 to 200 persons gathered on or near the steps of the Eoxbury Crossing welfare office. While this crowd was thus gathered a disturbance took place during which the defendant and another person kicked a police officer who was stationed at the door of the welfare office. The defendant took the officer\u2019s revolver and stuck it in his (the defendant\u2019s) waistband.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Prior to the impaneling of the jury the defendant filed a motion, supported by an affidavit of his counsel, seeking permission to ask the veniremen individually seventeen questions or, alternatively, that the judge examine the prospective jurors individually in accordance with those questions. The judge ruled that questions one, two, ten, and the substance of question three would be put to the venire collectively. This was done.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge also asked the substance of the so-called statutory questions (G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, prior to the amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>effected by St. 1973, c. 919).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant excepted to the judge\u2019s refusal to ask the other requested questions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result of the questions put to the veniremen, three were excused upon their responses to question ten, one was excused because he had restricted police powers, and one was excused because of an affirmative answer to question one. A sixth venireman responded that he had an uncle who was a police officer, but the defendant did not challenge for cause after the venireman answered, upon questioning by the defendant\u2019s attorney, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>would not believe the testimony of a policeman over that of another person, solely because he was a policeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">1. We first consider the defendant\u2019s exception to the partial denial of his motion under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, for the judge to ask or allow the attorney to ask questions enumerated in the motion (see nn. 1 and 3), and we do so, as we must, in the light of the facts before the judge at the time he made his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The defendant argues that the affidavit filed in support of his motion for voir dire questions shows that he anticipated the prejudice of the prospective jurors against young people who engage in protest demonstrations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and he contends that the judge erred in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The judge was informed that the charges upon which the defendant was to be tried arose out of a demonstration at a welfare office, and he was asked to inquire specifically of the jurors whether they might have any hostility towards persons who engage in protests or towards persons who receive welfare or Medicaid, or whether they might believe that such protestors would be more likely to commit crime. There was no suggestion to the judge that any anti-communist feelings of the veniremen might be injected into the case. That matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>only surfaced during the course of the trial when certain photographic exhibits, introduced by the defendant, showed some of the protestors carrying red flags and signs which could have suggested to the jury that some of the demonstrators had communistic leanings. Furthermore, the affidavit of the defendant\u2019s counsel in support of his motion, like that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>365 Mass. 70, 74 (1974), amounted to no more than an argument of law intended to persuade the court to adopt the defendant\u2019s position on the utility of the requested questions and in no way informed the judge as to the possible injection into the case of prejudice stemming from possibly disparate political views or cultural values.</p>\n<p id=\"a_t-dedup-0\">It is a well established rule in this Commonwealth that it lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge whether to ask questions beyond the minima prescribed by G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>365 Mass. 70, 72-73 (1974).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Asq\">For the reasons stated, we are of the opinion that the judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to ask the proffered questions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">2. Six days after the jury returned verdicts, one of the jurors approached the judge and told him that during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>deliberations a fellow juror had said that the defendant was a \u201cCommunist\u201d and that the judge \u201cshould hang the whole bunch of them, for what they were doing.\u201d He also said that another juror had referred to the defendant as a \u201cbum.\u201d The reporting juror also related to the judge that \u201ctoday, upstairs in the jurors\u2019 room\u201d the foreman told him that after the case had been \u201cdeliberated\u201d a juror had said that the defendant was a \u201cCommunist.\u201d The judge made a transcript of his conference with the reporting juror available to counsel. Thereafter sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Following sentencing the defendant filed a motion for a new trial. He assigned as grounds for that motion \u201cthat the defendant was prejudiced in his defense by the denial of his motion under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, for order that his attorney be permitted to examine on oath persons called as jurors under the direction of this Court or, in the alternative, that the Court examine on oath such persons and that the statements of the reporting juror demonstrated the prejudice to which the defendant was subjected in his defense by the denial of said motion.\u201d The motion was denied, and the defendant excepted to its denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The defendant disavows any attempt to impeach the jury\u2019s verdict, recognizing that the mandate of <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>107 Mass. 453, 460-462 (1871), is still the law of this Commonwealth. <em>Dixon </em>v. A. <em>J. Cunningham Co. </em>257 Mass. 63, 71 (1926). Compare <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>403 F. 2d 77, 83, n. 11 (2d Cir. 1968). However, he appears to contend that he has demonstrated that false answers were given by some of the prospective jurors to the voir dire questions posed by the judge concerning prejudice, in light of the reporting juror\u2019s statements, and that the verdict of the jury is therefore a nullity and a new trial should have been granted. In support of this contention he cites <em>Clark </em>v. <em>United States, </em>289 U. S. 1, 13-14, 18-19 (1933); <em>People </em>v. <em>Castaldia, </em>51 Cal. 2d 569, 572-573 (1959); and <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number><em>Leonti, </em>262 N. Y. 256, 258 (1933).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In each of those cases, however, it was in fact demonstrated that the juror had returned false answers to voir dire questions prior to his selection as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">While the cases relied upon by the defendant illustrate that an exception exists in some jurisdictions to the general rule expressed in <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>107 Mass. 453 (1871), that the deliberations of the jury are inviolable, we do not consider the facts of this case to come within any such possible exception. Even if we were to consider that such evidence might be used in the manner urged by the defendant, no showing has been made that the judge believed the reporting juror,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nor was there any indication in the statements of the reporting juror, assuming them to be true, that those jurors whose remarks were reported harbored such views at the time of impaneling as to demonstrate the existence at that time of any bias or prejudice which would have required an affirmative answer to any of the judge\u2019s voir dire questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">It is within the sound discretion of the trial judge whether to allow or deny a motion for a new trial (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stout, </em>356 Mass. 237, 242-243 [1969]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cassesso, </em>360 Mass. 570, 575 [1971]), and we discern no abuse of that discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\">\u201c1.

The defendant does not argue that his situation comes within the rule in those cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b793-9\">While we do not depart from the established law with respect to the judge\u2019s discretion, we note that such discretion is not unlimited and that the judge has the serious responsibility of addressing special questions to the venire concerning particular biases and prejudices which might intrude into the trial of a case. We particularly note the caution to that effect in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bumpus, </em>365 Mass. 66, 70 (1974). The directions of the amendment to G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, which were effected by St. 1973, c. 919, should also be noted.
