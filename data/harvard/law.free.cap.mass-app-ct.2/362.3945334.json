The plaintiff had a finding in a District Court, whereupon the defendant removed the action to the Superior Court (G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104, as amended through St. 1965, c. 377), where it was submitted on a statement of agreed facts which we shall treat as a case stated. A judge of the latter court entered an order for judgment for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The only defence to the action which has been argued before us is that the plaintiff is barred from recovery because the provisions of G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 39 (as amended by St. 1958, c. 130),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> impose a statutory duty on the plaintiff\u2019s municipal light department (and thus on the town itself) to remove electric wires at the town\u2019s expense. We hold that the provisions of that section do not apply to a city or town owning a municipal electric plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">1. We first reach that result by the application of long familiar rules of statutory construction. It has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>repeatedly held or considered that a word such as \u201ccompany,\u201d which is employed no less than six different times in G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 39, is not to be construed to include a municipality owning an electric plant in the absence of a clear expression of legislative intent that it shall be so construed. See <em>Donohue </em>v. <em>Newburyport, </em>211 Mass. 561, 566-569 (1912); <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>North Attleborough, </em>212 Mass. 243, 245-246 (1912); <em>MacRae </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>296 Mass. 394, 396-397 (1937); <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>299 Mass. 115, 121-122 (1937); <em>Taunton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>359 Mass. 188, 190-191 (1971). See also G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">It seems to us that such a rule of construction is required in the present case. The words \u201cany such company\u201d which appear near the outset of the first sentence of \u00a7 39 refer to the immediately preceding provisions of G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 38,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where \u201cany city or town engaged in the manufacture and sale of electricity for light, heat or power\u201d is referred to disjunctively with and in contradistinction to \u201cany street railway company . . . any electric railroad company ... or any company . . . described in . . . [section] twenty-one.\u201d Section 38 does not use the word \u201ccompany\u201d when referring to a city or town which owns an electric plant, and we are not at liberty to assume that the Legislature intended that word to have different meanings in two successive sections of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>statutory provisions dealing with the same subject matter. Compare <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>356 Mass. 184, 188-189 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We note also a serious anomaly which would result from construing the word \u201ccompany\u201d as used in \u00a7 39 to include a municipal electric plant; if a municipal electric department wrongfully refused to remove wires, an inspector of wires or a board of selectmen could cause the wires to be removed and the city or town could then proceed against itself under the second sentence of that section to recover the expense of removal. We cannot believe any such result was intended, but such would appear to be a logical consequence of the construction contended for by the defendant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">We conclude as matter of simple statutory construction that the provisions of G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 39, as amended, do not apply to a municipally owned electric plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">2. Support for that conclusion is found in the legislative history of the provisions now found in G. L. c. 166, \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 39. The earliest version of what is now \u00a7 38 appears to have been St. 1849, c. 93, \u00a7 7, which, when read together with \u00a7 1 of c. 93, applied only to telegraph companies. That \u00a7 7 was carried in 1860, without significant change, into Gen. Sts. c. 64, \u00a7 15. The earliest ancestor of G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 39, is St. 1869, c. 141, \u00a7 1, which likewise applied only to telegraph companies. That section authorized persons desiring to move buildings to disconnect wires themselves; it contained nothing comparable to what is now the second sentence of G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 39. The 1869 statute was not made part of the General Statutes, despite its obvious interrelationship to Gen. Sts. c. 64, \u00a7 15. It was not until the enactment of the Public Statutes in 1882 that the provisions of Gen. Sts. c. 64, \u00a7 15, and of St. 1869, c. 141, \u00a7 1, were juxtaposed as Pub. Sts. c. 109, \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 17, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">By St. 1883, c. 221, \u00a7 1, \u201cAll provisions of law granting to persons and corporations authority to erect, lay and maintain . . . telegraph and telephone lines\u201d were, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>with certain exceptions, made applicable \u201cto lines for the transmission of electricity for the purpose of lighting.\u201d One of the exceptions was Pub. Sts. c. 109, \u00a7 16, which has already been identified as a forerunner of G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 38.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> What had been Pub. Sts. c. 109, \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 17, were carried without material change into R. L. c. 122, \u00a7\u00a7 27 and 28, respectively. Both those sections were, by virtue of R. L. c. 122, \u00a7 1, made applicable to electric light and power companies as well as to telephone and telegraph companies. There is nothing in the legislative history of R. L. c. 122, \u00a7\u00a7 27 and 28, to suggest that either section was intended to apply to any wires other than those owned by private companies or unincorporated owners. To the contrary, it was said in Vol. II of the Report of the Commissioners for Consolidating and Arranging the Public Statutes (1901), at p. 1160, that the sections ultimately enacted in 1902 as R. L. c. 122, \u00a7\u00a7 25-30, \u201chave been so drafted to include all <em>companies </em>which by amendments have been brought within Pub. Sts. c. 109 ...\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">It is in St. 1908, c. 233 (\u201cAn Act to extend the provisions of . . . [R. L. c. 122, \u00a7 27] to street railway companies, electric railroad companies and municipalities engaged in the manufacture and sale of electricity . . .\u201d), that we find the first use of the phrase \u201cany city or town engaged in the manufacture and sale of electricity\u201d which is now found in G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 38. No change was made in 1908 in the provisions of R. L. c. 122, \u00a7 28. The latter section was amended by St. 1911, c. 509, \u00a7 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>in respects not important for present purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The provisions of R. L. c. 122, \u00a7\u00a7 27 and 28, each as so amended, were carried directly to G. L. c. 166, \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 39, respectively.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The significance of the foregoing exposition lies in the fact that ever since the juxtaposition in the Public Statutes of 1882 of the predecessors of G. L. c. 166, \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 39, the scope of the predecessors of \u00a7 39 has been defined by and limited to \u201cany such company.\u201d The fact that the quoted phrase has remained unchanged in the ensuing period of more than ninety years (during which other changes have been effected in both of what are now G. L. c. 166, \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 39) is, we believe, persuasive evidence that what is now G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 39, was never intended to be extended to apply to a municipally owned electric plant which is separately and expressly referred to as such in what is now G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 38. Compare <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. </em>&amp; <em>Taxn. </em>363 Mass. 685, 691-692 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">3. Although it was not discussed in either of the briefs, we have considered the possibility that the provisions of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 71, might have the effect of making the provisions of G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 39, applicable to a municipal electric plant. Section 71 of G. L. c. 164 is not one of the sections expressly referred to in the second clause of \u00a7 2 of that chapter. Compare <em>Board of Gas ir Elec. Light Commrs. of Middleborough </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>363 Mass. 433, 437-438 (1973). We have concluded from an examination of the legislative history of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 66, and 71, that \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 71 have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>no bearing on the application or proper construction of G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 39.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The order for judgment is reversed, and the case is to stand for further proceedings in the Superior Court not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\u201cWhenever, in order to move a building or for any other necessary purpose, a person desires that the wires of <em>any such company </em>be cut, disconnected or removed, the <em>company </em>shall forthwith cut, disconnect or remove the same, if the person desiring this to be done has first left a written statement, signed by him, of the time when, and the place, described by reference to the crossings of streets or highways, where he wishes to remove said wires, at the office of the <em>company </em>in the city or town where such place is situated, seven days before the time so stated, or, if there is no such office, if he has deposited such statement in the post office, postage prepaid, and directed to the <em>company </em>at its office nearest to said place, ten days before the time mentioned in said statement. If the <em>company </em>neglects or refuses to cut, disconnect or remove wires, as hereinbefore provided, the inspector of wires, or the selectmen of a town having no such inspector, may cause the same to be cut, disconnected or removed, and the city or town may recover of the <em>company </em>in contract the expense of so doing\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u201cWhoever unlawfully and intentionally injures, molests or destroys any line, wire, pole, pier or abutment, or any of the materials or property of any <em>street railway company, </em>of any <em>electric railroad company, </em>or of <em>any city or town engaged in the manufacture and sale of electricity for light, heat or power </em>or of any <em>company, </em>owner or association <em>described in sections twenty-one and forty-three </em>shall be punished . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).

Sts. c. 109, \u00a7 17, a forerunner of G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 39. In A. <em>M. Richards Bldg. Moving Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Elec. Light Co. </em>188 Mass. 265, 267 (1905), it was held that the 1883 statute had made a privately owned electric company subject to the provisions of Pub. Sts. c. 109, \u00a7 17. Cities and towns were not generally authorized to construct or acquire electric plants until the enactment of St. 1891, c. 370.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The 1911 amendments added what is now the second sentence of G.
