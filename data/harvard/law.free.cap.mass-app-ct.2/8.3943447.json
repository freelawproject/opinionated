L. c. 123A, \u00a7 6 (as most recently amended by St. 1969, c. 838, \u00a7 58), the defendant, Leroy E. Jarvis, was found to be a sexually dangerous person and was committed to the treatment center at Bridgewater for from one day to life. The case <em>is </em>before us on the defendant\u2019s substitute bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-14\">On October 27, 1970, the defendant was sentenced to M.C.I., Concord, after pleading guilty to indictments charging \u201cassault to rape,\u201d an unnatural act, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and furnishing liquor to a minor. The sentences were concurrent. Thereafter, proceedings were begun under G. L. c. 123A and on May 13, 1971, the district attorney filed a petition for the defendant\u2019s commitment to the treatment center at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Bridgewater. At the hearing on the petition Dr. Aviles, a licensed physician specializing in psychiatry and acting as a senior psychiatrist at Bridgewater, and Dr. Friedman, a consulting psychiatrist, each testified on behalf of the Commonwealth that, in his opinion, the defendant was a sexually dangerous person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Lebeaux, a dipl\u00f3mate of the American Board of Psychiatry, appointed by the court and paid by the county, testified that, in his opinion, the defendant was not a sexually dangerous person. The defendant and Sandra Jarvis, his former wife, with whom he had four children, testified on his behalf. The defendant\u2019s criminal record was also introduced in evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bladsa, </em>362 Mass. 539 (1972). The only issue raised by the defendant\u2019s substitute bill of exceptions with which we need concern ourselves is whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that the defendant was a sexually dangerous person. Since we hold the evidence insufficient and that the petition must be dismissed, it is not necessary to deal with the defendant\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The elements of proof required for a finding that a defendant is a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d are set out in the definition, found in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Peterson, petitioner, </em>354 Mass. 110, 117 (1968), the Supreme Judicial Court said (answering a contention that the definition and particularly the word \u201cmisconduct\u201d were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>unconstitutionally vague): \u201cWhereas this word, if standing alone, might suggest that a person was sexually dangerous for almost any act which offended someone\u2019s notion of propriety (see <em>Musser </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>333 U. S. 95), <em>the statute sets forth clearly its meaning in the subsequent clauses. </em>The statutory definition requires [1] repetitive or compulsive behavior, [2] violence or aggression by an adult against a person under the age of sixteen and [3] a likelihood that injury will be [injflicted\u201d (emphasis supplied). Paraphrasing this in terms relevant to this case, commitment as a sexually dangerous person must be based on evidence of repetitive acts of sexual misconduct which are also violent or on evidence of behavior which is compulsive and violent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See 1959 Ann. Surv. of Mass. Law, \u00a7 10.3, p. 96. The Supreme Judicial Court went on to say in the <em>Peterson </em>case, \u201cThe statute reaches those persons whose <em>behavior has reasonably demonstrated </em>that they are such a danger to society as to require confinement. The language resembles that approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Minnesota ex rel. Pearson </em>v. <em>Probate Court of Ramsey County, </em>309 U. S. 270, 272-274. See <em>Sas </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>334 F. 2d 506, 514 (4th Cir.)\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>The court was thus careful to interpret the statute so as to specify a concrete basis in past sexual misconduct for \u201ca projection of future conduct\u201d <em>(Sarzen </em>v. <em>Gaughan, </em>489 F. 2d 1076, 1084 [1st Cir. 1973]), requiring \u201cevidence of past conduct pointing to probable consequences . . ..\u201d <em>Minnesota ex rel. Pearson </em>v. <em>Probate Court of Ramsey County, </em>309 U. S. 270, 274 (1940). This recognized the basically recidivist character of statutes of this kind. See <em>Specht </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>386 U. S. 605, 610 (1967); <em>Millard </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>406 F. 2d 964, 972 (D. C. Cir. 1968). The requirement for repetitive or compulsive sexual misconduct has been termed \u201ca comparatively plausible approach\u201d (Note, The Plight of the Sexual Psychopath: A Legislative Blunder and Judicial Acquiescence, 41 Notre Dame Lawyer 527, 530); it mitigates the \u201cinherently speculative nature of psychiatric predictions\u201d <em>(Sarzen </em>v. <em>Gaughan, </em>489 F. 2d 1076, 1086 [1st Cir. 1973], and material cited), and the \u201cvery real constitutional problems surrounding incarceration predicated only upon a supposed propensity to commit criminal acts.\u201d <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>418 F. 2d 1095, 1101 (D. C. Cir. 1969). See also <em>Tippett </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>436 F. 2d 1153, 1160 (4th Cir. 1971) (Sobeloff, J., concurring and dissenting). It thus goes at least some way in \u201csubstitu\u00ed [ing] functional legal criteria for the medical model . . ..\u201d Dershowitz, Psychiatry in the Legal Process: \u201cA Knife that Cuts Both Ways,\u201d in The Path of the Law from 1967, pp. 71, 83 (Sutherland ed. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Analyzing the record in terms of the explanation in the <em>Peterson </em>case, we find no evidence of repetitive or compulsive sexual misbehavior sufficient to provide a point of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>departure for a finding that the defendant is a sexually dangerous person. The defendant\u2019s criminal record does not indicate, and there was no other evidence of, any sexual misconduct except for the one incident of September 4, 1970. The defendant\u2019s criminal record contained mainly convictions for drunkenness and other minor offenses,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> none of which appear to have been sex related.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Nor was there sufficient evidence of \u201ccompulsive behavior.\u201d The convictions for \u201cassault to rape\u201d and \u201cunnatural act\u201d are not, without more, sufficient evidence of compulsive behavior. \u201c[A] sexual offense, such as rape . . . may not denote a sexual deviation. A charge such as indecent assault may comprise . . . sexually non-deviant acts such as accosting a woman in a park with \u2018normal\u2019 sexual aims.\u201d Sadoff, Sexually Deviated Offenders, 40 Temple L. Q. 305, 309, n. 15, quoting Gray and Mohr, Follow-up of Male Sexual Offenders, in Sexual Behavior and the Law, pp. 742, 743 (Slovenko ed. 1965). See also Cohen, Garofalo, Boucher and Seghorn, The Psychology of Rapists, 3 Seminars in Psychiatry, No. 3, 307, 311-312. It might well be, as the Legislature apparently felt, that a single act of sexual misconduct may be so bizarre and irrational as to permit the inference by a trier of fact that it was uncontrollable, and thus provide the basis for a determination that it was compulsive behavior. When such an act is also violent, there is a statutory basis for a prediction that the defendant is a sexually dangerous person. However, there was nothing in the testimony of the psychiatrists for the Commonwealth (the only evidence it produced apart from records) which indicated that the incident of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>September 4, 1970, manifested compulsive conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Some details of the incident came from Dr. Lebeaux, who testified \u201cthat Jarvis had been led into the crime . . . [by] another person who appeared to be a rather aggressive, authoritative figure . . ..\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that the evidence did not permit a finding that the incident of September 4, 1970, was the result of compulsive behavior; nor was there any evidence of other sexual misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained. Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b23-6\">These two psychiatrists had signed the report which was made after the observation period of not more than sixty days (G.L. c. 123A, \u00a7- 4) and on which the petition was based.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b23-7\"> \u201cThe words \u2018sexually dangerous person\u2019 as used in this chapter shall have the following meaning: \u2014 Any person whose misconduct in sexual matters indicates a general lack of power to control his sexual impulses, as evidenced by repetitive or compulsive behavior and either violence, or aggression by an adult against a victim under the age of sixteen years, and who as a result is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury on the objects of his uncontrolled or uncontrollable desires.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Since we do not find the requisite repetitive or compulsive behavior present and since there is no contention that the defendant was in any way involved with a child \u201cunder the age of sixteen years\u201d (the victim in the incident of September 4, 1970, was nineteen), we need not determine the scope of the requirement for \u201caggression by an adult against a victim under the age of sixteen years\u201d and its exact relationship to the other requirements.

Dr. Aviles indicated reliance on a conviction for \u201crobbery with knife\u201d in Connecticut, but the defendant introduced an official court record showing that there was no conviction and that the charge had been \u201cnolle pressed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Dr. Aviles testified on cross-examination by the defendant (as set out in the substitute bill of exceptions) \u201cthat according to the victim [\u2019s] . . . version of the crimes for which Jarvis was sentenced to Concord: she met Jarvis in a bar on a particular afternoon, she arrived at the bar at noontime; that at the bar she and a female companion met Jarvis and another person; that together they drank at that bar until 5:00 in the afternoon; that at that time the victim left her female companion and accompanied Jarvis and another out of the bar; that after leaving the bar, the victim, Jarvis and the other stopped off and purchased a case of beer; that together they went to the apartment of a Mr. [ GJ; that there they drank and danced for sometime.\u201d Dr. Friedman did not even mention the incident. Perhaps the failure of the Commonwealth's psychiatrists to concern themselves with the statutory requirements may have been the result of an erroneous view in this case by the staff of the treatment center that the statute does not require a finding of repetitive or compulsive conduct, but that these are merely relevant factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b27-8\">He further testified on cross-examination by the Commonwealth that he was aware that the records indicated (there was no objection; cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bladsa, </em>362 Mass. 539 [1972]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>1 Mass.
