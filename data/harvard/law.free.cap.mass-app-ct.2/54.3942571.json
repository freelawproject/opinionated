The defendants have appealed from a final decree which declared that the plaintiff has a prescriptive right (limited to use as a driveway) in so much (ten feet) of the driveway as is located on the defendants\u2019 land, which ordered the defendants to remove a wooden picket fence erected by them near and roughly parallel to the common boundary between the respective lots of the parties, and which enjoined the defendants from interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s use of the driveway in common with the defendants. The case is here on voluntary findings made by the trial judge and on a report of the evidence (which need not be recited in detail).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">1. There was no error in the judge\u2019s findings, in essence, that the plaintiff had sustained his burden of proving that his use of the driveway had been (a) open, (b) uninterrupted and (c) adverse to the defendants\u2019 predecessors in title (d) for a period of not less than twenty years (see <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Poch, </em>321 Mass. 321, 323 [1947]) prior to the defendants\u2019 acquisition of their lot in 1959, when the fence was erected.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>(a) There was no question that the uses made of the driveway by the plaintiff (and by at least two of his sons while they lived with him) had been open and notorious. See <em>LaChance </em>v. <em>First Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>301 Mass. 488, 490-491 (1938); <em>Nocera </em>v. <em>DeFeo, </em>340 Mass. 783 (1959). Contrast <em>Gadreault </em>v. <em>Hillman, </em>317 Mass. 656, 659, 661-662, 662-663 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">(b) The uses made by the plaintiff and by his sons may be characterized as fairly regular (see <em>Nocera </em>v. <em>DeFeo, </em>340 Mass. 783 [1959]; contrast <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Stavros, </em>348 Mass. 251, 262-263 [1964]; <em>Uliasz </em>v. <em>Gillette, </em>357 Mass. 96, 101-102 [1970]) and were punctuated (1) by annual deliveries of firewood (see <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Mars, </em>277 Mass. 122, 124 [1931]) and (2) by twice yearly deliveries of coal which was chuted into the cellar of the plaintiff\u2019s house from trucks which were driven into the driveway (as to which see <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>120 Mass. 340, 342 [1876]; <em>American Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Alexanderian, </em>338 Mass. 112, 114 [1958]) during the period from 1930 (or 1936) to 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">(c) The plaintiff was not bound by the allegations in his original bill to the general effect that his use of the driveway from 1930 to 1959 had been by virtue of an oral agreement with the defendants\u2019 predecessors in title (as to which see <em>Gadreault </em>v. <em>Hillman, </em>317 Mass. 656, 663 [1945]). Those allegations were deleted by an amendment allowed in advance of trial and were, therefore, no longer even evidence in the case. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Transit Authy. </em>345 Mass. 371, 373 (1963). The judge found (on ample uncontradicted evidence) that there had been no discussion or disputes between the plaintiff and the defendants\u2019 predecessors concerning the use of the driveway during the period from 1936 to 1959. His finding that the plaintiff\u2019s use had been adverse was grounded on the (here unrebutted) presumption that an unexplained use for twenty years which is open and uninterrupted is to be taken as adverse to the owner. See <em>American Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Alexanderian, </em>338 Mass. 112, 115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>(1958), and cases cited; <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Korsack, </em>343 Mass. 15, 17-19 (1961). Contrast <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Rabidou, </em>340 Mass. 91, 92-93 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">(d) The evidence with respect to uses which has been adverted to in (b) above supported the findings with respect to the necessary period of twenty years (G. L. c. 187, \u00a7 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">2. The plaintiff was not barred by laches, as pleaded by the defendants. We cannot say that the defendants, who were quite aware of the plaintiff\u2019s claim (see <em>Albano </em>v. <em>Puopolo, </em>309 Mass. 501, 509-510 [1941]; <em>Ottavia </em>v. <em>Savarese, </em>338 Mass. 330, 336-337 [1959]), were prejudiced by the nine-year delay in the plaintiff\u2019s bringing suit (compare <em>Albano </em>v. <em>Puopolo, </em>309 Mass. 501, 510 [1941]; <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Beal, </em>317 Mass. 750, 759 [1945]). The decree does not require the defendants to remove the paving which was laid on their side of the driveway following 1959 or to restore the surface of the ground to the 1959 grade. The relocation of the front and rear entrance steps to the defendants\u2019 house appears to have been occasioned and required by the defendants\u2019 conscious decision (evidenced by the erection of the fence) to use less of the width of the driveway than was available to them. See, generally, <em>Ferrone </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>311 Mass. 591, 595-596 (1942); <em>Ottavia </em>v. <em>Savarese, </em>338 Mass. 330, 335-337 (1959); <em>Brink </em>v. <em>Summers, </em>352 Mass. 786 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">3. In the admission of evidence there was no error which \u201cinjuriously affected the substantial rights of the [defendants]\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">4. No appeal was taken from, nor was any bill of exceptions prosecuted with respect to, the order or decree denying the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial. Accordingly, we ignore the motion, which presented no issue which has not already been discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
