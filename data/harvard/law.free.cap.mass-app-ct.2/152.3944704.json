Hayes with intent to murder him.\u201d The only exceptions which have been argued to us<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are concerned with the trial judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motions (1) for a directed verdict presented at the close of all the evidence and (2) to poll the jury with respect to and to declare a mistrial because of a certain newspaper article which was published on the morning of the second day of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">1. We summarize the evidence most favorable to the Commonwealth. On the day in question a correctional officer (the first officer) on duty in a cell block at the Massachusetts Gprrectional Institution at Walpole heard a scuffle on the third tier of the block, looked up at the tier, and saw the defendant (an inmate) pursuing one Richard Hayes (another inmate). The officer sounded an alarm. At about this time another inmate in a cell on the third tier saw the defendant run down the tier and wrestle Hayes to the floor. The first officer, upon being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>joined by several other officers, raced up the stairs to the third tier, where he observed the defendant crouched over Hayes, who was bleeding from what were later determined to be stab wounds in his neck and in the back of his left shoulder. A second officer who ran up the stairs with the first officer saw the defendant throw a knife off the third tier. The first officer heard a clang of metal on the bottom tier of the block in an area known as the \u201cflats.\u201d A third officer testified that shortly after he entered the block a knife fell to the flats. He retrieved the knife, which, on subsequent testing, revealed the presence of human blood. After Hayes had been escorted downstairs from the third tier a fourth officer found a knife sheath at the top of the stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument that such circumstantial evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction under the indictment asks us to weigh certain testimony of the defendant which the jury were admittedly not required to believe, points to certain matters which would have been helpful to the Commonwealth but which were not covered by the testimony of the first officer, and stresses certain laboratory tests which showed that the only type of blood found on the defendant\u2019s clothing was his and not that of Hayes. We cannot accept the defendant\u2019s argument. For the same reasons as those which were very recently stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lussier, </em>364 Mass. 414, 420-422 (1973), we are of the opinion that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury in finding the defendant guilty as charged. Accordingly, the exception to the denial of the motion for a directed verdict is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">2. The unsworn motion for a mistrial<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleged broadly that \u201c(b) massive publicity, specifically based upon statements of ... . [the district attorney] regarding misconduct of inmates at Walpole in general has made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Walpole inmate unable to get a fair trial; (c) the presiding Justice has discussed the disorder at Walpole with the press, and the defendant herein was specifically named and associated with these disorders and illegal activity; (d) Walpole MCI disorders have been front page news and television and radio lead story, on all channels and stations, before and during this trial . . ..\u201d The motion concluded with requests that the jury \u201cbe individually polled<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as to what they have heard and its effect upon their deliberations; be instructed not to read the papers and see media; and be discharged rather than sequestered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The motion was presented and denied at the opening of the second day of the trial, which was March 23, 1973, a Friday. The only matter put forward by the defendant in an effort to sustain his burden of proving the allegations of his motion (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>311 Mass. 82, 87-88 [1942]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co. </em>360 Mass. 188, 294-296 [1971]) was a newspaper article which, we are told, appeared in an edition of the Boston Record American published on the morning the motion was filed and which is set out in the margin of this opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The article was not attached to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the motion or marked as an exhibit; however, as the article appears in the bill of exceptions allowed by the trial judge (see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 31, as amended through St. 1953, c. 384), we shall assume that it was offered to the judge at the time of the hearing on the motion. Because the judge denied the request to poll the jurors with respect to the article, we shall also assume that the jurors saw the article (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crehan, </em>345 Mass. 609, 613 [1963]) and believed the statements contained therein to be true, including those attributed to the trial judge<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (see <em>Silverthorne </em>v. <em>United States, </em>400 F. 2d 627, 643 [9th Cir. 1968]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The principles by which we must be guided in determining whether the defendant was prejudiced, even in the absence of special instructions by the judge to disregard the article, have been stated often. \u201c[A motion] for a mistrial, on the basis of [a] publication alone . . . [is] addressed to the judge\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co. </em>360 Mass. 188, 297 (1971). See also <em>Worcester Tel. &amp; Gazette, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>354 Mass. 578, 580-581 (1968). \u201cMuch must be left to the discretion of the trial judge, and his denial of the motion implies a finding that the defendant had not been prejudiced.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>311 Mass. 82, 88 (1942). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>363 Mass. 102, 104 (1973). \u201cWhether a judge has abused his discretionary powers is to be determined by the special facts of each case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagan, </em>357 Mass. 585, 588 (1970). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co. </em>360 Mass. 188, 299 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The article in this particular case (n. 5) attributes no misconduct to the defendant himself, as opposed to that of other inmates. Nor does it identify the nature of the offense which resulted in the defendant\u2019s being incarcerated at Walpole or suggest any involvement by him in a pattern of criminal conduct. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co. </em>360 Mass. 188, 296-297, 298-299 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>363 Mass. 102, 105 (1973). By the time the jury (or any of them) could have read the article they had presumably heard the reading of the indictment, they had learned that the defendant was an inmate at Walpole, and they had heard testimony as to the salient features of the assault on Hayes. Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>pare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balakin, </em>356 Mass. 547, 554 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>363 Mass. 102, 105 (1973). The remarks attributed to the trial judge contained no expression of belief on his part as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant (contrast <em>People </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>37 Cal. 2d 792, 794-796, 799 [1951]) or the merits of any defense raised by him (contrast <em>Fouquette </em>v. <em>Bernard, </em>198 F. 2d 96, 99-100 [9th Cir. 1952]). The jury, which (as the defendant\u2019s counsel urged at oral argument) were by then serving in the third week of a regular sitting of the Superior Court at Dedham held for the transaction of criminal business (see G. L. c. 212, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 14A and 20; G. L. c. 213, \u00a7 6), could not have failed to realize that the case on trial was one of \u201ca series of cases involving crimes committed at Norfolk and Walpole.\u201d We see nothing in either of the last two paragraphs of the article which is susceptible of an interpretation that the judge felt frustrated by, or that the jury would be held for an additional week because of, anything done by this particular defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Based on our own independent evaluation of the circumstances <em>(Sheppard </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>384 U. S. 333, 362 [1966]), we concur in the finding of the trial judge, implicit in his denial of the motion for a mistrial, that the defendant was not prejudiced by the article; we perceive no abuse of discretion in the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-11\">We give no consideration to the numerous references in the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions to various portions of the trial transcript, which is not before us, physically or otherwise.
