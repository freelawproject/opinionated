L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, the defendant was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>victed of possession of heroin with intent to sell and was sentenced. He has briefed and argued three assignments of error concerning the denials of (1) his request to represent himself; (2) his motion to specify the name and address of the police informant, and (3) his motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">We summarize the evidence. At approximately 3:30 a.m. on January 5, 1972, police officers, having obtained a search warrant based on information supplied by an informant, went to the New Bedford apartment of the defendant\u2019s girl friend. The apartment occupied the entire second floor of a three-story building; the third story was apparently unoccupied. Present in the apartment at the time were the defendant, his girl friend and five children. The police officers proceeded to search the premises. Under a cushion were found 110 glassine bags; there was testimony that, when asked what he used the bags for, the defendant responded, \u201cWhat the hell do you think I use it for. I bag my dope in it.\u201d Two rolls of cellophane tape, cigarette papers, and twenty-one rectangular pieces of aluminum foil were also seized. Approximately $1,000 in cash was found in the defendant\u2019s trouser pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The police officers continued to search the area. In a light fixture located in the ceiling of the third floor hallway, directly above a child\u2019s desk, the officers found forty-six glassine envelopes containing heroin. Thereupon the defendant was informed that he was under arrest for possession of heroin with intent to sell. There was testimony that he replied, \u201cYou can\u2019t pin that on me, you didn\u2019t find it on me.\u201d There was also testimony that while the officers were conducting the search the defendant remarked, \u201cI got a Cadillac out in front, and I gave my mother a Cadillac, and it is up to,you to catch me. I break the law seven days a week and it is up to you to catch me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>1. Immediately before trial commenced the defendant\u2019s privately retained counsel requested permission to withdraw, explaining that the defendant had engaged a lawyer from Philadelphia who had not yet arrived but who was due in court that morning. The trial judge denied the request and ordered that a jury be em-panelled. Counsel for the defendant informed the judge that \u201cthe defendant would prefer to defend himself.\u201d That request was also denied, and an exception was taken.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury was then empanelled, and counsel for the defendant represented the defendant throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The defendant argues that the denial of his request to proceed pro se violated the constitutional right of an accused to defend himself. We are inclined to agree, at least to the extent that such right is secured by the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">There appears to be no controlling case which establishes that the right to proceed pro se is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>(see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dougherty, </em>473 F. 2d 1113, 1121 [D. C. Cir. 1972]; but see <em>United States ex rel. Maldonado </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>348 F. 2d 12, 15 [2d Cir. 1965], citing <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U. S. 269, 279 [1942]), and it would serve no purpose here to discuss the issue. We think the language of article 12 of the Declaration of Rights is unambiguous as to the existence of the right within the Commonwealth \u2014 \u201cAnd every subject shall have a right ... to be fully heard in his defence by himself, or his counsel, at his election.\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>360 Mass. 695, 699 (1971). (\u201cThe defendant did not ask to be allowed to proceed pro se, and he was therefore never denied <em>that </em>right\u201d [emphasis supplied].).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We think, however, that the right to conduct one\u2019s own defense is not wholly unqualified and that limitations placed on the Federal right apply with equal force to the cognate right under the Massachusetts Constitution. First, the request to proceed without counsel must be unequivocal. <em>United States ex rel. Maldonado </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>348 F. 2d 12, 15 (2d Cir. 1965). Compare <em>United States ex rel. Jackson </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>425 F. 2d 257, 259 (2d Cir. 1970), and <em>Meeks </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>482 F. 2d 465, 467 (9th Cir. 1973). Second, the request should be asserted before trial. \u201cOnce the trial has begun with the defendant represented by counsel, however, his right thereafter to discharge his lawyer and to represent himself is sharply curtailed.\u201d <em>United States ex. rel. Maldonado </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, </em>at 15, and cases cited. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Catino, </em>403 F. 2d 491, 497 (2d Cir. 1968). See also <em>Lamoureux </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 556, 560 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ransom, </em>358 Mass. 580, 585 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 545, 547-548 (1973) (all concerning the right to compel a change of counsel during trial). Third, and perhaps most important, the trial judge should be satisfied that the right is being exercised knowingly and intelligently, and not for an ulterior purpose. These considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>require that the judge conduct some sort of inquiry once the request is made. The motivation of the accused in making the request should be examined, and the accused should be apprised of the pitfalls in proceeding pro se. See S. J. C. Rule 3:10, 351 Mass. 791 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In the circumstances presented in the case at bar, it appears to us that the request was sufficiently unequivocal and was timely asserted. However, the judge conducted no meaningful inquiry after being informed that the defendant preferred to defend himself. His denial of the request seems to have been based on the ground that the defendant was seeking delay; but, as he made no finding to that effect and as it appears that the defendant was willing to go ahead with the trial without delay, we cannot affirm the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Accordingly, we must reverse the conviction and order a new trial. The situation presented here is not an appropriate one for the application of the harmless constitutional error standard established in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 18, 21-24 (1967), and in <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>407 U. S. 371, 372-373 (1972). On that point we are in agreement with the reasoning of the United States Court of Appeals in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dougherty, </em>473 F. 2d 1113, 1127-1130 (D. C. Cir. 1972). Although the defendant makes no claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and although it appears to us that the defendant was capably represented throughout the proceedings, we think that \u201ceven in cases where the accused is harming himself by insisting on conducting his own defense, respect for individual autonomy requires that he be allowed to go to jail under his own banner if he so desires and if he makes the choice \u2018with eyes open.\u2019\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Maldonado </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">2. We consider the remaining two assignments of error in view of the fact that those matters are likely to arise at retrial. We consider both to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>a. <em>Denial of the motion to specify the name of the informant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">A judge other than the trial judge held a pre-trial hearing on this motion. He found, among other things, that the informant had assisted the police in narcotics investigations over a two-year period and that he continued to do so; that he was reliable; that he did not participate in the offense charged; that to disclose his identity \u201cwould jeopardize the informant\u2019s safety and even his life\u201d; and that \u201cthe public interest is served by non-disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Those findings were warranted by the evidence and will not be disturbed. They indicate that the judge properly applied the balancing test expressed in <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 62 (1957). We fail to see how disclosure of the informant\u2019s name would have been relevant or helpful to the defense, so as to bring this case within the exception to the well established privilege of the government \u201cto withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law.\u201d Id. at 59. <em>Worthington </em>v. <em>Scribner, </em>109 Mass. 487, 488-489 (1872). Contrast the <em>Roviaro </em>case, <em>supra, </em>with <em>McCray </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>386 U.S. 300, 308-314 (1967). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ennis, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 499 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">b. <em>Denial of the motion for a directed verdict.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The defendant asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. He argues that, as the heroin was discovered in a hallway one flight above his girl friend\u2019s apartment, the Commonwealth failed to show that the defendant was in constructive possession of the heroin. We disagree. We think the evidence introduced by the Commonwealth on this point was sufficient to permit the case to go to the jury. There was evidence that the defendant had been at the apartment on numerous occasions, that clothing found there belonged to the defendant and that the defendant\u2019s children were sleeping in the apartment at the time of his arrest. Although the control exercised by the defendant over the area may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>have been exclusive, there was other evidence in the case, including the defendant\u2019s utterances, from which the jury could have found that the defendant was in fact constructively in possession of the heroin. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guerro, </em>357 Mass. 741, 752 (1970). Contrast <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>320 F. 2d 1, 2 (2d Cir. 1963), and <em>Hallman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>320 F. 2d 669 (D. C. Cir. 1963), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>445 F. 2d 701, 703 (D. C. Cir. 1971). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fron-gillo, </em>359 Mass. 132, 138 (1971), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>358 Mass. 817 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"at-dedup-0\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Other assignments of error, not having been argued, are deemed waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We excerpt portions of the pre-trial colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">Counsel for the defendant: \u201cYour Honor, I would like to orally request permission to withdraw as counsel for Mr. Mott in this matter, as he has informed me that he has counsel who is due here in court at ten o\u2019clock this morning from Philadelphia to try his case.
