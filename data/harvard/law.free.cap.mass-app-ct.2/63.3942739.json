The Superior Court decree was in conformity with the decision of the reviewing board (board), which had affirmed and adopted as its own the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>findings and decision of the single member. We must therefore look to the single member\u2019s decision to determine whether the action of the board was correct. <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 679-680 (1970). <em>Russo\u2019s Case, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 206 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The employee\u2019s injury has been the subject of several proceedings before the Industrial Accident Board. As those proceedings are relevant to a consideration of the issues in this case, we proceed to summarize them. On March 24, 1961, while working as a mechanic, the employee injured his right hand. Although the employee recovered from the physical effects of his accident, he remained unable to work because of feelings of \u201clight-headedness, dizziness and weakness of his legs.\u201d His condition was diagnosed in 1962 as a \u201c [pjsychoneurosis-anxiety reaction, stress: severe; fear of reinjury at work.\u201d The employee received total incapacity and dependency compensation from 1961 until 1965. In September, 1965, a single member found the employee capable of performing work and authorized the insurer to discontinue compensation. This decision was modified by the board, which found the employee partially incapacitated as of that date and awarded him compensation. In September, 1968, the statutory limit on total and partial incapacity compensation was reached<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and the payments to the employee were discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">At some date subsequent to April 1, 1966, the employee initiated a further proceeding in which he claimed total incapacity compensation dating from April 1, 1966, and permanent and total incapacity compensation from September, 1968, when his partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>incapacity payments had been discontinued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The single member, however, ruled that the employee had failed to sustain his burden of proof and dismissed the claim. This decision was affirmed and adopted by the board. Both the single member and the board explicitly reserved the employee\u2019s rights subsequent to the date of the final hearing in the proceeding (April 17, 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Approximately two weeks after the board rendered its decision denying the employee\u2019s claims for the 1966-1970 period, the employee initiated a new proceeding, on this occasion requesting total and permanent incapacity compensation dating from April 17, 1970. His claim was allowed by the single member on May 30, 1972, in a decision which was subsequently adopted and affirmed by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">It is the contention of the insurer that the single member\u2019s 1972 finding of total and permanent incapacity was erroneous as a matter of law <em>(Hachadourian\u2019s Case, </em>340 Mass. 81, 85 [1959]; <em>Sutherland\u2019s Case, ante, </em>58 [1974]),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as there was no evidence to indicate that the employee\u2019s condition had changed since 1970, when, as was found, he was <em>not </em>permanently and totally incapacitated. The insurer relies principally upon <em>Foley\u2019s Case, </em>358 Mass. 230 (1970), in which a board finding of total and permanent incapacity was reversed. The court made comments as follows (at page 232): \u201cOur review of the transcript of the testimony at the 1964 hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>leads us to conclude that it does not support the single member\u2019s finding that the employee is \u2018totally disabled within the intent and meaning of \u00a7 34A of the Act.\u2019 Since the employee had been found in 1960 to be only partially incapacitated the burden in the 1964 proceedings was upon him to prove he was now totally incapacitated as a result of his accident. <em>Davis\u2019s Case, </em>304 Mass. 530, 534 [1939]. <em>Hummer\u2019s Case, </em>317 Mass. 617, 622 [1945]. We find no evidence to indicate any change in the employee\u2019s condition from 1960 to 1964 not due to advancing age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The only evidence of a change in the present employee\u2019s condition between 1970 and 1972 was his testimony and the testimony of one Dr. Rizzo, a physician called by him. The employee testified that his \u201ccondition\u201d subsequent to April, 1970, was \u201c [n]ot the same. Maybe just slightly worse at times,\u201d but said that his \u201csymptoms\u201d were the same in 1972 as they had been four years earlier. These comments were at best speculative and perhaps contradictory; hence they must be disregarded. <em>Perangelo\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 59, 65 (1931). <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 365, 368 (1932). <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 747, 749-750 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Dr. Rizzo\u2019s testimony on the issue of change in condition was equally insubstantial. Asked whether the employee had given him any indication that his condition had worsened in the last two or three years the witness answered, \u201cA hint of it ... He expresses discouragement, low morale and feelings of not being much good.\u201d This testimony must also be disregarded as speculative, especially in light of other testimony by the same witness that the employee\u2019s \u201cfeelings are similar to what they were following the accident and only made worse because it is now eleven years later.\u201d Dr. Rizzo was also asked whether the employee\u2019s medical history indicated a change of condition since his accident in 1961. He replied, \u201cIt got progressively worse; eleven years have elapsed. That makes a big difference.\u201d To the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>that this opinion was relied upon by the single member, it must be noted that it is in express contradiction of the findings, in earlier proceedings, that the employee was totally disabled from 1961 to 1965, but only partially disabled as of September, 1965. It is also apparent from reported testimony and from documents incorporated in the record of this case that Dr. Rizzo, who cited findings by an impartial examiner and two other psychiatrists in support of his opinion, seriously misread the findings of those experts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This serves further to undermine the adequacy of his testimony. \u201c [A]n opinion given by an expert will be disregarded where it amounts to no more than mere speculation or a guess from subordinate facts that do not give adequate support to the conclusion reached.\u201d <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 747, 751 (1958). <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Egbert, </em>360 Mass. 90, 92 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We conclude that the above summarized testimony does not constitute evidence of a change in the employee\u2019s condition between April 17, 1970, the date of the final evidentiary hearing concerning his previous claim, and May 18, 1972, the date on which evidence was heard in the present case. As there was no other evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>support the single member\u2019s finding of total and permanent incapacity, his and the board\u2019s decisions were erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The decree entered by the Superior Court is reversed and a new decree is to be entered denying compensation for the period from April 17, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\">G.

His claim to permanent and total incapacity compensation was filed pursuant to G.L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A (as amended through St. 1959, c. 566, \u00a7 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\">The insurer also argues that a psychoneurosis such as was diagnosed in the present case cannot serve as the basis for a claim under G.L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A. In light of the view we take of this case we find it unnecessary to decide this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Dr. Rizzo stated in a medical report incorporated in the record that: \u201cOne impartial examiner [Dr. Charles Benedetti] saw the claimant four times in consultation and each time he reported Mr. McEwen to be totally and permanently disabled. The examinations conducted by Drs. Maxwell MacDonald and Leo Alexander yielded essentially the same findings.\u201d The impartial examiner in fact reported on February 7, 1966, that the employee was \u201ccapable of some type of work.\u201d On May 21, 1968, the same examiner gave an opinion that \u201cin his present state\u201d the employee was \u201cunemployable\u201d but that \u201cthis condition need not lead to a permanent and total disability.\u201d Dr. MacDonald reported on April 3, 1963, that the employee was then totally disabled but \u201cshould recover and return to work with proper handling.\u201d In the course of the April, 1970, hearing Dr. Alexander testified that in 1969 he had diagnosed the employee as suffering from \u201cdepression with phobic features\u201d; however, he suggested intensive treatment, a recommendation inconsistent with the diagnosis imputed to him by Dr. Rizzo.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
