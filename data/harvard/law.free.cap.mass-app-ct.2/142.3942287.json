L. c. 231A, \u00a7 1). The plaintiff, trustee of the Berkeley Trust, seeks a determination that a notice by the defendant Merchants Mutual Insurance Company (insurer) cancelling fire insurance on property owned by the trust was invalid. The plaintiff also seeks a determination that the resulting entry on the property by the Warren Five Cents Savings Bank of Peabody (bank), the holder of a first mortgage thereon, was consequently invalid, as was the subsequent entry by the defendants Allen B. Schwartz and Duco Associates, Inc., joint holders of a second mortgage (second mortgagee). In addition the plaintiff seeks damages from the insurer for wrongful cancellation and from the bank for wrongful possession. The case was referred to a master who filed a report, limited to an accounting, and thereafter a final report which incorporated the first report and to which were appended the plaintiff\u2019s objections to the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>report and summaries of evidence relating to certain of the objections. The court confirmed the master\u2019s report and entered a final decree declaring that the insurer\u2019s cancellation of the policies on the plaintiff\u2019s premises \u201cwas valid and in accordance with the provisions of the insurance contract between the petitioner and the . . . [insurer],\u201d that the bank\u2019s consequent possession of the premises was justified by its mortgage, and that the possession thereafter taken by the second mortgagee was also valid. The decree further declared the indebtedness of the plaintiff to the second mortgagee as of October 29, 1970, and that none of the defendants was liable to the plaintiff in respect to any matter alleged in the bill. The case is here on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from an interlocutory decree confirming the master\u2019s report, from an order discharging a lis pendens and from the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The pertinent facts from the master\u2019s report (including the exhibits incorporated therein) are as follows: The plaintiff mortgaged the property in question on October 2, 1967, to the bank to secure a note for $116,500 payable in monthly installments of $1,292 to cover principal, interest and taxes. On December 11, 1968, the plaintiff gave a second mortgage to secure his note for $10,000 to the second mortgagee. The mortgage to the bank contained a covenant \u201c [t]o insure in sums and in companies satisfactory to the mortgagee and for its benefit .. . against fire . . ..\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 23, 1968, two fire insurance policies on the property were issued by the insurer, each for $60,000 and each for a period of three years. On October 30 a premium of $945 for each policy was paid, covering the entire three year period. Thereafter, about December 31, 1968, the premium on each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>these two policies was increased to $1,278, and the plaintiff was billed for the difference; the plaintiff did not pay it in spite of subsequent invoices sent to him. On August 29, 1969, the insurer sent cancellation notices covering the two policies to the bank and the plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The bank received its notices on September 3 and during the first week of September advised the plaintiff of the cancellations and asked him to see to it that the property was insured. On September 10 the assistant treasurer of the bank told the plaintiff that all three policies had been cancelled and, as the master found, \u201crepeated essentially the content of the [bank\u2019s] letter of 9/3/69\u201d which it had sent to the plaintiff and which had stated that \u201cfailure to maintain satisfactory fire insurance coverage ... is a default of your mortgage . . ..\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">On September 16, 1969, the bank entered into possession (\u201cproperly and rightfully,\u201d the master found), notified the plaintiff, hired a firm to manage the property and placed insurance on the property adequate to cover the amount of the mortgage. Thereafter, on October 8, the insurer reinstated the two insurance policies, and on October 10 counsel for the bank advised the plaintiff by letter that it had received notice of the reinstatement and was in the process of preparing a statement of its expenses and information concerning the \u201cstatus of the account.\u201d By letter of October 20 the bank\u2019s attorney notified the plaintiff that he had been instructed to commence foreclosure proceedings and suggested that the plaintiff \u201cpay up and avoid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>expense involved in foreclosure.\u201d By letter of October 21 the bank notified the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that it was prepared to turn over the property to the plaintiff upon payment of $2,778.54, which was itemized, plus \u201cany legal fees in connection with the matter.\u201d The letter also advised the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that \u201c [t]he account has been turned over to our attorney to start foreclosure proceedings, and unless the above total is paid by October 31, 1969, he will be instructed to proceed accordingly.\u201d The plaintiff, however, made no further payments to the bank; his last payment was on September 12, 1969, representing the monthly payment due on August 15, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The bank remained in possession until December 5, 1969, when the second mortgagee took possession because of a default in monthly payments, the last payment to the second mortgagee having also been made on September 12, 1969. The second mortgagee paid the bank the amount due from the plaintiff for the period, September 15, 1969, to December 5, 1969, and thereafter managed the property and continued making the monthly payments due to the bank from the plaintiff. As of October 29, 1970, the plaintiff owed the second mortgagee a total of $24,225.65, representing the principal of the second mortgage note in the amount of $10,000 plus interest thereon, management expenses, and payments made to the bank, the latter two items continuing to (at least) the date of the master\u2019s report. In addition, the master found that there was owing from the plaintiff to the second mortgagee $1,750 for legal fees, making a total of $25,975.65. On March 15, 1970, the second mortgagee advertised a foreclosure auction sale of the property to take place on March 19, 1970. On March 17, 1970, the bill for declaratory relief in this case was entered and a temporary restraining order issued.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s primary attack is on the declaration in the decree that the notices of cancellation by the insurer were valid, and from that he argues that the bank wrongfully took possession. We agree that the cancellation notices were invalid as between the plaintiff and the insurer; but it does not follow that the bank\u2019s possession was wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">1. <em>The cancellation notices to the plaintiff. </em>The insurance policies contained the standard form cancellation clause<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as required by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 99 (prior to St. 1969, c. 425, \u00a7 1). That clause required that any cancellation notice should either be accompanied by a tender of the unearned premium or state that the unearned premium would be refunded on demand. The notices given by the insurer to the plaintiff list four statements concerning the status of his premium, two relevant if the premium has not been paid,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and two relevant if a return of unearned premium is due.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Each statement is preceded by a small box, and the following note appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>below: \u201cAGENT NOTE: The above additional information must appear on original copy of Cancellation Notice mailed to the Insured and on the carbon copies. Place an \u2018X\u2019 in the box at the left of the condition applying.\u201d No \u201cX\u201d was placed in any of the boxes on the cancellation notices sent to the plaintiff, and the amounts were left blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">It is clear from the master\u2019s report that when the cancellation notices were sent there was an \u201cexcess of paid premium . . . above the pro rata premium for the expired time.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These unearned premiums were not' tendered \u2014 as appears from the failure to check the first statement under the heading, \u201cPREMIUM PAID\u201d (fn. 8) \u2014 and the failure to check the last statement indicated, if anything, that nothing would be refunded on demand. The notices of cancellation were thus ineffective to cancel the insurer\u2019s liability on the policies to the plaintiff. \u201cA notice of cancellation of insurance must be definite and certain. . . . Conditions imposed with respect to giving notice must be strictly complied with . . . [citing <em>Michelson </em>v. <em>Franklin Fire Ins. Co. </em>252 Mass. 336, 340 (1925)].\u201d <em>Gulesian </em>v. <em>Senibaldi, </em>289 Mass. 384, 387 (1935). <em>Fields </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>353 Mass. 706 (1968). See <em>White </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>352 Mass. 655, 657 (1967). And \u201c [compliance with the provision of the policy that the notice of cancellation state that the excess premium will be refunded on demand is essential to a valid cancellation upon notice.\u201d Couch, Insurance (2d ed.) \u00a7 67:155, p. 489. 43 Am. Jur. 2d, Insurance, \u00a7 405, p. 450. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>While we have found no case in which the Supreme Judicial Court has dealt with these specific circumstances, our decision is in accord with those from other jurisdictions. See <em>Petersen </em>v. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>131 Neb. 128, 137 (1936), collecting cases from a number of other jurisdictions; <em>Allied Concord Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Sterling Ins. Co. </em>251 S. C. 38, 40-41 (1968); <em>Pellets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Millers Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>241 So. 2d 550, 553 (La. App. 1970), cert. den. 257 La. 607 (1971). The case of <em>First Natl. Bank in Chicago Heights </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>350 F. 2d 577 (7th Cir. 1965), cited by the insurer, is distinguishable since the policies in that case had been surrendered with the consent of the insured, who thus in effect waived any defect in the notice. See <em>Michelson </em>v. <em>Franklin Fire Ins. Co. </em>252 Mass. 336 (1925), in which the court, after holding that provisions for cancellation had not been strictly complied with, sent the case back for a new trial on the question whether there had been a surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">2. <em>The bank\u2019s possession. </em>Though the cancellations were not sufficient to relieve the insurer of its obligations to the insured, it does not follow that the bank, upon receipt of notices from the insurer that the policies were being cancelled, was not entitled to take possession. Whether or not the cancellation notices sent to the bank were invalid as between the bank and the insurer, which we need not determine, the bank was not required to attempt at its peril to decide the matter. The bank was clearly within its rights in advising the plaintiff that it considered the insurance coverage to be unsatisfactory and to constitute a ground for treating the mortgage as in default. Insurance in a company which was in effect disavowing liability could hardly be said to be such as \u201cought to satisfy any reasonable mortgagee.\u201d <em>McCombs </em>v. <em>Elmes, </em>197 Mass. 19, 21 (1907). <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>153 Fla. 535 (1943). The bank could therefore, as it did, regard the cancellations and the subsequent temporizing by the plaintiff (who did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>have the insurance restored until October 8) as a breach of the covenant in the mortgage \u201c [t]o insure ... in companies satisfactory to the mortgagee\u201d as well as a breach of the statutory condition. The bank\u2019s entry and possession on September 16, 1969, was therefore proper. No formal notice or demand was necessary. <em>Joyner </em>v. <em>Lenox Sav. Bank, </em>322 Mass. 46, 53 (1947). See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>333 Mass. 155, 159 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">3. <em>Damages. </em>The plaintiff contends that he is entitled to damages caused by the wrongful cancellation and objected to the master\u2019s report on the ground that, as a matter of law, the entire liability of the plaintiff to the second mortgagee, found by the master, was due to the wrongful cancellation of the policies by the insurer. But the master\u2019s report makes no finding whether or to what extent the plaintiff\u2019s liability to the second mortgagee resulted from the cancellation of the insurance policies, which were reinstated in about a month. Further, no findings were made as to the effect, if any, of the possession, rightfully taken by the bank and the second mortgagee, and the acts or omissions of the plaintiff. Nor did the plaintiff make \u201ca motion to recommit with directions to make [such] findings.\u201d <em>Sheppard Envelope Co. </em>v. <em>Arcade Malleable Iron Co. </em>335 Mass. 180, 184 (1956), and cases cited. We therefore do not modify the provision of the final decree that \u201cthe respondents are not liable to the petitioner in respect to any matters alleged in the [b]ill of [c]omplaint.\u201d At law, the plaintiff would be entitled to at least nominal damages on account of the cancellations in breach of the insurance contracts. See <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Bunar, </em>328 Mass. 398, 403 (1952); Annot., 34 A. L. R. 3d 385, 393-398; Couch, Insurance (2d ed.) \u00a7 67:428, p. 653. But in the circumstances of this case in which there was no proof that any damage arose from the breach of contract \u201c [e]quity pays no attention to nominal damages.\u201d <em>Fred T. Ley &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Sagalyn, </em>302 Mass. 488, 495 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>(1939). <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>White, </em>328 Mass. 653 (1952). Cf. <em>DiNardo </em>v. <em>Dovidio, </em>312 Mass. 398, 404-405 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The plaintiff also contends that he is entitled to damages because \u201cthe bank conducted its possession negligently in that it failed to comply with the requirements of G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 20 for an accounting.\u201d We are of the opinion that \u00a7 20, which \u201cappears under the subtitle \u2018Redemption\u2019\u201d <em>(Krikorian </em>v. <em>Grafton Co-operative Bank, </em>312 Mass. 272, 276 [1942]) see G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 21, 22, 24), cannot (without more; cf. <em>Sandler </em>v. <em>Silk, </em>292 Mass. 493, 498 [1935]) be made the basis of a cause of action which, as the plaintiff\u2019s brief indicates, is essentially in tort and unconnected with a claim for redemption \u2014 which this bill is not \u2014 or with a similar claim involving the satisfaction of the mortgage debt, e.g., a suit for a deficiency <em>(City Inst. for Sav. v. Kelil, </em>262 Mass. 302, 307 [1928]) or for a surplus <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Newburyport Five Cents Sav. Bank, </em>311 Mass. 377, 386-387 [1942]). See Osborne, Mortgages (2d ed. 1970) \u00a7 165, p. 287; Glenn, Mortgages (1943) \u00a7 206, p. 1035. The purpose of \u00a7 20 is to enable the mortgagor to make a proper tender; but whether or not a proper tender is made does not affect the original possession taken for default or a subsequent sale. <em>Sandler </em>v. <em>Green, </em>287 Mass. 404, 407 (1934); the court said, \u201cSuch a tender gave the plaintiffs no rights at law, but merely furnished them the foundation for an equitable remedy by suit for redemption under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 244, \u00a7 21, of which they have not, on this record, availed themselves. Nor are the plaintiffs seeking here the equitable relief under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 244, \u00a7 22, which may be had without tender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In accordance with this opinion, the final decree is modified (a) by striking paragraphs 1 and 2 and substituting instead the following paragraph: \u201c1. That the notices dated August 29, 1969, given to the petitioner by the respondent Merchants Mutual Insurance Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>purporting to cancel insurance policies numbered FE214676 and FE214677 on petitioner\u2019s property located at 458 Beacon Street, Boston, Massachusetts, were in violation of the standard form cancellation clause in those policies and G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 99 (prior to St. 1969, c. 425, \u00a7 1) and were therefore ineffective to cancel those policies.\u201d and (b) by renumbering paragraphs 3 to 8 inclusive to be paragraphs 2 to 7 inclusive, and as so modified the final decree is affirmed. The appeal from the interlocutory decree confirming the master\u2019s report and the appeal from the order allowing a motion to discharge the lis pendens raise no questions not disposed of in this opinion; the interlocutory decree is affirmed and, treating the order allowing the motion to discharge the lis pendens as a decree, it is also affirmed. Costs of appeal are not to be awarded to any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\">A cancellation notice was also sent on a third policy written July 18, 1968. This cancellation has not been regarded as material by the parties, perhaps because the two policies of October 23, 1968, were in sums sufficient to cover the mortgage debt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">While the letter of September 3 referred specifically only to the policy issued on July 18, 1968 (see fn. 3), there is nothing to indicate that this in any way misled the plaintiff to his prejudice prior to September 10 when, at the latest as appears from the master\u2019s report, the matter was clarified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">That mortgage was also made \u201cupon the STATUTORY CONDITION\u201d (G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 20), which includes a similar provision that the mortgagor \u201cshall keep the buildings . . . insured against fire in a sum not less than the amount secured by the mortgage ... for the benefit of the mortgagee . . . and assigns, in such form and at such insurance offices as they shall approve . . ..\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We are informed that on June 21, 1971, there was a foreclosure sale and auction and that the property was sold pursuant to the second mortgage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u201cThis policy may be cancelled at any time by this company by giving to the insured and to any mortgagee to whom this policy is payable a 10 day\u2019s written notice of cancellation with or without tender of the excess of paid premium above the pro rata premium for the expired time, which excess, if not tendered, shall be refunded on demand. <em>Notice of cancellation shall state that said excess premium (if not tendered) will be refunded on demand\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u201cNON-PAYMENT OF PREMIUM</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">\u201c1.

He also found that the policies were effective on October 22 of 1968 for a term of three years, and that they were cancelled on August 29, 1969, about twenty-eight per cent of the way into the term. Thus it would appear that the \u201cpro rata premium for the expired time\u201d on each policy (see fn. 6) was twenty-eight per cent of $1,278, or about $358, while the \u201cpaid premium\u201d was $945, leaving an \u201cexcess\u201d of about $587 to be returned to the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
