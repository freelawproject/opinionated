The case is before us on a report of material facts and designated portions of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>The defendants, Fred B. Harney, Jr., and Shirley J. Harney, own a parcel of land located between Route 134 and Main Street in Dennis. The bulk of their property lies within an \u201cunrestricted\u201d zoning district.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the portion of their property which borders on Main Street was, at the time of the hearing, zoned \u201cresidential\u201d to a depth of 150 feet from the street. The town\u2019s zoning by-law provided that \u201c [i]n a residential district no building or premises shall be used for any purpose\u201d except certain enumerated uses with which we are not here concerned. Also allowed was \u201c[accessory use on the same lot with and customarily incident to any . . . permitted uses and not detrimental to a residential neighborhood</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The defendants operate a business which is located on Route 134 within the unrestricted portion of their property. The subject of the present dispute is a roadway constructed by the defendants which runs through both the residential and the unrestricted areas of their land from Main Street to Route 134. A judge of the Superior Court found that the road \u201chas been used as an accessory roadway to [the defendants\u2019] place of business ever since its construction . . . [and] constitutes an additional means of access to [their] place of business.\u201d Ruling that such a use of the residentially zoned portion of the defendants\u2019 land was illegal under the town\u2019s zoning bylaw, he enjoined further use or construction of an access road inside the residential strip and ordered the defendants to erect a barricade adequate to prevent public use of that portion of the road which fell within the strip.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The use of the portion of the defendants\u2019 land lying within the residential zone as an access road to a commercial enterprise lying within the unrestricted zone clearly does not fall within any of the uses permitted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>residential zone by the town\u2019s zoning by-law. See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Braintree, </em>350 Mass. 559, 561 (1966); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>351 Mass. 375, 381 (1966). The defendants have sought to distinguish the <em>Harrison </em>case on the ground that the road at issue is used by the public to gain access to other residential and commercial property in the town. It is doubtful whether the designated portion of the evidence affords a basis for modifying the judge\u2019s finding on this issue. Even if it did, however, the defendants would not prevail, since under the terms of the zoning by-law a qualifying use must itself be residential in nature or must be accessory to a permitted use <em>on the same lot. </em>Employment of the defendants\u2019 land as a public way qualifies under neither of these criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Although we do not accept the defendants\u2019 contention that the present decree<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is impossible to enforce, we do believe that compliance with the by-law could be assured by means less drastic than the erection of a \u201cbarricade,\u201d for instance by the installation of posts and a chain or of a locked gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The final decree is to be modified by striking out paragraphs 1, 3, and 4 thereof and by substituting for paragraph 1 the following: \u201c1. The respondents, their agents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>or servants are permanently restrained and enjoined, except as provided in paragraph 2 of this decree, from using or permitting the use of any part of the land owned by the respondents, beginning at Main Street, South Dennis, Massachusetts and extending easterly a distance of 150 feet, as an access roadway to the respondents\u2019 place of business and from further constructing said access roadway on such land.\u201d It is further modified by adding the following sentence to paragraph 2. \u201cThe barricade may be removable in nature, but the respondents are to keep the same in place or locked at all times except when used by themselves or by bona fide residents of t;he dwelling presently located on the Main Street portion of the respondents\u2019 property, subject to such modification by the court as changed circumstances may make reasonable.\u201d As so modified the decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-15\">Richard D. Bush, a property owner in the town of Dennis, was permitted to intervene as a plaintiff in the suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\">In an \u201cunrestricted\u201d district the zoning by-law permitted \u201cany use . . . residential . . . business or industrial, which is legal, proper, and not otherwise regulated or forbidden.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The final decree provided in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u201cThe cause came on for further hearing, and it was argued by counsel, and upon consideration thereof, it is ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">\u201c1.
