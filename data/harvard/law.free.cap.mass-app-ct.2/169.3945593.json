Thereafter the judge ordered the entry of a verdict for the defendant under leave reserved. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 120. The plaintiff duly excepted to that order. The case is before us not only on the plaintiff\u2019s bill of exceptions, but also on the defendant\u2019s exception to the allowance of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to file its bill of exceptions late.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">1. We first consider the defendant\u2019s exception. In the case at bar counsel for the plaintiff failed to file a bill of exceptions within twenty days following the entry of the verdict as required by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 113, in its original form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, counsel for the plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a bill of exceptions late, with a proposed bill attached, as provided by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 113 (as amended by St. 1945, c. 328).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a hearing on the motion, the judge made findings, concluded that \u201cthe attorney for the plaintiff had duly claimed exceptions and that he failed, through inadvertence, to file the Bill of Exceptions within the twenty-day period\u201d, and allowed both the motion and the bill. The defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>We think the motion was properly allowed. Section 113, as amended, authorizes a judge to allow the late filing of a specific bill of exceptions (and to allow the bill) if the failure to file it seasonably is due to \u201cinadvertence.\u201d <em>Raymond Coughlin Elec. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Spear Constr. Corp. </em>350 Mass. 407, 409 (1966). Here the judge found such inadvertence. His subsidiary findings adequately support that conclusion. \u201cThe word \u2018inadvertence\u2019 . . . embraces the effect of inattention, the result of carelessness, oversight, mistake, or fault of negligence and the condition or character of being inadvertent, inattentive, or heedless.\u201d <em>Tremont Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Burack, </em>235 Mass. 398, 402 (1920). See also <em>DeVincent Ford Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>First Mass. Corp. </em>336 Mass. 448, 451 (1957). From our review of the judge\u2019s findings it appears that the conduct of the plan tiff\u2019s counsel was within those parameters. Compare <em>Hackney </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>339 Mass. 605, 608 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">2. We now consider the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the order for the entry of a verdict for the defendant under leave reserved. It is well settled that the test for reviewing the correctness of such an order is the same test that is applied in the case of a motion for a directed verdict <em>(O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>354 Mass. 131, 132 [1968]) \u2014 \u201cwhether the evidence in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff could rightly be found to support the contentions essential to the maintenance of his cause of action.\u201d <em>Petrangelo </em>v. <em>Pollard, </em>356 Mass. 696, 697 (1970), quoting from <em>Holton </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>291 Mass. 513, 515 (1935). Thus, in an action alleging negligence, the judge\u2019s order \u201cwill be upheld only if on the pleadings the evidence (a) did not warrant a finding that the defendant was negligent, or (b) required a finding that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Davidonis </em>v. <em>Levielle, </em>356 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Mass. 716 (1969). In this case contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff was not established as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We summarize the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>345 Mass. 588, 589 [1963]; <em>Petrangelo </em>v. <em>Pollard, supra, </em>at 697), to determine therefrom whether support could be found for the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the defendant negligently caused a water pipe to break, as a result of which the plaintiff\u2019s property was damaged by water.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The plaintiff corporation, engaged in the leather business, was a tenant in the basement of a building in Lynn and used the space for the storage of leather soles in burlap bags. The defendant corporation became a tenant in the floor directly above the premises leased by the plaintiff. Certain machinery used by the defendant required the installation and connection of water pipes. On various occasions prior to September 18, 1963, water had leaked from the defendant\u2019s premises into the plaintiff\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">On the evening of September 18, 1963, the defendant was in the process of moving its equipment from its premises in Lynn. The defendant had engaged one Blanchard to assist with the moving.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s foreman and its president were present at the premises with Blanchard and his assistant. Blanchard testified that he had instructed the defendant\u2019s president to shut off the water and to disconnect the pipes which were attached to certain of the machines. Blanchard and his assistant had moved certain of the machines without incident; after they had moved the one remaining piece of machinery (to which a water pipe had been connected) about ten feet, Blanchard heard someone shout \u201cwater.\u201d He returned to the site from which the machinery had been removed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>there observed water flowing from a broken water pipe. Water flowed from that pipe into the plaintiff\u2019s basement premises, and caused damage to leather soles stored there. There was testimony that this pipe had not been disconnected from the machinery before the machinery was moved. The defendant\u2019s foreman testified that he had disconnected the pipe and that shortly before the incident he had spoken to Blanchard about the pipe, saying, \u201cThis is a live water pipe, careful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">From this evidence the jury could have found that the defendant was aware of the potential hazard, that it was under a duty to disconnect the water pipe before the machinery was moved, that it committed a breach of that duty, and that such breach was the proximate cause of the damage sustained by the plaintiff. The jury could further have found that the defendant should have foreseen that the act of Blanchard in moving the machinery with the pipe still attached would result in the rupture of the pipe. Assuming arguendo that the action of Blanchard, in relying on the foreman\u2019s assurance that the pipe had been disconnected, amounted to negligence, \u201c[i]t is well settled that the intervening negligence of a third person which contributes to an injury does not necessarily break the causal connection between the conduct of an earlier wrongdoer and the injury.\u201d <em>Buda </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>302 Mass. 411, 413 (1939). Prosser, Torts (4th ed.) \u00a7 44. In this case Blanchard\u2019s intervening conduct was not of such a nature as to sever the chain of causation between the defendant\u2019s acts and the resulting damage to the plaintiff. See <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Medaglia, </em>287 Mass. 46, 49-50 (1934), and cases cited. We conclude that it was error to have ordered the entry of a verdict for the defendant under leave reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The bill of exceptions filed by the plaintiff in this case is inordinately lengthy and unnecessarily verbose. The exceptions can hardly be said to have been \u201creduced to writing in [the] summary manner\u201d required by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 113. \u201cThis requirement of the statute is some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>thing more than a pious wish and if it is not complied with the judge has not only the power but the duty to disallow the bill.\u201d <em>Western Union Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Gas </em>&amp; <em>Elec. Light Co. </em>334 Mass. 587, 593 (1956), and cases cited. See also <em>Bristol Wholesale Grocery Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Municipal Lighting Plant Commn. of Taunton, </em>347 Mass. 668, 671 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The defendant\u2019s exceptions are overruled. The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions are sustained. The verdict for the defendant under leave reserved must be set aside and the original verdict for the plaintiff is to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\">A motion for an extension of time for filing a bill of exceptions, filed within the twenty day period (see Rule 73 of the Superior Court [1954]), was not acted upon within such period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-10\">The 1945 amendment added the following sentence to \u00a7 113, which the parties agree is here applicable: \u201cIf, through inadvertence, a party who has duly claimed exceptions failed to file a bill of exceptions within said twenty days or within such further time as may have been allowed, the presiding justice may, before final judgment, upon motion after notice and hearing, allow a bill of exceptions to be filed and may allow such bill of exceptions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Part (b) of this statement is applicable only to causes of action arising before January 1, 1971, such as the one in the instant case.
