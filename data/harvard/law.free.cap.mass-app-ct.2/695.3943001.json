Fontaine impleaded the city as third-party defendant. The case was heard and determined on affidavits under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59 (as amended through St. 1965, c. 491, \u00a7 1). Fontaine and the city have appealed from a final declaratory decree favorable to Industrial\u2019s claims against Fontaine and to Fontaine\u2019s claims against the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">1. There was no error in the court\u2019s consideration of the affidavit of Robert Grier, chief estimator for Indus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>trial and the person who had formulated its bid proposal to Fontaine. Grier identified the pertinent contract documents (about which there was no dispute), and the recitation of his background and qualifications affirmatively demonstrated his competence to testify of his own personal knowledge (compare <em>Limbach Co. </em>v. <em>George B. H. Macomber Co. </em>357 Mass. 475, 480-481 [1970]) on the factual issue of whether there was a custom in the trade (see <em>Baccari </em>v. B. <em>Perini </em>&amp; <em>Sons, Inc. </em>293 Mass. 297, 303-304 [1936]; <em>Hardware Specialties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mishara Constr. Co. Inc., ante, </em>277, 280-281 [1974]) that the architect expressly specify and locate closures in the bid documents whenever and wherever he should intend their installation. If the affidavit, when read in the light of attachments thereto, suggested an inconsistence as to the order in which Industrial and the city\u2019s architect depicted their opposing interpretations of the contract documents on certain sepias not prepared until after the dispute arose, the inconsistency was not as to a \u201cmaterial fact\u201d within the meaning of the aforementioned \u00a7 59, as the rights of the parties were to be determined by the original contract documents. Nor did the affidavit\u2019s verbal recitation of opposing interpretations raise a question of material fact; the proper construction of the contract documents was a question of law for the court. <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Green, </em>337 Mass. 444, 447 (1958). <em>Limbach Co. </em>v. <em>George B. H. Macomber Co. </em>357 Mass. 475, 479-480 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">2. We believe there was error in those portions of the decree which ordered Fontaine to pay interest on Industrial\u2019s claim \u201cat the rate of ten percent per annum in accordance with c. 30, \u00a7 39K\u201d and which ordered the city to pay Fontaine interest on its claim at the same rate \u201cin accordance with c. 30, \u00a7 39K.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Assuming (without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>deciding) that the provisions of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39K, were intended to apply to contracts and subcontracts of the types found in the present case, and passing any question as to whether the interest provisions of \u00a7 39K were intended to apply to a situation in which (as here) there appears to have been a good faith dispute as to what was required under the original contract documents (see <em>State Line Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 306, 323 [1969], decided under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39G), there is nothing in the present record to suggest that either Industrial\u2019s claim against Fontaine or Fontaine\u2019s claim against the city was ever submitted as or as a part of either of the types of \u201cperiodic estimate\u201d contemplated by \u00a7 39K. In short, it was not alleged, nor was it made to appear, that \u00a7 39K had any application to the factual situation presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">We are of the opinion, however, that Industrial should be awarded interest on its claim from the time of the filing of the bill in this case (see C. <em>&amp; R. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>334 Mass. 232, 233 [1956]; <em>State Line Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 306, 323 [1969]; <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>359 Mass. 206, 209-210 [1971]) until the date of the entry of a new final decree after rescript, to be computed at the rate of six percent per annum (G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, as inserted by St. 1968, c. 763, and as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 156) until August 14, 1974, and thereafter at the rate of eight percent per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>annum (G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, as most recently amended by St. 1974, c. 224, \u00a7 2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cognate changes are also to be made in that part of the decree which awards interest to Fontaine on its claim against the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">3. We also find error in that part of the decree which determined the city to be indebted to Fontaine for a \u201cpercentage fee of seven percent (7%) of the value of [the] extra work\u201d performed by Industrial. In making such an award the judge appears to have relied on the provisions of art. 12.1.8 of the general conditions of the contract between Fontaine and the city (as inserted in those conditions by so called \u201csupplementary conditions\u201d). A review of the pertinent portions (as amended) of art. 12 (\u201cChanges in the Work\u201d) of the general conditions discloses that its purposes were to give the owner the unilateral right, by a writing signed subsequent to the execution of the original contract documents, to require changes in the work called for by those documents and to provide the means for determining the adjustments in the contract price and other terms which should flow from changes so required.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are of the opinion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>provisions of art. 12 have no application to the circumstances of this case, in which there was an unresolved dispute as to what was required by the original contract documents, the city\u2019s architect (without referring to art. 12) insisted on his interpretation of the contract documents and that the work in question be performed at no expense to the city, and the work was performed under protest. Accordingly, so much of the decree as purports to award Fontaine a percentage fee on the value of the disputed work is to be struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Other questions lurking in the record but not argued in the briefs have not been considered in this opinion. Rule 1:13 of the Appeals Court, 1 Mass. App. Ct. 889 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The case is remanded to the Superior Court for the modifications in the final decree which are required by parts 2 and 3 of this opinion. Costs of appeal are not to be allowed to any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-5\"> The successive statutory references appear to be to the third sentence of the first paragraph of G.
