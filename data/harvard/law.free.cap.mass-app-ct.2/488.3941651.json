See Y. <em>D. Dugout, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Canton, </em>357 Mass. 25, 26-28, 31 (1970), describing and upholding the validity of the provisions for \u201csite plan approval.\u201d See also 1970 Ann. Surv. of Mass. Law, \u00a7 17.1, p. 454. The decree also ordered the board to approve the plaintiff\u2019s site plan and to direct the building inspector \u201cto issue all necessary building permits\u201d; costs were awarded to the plaintiff. The decree is based on a master\u2019s report, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">The plaintiff submitted to tiie board an application for approval of a site plan for the development of a parcel of 5.89 acres owned by the plaintiff and to be leased to an \u201cintrastate common carrier by motor vehicle\u201d (the lessee). Most of the area would be surfaced and fenced and would include two buildings \u2014 one of 47,880 square feet, and the smaller one to be used as a garage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cPart of the principal building was to be used for warehousing, part for office space and part as a receiving and delivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>terminal with extended loading dock facilities. . . . The Parcel would have a rail siding to or into the principal building, and freight car traffic would be one car or series of cars per week.\u201d There would be approximately thirty truck movements out of the site in the morning of each business day (Monday through Friday), approximately ten movements during the business day, and approximately thirty movements at the end of the business day. The area contains a number of similar sites, and the added traffic would not be appreciable. Normal operations would not include night traffic. \u201cAs accessory uses certain of the lessee\u2019s vehicles would be stored on the Parcel from time to time when not in use and the proposed garage would be used for servicing and preventive maintenance of the lessee\u2019s vehicles.\u201d There would be 194 \u201c [t]otal \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018inactive\u2019 parking spaces.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The master found that the lessee \u201cwould be distributing . . . from the manufacture to retailers such as discount department stores,\u201d and that the \u201cuses proposed for the Parcel . . . would be those comprising the business of any intrastate common carrier by motor vehicle engaged in the storage and distribution of articles which may be produced in a limited industrial zone pursuant to clauses 1(a) through 1(g) of section III-E of the Canton Zoning By-Law and articles described in clause 1(h) of said section III-E.\u201d The zoning by-law of Canton referred to by the master<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> divided the town into classes of districts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>including (besides residential districts and business districts) limited industrial districts and industrial districts. The uses listed \u201cas of right\u201d for limited industrial districts include among others<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u00a7 III-E l[h]) \u201c[warehouse or distribution plant for [certain enumerated products] or any products of manufacturing activities permitted by this paragraph [\u00a7 III-E 1] (whether or not produced on the premises).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The contentions of both parties are focused on the issue whether the operation proposed is a \u201cwarehouse or distribution plant.\u201d Both parties have in varying degree analyzed the phrase into its components \u201cwarehouse\u201d and \u201cdistribution plant,\u201d but neither the master\u2019s report nor the trial judge makes this distinction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The master\u2019s report appears to view the facility as an entity to be used in the storage and movement of goods from manufacturer to retailer without reference to the relative importance of the storage function. The real question, we believe, is whether this complex is a \u201cdistribution plant\u201d containing, as it ordinarily does, a storage component. <em>Kreger </em>v. <em>Public Bldgs. Commr. of </em>Newton, 353 Mass. 622, 623, 626 (1968), characterizing as \u201ca distribution plant\u201d a facility described as \u201ctanks to hold oil, with necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>valves and vents, pumping machines, meters, and loading and unloading bays for the oil trucks.\u201d See <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Roemer, </em>287 Mass. 500, 504 (1934), in which the court described a \u201ccoal elevator\u201d from which coke was sold at retail to dealers and to industrial users as a \u201cplant . . . for . . . storage of coke and . . . for distribution.\u201d Contrast <em>Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie R.R. </em>v. <em>Allegheny County, </em>283 Pa. 220 (1925), in which a warehouse at a freight terminal was run as a distinct business with storage charges and warehouse receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">We therefore examine the phrase \u201cdistribution plant\u201d to determine its meaning, as a question of law for this court, from its \u201ccommon and approved usage\u201d <em>(Needham </em>v. <em>Winslow Nurseries, Inc. </em>330 Mass. 95, 99 [1953]) and its context in the by-law. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Brockton, </em>351 Mass. 472, 475 (1966); <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>352 Mass. 54, 58-61 (1967); <em>Kreger </em>v. <em>Public Bldgs. Commr. of Newton, </em>353 Mass. 622, 624-626 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The board argues that the proposed facility is a trucking terminal operated by a common carrier and that the phrase \u201cdistribution plant\u201d excludes such an operation. It points to the dictionary definition of \u201cdistributor\u201d as \u201cone that markets a commodity; esp.: wholesaler.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary, p. 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Though we agree that a trucking terminal is not in common usage a \u201cdistribution plant,\u201d we believe that the board gives the phrase, \u201cdistribution plant,\u201d too restrictive a meaning. In the <em>Kreger </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the owner of the \u201cdistribution plant\u201d was not the owner of the bulk of the oil distributed through the facility. In <em>Westborough </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>358 Mass. 716, 717 (1971), a proposed facility was described as \u201ca freight yard, unloading facility, and <em>distribution </em>center for automobiles\u201d (emphasis supplied) and (as appears from the original papers) was to be used by a railroad in connection with its contract with an automobile manufacturer. The words \u201cdistribution\u201d and \u201cdistri-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>button plant\u201d as used in these cases fit the proposed use described by the master. They connote the function of and facility for receiving and storing merchandise and shipping it in smaller quantities to retail outlets. As the <em>Kreger </em>case indicates, the facility is no less a \u201cdistribution plant\u201d because the function is not performed by the owner of the goods and, as the <em>West-borough </em>case indicates, it may be done by a common carrier. Nor is there anything in the record to indicate that the lessee, though a common carrier, cannot also function as a contract carrier and operator of a distribution plant restricted to specified commodities. <em>Mt. Tom Motor Line, Inc. </em>v. <em>McKesson </em>&amp; <em>Robbins, Inc. </em>325 Mass. 45, 48 (1949). <em>Superline Transp. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>350 Mass. 364, 368 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Accordingly, the board\u2019s decision as explained in its brief<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is wrong as a matter of law, for it is based on the premise that a distribution plant cannot be operated by one who also happens to be a common carrier and that operation by a common carrier makes the facility, no matter how limited, a trucking terminal, something other than a \u201cdistribution plant.\u201d We agree with the plaintiff that there appears to be no reason why \u201c[t]he character of the activity in the proposed building is . . . [any] different because ... an intra-state carrier, is performing this function by contract for a few retail stores instead of the stores doing it themselves,\u201d and that the accumulation and storage of goods shipped in from manufacturers by rail or truck to a center from which to distribute these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>goods among numerous retail stores is within the common and approved usage of the phrase \u201cdistribution plant\u201d and permitted by the by-law, if confined to the goods there specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Though the decree correctly annulled the decision of the board, it does not follow that it was proper for the court to order approval of the site plan or the issuance of building permits. It is true, as the plaintiff argues, that a \u201cuse\u201d within \u00a7 III-E 1(h) of the by-law is \u201cpermitted as of right\u201d (\u00a7 III-E 1), but the \u201ccommercial building\u201d proposed is nonetheless subject to the determination \u201cthat the further standards contained in \u00a7 IV D 4 have also been met in the particular case.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Y. <em>D. Dugout, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Canton, </em>357 Mass. 25, 30 (1970). Neither the boards decision nor the master\u2019s report contains sufficient findings as to the satisfaction of each of the standards in that section. The board did not deal with the matter except in the most cursory fashion,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> indicating nothing more than a vague scepticism. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>by-law, however, \u201cimplies regulation of <em>\u00e1 </em>use rather than its prohibition\u201d and the imposition of \u201creasonable terms and conditions\u201d <em>(Y. D. Dugout </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at 31) which, as the by-law provides, are \u201c [consistent with a reasonable use of the site for the purposes permitted.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"An_\">The master\u2019s report also contains no specific findings addressed to each of the standards of \u00a7 IV-D 4. It states that the planning board voted to recommend \u201csite plan approval subject only to certain conditions relating to parking facilities and drainage and subject to review by the Board of Health with respect to the proposal of sewage disposal . . ..\u201d However, there is no indication just what happened to these recommendations. There is therefore no basis in the master\u2019s report for the order in the decree requiring that building permits be issued and that, in effect, the site plan be approved;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the case must be remanded to the board. Y. <em>D. Dugout, supra, </em>at 32. <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>362 Mass. 290, 300 (1972). See <em>Tambone </em>v. <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>Appeal of Stoneham, </em>348 Mass. 359, 365 (1965); <em>Slater </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>350 Mass. 70, 74 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The board, on remand, may also have to consider the question whether and to what extent the garage, proposed to be used for servicing and preventive maintenance, and the storing of the lessee\u2019s vehicles are accessory uses within the by-law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree with the board that this in general is a question of fact <em>(Harvard </em>v. <em>Maxant, </em>360 Mass. 432, 437-439 [1971]) which the board must determine initially. Because the question has been argued and may arise again, we think it advisable to state that we do not agree with the board that, as a matter of law, the garage and storage of vehicles are not permitted as accessory uses. The failure to mention garages in \u00a7 III-E l(n), on which the board relies, seems to us to be immaterial in the context of this by-law. The four uses listed obviously could not have been intended to exhaust the multifarious possibilities inherent in the broad definition of \u201caccessory use\u201d in \u00a7 1-B 1. Cf. <em>Hume </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Westford, </em>355 Mass. 179, 180, fn. 1, 181-182 (1969). \u201cThe word \u2018including\u2019 does not lend itself to such destructive significance.\u201d <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>313 U. S. 177, 189 (1941). Uses such as those proposed by the plaintiff have, without detailed analysis of the facts, been held to be accessory. <em>Needham </em>v. <em>Winslow Nurseries, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>Inc. </em>330 Mass. 95, 102 (1953) (maintenance on the premises of trucks used in a permissible landscape contracting business). <em>Bridgewater </em>v. <em>Chuckran, </em>351 Mass. 20, 21, 24 (1966) (storage of trucks used in permissible contracting business). See <em>Superintendent &amp; Inspector of Bldgs. of Cambridge </em>v. <em>Villari, </em>350 Mass. 176, 177-178 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Finally, we hold that there is no basis for the assessment of costs against the board. They can be assessed only if the board \u201cacted with gross negligence, in bad faith or with malice.\u201d G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21. The master\u2019s report does not permit such a conclusion. The general finding that site plan approval was denied \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d is not borne out by the record or supported by any subsidiary findings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The final decree is reversed, and a new final decree is to be entered annulling the board\u2019s decision and remanding the case to the board for reconsideration in the light of this opinion. Y. <em>D. Dugout, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Canton, </em>357 Mass. 25, 32 (1970).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-12\">The master\u2019s report does not state the size.

However, the by-law was referred to in the report <em>(Leventhal </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>311 Mass. 622, 624 [1942]) and by the parties in the briefs and argument. We consider it, but observe that it would have been desirable for the master to have specifically incorporated the by-law in the record to avoid any ambiguity as to its status.
