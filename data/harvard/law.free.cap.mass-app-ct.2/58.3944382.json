It is before this court on an appeal by American Motorists Insurance Company (American) from a Superior Court decree which awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>total incapacity and dependency compensation (to be paid by American) and dismissed a claim for such compensation against Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corporation, Ltd. (Employers\u2019 Liability).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With an exception noted in the last paragraph of this opinion, the Superior Court decree was in conformity with the decision of the reviewing board, which had affirmed and adopted as its own the findings and decision of the single member. We must therefore look to the single member\u2019s decision to determine whether the action of the board was correct. <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 679-680 (1970). <em>Russo\u2019s Case, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 206 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The findings of the single member may be summarized as follows. On January 30, 1962, while in the employ of a company insured by American, the employee injured his back. As a result of this injury, he underwent surgery and was paid total disability compensation by American from March 7, 1962, until May 5, 1963, when he went to work for Hyannis Marine Service (Hyannis), a firm which was insured by Employers\u2019 Liability. The employee had never fully recovered from his injury, however, and experienced gradually increasing pain and a restriction of normal movement in his back. On October 11, 1966, the employee again left work and never returned. The single member found that the employee\u2019s ultimate disability was directly related to his 1962 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">1. American concedes that, as stated in <em>Hacha-dourian\u2019s Case, </em>340 Mass. 81, 85 (1959), and cases cited, \u201cthis court must sustain the findings of the board of review . . . unless they are wholly lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law, and this is true even if different findings could have been made by the board,\u201d but argues that there was no evidence to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>finding of a causal relationship between the employee\u2019s back injury and his ultimate disability. The evidence on this issue included the following. After his injury the employee was hospitalized and underwent a fusion operation on his spine. Following the operation he experienced recurring backaches. While working for Hyannis he experienced severe pain along his spine, wore a back brace, and was forced to take medication. The pain became progressively worse in the months before the employee left work permanently on October 11, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">One Doctor Howard, an orthopedic specialist, testified that the employee\u2019s spinal fusion had broken down shortly after it was performed, resulting in a \u201cfissure line\u201d through the fusion. In the course of a 1968 examination, Doctor Howard discovered a fracture of the employee\u2019s first lumbar vertebra. He was of the opinion that the employee became susceptible to the fracture because of the development of osteoporosis, which was caused by inactivity, disuse and pain in his back following his injury. It was the opinion of Doctor Howard that the employee\u2019s ultimate disability \u201crelated to\u201d his 1962 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In light of the above summarized evidence, we cannot accept American\u2019s contention that the finding of a causal relationship between the employee\u2019s injury and his subsequent disability rested \u201cmerely on speculation and conjecture.\u201d Rather, we conclude that the challenged finding was amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">2. American also argues that the single member erred in dismissing a claim against Employers\u2019 Liability based on an incident which occurred in August, 1966, while the employee was working for Hyannis. Testimony was presented that the employee lost his balance while walking and stumbled for a distance of ten to fifteen feet. The single member found that although the stumble may have led to a temporary worsening of the employee\u2019s back pains, any such exacerbation was only \u201cfleeting and temporary,\u201d and dismissed the employee\u2019s claim against Employers\u2019 Liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>As regards the single member\u2019s interpretation of the law governing successive insurers, American states that \u201cthere is a doubt as to whether the . . . [single member] understood the fundamental rule that, given causal relationship, <em>however slight, </em>the last insurer is chargeable\u201d (emphasis in the original). Although the single member\u2019s formulation of the rule<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not emphasize the minimal degree of causality which is needed to shift liability to a later insurer (see <em>Rock\u2019s Case, </em>323 Mass. 428, 429 [1948]; <em>Fitzpatrick\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 298, 300 [1954]), we are of the opinion that it fairly summarized the applicable law for the purposes of this case. See <em>Trombetta\u2019s Case, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 104 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">American also contends that the single member\u2019s findings are wholly lacking in evidential support. See <em>Hachadourian\u2019s Case, supra. </em>The evidence introduced in support of the findings was as follows. Although the employee\u2019s stumble left his ankle lame, nothing else bothered him at the time and he continued to perform laborious work every day until he finally left his job on October 11. In medical histories given to three physicians who examined him on or after that date, the employee linked his pain (and disability) once to an injury sustained while playing touch football, and once to his stumble, and on another occasion he said that he could recall no back injury at all subsequent to 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Expert opinion concerning the effect of the stumbling incident on the employee\u2019s back condition varied considerably and was in any event within the province of the single member to accept or reject. See <em>Leonardos Case, </em>349 Mass. 771 (1965). The medical testimony that an aggravating injury would normally cause increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>back pain within a few days is significant in light of the employee\u2019s testimony that he felt no change in the condition of his back until one or two weeks after the stumbling incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">We think that this evidence, considered in light of other evidence that the employee never recovered from his 1962 back injury and was suffering from gradually worsening pain in the months before he left work, supports the findings of the single member concerning the effect of the employee\u2019s stumble. See <em>Rock's Case, supra, </em>at 430; <em>Lambert\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 516, 518-519 (1950); <em>Casey\u2019s Case, </em>353 Mass. 756 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">As the result of an apparent typographical error in the final decree, the date as of which dependency compensation is reduced by reason of the death of the employee\u2019s wife reads \u201cJanuary 31, 1971,\u201d rather than January 31, 1970, which was the date fixed by the reviewing board. In all other respects, including the total amount of compensation to be paid, the decree is in conformity with the decision of the reviewing board. The decree is therefore to be modified by replacing the date January 31, 1971, wherever it appears, by January 31, 1970, and as so modified, is affirmed. Costs of appeal under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A, are to be determined by a justice of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The employee died on July 29, 1971, before the case had been heard by the reviewing board. No claim arising from the employee\u2019s death is before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The single member\u2019s decision stated the Massachusetts rule to be as follows: \u201c[T]he chargeability for the whole compensation to which the employee may be entitled . . . rests on the insurer covering the risk at the time of his most recent injury <em>that bears causal relation to the disability claimed\u201d </em>(emphasis in the original).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
