The defendant Maurice Callahan &amp; Sons, Inc. (Callahan) demurred to and answered the bill while the defendant Outdoor Advertising Board (the board) filed only an answer. The demurrer was overruled by a judge of the Superior Court and Callahan claimed an appeal. The case was referred to a master, who filed a report to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>which no objections were made and, on the plaintiff\u2019s motion, an interlocutory decree confirming the master\u2019s report was entered by another judge of the Superior Court. The second judge then reported the case to the Supreme Judicial Court which transferred it to us pursuant to G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">We treat the report as having been filed under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 31, whereunder a judge of the Superior Court \u201cby whom a case is heard for final decree may reserve and report the evidence and all questions of law therein for the consideration of the full court . . ..\u201d Accordingly, we interpret the second of the two questions specifically set forth in the report \u2014 asking to what, if any, relief the plaintiff is . entitled upon the facts contained in the master\u2019s report \u2014 as bringing before us all questions of law argued by the parties. The answer to the first question in the judge\u2019s report, viz., whether Callahan\u2019s demurrer was properly overruled, is encompassed in our discussion of the second question. Therefore, we assume that the first question is properly before us although the demurrer was overruled by a judge other than the one who signed the report. Cf. <em>John Gilbert Jr. Co. </em>v. <em>C. M. Fauci Co. </em>309 Mass. 271, 272-273 (1941); <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Louro, </em>345 Mass. 456, 458 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Facts alleged in the bill, which are admitted by stipulation, and additional facts found by the master are as follows: On July 8, 1969, the board voted to amend its regulations pursuant to G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 29 (as amended through St. 1958, c. 143),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by the insertion of a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>section, 9K, prohibiting the issuance by the board of any permit for a billboard, sign or other device except in conformity with applicable municipal ordinances or bylaws. The vote of the board recited that it was to become \u201ceffective on filing of a copy hereof with the Secretary of the Commonwealth pursuant to . . . [G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 37].\u201d The text of the vote, including \u00a7 9K, is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A copy of the vote was filed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>July 23, 1969. To it, however, was appended a certification by the board secretary \u201cthat the Outdoor Advertising Board voted on July 8, 1969 to adopt the foregoing Rules and Regulations and further that on July 23, 1969 I filed a true copy of these Rules and Regulations with the Secretary of State, together with a citation of the law by authority of which these regulations were adopted, <em>to become effective August 15, 1969\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">On July 30, 1969, Callahan filed applications with the board for permits for the two billboards which are the subject of the plaintiff\u2019s bill. Each of the billboards was to be six hundred square feet in area advertising an off-premises use. Under the Pittsfield zoning ordinance applicable to the district in which the billboards were to be located, the maximum permissible size of any billboard was one hundred and sixty-five square feet, and no billboards advertising an off-premises use appear to have been permissible regardless of size. Notwithstanding the size of the billboards the city council of Pittsfield, having been notified by the board of the pendency of Callahan\u2019s applications, voted to approve the same on August 12, and so advised the board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board voted its approval of the applications on September 30, so advised the Pittsfield authorities on October 1, and issued permits for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the two billboards dated October 3. The billboards were erected and in place by January 5, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The plaintiff, an abutter of the premises on which the billboards were erected, brought this bill under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 584, \u00a7 7),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contending that \u00a7 9K of the board\u2019s regulations was in effect when Callahan filed its applications, that the permits were granted in violation of that regulation, and that Callahan\u2019s billboards were therefore erected unlawfully and subject to removal under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31 (see fn. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">We find no merit in the defendants\u2019 contention that the certification of the board\u2019s secretary served to postpone its effective date to August 15, 1969. Section 9K had become effective prior to the date of Callahan\u2019s applications. Under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 5 (as appearing in St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1), such regulations \u201cbecome effective upon filing [with the Secretary of the Commonwealth ], unless a later date is required by any law or is <em>specified by the agency in the </em>regulation\u201d (emphasis supplied). Authority to adopt the regulation vested exclusively in the board. G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 29. The board and not its secretary was authorized to specify a later effective date under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 5; and its intention was manifest in the first paragraph of its vote adopting the regulation. (See fn. 2.) Therefore, the secretary\u2019s addendum to his certification of the board\u2019s vote, indicating a later effective date, was gratuitous and is not to be viewed as evidence of action taken by the board to postpone the effective date of \u00a7 9K. See <em>Oakes </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>14 Pick. 442, 448 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>(1833); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>142 Mass. 71, 74 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">There is no substance to the second contention advanced by Callahan (but not by the board) that no relief can be afforded the plaintiff because the billboards are not a nuisance at common law. The plaintiffs bill is not based on a common law concept but on a very different concept of \u201cnuisance\u201d embodied in G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31 (see fn. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Callahan next contends that the plaintiff is barred by its failure to exhaust administrative remedies available to it under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 29A (as inserted by St. 1955, c. 584, \u00a7 5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, neither \u00a7 29A nor the board\u2019s regulations make provision for notification to anyone but a city or town when an application is received or a permit granted. There is nothing in the record before us to suggest that the plaintiff knew of Callahan\u2019s applications until the permits had been issued and the installation of the billboards had begun. Assuming, without deciding, that the plaintiff had standing to file an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>objection to the applications and to demand a public hearing thereon under the first sentence of \u00a7 29A (see fn. 5), it is clear that the plaintiff could not have appealed from the issuance of the permits to the board under the second sentence of that section. The plaintiff\u2019s remedy under \u00a7 29A was at best so illusory that it would have been unreasonable to require that the plaintiff resort to it as a prerequisite to judicial relief. Cf. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>355 Mass. 79, 84 (1968); <em>Ouellette </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Quincy, </em>362 Mass. 272, 276-277 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Callahan also contends that the bill will not lie for the reason that the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy is through a bill under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (as amended through St. 1968, c. 637, \u00a7 1) for judicial review of the board\u2019s decision granting the permits. Reliance is placed on <em>Selectmen of Truro </em>v. <em>Outdoor Advertising Bd., </em>346 Mass. 754 (1964), and <em>Building Inspector of Northampton </em>v. <em>Springfield Advertising Co., </em>353 Mass. 763 (1968), in which bills brought under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31 (see fn. 4) were ordered dismissed for that reason. Those cases, however, are not controlling here. The bills involved in those cases were brought by officials of towns which, unlike the present plaintiff, had effective administrative remedies under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 29A (see fn. 5) which they failed to utilize. In addition the plaintiffs in those cases sought to enforce municipal by-laws rather than regulations of the board<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31, confers equity jurisdiction only as to the latter. We find nothing in the cases cited by Callahan which would foreclose the plaintiff, perforce a stranger to the board\u2019s proceedings, from equitable relief even if it were conceded that the plaintiff had standing as an \u201caggrieved\u201d person to challenge its proceedings under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The central issue is whether the plaintiffs bill falls within the purview of G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31 (see fn. 4). No contention is made that the plaintiff is not an \u201cinterested party\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31. Callahan appears to argue, however, that the billboards were not \u201cerected or maintained in violation of any rule, or regulation, adopted by the board.\u201d This contention has already been dealt with to the extent that it is based on the assumption that \u00a7 9K of the board\u2019s regulations did not take effect until after Callahan\u2019s application had been filed. Unlike the <em>Truro </em>and <em>Northampton </em>cases, <em>supra, </em>the present one was brought after the board had imposed upon itself \u201ca flat mandate\u201d to issue no permit except in conformity to applicable zoning ordinances and by-laws. <em>John Donnelly &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Outdoor Advertising Board, </em>361 Mass. 746, 752 (1972). Nor does the action of the Pittsfield city council in purporting to approve Callahan\u2019s applications excuse the violation of \u00a7 9K of the board\u2019s regulations. Nothing in the record supports the hypothesis that the statutory requirements for amending the pertinent zoning ordinance or for granting a variance or special permit were met. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 4 (as amended through St. 1966, c. 199), \u00a7 6 (as amended through St. 1968, c. 194), \u00a7 17 (as amended through St. 1968, c. 366). We conclude that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to entertain the bill, and to grant equitable relief based upon the findings of the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In oral argument before this court Callahan advanced the further contention that the case had become moot by the adoption of a new zoning ordinance by the city-council of Pittsfield, after the case had been reported, under which billboards are permissible in the district in which Callahan\u2019s are located if approved by the city council. The existence and terms of the new ordinance, insofar as pertinent to the facts of this case, have been stipulated by the parties and we therefore treat the issue as properly before us. See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>304 Mass. 181, 182 (1939). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>pertinent section of the new ordinance, however, contains a proviso that no such billboard \u201cshall exceed twenty-five (25) by twelve (12) feet in size.\u201d The fact that each of Callahan\u2019s billboards is twice that size is sufficient to dispose of the contention of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Our answer to the judge\u2019s first question is that the defendant Callahan\u2019s demurrer was rightly overruled. Our answer to the second question is that a final decree with costs is to be entered in the Superior Court enjoining the defendant Callahan from continuing to maintain the subject billboards in accordance with the second prayer of the plaintiff\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\u201cThe outdoor advertising board, herein and in sections twenty-nine A, thirty A and thirty-one called the board, may make, amend or repeal rules and regulations for the proper control and restriction of billboards, signs and other advertising devices, except as provided in section thirty-two, on public ways or on private property within public view of any highway, public park or reservation.
