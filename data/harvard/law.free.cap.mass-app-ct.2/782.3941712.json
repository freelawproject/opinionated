The Commission ordered the plaintiff to cease and desist from committing certain specified violations of the State Labor Relations Law, G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 4 (1), (3), and to take certain affirmative action to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>remedy the violations, including the reinstatement of two employees with back pay. The plaintiff contends that the order should be set aside because it is unsupported by substantial evidence, as required by G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 6 <em>(e), </em>and G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8) <em>(e), </em>and because it is \u201c[arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8) (g). Although the hospital uses the language of c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8) (g), in its argument, it does not expand on that language and relies instead on the claim that the order is unsupported by substantial evidence. It is by that standard that we test the validity of the order. See <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>University Hosp. Inc. </em>359 Mass. 516, 521 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6), defines \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d See Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action, 596-598 (1965) . While a reviewing court must consider whatever evidence in the record fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence relied on by the Commission, <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 253 (1966) , this does not permit a court to \u201cdisplace an administrative board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\u201d <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>University Hosp. Inc., supra, </em>at 521. <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>340 U. S. 474, 488 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">In the present case there was evidence that the two employees had been openly soliciting fellow employees on behalf of a labor union and that their immediate supervisor, Mrs. Gilraine, was aware of their activities. The individual who discharged the employees, one Yuknis, was Mrs. Gilraine\u2019s immediate superior and admitted knowing that such activities were widespread among Boston\u2019s numerous health-care facilities. While Yuknis denied any knowledge of those employees\u2019 organizational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>activities before he discharged them, the Commission indicated its disbelief of his testimony. It was entitled on the basis of the evidence to infer that Yuknis and other supervisory personnel of the plaintiff knew what the two employees were doing. Contrast <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Joseph Antell, Inc. </em>358 F. 2d 880, 882-883 (1st Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">There was also evidence that Mrs. Gilraine had cautioned the two employees against engaging in their organizational activities during working hours, but that she was entirely satisfied with the quality of their work. Their discharge occurred less than a week after their union activities began. The testimony of Yuknis and other witnesses for the plaintiff as to the reasons for the discharge conflicted with the reasons stated in the plaintiff\u2019s own personnel records signed by Yuknis and with the reasons given by Yuknis to the employees when he discharged them. The Commission was justified in drawing the inference that the employees were discharged by reason of their organizational activities and that the reasons given in the plaintiff\u2019s records and the testimony of its witnesses were pretextual. Compare <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Joseph Antell, Inc., supra, </em>at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">This is therefore not a case where the Commission failed to indicate \u201cits disbelief of the . . . [plaintiff\u2019s] evidence ... [or to base] its decision upon any direct evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, supra, </em>at 252. Nor is it a case where the inferences drawn by the Commission from that evidence were \u201cneither reasonable nor permissible.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We conclude that the decision and order of the Commission were supported by substantial evidence and should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
