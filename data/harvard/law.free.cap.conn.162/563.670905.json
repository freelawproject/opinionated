The defendant excepted to this portion of the charge, claiming that the statute had no application because there was no evidence in the case to warrant such a charge. The assignment of error addressed to the charge is to be tested by the claims of proof as they appear in the finding.

When Fleming was thirty to forty feet from the defendant\u2019s automobile, the defendant, without any signal or warning, for the purpose of entering a driveway, made a left turn in front of the motorcycle. Fleming applied his brakes and attempted to go to the left and the defendant\u2019s vehicle continued into the driveway. The motorcycle skidded a few feet, Fleming lost control of it and fell off, resulting in injuries to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">On these claims of proof there was an adequate basis for submitting to the jury the issue involving the application of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222 and the court was not in error in charging on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The remaining assignments of error attack the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict and the denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. We test the court\u2019s action on these rulings on the basis of the evidence printed in the appendices to the briefs. <em>Lucier </em>v. <em>Meriden-Wallingford Sand &amp; Stone Co., </em>153 Conn. 422, 427, 216 A.2d 818; <em>Petrizzo </em>v. <em>Commercial Contractors Corporation, </em>152 Conn. 491, 498, 208 A.2d 748; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>144 Conn. 13, 14, 127 A.2d 45. The evidence must be given the most favorable construction in support of the verdict of which it is reasonably capable. <em>Petrillo </em>v. <em>Bess, </em>149 Conn. 166, 167, 179 A.2d 600; <em>Kazukynas </em>v. <em>N. C. Casciano &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>149 Conn. 1, 2, 174 A.2d 796. From the evidence printed in the appendix to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 brief, tbe jury could reasonably have found that the defendant was negligent in the operation of his automobile, that such conduct was the proximate cause of the injuries and losses sustained and was sufficient to establish a basis for the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
