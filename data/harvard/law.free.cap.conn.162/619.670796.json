The trial resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>in a verdict for the defendants. The sole issue on appeal is the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, that the trial court committed error in an evidential ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The investigating police officer, on cross-examination, was permitted to read into evidence a statement which the defendant operator gave to the .officer in the presence of the plaintiff at the scene of the accident. The only objection to the admission of the evidence was that it was a self-serving statement. If an objection had been made that the statement was hearsay and inadmissible in the absence of a proper foundation for the admission of the statement as a \u201ctacit admission,\u201d it would undoubtedly have been properly excluded as hearsay under the precedent of <em>Mei </em>v. <em>Alterman Transport Lines, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 307, 313, 268 A.2d 639, and <em>Obermeier </em>v. <em>Nielsen, </em>158 Conn. 8, 11, 255 A.2d 819. This is the authority on which the plaintiffs rely in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">No objection on the ground of hearsay was raised in the trial court, however, and the court was never alerted to the claims now advanced on this appeal. Whether, under the circumstances, a proper foundation for the admission of the statement could have been laid had its absence been called to the attention of the court on proper objection to the evidence as hearsay is now purely speculative. \u201cSince this claim was not made when the court was called upon to make the ruling, we cannot consider it now. <em>Petrillo </em>v. <em>Kolbay, </em>116 Conn. 389, 395, 165 A. 346; Practice Book \u00a7155 [Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7266]. The . . . [plaintiff], as an appellant, is confined in this court to the ground of objection put forward by . . . [him] in the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>90 Conn. 126, 131, 96 A. 370; <em>Sortito </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins.
