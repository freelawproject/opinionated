Minogue, Jr., </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, was <em>Joseph T. Gormley,Jr., </em>state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (defendant).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b631-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AD7\">After the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of breaking and entering and was presented for sentence, the state\u2019s attorney recommended a sentence of not less than two nor more than four years in the state prison. Counsel for the defendant suggested that a term of eighteen months to three years \u201cwould be more than sufficient.\u201d After inquiring of the defendant if he wished to say anything, the following transpired:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">\u201cThe Court: The sentence of the court in State against Frederick Franklin is that he be confined in the State\u2019s Prison for not less than eighteen months nor more than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">The defendant: Thank you, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">State\u2019s Attorney: The maximum is two? What was the maximum?</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>The court: Four.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">State\u2019s Attorney: Four. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The judgment was recorded and mittimus issued for a term of eighteen months minimum and four years maximum. The sole issue on the appeal is the merit of the claim of the defendant that the court erred in denying his petition for habeas corpus which was predicated on the sole ground that the court erred \u201cin orally changing the Defendant\u2019s maximum sentence from two years to four years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">What we said in <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>158 Conn. 45, 47, 255 A.2d 850, is equally applicable in this instance: \u201cBecause there is such a complete lack of merit to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, this case should not even have been certified to this court under \u00a7 52-470.\u201d There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
