The court rendered judgment sustaining the action of the board and the plaintiffs have appealed from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">The plaintiffs, on December 9, 1968, acquired property on Outlook Drive in Darien, consisting of adjoining lots 54, 53 and part of 52, located in a residential zone requiring a minimum lot size of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>one-half acre. Lot 54, vacant land, consists of .303 of an acre and lot 53 together with part of lot 52, hereinafter called lot 53, on which stands a dwelling house, consists of .585 of an acre. The plaintiffs, on December 30, 1968, petitioned the board for a variance as to lot 54 under \u00a7\u00a7410 and 455 of the Darien zoning regulations. We need concern ourselves only with \u00a7 455 since, in their appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, the plaintiffs abandoned their claim that the board improperly denied their request for a variance under \u00a7 410.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The variance sought was for the purpose of erecting a dwelling house on lot 54.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Following a public hearing, the board stated, in part, in its finding, that the applicants failed to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (a) of \u00a7 455 of the regulations in that they \u201cand their immediate predecessor in title do and did own sufficient adjoining land at the time of the adoption of the Regulations to conform more nearly therewith. The first tract consists of 0.303 acres and the second tract of 0.585 acres\u201d; and that there \u201cis indication that construction of a dwelling on the first tract would aggravate an existing drainage problem and thus be injurious to the neighborhood.\u201d On grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>consistent with these findings, the hoard denied the request for a variance. The board\u2019s action was sustained and the court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. The court concluded that the board did not act illegally, arbitrarily and in abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The court\u2019s functions were limited to a determination whether the board had, as alleged on the appeal, acted illegally, arbitrarily and in abuse of the discretion vested in it. <em>Verney </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>151 Conn. 578, 580, 200 A.2d 714; <em>Wil-Nor Corporation </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>146 Conn. 27, 30, 147 A.2d 197; <em>Devaney </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>143 Conn. 322, 325, 326, 122 A.2d 303. On the record, we find no error in the conclusion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\"> Section. 455 of the zoning regulations of tte town of Darien provides as follows: \u201cBuilding on Non-Conforming Lots. A permit may <em>be </em>issued for the erection of a building on any lot, recorded in the Darien Land Records, that has been made non-conforming with respect .to area, frontage or width requirements, by the adoption of or any amendments to these Regulations or the Zoning Map, provided: (a) the owner of any such lot did not own sufficient adjoining land at the time of the adoption of said Regulations (September 25, 1954) or said amendments to conform therewith, or more nearly therewith, and (b) all yard and open space requirements of the Regulations are met.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-9\"> It is undisputed that lot 54 did not conform to the minimum zoning requirement of one-half acre at the time of the adoption of \u00a7 455 and comes within the purview of \u00a7 455, since it adjoins lot 53.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
