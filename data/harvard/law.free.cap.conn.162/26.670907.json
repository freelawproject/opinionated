Money damages in the amount of $200,000 was the only relief sought under the original complaint. An attachment of the real estate was made at the commencement of the action but was released on May 18, 1964, on the substitution of a bond with personal surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">An amended complaint, filed September 6, 1966, alleging fraud and unjust enrichment, sought, in addition to money damages and other relief, a decree that the land and buildings be impressed with a trust for the benefit of the plaintiff. A lis pendens was subsequently filed covering all the real estate which is the subject matter of the still pending action and over which the plaintiff seeks the imposition of a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">On March 4, 1969, the parties stipulated that the case be referred to a state referee. On November 4, 1970, during the trial, the defendants filed a motion asking the referee to release the lis pendens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>as to only a portion of the land with a dwelling house thereon. The land for which the partial release of the lis pendens was sought is a small portion of the property subject to the lis pendens. The land is approximately 248 by 341 feet in size and is on a private road near the Middletown-Durham town line.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">On November 5, 1970, the referee ordered the release, in part, of the lis pendens, but gave the plaintiff until November 25, 1970, to purchase the property or to provide a purchaser ready, willing and able to buy it for $60,000. The order further provided that the house and the land on which it stood should be sold to the defendants\u2019 prospective purchaser after November 25, 1970, for the stated amount. It provided further that the remainder of the property owned of record by the defendants should continue to be subject to the lis pendens. The order concluded by providing that the proceeds of any sale be applied to the payment of the outstanding first mortgage and that the question of the actual credit for- the $60,000 should remain a matter to be adjudicated between the parties in the litigation before the state referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The state referee assigned these reasons for ordering the partial release of the lis pendens: (1) Because of its size and location it has been difficult for the defendants to rent this property and secure any adequate income from it. From time to time it has been vacant; (2) there is a reasonable probability that if and when the house is vacant the property, including the house and the surrounding land, with its shrubbery, will be vandalized; (3) it is in the best interest of both parties, for the preservation of the property on which the plaintiff seeks to impress a trust, that the property described in the motion be sold irrespective of the resolution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>issues between the parties in the instant litigation, which has already consumed forty-six trial days extending over a period of more than one year, with the probability of further extended hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">The plaintiff assigns as error the overruling by the court of the following claims of law: (1) The court had no power whatsoever to order the release of any land subject to a duly recorded lis pendens in an action intended to affect the real estate subject to the lis pendens; (2) the sole powers of the court to order the dissolution of an attachment or to order a reduction in the amount of an attachment, and analogously the power of a court to order dissolved or in any way modified a lis pendens derived solely and exclusively from specific statutes; (3) there is no Connecticut statutory authority under which the court could lawfully make the order which the defendants sought in their motion to release in part the lis pendens; (4) if the court, pursuant to \u00a7 52-326 of the General Statutes, as amended, had the power under \u00a7\u00a7 52-322 and 52-324 to discharge, dissolve or in any way modify a duly recorded lis pendens, or to order such discharge, dissolution or modification, a condition precedent to the exercise of such power was the establishing by the moving party of any one of the conditions expressly set forth in said \u00a7\u00a7 52-322 and 52-324.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The state referee concluded that, sitting as a court of equity, he had the power to make an order releasing the lis pendens as it affected the house and parcel of land on which it stood. The plaintiff assigns as error this conclusion, in that no facts were found or conclusions reached which according to the applicable statute would confer on the referee the power he sought to exercise by granting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>We need not pass on the question whether the state referee proceeded correctly in entertaining the defendants\u2019 motion, for this appeal may be determined on the narrower issue of whether the order partially releasing the lis pendens, made pursuant to the defendants\u2019 motion, was grounded on permissible considerations. See <em>Clipfel </em>v. <em>Kantrowits, </em>146 Conn. 738, 150 A.2d 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">At the outset, the applicable statutes should be made clear. The statutory authority under which a party to a cause of action intended to affect real estate may record in the office of the town clerk of the town where the property is situated a notice of the pendency of the action is \u00a7 52-325.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Section 52-326 of the General Statutes, entitled \u201cDischarge of lis pendens,\u201d provides that \u201c [t]he provisions of sections 52-322 . . . and 52-324 shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>apply, mutatis mutandis, to any lis pendens recorded according to the provisions of section 52-325.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Section 52-322 of the General Statutes provides, mutatis mutandis, that when a plaintiff who has filed a lis pendens has (1) received satisfaction for his claim or (2) final judgment has been rendered against him thereon, or (3) when for any reason such lis pendens has become of no effect, such plaintiff shall at the request of interested persons, file with the town clerk a certificate of dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Section 52-324 of the General Statutes provides, mutatis mutandis, that when a plaintiff has (1) withdrawn his suit, or (2) has been nonsuited, or (3) final judgment has been rendered against him, or (4) if such suit has not been returned, or (5) if for any reason the lis pendens has become of no effect, the clerk of the court shall, on the request of any person interested, issue a certificate of dissolution to be filed with the town clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Finally, \u00a749-13 (b) of the General Statutes provides that when record title is encumbered by a lis pendens which \u201chas become of no effect,\u201d the owner of the property may bring a petition in the Superior Court within the county in which the property is situated and, after proper notice and hearing, \u201cif such court finds the ... lis pendens . . . has become of no effect, the court may render a judgment reciting the facts and its findings in relation thereto and declaring such ... lis pendens . . . invalid as a lien against such real estate, which judgment shall . . . be recorded in the land records of the town in which such property is situated, and no action to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>enforce a title under such ... lis pendens . . . shall be maintained thereafter. The plaintiff may claim in such petition damages as set forth in section 49-8 if he is aggrieved by the failure of the defendant to execute the release therein prescribed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Thus, within \u00a7\u00a7 52-322, 52-324 and 49-13 (b). of the General Statutes, the legislature, in providing three procedures for releasing a lis pendens, has detailed the considerations on which such release may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The considerations detailed in the aforementioned statutes do not include the equitable considerations on which the referee based his order. The plaintiff has received no satisfaction on his claim; no final judgment has been rendered against him; the suit has not been withdrawn, nor has he been nonsuited. No reason has been advanced to indicate that the lis pendens has become \u201cof no effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">It is well to observe at this juncture that there is not in this case any claim that: (a) The action is not intended to affect real estate, or (b) the notice recorded does not contain the details required by the statute, or (c) service of process was not timely completed, any of which circumstances, when properly proven, may qualify as the \u201cfor any reason\u201d that a lis pendens may have been of no effect pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 52-322, 52-324 and 49-13 (b) of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">This court is unpersuaded by the defendants\u2019 argument that while \u00a7 52-326 of the General Statutes specifically requires the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 52-322 and 52-324 to apply to the dissolution of a lis pendens, this does not preclude other statutes relating to the discharge of attachments \u2014 specifically \u00a7 52-302<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u00a7 52-304<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Gfeneral Statutes \u2014 from being applicable here, and that under these provisions the court below had ample authority to release the lis pendens. The legislature has chosen not to make these sections applicable to a lis pendens, but has, instead, confined the conditions for the release of the lis pendens to those in \u00a7\u00a7 52-322, 52-324 and 49-13 (b). This fact aside, \u00a752-302 only allows a court to discharge an attachment on a finding that it is \u201cexcessive.\u201d Thus, even if it were applicable here, mutatis mutandis, the state referee did not base his order on a finding of an \u201cexcessive\u201d lis pendens. The application of \u00a7 52-304 to the discharge of a lis pendens, mutatis mutandis, is not legislatively authorized nor has its relevance to the action of the referee been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Having explored the only statutory grounds under which a court or a state referee acting as a court may act with respect to the discharge of a lis pendens, we conclude that none formed the basis of the referee\u2019s order partially releasing the lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">At common law, the equitable doctrine of lis pen-dens was set in motion when a suit which affected interests in property was commenced. One who purchased property affected by litigation, pendente lite, without any notice, implied or in fact, was nonetheless bound by the judgment or decree in the suit. Every man was presumed to be attentive to what passed in the courts of his state. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Birge, </em>35 Conn. 250, 258-59. The common law no doubt placed a hardship on a purchaser without actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>notice but, as this court observed (p. 259), this was \u201cone of the cases in which private mischief must yield to general convenience.\u201d The doctrine was said (p. 258) to be \u201cfounded upon a great public policy,\u201d for without the doctrine decrees could be evaded and litigation extended by sales to third persons during litigation. Thus, the common-law rule, that the lis pendens continued until the suit was determined by a final decree or until it was suspended by a failure to prosecute diligently, served to preserve the subject of the litigation in order to make it possible for the courts to execute their judgments and decrees. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Birge, </em>supra, 259; <em>Olson </em>v. Leibpke, 110 Iowa 594, 597, 81 N.W. 801; see 51 Am. Jur. 2d 950, 979, Lis Pendens, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 32, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The enactment of statutes such as \u00a7 52-325 of the General Statutes requiring the filing of notice of lis pendens served to alleviate the harsh result on third-party transferees wrought by the common law by affording them the opportunity of notice of the litigation affecting the property. The lis pendens statutes themselves, which we have discussed, in indicating the considerations which allow the release of a lis pendens, include nothing which diminishes the common-law view that the property should not be alienated, pendente lite, so as to preclude a court or a state referee acting as a court from granting such relief as is justifiable in the circumstances or such as would vitiate a judgment subsequently rendered at the conclusion of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Here, the referee, in ordering the partial release of the lis pendens based on equitable considerations which are in contention in the action, has prematurely considered the merits of the action and the ability of the plaintiff to prevail in the action. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>granting the motion the referee necessarily concluded that the plaintiff had no right to have a trust imposed on all the property subject to the outcome of the litigation. This was an adverse determination of an ultimate issue in the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. The defendants have cited no case law or statute that gives the court power to decide such a matter on motion. The doctrine of lis pendens was intended to preserve the property until the state referee in the present case had an opportunity to hear fully the case and render a final judgment. The referee acted beyond his power in ordering a partial release of a lis pendens during the pendency of the suit, based on equitable considerations that involve the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s action. That was for the state referee to do only in proper course and at the appropriate time.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">In <em>Sachs </em>v. <em>Nussenbaum, </em>92 Conn. 682, 687, 104 A. 393, we held that the power of the judge to dissolve an excessive attachment is limited by the language of the statute which allows such a dissolution only when the attachment is excessive, and, in ordering a dissolution, the judge had no power to test the legal sufficiency of the complaint or to weigh the chances for the plaintiff\u2019s recovery of his claim. See also <em>Clime </em>v. <em>Gregor, </em>145 Conn. 74, 76, 138 A.2d 794; <em>Csakany </em>v. <em>Takacs, </em>143 Conn. 485, 487, 123 A.2d 764; <em>D\u2019Andrea </em>v. <em>Rende, </em>123 Conn. 377, 380, 195 A. 741; <em>Cimminello </em>v. <em>A. M. S. Corporation, </em>4 Conn. Cir. Ct. 12, 224 A.2d 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">There is error and the order granting a partial release of the lis pendens is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-325.
