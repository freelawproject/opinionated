The sole issue is which of two Mississippi limitations periods applies, the one-year statute applicable to intentional torts or the six-year residual statute governing claims of a sort not treated elsewhere. The material facts are undisputed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-24\">The incident of which Mr. Thomas complains took place on November 29, 1983. At that time, under the rule of <em>Morrell v. City of Picayune, </em>690 F.2d 469 (5th Cir.1982), it was settled that the six-year statute applied to such actions. He first consulted counsel nearly two years later, however, and was then correctly advised that, under our Circuit\u2019s intervening decision in <em>Gates v. Spinks, </em>771 F.2d 916 (5th Cir. 1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1065, 106 S.Ct. 1378, 89 L.Ed.2d 603 (1986), the one-year statute applied and barred his action. After our decision in <em>Young v. Biggers, </em>820 F.2d 727 (5th Cir.1987), however, counsel concluded otherwise and, in September 1987, suit was filed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A few months later, responding to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985), we handed down <em>Hanner v. State of Mississippi, </em>833 F.2d 55 (1987), under the rule of which Thomas\u2019s action was again time-barred. Finally came the Supreme Court decision in <em>Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989), under which the six-year, residual statute plainly applies to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The district court viewed the question presented as one of <em>Okure\u2019s </em>retroactivity, concluded that it should not be retroactively applied \u201cwith respect to this plaintiff\u201d so as to \u201creward his prolonged inaction at the expense of the defendants\u2019 peace of mind,\u201d and dismissed the action. Despite our sympathy with the result \u2014 a sympathy arising chiefly from the staleness of some claims legitimately subject to being brought within the period of so lengthy a statute \u2014 we conclude that it cannot stand. In the first place, we are dubious that the problem presented is correctly viewed as one of retroactivity. In the second, we conclude that, even if it be so viewed, no inequity results.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">As for whether the problem is truly one of retroactivity at all, we note that after <em>Okure </em>was handed down on January 10, 1989, and before the running of the six-year statute on Thomas\u2019s claim on November 30, 1989, almost eleven months ensued \u2014 months during which, had he never brought an action at all, he could have done so. Thus, at a time when his remedy was not barred, it became known that limitations had not run on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">But even if the problem be viewed in terms of whether or not <em>Okure </em>should be retroactively applied, and if the <em>Chevron </em>factors be consulted, the result is the same. As the district court observed, cases are ordinarily decided in accordance with the law that exists at the time of decision. <em>Gulf Offshore Oil Co. v. Mobil Oil Co., </em>453 U.S. 473, 101 S.Ct. 2870, 69 L.Ed.2d 784 (1981). <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 107, 92 S.Ct. 349, 355, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971) sets forth factors to be considered in determining when special circumstances exist suggesting prospective application only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">First, the decision to be applied nonretro-actively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied ... or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.... Second, [the court must] \u2018weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.\u2019 Finally, [the court must weigh] the inequity imposed by retroactive application....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">We agree with the district court that, given the chaotic state of authority during the period in question, the first two <em>Chevron </em>factors are of little assistance. We are unable, however, to agree with the court that applying current law, settled by <em>Okure </em>as of the time of decision, would produce any inequity.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">Plaintiff consulted counsel within two years of the incident of which he complains, scarcely an outlandish delay. At that time, it appeared that limitations had run; but when later developments occurred indicating that it had not, suit was filed well within the true period provided by the state. Nor did any defendant take any action or change position to his detriment in reliance on any phase of the vacillating law since the claimed incident in November 1983. For all this record shows, none was more than an observer \u2014 an interested one, to be sure \u2014 as this unfortunate limitations quadrille of reversals and counter-reversals played itself out.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">For the reasons stated, we conclude that the judgment of the district court must be REVERSED and the cause REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-18\">. Each of the cited decisions represents an attempt by the Circuit to conform to controlling authority. <em>Morrell </em>followed <em>State for the Use of Smith v. Smith, </em>156 Miss. 288, 125 So. 825 (1930); <em>Gates </em>and <em>Hanner </em>sought to follow <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985); and <em>Young </em>was thought required by <em>St. Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, </em>481 U.S. 604, 107 S.Ct. 2022, 95 L.Ed.2d 582 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
