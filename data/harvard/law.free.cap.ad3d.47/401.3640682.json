(My Home) for summary judgment only to the extent of dismissing the seventh cause of action for punitive damages as against them, unanimously modified, on the law, the third and sixth causes of action dismissed as against My Home and, upon a search of the record, as against the Weintraub defendants, and otherwise affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">In this action to recover alleged damages resulting from renovation work being performed, with the cooperative\u2019s approval, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>by defendant contractor My Home for plaintiff Pamela Lipkin\u2019s upstairs neighbors, the Weintraub defendants, the case against the cooperative corporation and its residential managing agent was properly dismissed for lack of evidence that the cooperative committed any wrongful act leading to Dr. Lipkin\u2019s constructive eviction from her medical offices <em>(see Barash v Pennsylvania Term. Real Estate Corp., </em>26 NY2d 77, 82 [1970]). It is arguably the cooperative\u2019s duty, pursuant to the proprietary lease, to keep the concrete slab between Dr. Lipkin\u2019s offices and her upstairs neighbors in good repair unless the damage has been caused by a tenant <em>(cf Hauptman v 222 E. 80th St. Corp., </em>100 Misc 2d 153, 154-155 [1979]). However, plaintiffs failed to present any evidence that the damage was in any way caused by the cooperative rather than by the Weintraubs and their contractor or by Dr. Lipkin herself, who had previously made renovations to her offices, including work on the same slab. Other than by speculation, plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the cooperative controlled the means and methods of the work or that it was negligent in its approval of the renovation plan in the first place. Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on a notice of violation issued against the cooperative as evidence of its negligence is unavailing, as the notice does not allege any affirmative acts of negligence by the cooperative. Moreover, without any evidence of negligence on its part, the cooperative is shielded from liability pursuant to language in the parties\u2019 proprietary lease specifically providing that the cooperative \u201cshall not be liable for . . . injury or damage to person or property caused by . . . another tenant . . . unless caused by the negligence of the [cooperative].\u201d Furthermore, to the extent that plaintiffs claim the cooperative acted unreasonably in addressing Dr. Lipkin\u2019s complaints and determining that there was nothing more it was required to do with respect to those complaints, they present no evidence in support of such contention. Thus, any decision made by the cooperative and its managing agent with regard to such complaints, which the record reflects were primarily handled by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney and representatives of the Weintraubs and My Home, would be insulated from further judicial review <em>(see generally Matter of Levandusky v One Fifth Ave. Apt. Corp., </em>75 NY2d 530 [1990]).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">My Home\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment was properly denied; plaintiffs\u2019 expert affidavits raised issues of fact as to whether the work the contractor performed proximately caused debris and dust to infiltrate Dr. Lipkin\u2019s office, and whether the protective measures it recommended but Dr. Lipkin allegedly rejected would have been effective. Furthermore, an issue of fact exists as to whether My Home agreed to indemnify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Weintraub defendants for claims such as plaintiffs\u2019; accordingly, that part of its cross motion seeking dismissal of the Weintraub defendants\u2019 cross claims was also properly denied. However, the court should have dismissed the third cause of action against the Weintraub defendants and My Home for constructive eviction, as that claim can only be brought against a landlord <em>(see Barash, </em>26 NY2d at 82). Similarly, the sixth cause of action for tortious interference with Dr. Lipkin\u2019s leasehold rights should have been dismissed as against the Weintraub defendants and My Home, as that claim necessarily assumes liability on the part of the cooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Finally, plaintiffs\u2019 claim for punitive damages was properly dismissed since the complaint does not allege egregious culpable conduct or wrongdoing aimed at the general public <em>(Silverman v 145 Tenants Corp., </em>248 AD2d 261, 262 [1998]).
