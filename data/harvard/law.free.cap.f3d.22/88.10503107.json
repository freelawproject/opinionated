(Alamo) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff/Counter-Plaintiff/Appel-lee Gulf States Insurance Co. (Gulf States). Alamo also questions whether the district court abused its discretion by awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Gulf States; but because it does not brief the issue on appeal, we do not consider it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the petition in the underlying litigation alleged facts and claims which, if proved, would clearly be excluded from coverage under Alamo\u2019s policy of manufacturers\u2019 and contractors\u2019 general liability insurance, so that Gulf States had no duty to defend Alamo. Satisfied that Alamo\u2019s contention is so meritless as to be frivolous, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b171-22\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b171-23\">On January 7, 1989, Heije Carlsson, an Alamo employee, was injured while driving a truck owned by Alamo. At the time, Gulf States insured Alamo under a general liability policy. That policy provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-24\">Exclusions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-25\">This insurance does <em>not </em>apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-26\">b. to bodily injury ... arising out of the ... operation [or] use ... of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-28\">(1) any <em>automobile </em>... owned ... by ... any insured, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-29\">(2) any other automobile ... operated by any person in the course of his employment by any insured....<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-30\">Carlsson filed this personal injury action against Alamo and Gulf States in state court. Carlsson alleged that he was injured while performing an incidental contract for Alamo while driving a \u201cvehicle\u201d that was owned by Alamo. Gulf States appeared and answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>for itself, but did not provide a defense for Alamo. Alamo did not appear, and Carlsson took a default judgment against Alamo on liability issues. When Gulf States moved for summary judgment, Carlsson nonsuited Gulf States.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Gulf States then intervened, but Carlsson severed his claims against Alamo and took a default judgment as to Alamo in the principal amount of $415,297.00. Gulf States filed the instant declaratory judgment suit in federal court seeking a declaration that \u2014 as there was no coverage under the policy \u2014 it did not have a duty to defend Alamo, and thus was not liable for the judgment against Alamo. In response, Alamo asserted a cross-claim against Gulf States in the state court action. Gulf States then removed the state court action to federal court, where it was consolidated with the pending declaratory judgment action. The parties were ordered to file cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The district court granted Gulf States\u2019 motion and denied Alamo\u2019s and Carlsson\u2019s motions. The district court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Gulf States. Alamo appeals, asserting that the word \u201cvehicle\u201d in Carls-son\u2019s petition is ambiguous, and that Gulf States could not look beyond the \u201ceight corners\u201d of the state court petition and the insurance contract to deny coverage on the basis that the \u201cvehicle\u201d was a truck and thus an \u201cautomobile,\u201d which clearly would not be covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"AM6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment de novo, \u201creviewing the record under the same standards which guided the district court.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issue of material fact exists that would necessitate a trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In determining on appeal whether the grant of a summary judgment was proper, all fact questions are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Questions of law \u2014 including the construction and effect of an unambiguous contract \u2014 are always decided de novo.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">B. <em>Contract Exclusion: No Duty to Defend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">If the policy did not cover Carlsson\u2019s injury or damage, then Gulf States owed Alamo no duty to defend.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under Texas law, a court determines an insurer\u2019s duty to defend by examining the allegations in the petition filed against the insured and the relevant insurance policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For such a duty to be established, the pleadings must allege a claim that is \u201cpotentially\u201d covered by the applicable policy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But when the plaintiffs petition makes allegations which, if proved, would place the plaintiffs claim within an exclusion from coverage, there is no duty to defend.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-17\">If all facts alleged by Carlsson were proved, his claim clearly would fall within the automobile exclusion. Alamo\u2019s contention that the word \u201cvehicle\u201d may or may not be encompassed in the policy term \u201cautomobile,\u201d and that the automobile exclusion does not necessarily apply, evokes such adjectives as nonsensical, specious, fatuous, and frivolous, to name but a few. The tenor of Alamo\u2019s argument is that the word \u201cvehicle\u201d as used in Carlsson\u2019s state court petition is ambiguous \u2014 that it could refer to \u201cautomobile\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u201cmobile equipment,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that if Carlsson were operating \u201cmobile equipment\u201d when he was injured, then there was coverage under the policy and Gulf States was required to defend the suit against Alamo. Although such a contention might prompt a law school exam grader to give extra credit for imagination, it has no place in a court of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Carlsson\u2019s petition alleges that he was driving a vehicle owned by Alamo on a public road when the vehicle he was in was rear-ended, struck on the side, and struck a third time in the driver\u2019s side door.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He was driving the vehicle to carry out a mission for his employer \u2014 to sell Alamo Carriage Service Driving Academy to a Houston-based proprietary school. Nothing in the petition suggests that Carlsson was operating some sort of \u201cmobile equipment\u201d as distinguished from an automobile; to the contrary, every fact alleged confirms that he was driving a motor vehicle, i.e., an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The district court correctly held that Carlsson\u2019s petition did not allege any claim covered by the insurance policy. Thus, given the obvious applicability of the automobile exclusion, there could be no duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is dismissed as frivolous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-15\">. <em>Morrison v.
