INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b501-18\">Settlement of mass tort litigations for personal injuries have become extraordinarily complex and difficult as a result of the attempts by the United States to collect on Medicare liens and of the states to enforce their Medicaid liens. The settlement techniques utilized in the instant litigation may provide a model for the handling of Medicare and Medicaid liens in future mass actions on a uniform, national basis. Although complete uniformity was not achieved, the parties, the federal government, and many of the states demonstrated that they can work together for the benefit of taxpayers, injured plaintiffs, and industry. The experience in this case suggests the desirability of a more uniform statutory approach to lien resolution in the Medicaid program, either by uniform individual state legislation devised by the Commission on Uniform State Laws or others, or by national legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-19\">In this mass tort multidistrict litigation, a unique series of agreements have been reached among the Plaintiffs\u2019 Steering Committee (\u201cPSC\u201d) and representatives of the federal government and twenty-three states to resolve outstanding Medicare and Medicaid liens on the recoveries of plaintiffs who have entered into a settlement of their claims. Payments to settling plaintiffs who received neither Medicare nor Medicaid, who received only Medicare, and who received Medicaid from these twenty-three states have begun. Payments will continue expeditiously until all are paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-21\">The Medicaid liens of twenty-seven states, the District of Columbia, and Puer-to Rico remain partially or completely unresolved, because of disputes over (1) the amount of the liens; (2) the division of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs between the settling plaintiffs and the states seeking to recover Medicaid disbursements from those plaintiffs; and (3) whether the cost of the drug Zyprexa should be included in the states\u2019 liens. Payments to settling plaintiffs who received Medicaid from these jurisdictions have not yet begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-22\">This memorandum and order describes the terms of the agreements entered into by the PSC, the federal government, and the states. It rules on two disputed issues, holding: (1) all states, regardless of specific state policies on the matter, shall pay a portion of the settling plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs; and (2) the cost of Zyprexa shall not be included in the states\u2019 Medicaid liens. The method of disbursement of funds is specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">A.Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In April 2004, pre-trial proceedings were consolidated in actions against defendant Eli Lilly &amp; Company (\u201cLilly\u201d) for injuries alleged to have been caused by the prescription drug Zyprexa. <em>See </em>letter of April 14, 2004 from the Multidistrict Litigation Panel to the Clerk of the Eastern District of New York. After discovery and negotiations overseen by a court-appointed special discovery master and four special settlement masters, in November 2005 the defendant, without conceding liability, entered into a settlement covering some 8,000 individual plaintiffs. <em>See In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-MD-1596, 2005 WL 3117302 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 2005). As a result of the settlement agreement, a significant sum was placed in an escrow account to be paid to settling plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The complex claims processing procedure set forth in the master settlement agreement and in a series of court orders has now been completed. All individual awards have been fixed by the special settlement masters. <em>See </em>letter of August 18, 2006 from special master Kenneth R. Feinberg setting forth awards for each settling plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">An attorneys\u2019 fees structure has been ordered, capping fees at 20% of recovery in certain smaller, lump-sum claims and at 35% of recovery in all other claims. <em>See In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>424 F.Supp.2d <em>488 </em>(E.D.N.Y.2006). Costs related to the individual cases and charged to the individual settling plaintiffs are limited to 1% of each plaintiffs recovery. <em>See In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-MD-1596, 2006 WL 2443248 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2006). Costs and fees for work done on behalf of all plaintiffs by the PSC are to be paid out of a \u201ccommon benefit\u201d fund. The magistrate judge will audit all of the PSC\u2019s claims on this fund. <em>See </em>Order for Set Aside for the Common Benefit Fund for Members of the Former Plaintiffs\u2019 Steering Committee dated August 24, 2006; <em>In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig, </em>No. 04-MD-1596, 2006 WL 2458878 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2006) (referring oversight of the PSC\u2019s claims to the magistrate judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">B. Allegedly Related Medical Costs Paid by Medicare and Medicaid</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Zyprexa is an atypical antipsychotic medication whose on-label uses include treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and bipolar disorder. Almost all of the plaintiffs in the present action are mentally ill, some severely so. Some are completely unable to work, and a large number have very limited resources. Many of the plaintiffs suffer from numerous physical ailments in addition to the serious medical problems \u2014 including diabetes and pan-creatitis \u2014 that were allegedly caused by Zyprexa.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">Approximately 61% of the over 8,000 settling plaintiffs received state Medicaid benefits. Approximately 55% received Medicare benefits. Approximately 32% of all settling plaintiffs are \u201cdual beneficiaries,\u201d having received both Medicare and Medicaid. <em>See </em>Status Report of the Gar-retson Law Firm dated July 19, 2006 at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">C. Medicare and Medicaid Liens</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">Because the federal Medicare and joint federal-state Medicaid programs paid health care costs allegedly associated with injuries the plaintiffs claim were caused by their ingestion of Zyprexa, the administrators of these programs now assert their right to reimbursement of their disbursements out of the settling plaintiffs\u2019 recoveries. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(ii)-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>(iv); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25). <em>See also In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-MD-1596, 2006 WL 1662610 (E.D.N.Y. June 15, 2006) (setting initial conference regarding a possible holdback to satisfy Medicare and Medicaid liens).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In order to determine the amount of their liens on a beneficiary\u2019s settlement with a third party, Medicare and Medicaid authorities typically conduct an extensive examination of the beneficiary\u2019s claims history to determine the amount expended by the program on health care specifically related to the injury at the heart of the settlement. By reason of the many thousands of individuals involved in the present case and their complicated medical histories \u2014 many of the plaintiffs have significant pre-existing conditions not attributable to Zyprexa \u2014 the traditional \u201cone-at-a-time\u201d method of review of Medicare and Medicaid claims and lien demands would be time-consuming and costly, wasting needed resources and the time of governmental agencies, the court, and the litigants. It would inordinately delay recovery for the settling plaintiffs, many of whom are in desperate need of prompt assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In an effort to facilitate cost-effective and timely reimbursements to Medicare and Medicaid while protecting the settling plaintiffs\u2019 right to compensation for their injuries, the PSC engaged an independent law firm \u2014 the Garretson Law Firm (\u201cGar-retson\u201d) \u2014 -with experience in damage evaluation to design and implement models that could be used for a global resolution of the federal and state claims. The resulting models were designed to determine the likely course of treatment associated with each \u201csignature injury\u201d alleged to have been caused by Zyprexa, including diagnosis and on-going medical management. The models identify tests, procedures, and resources utilized in the standard course of treatment as well as the \u201cfrequency and probability of a [settling] plaintiff ... progressing from node-to-node on a medical decision tree from the date of ... ingestion to the date of settlement.\u201d Status Report of the Garretson Law Firm dated July 19, 2006 at 3. By plugging in the federal Medicare and state Medicaid procedure codes and reimbursement rates, the models can be used to generate a reasonable lien recovery for each agency</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The federal government quickly and sensibly agreed to a global resolution of its Medicare claims. <em>See </em>Tr. of July 24, 2006 Conf. 24-33; Stipulation and Order dated Aug. 21, 2006 (describing and approving Medicare lien agreement between the federal government and the PSC). In support of the proposed Medicaid process, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) issued a letter to the state Medicaid agencies \u201cstrongly\u201d encouraging them to participate in global settlements of their liens in mass tort litigations. <em>See </em>Ctrs. for Medicare and Medicaid Servs., Pursuing Medicaid Reimbursement in Global Settlements 1 (2006). According to CMS\u2019 letter, given the burdens involved in establishing the amount of Medicaid\u2019s recovery, it might prove reasonable for the states to \u201cagree to be bound by a settlement which compensates [them] for a reasonable estimate of the medical expenses incurred ... on behalf of Medicaid recipients involved in the settlement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. CMS assured the states that were they to decide to participate in a global resolution of their liens in a mass tort litigation, they would not be found to be in violation of federal regulations preventing the states from compromising the federal share of them Medicaid hens. <em>Id. See </em>part III.B, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">At conferences on June 29 and July 24, 2006, the court heard from the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>masters, the parties, the states, and the federal government regarding the resolution of the Medicare and Medicaid liens. A number of states objected to the use of the global damages model to resolve their Medicaid claims. <em>See </em>Tr. of June 29, 2006 Conf.; Tr. of July 24, 2006 Conf. After reminding all those involved of the importance of a speedy resolution that would permit payments to begin promptly, the court ordered the states and the PSC to continue negotiating. <em>See </em>Tr. of July 24, 2006 Conf.; <em>In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-MD-1596, 2006 WL 2095728 (E.D.N.Y. July 28, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The PSC reached partial or complete agreement with twenty-nine of the states on August 15, 2006. This agreement was approved on the same day. <em>In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-MD-1596, 2006 WL 2385230 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 2006) (describing and approving Medicaid lien agreements between certain states and the PSC). The PSC later reached agreement with sixteen more states.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">To finalize the details of the Medicaid agreements and the earlier Medicare agreement and to discuss the status of negotiations with those states that had not yet agreed to resolve their liens, a conference was held on August 21, 2006. The only material issues remaining unresolved as of the August 21 conference were: (1) how attorneys\u2019 fees and costs should be divided between the settling plaintiffs and some of the states seeking to recover their Medicaid disbursements from those plaintiffs; and (2) whether the cost of Zyprexa itself should be included in the amount of the states\u2019 Medicaid liens. <em>See </em>Tr. of Aug. 21, 2006 Conf.; <em>In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-MD-1596, 2006 WL 2385232 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 16, 2006) (describing concerns about fee division); Status Update From the States of Ohio, Mississippi, Virginia, and the District of Columbia dated August 21, 2006 at 6-7 (describing some states\u2019 position that the cost of Zyprexa should be included in their liens). Briefing was ordered on those issues. Tr. of Aug. 21, 2006 Conf. at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">On August 24, 2006, two orders were issued providing for the start of payments to specific categories of settling plaintiffs whose Medicare or Medicaid liens had been completely resolved and whose recoveries were unaffected by the two issues still pending. <em>See In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-MD-1596, 2006 WL 2443217 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2006) (ordering payments to begin); <em>In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-MD-1596, 2006 WL 2443249 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2006) (establishing disbursement procedures). The terms of these orders \u2014 including the procedures ordered for disbursement of the settlement funds \u2014 are described below. <em>See </em>parts VI-VII, <em>infra. </em>As a result of the August 24 orders, payments have begun to thousands of settling plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">A separate sealing order protected the settling plaintiffs\u2019 privacy. <em>See In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-CV-1596, 2006 WL 2551842 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">To understand the nature of the problems involved in attempts to resolve Medicare and Medicaid liens in a mass tort settlement such as the instant one, it is necessary to understand the status of these liens under federal and state law, a subject discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">III. MEDICARE AND MEDICAID LIENS ON TORT SETTLEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">A. Medicare Liens</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">The Medicare program was established in 1965 as Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 <em>et seq. </em>Medicare is a social insurance program funded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>entirely by the United States government. It provides coverage for certain types of medical services to individuals who are more than 65 years of age, those who have received Social Security disability benefits for at least 24 months, and those with end stage renal disease. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395c; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395o.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">From 1965 to 1980 Medicare was the primary payer of health care costs for most eligible individuals. <em>See, e.g., Health Ins. Ass\u2019n of Am. v. Shalala, </em>23 F.3d 412, 414 (D.C.Cir.1994). <em>Cf. </em>S.S.R. 69-8 (1969) (because Medicare is in the nature of social insurance, there is nothing inconsistent with simultaneous reimbursement under Medicare and from other sources). The Medicare Secondary Payer Act of 1980 (\u201cMSP\u201d) sought to lower Medicare\u2019s expenses by making Medicare the \u201csecondary payer\u201d after any other entity obligated to pay for an individual\u2019s primary health care (the \u201cprimary payer\u201d), including group health plans, workers\u2019 compensation, or an automobile or other liability policy or plan. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2). If payment for covered services has been or is reasonably expected to be made by someone else, Medicare does not have to pay. <em>Id. </em>If Medicare does pay for a service that was or should have been covered by a primary payer, Medicare is empowered to recoup its outlay. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(ii)-(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">For many years courts were divided about the propriety of the federal government\u2019s attempts to recover Medicare expenditures under the MSP in cases involving settled tort claims. <em>Compare Thompson v. Goetzmann, </em>337 F.3d 489 (5th Cir.2003) (government could not recover from an individual beneficiary\u2019s settlement of a products liability claim with a manufacturer); <em>In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>202 F.R.D. 154, 163-69 (E.D.Pa.2001) (government could not recover under the MSP from the settlement of a class action tort claim against an orthopedic bone screw manufacturer), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Fanning v. United States, </em>346 F.3d 386 (3d Cir.2003); <em>In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>Nos. MDL 1203, CIV. A. 99-20593, 2001 WL 283163 (E.D.Pa. Mar. 21, 2001) (government could not recover under the MSP from a mass tort settlement fund, because the government\u2019s \u201cMSP cause of action arises when the \u2018primary plan\u2019 is obligated to pay for the primary care at issue under a contract of insurance, not when the payment obligation arises out of tort litigation\u201d) <em>with United States v. Baxter Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>345 F.3d 866, 885-93 (11th Cir.2003) (reversing the district court\u2019s dismissal of the government\u2019s claim for recovery out of a class settlement fund of medical bills it paid on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries who received treatment related to silicone breast implants); <em>Estate of Urso v. Thompson, </em>309 F.Supp.2d 253, 256-59 (D.Conn.2004) (the MSP gives the government the right to recover its share of an individual Medicare beneficiary\u2019s tort settlement); <em>Brown v. Thompson, </em>252 F.Supp.2d 312 (D.Va.2003) (the MSP confers on the government the right to reimbursement from beneficiary\u2019s medical malpractice settlement for Medicare payments received for services related to the malpractice), <em>aff'd, </em>374 F.3d 253, 256 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">In December 2003, amendments to the MSP were adopted that were designed to resolve this dispute. <em>See </em>Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Pub.L. No. 108-173, \u00a7 301, 117 Stat.2066, 2221 (2003) (hereinafter \u201cMMA\u201d); <em>see also </em>H.R.Rep. No. 108-178(11) at 189 (explaining that the \u201cSecretary\u2019s authority to recover payment from any and all responsible entities\u201d under the MSP \u201cwould be clarified\u201d as a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>amendments in the MMA); H.R.Rep.

The amendments to the MSP enacted in the MMA removed the two elements of the MSP that had resulted in courts\u2019 conflicting interpretations of the law. <em>Brown v.

As amended, the MSP \u201cplainly entitles Medicare to reimbursement of any payment it makes for medical services if a primary plan later pays for those medical services as part of a settlement agreement.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>374 F.3d at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Although Medicare\u2019s recovery from the proceeds of a tort settlement is protected by statute, in several instances a reduction or waiver of this recovery may be obtained. Federal regulations require Medicare to reduce the amount of its recovery \u201cto take account of the cost of procuring the judgment or settlement ... if: (i)[p]ro-curement costs are incurred because the claim is disputed; and (ii)[t]hose costs are borne by the party against which [Medicare] seeks to recover.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.37(a). If the Medicare lien is less than the amount of the settlement, the reduction for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses is equal to the ratio of the attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses to the total recovery. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.37(c). If Medicare\u2019s lien equals or exceeds the amount of the settlement, the regulations provide that Medicare will recover the full amount of the lien less the attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.37(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Medicare may also reduce or waive its recovery if either \u201cthe probability of recovery, or the amount involved, does not warrant pursuit of the claim.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 411.28. Medicare may decide to compromise a claim because: the Medicare beneficiary is unable \u201cto pay the full amount within a reasonable time\u201d; the federal government is unable \u201cto collect ... in full within a reasonable time\u201d; \u201cthe cost of collecting ... does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount\u201d; or \u201cthere is significant doubt concerning the [g]overnment\u2019s ability to prove its case in court.\u201d 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 902.2(a). <em>See also </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.376; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.515.

By contrast, Medicaid is paid for out of state and federal taxpayer-funded accounts. The Medicaid program generally covers less affluent members of society than does Medicare. Some of the states take a harsher view towards Medicaid liens than the federal government takes towards Medicare liens. To understand the reason, at least in part, it is necessary to turn to the subject of Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">B. Medicaid Liens</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The Medicaid program was established in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act. <em>See 42 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq. </em>Medicaid is a needs-based entitlement program providing joint federal and state funding of medical care for specified classes of individuals found to be unable to pay their own medical costs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d. All of the states voluntarily participate in the Medicaid program.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Between 50% and 83% percent of each state\u2019s patient-care-related Medicaid costs are paid for by the federal government\u2014 the exact percentage for a particular state (the \u201cfederal medical assistance percentage\u201d) is calculated pursuant to a formula tied to the state\u2019s per capita income. <em>See 42 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(b); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.10. The state pays its portion of the costs and complies with federal requirements for determining eligibility and administering the program. <em>See 42 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a. <em>See also Arkansas Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs. v. Ahlbom, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 126 S.Ct. 1752, 1758-59, 164 L.Ed.2d 459 (2006) (describing the structure and administration of the Medicaid program).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">As a condition of participating in the Medicaid program, states are required to \u201ctake all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties ... to pay for care and services available under the [state\u2019s Medicaid] plan.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(A). If third party liability is found after the state has provided medical services to a beneficiary and \u201cthe amount of reimbursement the [s]tate can reasonably expect to recover exceeds the costs of such recovery,\u201d the state is required to \u201cseek reimbursement ... to the extent of such legal liability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(B). To this end, states must require Medicaid recipients to assign to the state their rights to seek and collect payment for medical care from a responsible third party. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396k(a)(1)(A) (a state plan for medical assistance shall \u201cprovide that, as a condition of eligibility for medical assistance under the [s]tate plan to an individual who has the legal capacity to execute an assignment for himself, the individual is required to assign the [s]tate any rights, of the individual ... to payment for medical care from any third party\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(H) (\u201cto the extent that payment has been made under the [s]tate plan for medical assistance in any case where a third party has a legal liability to make payment for such assistance, the [s]tate has in effect laws under which, to the extent that payment has been made under the [s]tate plan for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual, the [s]tate is considered to have acquired the rights of such individual to payment by any other party for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>health care items or services\u201d). <em>See also </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.137-433.154.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">If a state Medicaid agency receives reimbursement from a liable third party for care or services, it does not receive federal financial participation (\u201cFFP\u201d) for the relevant Medicaid expenditures. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.140(a)(2). Likewise, if the state could have received reimbursement from a third party but failed to comply with federal regulations requiring it to attempt to establish liability and pursue reimbursement from that third party, <em>see </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.138-433.139, the state does not receive FFP in its Medicaid expenditures. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.140(a)(1). If a state that has already received FFP in its Medicaid expenditures later receives third party reimbursement for those expenditures, the state must pay the federal government \u201ca portion of the reimbursement determined in accordance with the [federal medical assistance percentage] for the [s]tate.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.140(c). <em>See also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396k(b) (any reimbursement \u201cshall be retained by the [s]tate as is necessary to reimburse it for medical assistance payments made on behalf of an individual with respect to whom such assignment was executed\u201d ... with \u201cappropriate reimbursement of the [f]ederal [g]overnment to the extent of its participation in the financing of such medical assistance\u201d); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.154 (when the state receives reimbursement from a third party, it keeps an amount equal to its own \u201cMedicaid expenditures for the individual on whose right the collection was based,\u201d distributes to the federal government \u201cthe [f]ederal share of the [s]tate Medicaid expenditures,\u201d and gives the remainder to the beneficiary).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">If, despite having pursued third-party reimbursement in compliance with federal requirements, a state receives less than full reimbursement for its Medicaid expenditures, the federal share of the recovery is reduced pro rata. The same protection accrues to the state if it voluntarily reduces or waives its recovery because it determines that it is not cost-effective to attempt to recover the full amount of its Medicaid expenditures. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(B); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.139(f); Ctrs. for Medicare and Medicaid Servs., State Options for Recovery Against Liability Settlements in Light of the U.S. Supreme Court Decision in <em>Arkansas Department of Human Services v. Ahlborn </em>4 (2006). Practical aspects of transactional costs in attempted recoveries are thus recognized explicitly by the system. A judgment call and some discretion on the part of the state in assessing costs and benefits is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">States may voluntarily reduce or waive their recovery for reasons other than costeffectiveness, but if they do, they will not receive FFP in the relevant Medicaid expenditures. If a state that has already received FFP voluntarily reduces or waives its claim to recovery for a reason other than cost-effectiveness, the federal share of that recovery is not reduced pro rata and the state must reimburse the federal government. <em>See, e.g., In re Washington State Dep\u2019t of Soc. &amp; Health Servs., </em>No. A-95-159, 1996 WL 157123 (H.H.S.Dep\u2019t App. Bd.

Except within the confines of the \u201ccost-effectiveness\u201d exception described above, states are not permitted to compromise the federal government\u2019s share of any reimbursement. <em>See Ahlbom, </em>126 S.Ct. at 1765 (describing the Departmental Appeals Board\u2019s determination in the <em>California </em>and <em>Washington </em>cases that \u201ca state is free to allow recipients to retain the state\u2019s share of any recovery, so long as it does not compro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>mise the [fjederal [g]overnment\u2019s share\u201d); Ctrs. for Medicare and Medicaid Servs., Pursuing Medicaid Reimbursement in Global Settlements B (2006) (describing CMS\u2019 \u201cno compromise\u201d rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Some states have enacted laws allowing waiver of Medicaid liens where recovery would work an undue hardship on the beneficiary or defeat the purposes of the program. <em>See, e.g., </em>Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.Code \u00a7 14124.71(b) (allowing waiver if recovery \u201cwould result in undue hardship\u201d); Tex. Hum. Res.Code Ann. \u00a7 32.033(f) (allowing waiver if recovery \u201cwould tend to defeat the purpose of public assistance\u201d). <em>Cf. </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 108A-57 (limiting the amount of medical assistance liens to 33.3% of the beneficiary\u2019s gross recovery). In addition, a number of state courts have relied on state subrogation law to limit the amount of the state Medicaid agency\u2019s recovery in particular cases. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Alabama Medicaid Agency, </em>461 So.2d 817 (Ala.Civ.App.1984) (allowing full recovery because the percentage was fair in the particular case, but cautioning that Medicaid\u2019s recovery was subject to equitable reduction); <em>State v. Cowdell, </em>421 N.E.2d 667 (Ind.Ct.App.1981) (state Medicaid agency\u2019s recovery may be reduced under equitable principles of subrogation); <em>White v. Sutherland, </em>92 N.M. 187, 585 P.2d 331 (N.M.Ct.App.1978) (state Medicaid agency\u2019s recovery may be reduced under equitable principles of subrogation). <em>Cf. Davis v. City of Chicago, </em>59 Ill.2d 439, 322 N.E.2d 29 (Ill. 1974) (upholding a provision of Illinois law that explicitly granted the court power to apportion a settlement between Medicaid and the beneficiary). <em>But see, e.g., Copeland v. Toyota Motor Sales, </em>136 F.3d 1249 (10th Cir.1998) (because the Kansas Medicaid reimbursement statute contains other express limitations on the agency\u2019s subro-gation rights, the court would not impose additional, implied limitations on recovery based on general equitable principles); <em>Co-plien v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Social Servs., </em>119 Wis.2d 52, 349 N.W.2d 92 (Wis.Ct.App.1984) (full recovery allowed on grounds that relevant Wisconsin law specifically provided that normal principles of subro-gation were not to be applied to reimbursement of medical assistance payments).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">C. <em>Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services v. Ahlborn</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">When a beneficiary\u2019s settlement with a third party is for less than her total damages, a majority of the states and the federal government maintain that federal laws governing reimbursement in both Medicare and Medicaid entitle them to full recovery of the amount of their liens, regardless of the classification of the settlement proceeds. <em>See, e.g., Sullivan v. County of Suffolk, </em>174 F.3d 282, 286 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5 (2d Cir.1999); <em>Zinman v. Shalala, </em>67 F.3d 841 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Houghton v. Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>57 P.3d 1067 (Utah 2002); <em>Richards v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Comty. Health, </em>278 Ga. 757, 604 S.E.2d 815 (2004); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>142 Wash.2d 40, 10 P.3d 1061 (2000); <em>Calvanese v. Calvanese, </em>93 N.Y.2d 111, 688 N.Y.S.2d 479, 710 N.E.2d 1079 (1999); <em>Share Health Plan of Illinois v. Alderson, </em>285 Ill.App.3d 489, 220 Ill.Dec. 798, 674 N.E.2d 69 (1996). Under this approach, when the amount of the Medicare or Medicaid lien exceeds the portion of the settlement that represents medical costs, satisfaction of the lien \u201crequires payment out of proceeds meant to compensate the [beneficiary] for damages distinct from medical costs, such as pain and suffering, lost wages, and loss of future earnings.\u201d <em>Ahlborn, </em>126 S.Ct. at 1756.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Federal Medicare and state Medicaid administrators justify a \u201cfull reimbursement\u201d approach on the ground that \u201cthe required apportionment of [settlement proceeds] short of a decision on the merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>would [otherwise] allow beneficiaries and personal injury attorneys to reduce or eliminate ... reimbursements by weighing claims in favor of items of damage other than medical expenses.\u201d <em>Denekas v. Shalala, </em>943 F.Supp. 1073, 1080 (S.D.Iowa1996). Yet full reimbursement deprives poor and injured individuals of needed compensation for their pain and suffering, lost wages, and other non-medical damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Moreover, although the policy provides Medicare and Medicaid with the maximum possible recovery in individual cases, it could adversely affect the programs\u2019 overall ability to obtain repayment of their costs from third party tortfeasors. Because it may deprive them of any compensation for their injuries, the full reimbursement approach gives many beneficiaries little incentive to pursue valid claims or, if they do, to accept otherwise reasonable settlement offers, thereby tending to push them into uncertain litigation that burdens the courts and may result in little or no recovery for either the beneficiaries or for Medicare or Medicaid. The comparison with workers\u2019 compensation claims in New York, which are settled on a reasonable basis, eliminating unnecessary litigation in this district\u2019s federal court, suggests why such an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d approach may be self-defeating.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In May 2006, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, rejected the full reimbursement approach in the Medicaid program, holding that the federal Medicaid statute only permits a state to recover its Medicaid expenditures from the portion of a settlement attributable to medical costs. <em>Ahlborn, </em>126 S.Ct. at 1767. The Court first held that the assignment provisions of federal Medicaid law \u2014 requiring states to enact laws providing for assignment of Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 rights to seek and collect payment for medical care from a responsible third party- \u2014 only provide for a limited assignment from the recipient to the state for payment for medical items and services from a liable third party. <em>Id. </em>at 1760-62. It then concluded that any state statute providing for a greater assignment or lien would be inconsistent with the Medicaid \u201canti-lien\u201d statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p, which prohibits states from placing liens against or seeking recovery of benefits from a Medicaid beneficiary before her death. <em>Id. </em>at 1762-64. According to the Court, while the assignment provisions create an exception to the anti-lien statute for recovery of payments that constitute reimbursement for medical costs paid by Medicaid, any recovery by the state of settlement funds intended to reimburse the Medicaid beneficiary for pain and suffering, lost wages, or other non-medical damages would constitute an impermissible lien on the beneficiary\u2019s property. <em>Id. </em>at 1763-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">IY. GLOBAL RESOLUTION OF THE MEDICARE LIENS</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The federal government and the PSC have agreed that the federal government\u2019s Medicare liens are to be resolved through the use of a global damages model designed and implemented by Garretson. <em>See </em>Stipulation and Order dated Aug. 21, 2006 (describing and approving Medicare lien agreement between the federal government and the PSC). Having applied the global damages model to each of the \u201csignature injuries\u201d alleged to have been caused by Zyprexa, the parties have agreed upon uniform reimbursement amounts for Medicare\u2019s outlays for diagnosis and treatment of most of these injuries.

Resolution of the Remaining States\u2019 Liens</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">As of the date of this memorandum and order, five states \u2014 Ohio, Mississippi, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Wisconsin\u2014 along with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have failed to reach any agreement with the PSC regarding resolution of their Medicaid liens. <em>See </em>Tr. of Aug. 21, 2006 Conf. at 33-76 (roll call of the states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands). The court encourages these states to work with the PSC to resolve their liens as quickly as possible in accordance with the legal conclusions embodied in part VIII of this memorandum and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">While the court understands that the states are under an obligation to the state taxpayers and to the federal government to collect on their Medicaid liens, the five remaining states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico will \u2014 like the states who have already agreed to a resolution of their liens \u2014 have the protection of a national and fair inquiry, an arms-length ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>gotiation, oversight by experienced special masters, the explicit encouragement of the federal government, and approval by the court to fall back on. <em>See </em>Ctrs. for Medicare and Medicaid Servs., Pursuing Medicaid Reimbursement in Global Settlements (2006) (strongly encouraging the states to participate in global settlements). This should assure those responsible for administration of these jurisdictions\u2019 Medicaid programs of the need for flexibility to achieve a lien resolution that is fair to all concerned. They undoubtedly have in mind their obligation not only to the public fisc, but also to their own citizens who are entitled to and need relief now.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">VI. START OF PAYMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">On August 24, 2006, an order was issued providing for the start of payments to four classes of settling plaintiffs: (1) all settling plaintiffs who received neither Medicare or Medicaid; (2) all settling plaintiffs who received only Medicare and whose liens are therefore covered by the global resolution agreed to by the federal government and the PSC; (3) all settling plaintiffs who received Medicaid from a state that has agreed to the resolution of its liens by means of the Medicaid global model; and (4) all settling plaintiffs who received Medicaid from a state that has agreed to use the traditional-holdback method of lien resolution and to bear some portion of the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. <em>In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-MD1596, 2006 WL 2443217 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2006). <em>See </em>part V, <em>supra </em>and part VIII.A.1, <em>infra. </em>States whose Medicaid-beneficiary plaintiffs are included in categories (3) and (4) are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming. <em>See id.; </em>Tr. of Aug. 21, 2006 Conf. at 33-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Payments have not begun to settling plaintiffs who received Medicaid from states that have not yet reached agreement regarding resolution of their Medicaid liens, namely Ohio, Mississippi, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. <em>See </em>Tr. of Aug. 21 Conf. at 33-76. Nor have payments begun to Medicaid-beneficiary plaintiffs in those states that have agreed to resolve their liens but have not explicitly agreed to pay a share of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. These \u201cno-fee\u201d states include both those that have expressed opposition to fee-sharing \u2014 Arkansas, Connecticut, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and South Carolina \u2014 and those that have not yet contacted either the PSC or the court to state their position regarding fee \u2014 sharing-Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Vermont. <em>See id. See also </em>part VIII.A.2, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Payments to the settling plaintiffs are unaffected by the dispute over inclusion of the cost of Zyprexa in the amount of the states\u2019 Medicaid liens \u2014 the states using the global model have agreed that the cost of the drug will not be included and the states using a traditional method have agreed to a set holdback regardless of the total amount of their liens. The court ordered Garretson to refrain from making disbursements to those states claiming the cost of Zyprexa until the court rules on this issue. <em>In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-MD-1596, 2006 WL 2443245 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2006).

The amount to be withheld for liens under the approved agreements with the federal government and the states shall be deducted by Garret-son from the amount awarded to the settling plaintiff by the Special Masters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">2. The amount left after withholding shall be remitted to the settling plaintiffs attorney on the direction of Garretson. Before receiving funds for payment a plaintiffs attorney shall file a certificate with the court indicating: (1) that the funds will be deposited in the firm\u2019s escrow account and; (2) that the attorney is of the opinion that the firm\u2019s insurance policy protects the funds against despoliation from within the firm. A copy of this certificate shall be forwarded to Garretson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">3. Upon receipt of settlement proceeds, the attorney shall retain the amount of the attorney\u2019s fees and costs in accordance with the court\u2019s orders of March 28 and August 24, 2006 setting a fee schedule and allowing up to 1% for actual costs that are not being absorbed by the PSC in its application for reimbursement. <em>See In re Zyprexa Prods.

Aug. 24, 2006) (allowing up to 1% for non-common benefit costs to be taxed to the individual plaintiffs\u2019 recoveries).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">4. The attorney shall disburse the settling plaintiffs net proceeds to the plaintiff within 21 days of receipt of applicable funds. Failure to comply with this time limit because of the claimant\u2019s disappearance, death, or other such reason shall be promptly disclosed to the court and Garretson, with the amount due the claimant being kept in the firm\u2019s escrow account pending further order of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">5. From the amount withheld for liens, Garretson shall remit directly to the state and federal lien holders the amounts required to pay the liens, as determined by the global models or the \u201ctraditional\u201d case-by-case approach agreed to by the federal government and the states. States will be added to this category as they reach agreement on the percentage of Medicaid liens to be withheld.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">6. Any amount from the lien holdback not required to pay the liens under the approved agreements shall be remitted by Garretson to the settling plaintiffs attorney. The plaintiffs attorney shall disburse these \u201cleftover\u201d amounts to the settling plaintiff within 21 days of receipt, except as provided in paragraph 4, where failure to comply with this time limit results from the claimant\u2019s disappearance, death, or other such reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-13\">7.

CONTESTED ISSUES RELEVANT TO THE MEDICAID LIENS</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">A. Payment of Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Federal Medicaid regulations allow states to deduct the costs of obtaining recovery, including attorneys\u2019 fees, before reimbursement to the federal government for its financial participation in the state\u2019s Medicaid costs; if costs are deducted, the amount of the federal government\u2019s share is determined with reference to the reduced rather than the original recovery by the state. <em>See </em>Ctrs. for Medicare <em>&amp; </em>Medicaid Servs., Dep\u2019t of Health <em>&amp; </em>Human Servs., State Medicaid Manual \u00a7 3907. As a result, there is sufficient flexibility built into the reimbursement system to permit a reasonable sharing of the expenses of litigation against third parties among the states, the federal government, and Medicaid beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">1. States Agreeing to Pay a Share</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Twenty-three of the states involved in the current litigation have taken advantage of this flexibility and have, like the federal government, agreed to pay a share of the settling plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. While many of these states have done so in response to state laws that explicitly provide for fee-sharing, <em>see, e.g., </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 71-5-117h, others of them have no such laws. <em>See, e.g., </em>Minn.Stat. \u00a7 256B.042(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Fifteen of the twenty-three states \u2014 Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia \u2014 are paying a proportionate share of the fees and costs. Because the Medicaid global model contains an offset to take account of the states\u2019 responsibility to pay a proportionate share of the expenses involved in procuring the settlement, <em>see In re Zy-prexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-MD-1596, 2006 WL 2443217, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2006), the eleven states that have agreed to the global method of resolving their liens have agreed to pay a proportionate share of the settling plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. These states are Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Utah. <em>See </em>part V.A, <em>supra. </em>Four of the states that agreed to a traditional-holdback resolution of their liens \u2014 Alaska, Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia \u2014 have also agreed to pay a proportionate share of the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Eight of the states that agreed to a traditional-holdback resolution of their liens are paying a limited percentage of the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with state laws or regulations capping the amount of fees to be paid by the state in Medicaid recoveries. <em>See, e.g. </em>Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.Code \u00a7 14124.72(d); Ind.Code \u00a7 12-15-8-8; Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 39-719a(b); Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 354.2332; Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 42-4-201. Kansas and Wyoming are paying fees and costs of 33.3% of each lien recovery; California, Florida, Michigan, South Dakota, and Texas are paying fees and costs of 25%; and Indiana is paying fees and costs of 10%.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">2. States Not Agreeing to Pay a Share</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">A total of twenty-seven states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have not agreed to pay a share of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Fourteen states \u2014 Arkansas, Connecticut, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin\u2014 and the District of Columbia have explicitly objected to any form of fee-sharing. Thirteen states \u2014 Delaware, Georgia, Ha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>waii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Vermont \u2014 and Puer-to Rico have not contacted either the PSC or the court to state a position regarding feesharing.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Of the objecting states, Arkansas, Connecticut, Louisiana, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia, and Wisconsin base their opposition on state laws that they maintain bar pro rata sharing of attorneys\u2019 fees in lien recoveries. <em>See </em>Consolidated Br. of the Participating States on the Issue of Attorneys\u2019 Fees (\u201cConsol. Fees Br.\u201d) at 6-9; Supplemental Br. of the State of Connecticut (\u201cBr. of Conn.\u201d) at 1-4; Br. of North Carolina at 2-3; letter from the State of New York Dep\u2019t of Health dated Sept. 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Although the District of Columbia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, and South Carolina all have laws that explicitly provide for fee sharing at the discretion of either the state Medicaid agency (Kentucky, Nevada, and South Carolina), the Mayor (the District of Columbia), or the court (Mississippi), these jurisdictions all argue that this discretion should not be employed in the present case. <em>See </em>Consol. Fees Br. at 8-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">3. All States Must Pay a Share</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">This is a nationwide multidistrict litigation in a federal court; the partial settlement at issue involves over 8,000 individual plaintiffs from every state of the union, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The case involves important questions of the nationwide marketing of drugs and of national regulation of drugs by the federal Food and Drug Administration. It also affects administration of the federal Medicare and federal-state Medicaid programs. Recognizing its obligation to exercise careful oversight of this national \u201cquasi-class action,\u201d the court has already utilized its equitable power to limit attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, <em>see In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig, </em>424 F.Supp.2d 488 (E.D.N.Y.2006) (limiting fees); <em>In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>No. 04-MD-1596, 2006 WL 2443248 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2006) (limiting costs), and to ensure that filing delays on the part of some settling plaintiffs did not prevent the start of payments to others. <em>See In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig, </em>433 F.Supp.2d 268 (E.D.N.Y.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">The court notes that federal courts have generally applied state laws regarding the validity and extent of state liens. <em>See, e.g., Caldwell v. TACC Corp., </em>423 F.3d 784 (8th Cir.2005) (state law applied to workers\u2019 compensation carrier\u2019s lien); <em>Copeland v. Toyota Motor Sales, </em>136 F.3d 1249 (10th Cir.1998) (under Kansas law governing Medicaid liens, state agency was only required to pay 33.3% attorneys\u2019 fees, not 40%, because trial was not convened); <em>Powell, Inc. v. Abney, </em>669 F.2d 348 (5th Cir.1982) (state law applied to private lien arising from litigation); <em>Bryan Memorial Hosp. v. Allied Property and Casualty Ins. Co., </em>163 F.Supp.2d 1059 (D.Neb.2001) (state law applied to hospital\u2019s lien). None of these cases implicated critical national interests of the kind involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">In a situation such as the present one, the court has an obligation to ensure that both the states and the plaintiffs are treated equitably with respect to payment of the costs of a litigation from which they all benefit. A federal court cannot allow variations in state law to interfere with the fair and efficient administration of a federally-controlled national litigation. <em>Cf. In re Johns-Manville Corp., </em>27 F.3d 48 (2d Cir.1994) (district court authority under All-Writs Act to issue order staying litigation against personal injury settlement trust and payments from the trust while litigation surrounding the trust was pending); <em>In re Agent Orange Prods. Liab. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>Litig., </em>996 F.2d 1425, 1431-32 (2d Cir.1993) (district court authority under All-Writs Act to remove otherwise unremova-ble state case in order to \u201ceffectuate and prevent the frustration of orders it has previously issued in its exercise of jurisdiction otherwise obtained\u201d); <em>In re Baldwin-United Corp., </em>770 F.2d 328, 335 (2d Cir.1985) (district court authority under All-Writs Act to enjoin states from bringing actions which would affect the rights of any plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Whether the issue of the attorneys\u2019 fees to be paid by a Medicaid agency in a federal litigation is procedural (in which case federal law would apply) or substantive (in which case state laws might arguably apply to the state-funded portion of the Medicaid program), the equities require a solution that is nationwide in scope and fair to each litigant and state. <em>Cf. Grievance Comm. v. Simels, </em>48 F.3d 640, 645-46 (2d Cir.1995) (because of the need to avoid \u201cbalkanization,\u201d a federal court is not bound by state interpretations of rules regarding the ethical conduct of attorneys); <em>County of Suffolk v. Long Island Lighting Co., </em>710 F.Supp. 1407, 1414-15 (E.D.N.Y.1989) (application of state rules regarding the ethical conduct of attorneys overridden by the requirements of a federal class action litigation). <em>See also </em>L. Elizabeth Chamblee, <em>Unsettling Efficiency: When Nortr-Class Aggregation of Mass Torts Creates SecondClass Settlements, </em>65 La. L.Rev. 157, 241 (2004) (in a multidistrict litigation as in a class action, the primary goal of the court is to \u201censure that similarly situated individuals receive equal fairness protections\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In deference to state sovereignty, a federal court may- accept limited variations arising from the application of state laws and regulations that, while explicitly providing for fee-sharing, limit the amount to be contributed by the state Medicaid agency. It is recognized that the states may have diverse reasons for controlling legal fees. Because the states who have limited the amount of their fee-sharing have balanced their own fiscal needs with the recognized needs of Medicaid beneficiaries and have voluntarily accepted their responsibility to share in the costs of a recovery from which they benefit, the court should attempt to give effect to the different feesharing arrangements resulting from their differing state policies. It would, however, be entirely inappropriate in a national settlement of this sort to allow some of the states to completely ignore their responsibility to pay a reasonable share of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs \u2014 a responsibility that other states and the federal government have properly assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The settling plaintiffs in this case are paying attorneys\u2019 fees of up to 35% of their recoveries, along with up to 1% in costs. They have expended time and effort in working with their attorneys to file necessary medical documentation and otherwise prosecute their claims. The work of these plaintiffs and their attorneys has benefited both the plaintiffs and the states. The states would likely have recovered nothing in the absence of this hard-fought litigation. They cannot be permitted \u201cto enjoy the fruits ... without contributing in any way to the costs or burdens of litigating that claim.\u201d <em>Hedgebeth v. Medford, </em>74 N.J. 360, 378 A.2d 226, 230 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">All of the state Medicaid agencies involved in the lien settlement shall pay a share of the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs involved in procuring this settlement, calculated in accordance with the court\u2019s orders of March 28, 2006 and August 24, 2006. <em>See In re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>424 F.Supp.2d 488 (E.D.N.Y.2006) (fees capped at 20% in \u201cTrack A\u201d cases and 35% in all other eases); <em>In re Zyprexa Prods.

As noted above, these states are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Those states that have not already made arrangements with the PSC to pay a share of the fees and costs shall pay a share of the fees and costs for all plaintiffs from whom they recover Medicaid reimbursements. This share shall be proportionate to the state\u2019s share of the gross recovery compared to the plaintiffs share. Fees and costs in their proportionate amounts shall be deducted from the lien withholding amounts of these states by Garretson.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">B. Non-Inclusion of the Cost of Zy-prexa in the Lien Amounts</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Arkansas, Florida, Ohio, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia have submitted a consolidated brief requesting that they, as subrogees of the Medicaid-beneficiary plaintiffs, \u201cbe permitted to \u2018stand in the shoes\u2019 \u201d of those plaintiffs in order to \u201crecover the taxpayer dollars expended on the cost of the drug Zyprexa.\u201d Consolidated Br. of the States Regarding Inclusion of the Cost of Zyprexa (\u201cConsol. Zyprexa Br.\u201d) at 1. This request is denied. The plaintiffs\u2019 recovery includes no reimbursement for the cost of Zyprexa. The settlement amounts compensate the plaintiffs only for treatment costs, pain and suffering, and other non-medical damages connected to personal injuries they allege were <em>caused by ingestion of Zyprexa. </em>Insofar as some of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints contained allegations of fraud, negligent misrepresentation and failure to warn that could possibly have supported recovery of the cost of the drug, these claims are now dismissed. The settlement masters did not include them in its allocation of damages to each settling plaintiff. <em>See </em>letter of September 11, 2006 from special master Kenneth R. Feinberg to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">The states and Lilly point to a provision in the master settlement agreement requiring the settling plaintiffs to satisfy all valid liens on their recoveries and to indemnify Lilly against third party payor claims related to their use of Zyprexa, including claims for the cost of Zyprexa. <em>See </em>Consol. Zyprexa Br. at 4-6; Response of Eli Lilly &amp; Co. to Certain States\u2019 Request for Reimbursement of the Cost of Zyprexa (\u201cDef.\u2019s Response\u201d) at 3-4. As Lilly acknowledges, this provision does not establish the validity of any particular third party claim. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Response at 5. Rather, it establishes the responsibilities of the settling plaintiffs vis-a-vis Lilly: the plaintiffs, not Lilly, are responsible for satisfying all <em>valid </em>liens on their recoveries\u2014 the court has found that the states do not have a valid lien for the cost of Zyprexa\u2014 and, if a third party payor brings suit against Lilly for damages related to the settling plaintiffs\u2019 use of Zyprexa, the plaintiffs will be required to reimburse Lilly for any recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Theoretically, the states could sue Lilly for payments for Zyprexa made by their Medicaid programs. Since they are not parties to this action, the states are not bound by the court\u2019s dismissal of the individual plaintiffs\u2019 claims for the cost of Zy-prexa, nor by the master settlement agreement. Theoretically, Lilly could lose that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>suit and be held responsible for all or a portion of the expenditures the states made in purchasing the drug. Were these remote possibilities to come to fruition, Lilly could, under a plausible interpretation of the indemnity provision of the master settlement agreement, seek to recover from the settling plaintiffs the portion of a judgment for the cost of the drug attributable to Medicaid\u2019s expenditures for Zy-prexa on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The possibility of these theoretical conditions coming to fruition is slight to the vanishing point. There is ample money left in the general escrow account being supervised by the court to cover this contingency. The special masters, with the aid of the parties and the states, if they wish to participate, are directed to estimate how much needs to be set aside for such claims. That amount will be set aside and held for a period of five years. This is a method utilized in the <em>Agent Orange </em>litigation to solve a somewhat similar problem of possible liability to the settling defendants in future actions. <em>See </em>Peter S. Schuck, Agent Orange on Trial 165, items (4) &amp; (11) (1986) (money set aside for reimbursement of settling defendants in case of a subsequent state suit; this money was later remitted to the fund on consent of all parties and used to aid spouses and children of veterans).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">IX.
