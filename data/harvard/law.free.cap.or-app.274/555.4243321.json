Claimant seeks judicial review of three final orders of the Employment Appeals Board (EAB) that denied his claims for benefits on the ground that he \u201cwas not actively seeking suitable work\u201d at pertinent times. On review, claimant argues that he met the ORS 657.155(l)(c) requirement to be \u201cactively seeking * * * work,\u201d as that requirement is further explained in OAR 471-030-0036(5). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the arguments that claimant makes on review do not establish that the EAB erred. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Under ORS 183.482(8), our review of the EAB\u2019s final orders proceeds as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u201cWe review the EAB\u2019s order for substantial evidence and errors of law, and to determine whether its analysis comports with substantial reason. Substantial evidence supports a factual finding when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding. An order comports with substantial reason when it articulates a rational connection between the facts of the case and the legal conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\"><em>Campbell v. Employment Dept. </em>256 Or App 682, 683, 303 P3d 957 (2013) (citations, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted). Claimant does not challenge the factual findings that the EAB adopted in its final orders, and we describe the facts in accordance with those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Claimant, who had lost his job as a paramedic, filed his initial claim for unemployment insurance benefits on February 3, 2014, and apparently obtained benefits for some periods of time that are not at issue here. Claimant subsequently sought benefits for three periods of time during which he had part-time employment with Seven Brides Brewing in 2014: April 27 through May 3, May 11 through May 17, and May 18 through June 7. He appears to have initially been deemed eligible for benefits during those periods. However, in June 2014, the Employment Department issued administrative decisions cancelling its prior payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>determinations for those three periods based on a determination that claimant had not actively sought work during the weeks at issue. Accordingly, the department denied benefits for each of the pertinent three time periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Claimant timely requested a hearing, which took place in August 2014. Based on testimony at that hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) issued decisions in which he found that claimant \u201cwas working part-time for Seven Brides Brewing\u201d during each of the three periods at issue and that claimant had \u201canticipated that he would be employed full-time\u201d with that employer. Moreover, the ALJ found that claimant had sought work only with Seven Brides Brewing and not with any other employers during those periods of part-time employment. The ALJ also found that, during the last pertinent time period (May 18 through June 7), claimant had started to look at websites, including Craigslist, for potential job openings.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Based on those findings, the ALJ concluded as a legal matter that claimant \u201cwas not actively seeking suitable work\u201d during each of the three pertinent periods. For each of those periods, the ALJ reasoned that claimant\u2019s \u201cwork search activity was insufficient\u201d because claimant had not made \u201cany potential employer contacts other than his part-time employer.\u201d The ALJ asserted that an \u201cordinary and reasonable person would have made additional contacts in order to return to full-time work at the earliest opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Claimant timely sought review before the EAB. The EAB issued orders stating that it had conducted <em>de novo </em>review on the hearing record developed before the ALJ and, pursuant to ORS 657.275(2), was adopting the ALJ\u2019s decisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">On judicial review of the EAB orders, claimant contends that he did actively seek work during the weeks at issue. Claimant bases that argument on his understanding of OAR 471-030-0036(5) (Feb 23, 2014). The current version of that rule provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\u201c(a) For purposes of ORS 657.155(l)(c) an individual is actively seeking work when doing what an ordinary and reasonable person would do to return to work at the earliest opportunity. Unless otherwise directed by the director or an authorized representative of the employment department, an individual who is not on temporary layoff as described in subsection (b), is not a union member as described in subsection (d), nor is filing a continued claim for the first week of an initial or additional claim as described in subsection (e), shall be required to conduct <em>at least five work seeking activities per week, with at least two of those being direct contact with an employer who might hire the individual.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-3\">\u201c(A) Work seeking activities include but are not limited to registering for job placement services with the Employment Department, attending job placement meetings sponsored by the Employment Department, participating in a job club or networking group dedicated to job placement, updating a resume, reviewing the newspaper or job placement web sites without responding to a posted job opening, and making direct contact with an employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">\u201c(B) Direct contact with an employer means making contact with an employer in person, by phone, mail, or electronically to inquire about a job opening or applying for job openings in the manner required by the hiring employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u00abH* ^ H? Hs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201c(e) For an individual who is filing a continued claim for the first week of an initial or additional claim:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">\u201c(A) If the individual worked less than full time and remuneration paid or payable to the individual for services performed during the week is less than the individual\u2019s weekly benefit amount, <em>each day the individual worked for the employer shall be considered a direct employer contact\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Claimant focuses his argument on the parts of the current rule that are emphasized in the quotation above, asserting that he fulfilled the rule\u2019s employer-contact requirements through his contacts with his part-time employer, Seven Brides Brewing. That is, claimant contends that he made at least the required \u201ctwo * * * direct contact [s] with an employer who might hire [him],\u201d OAR 471-030-0036(5)(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>by having multiple contacts with Seven Brides Brewing during each week that he had part-time employment there. <em>See </em>OAR 471-030-0036(5)(e)(A) (providing that, in certain circumstances, a part-time employee engages in a \u201cdirect employer contact\u201d on each day that the employee works for his or her employer).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The difficulty with claimant\u2019s argument is that it is explicitly based on the current version of OAR 471-030-0036(5), which is not the version of the rule that the ALJ applied when analyzing claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits. As noted, claimant filed his initial claim for benefits on February 3, 2014. At that time, a previous version of OAR 471-030-0036(5) (Jan 8, 2006) was in effect. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">\u201cFor purposes of ORS 657.155(l)(c) an individual is actively seeking work when doing what an ordinary and reasonable person would do to return to work at the earliest opportunity. In determining whether an individual is conducting an active search for work, the Employment Department may consider among other factors, length of employment, economic conditions in the individual\u2019s labor market and prospective job openings, weather conditions affecting occupations or industries, seasonal aspects of the individual\u2019s regular occupation, expected date of return to work with regular employer or in regular occupation, seniority status of individual, registration with a union hiring hall and normal practices for obtaining the type of work which the individual is seeking * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">We refer to that version of OAR 471-030-0036(5)(a) as \u201cthe 2006 rule\u201d in the remainder of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The 2006 rule and the current version of the rule are alike in one respect: both provide that \u201can individual is actively seeking work when doing what an ordinary and reasonable person would do to return to work at the earliest opportunity.\u201d The current rule follows that general statement with the more specific explanation \u2014 on which claimant bases his argument to this court \u2014 that (with certain exceptions) an individual must \u201cconduct at least five work seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>activities each week, with at least two of those being direct contact with an employer who might hire the individual.\u201d OAR 471-030-0036(5). But the 2006 rule did not include that quantitative description of what the department views as adequate work-seeking activities. Nor did it include the provision, currently found in OAR 471-030-0036(5)(e)(A), stating that, in some circumstances, a part-time employee\u2019s contacts with his or her current employer count as \u201cdirect employer contact [s].\u201d Instead, as quoted above, the 2006 rule more generally described various factors that the department could consider in determining whether a person had done \u201cwhat an ordinary and reasonable person would do to return to work at the earliest opportunity,\u201d including such things as \u201clength of unemployment, economic conditions * * *, seniority status * * *, normal practices for obtaining the type of work which the individual is seeking,\u201d and so on. OAR 471-030-0036(5)(a) (Jan 8, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Because the ALJ applied the 2006 rule in analyzing claimant\u2019s eligibility for benefits, he considered only whether, given the facts found, claimant had done \u201cwhat an ordinary and reasonable person\u201d would have done to gain full-time employment. The ALJ did not also analyze quantitatively whether claimant had \u201cconduct [ed] at least five work seeking activities per week, with at least two of those being direct contact with an employer who might hire [him],\u201d as the current version of OAR 471-030-0036(5)(a) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The ALJ\u2019s reliance on the 2006 rule may be based on OAR 471-010-0015(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201c(1) Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter, the rules in effect at the time an individual files a claim for benefits shall be applied to issues associated with that claim for benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">\u201c(2) For purposes of this rule, a \u2018claim for benefits\u2019 includes an initial, additional or continued claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Under that rule, it appears likely that the ALJ acted correctly in applying the 2006 rule to claimant\u2019s claim for benefits, as claimant filed his initial claim while the 2006 rule was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Significantly, claimant does not argue on review that the ALJ and, thus, the EAB, erred by relying on the 2006 rule instead of on the current version of OAR 471-030-0036(5). Rather, claimant\u2019s argument is based entirely on an unexplained assumption that the current version of the rule applies. Nor has claimant presented a cogent explanation, based on the 2006 rule, of why the ALJ could not properly conclude on this record that claimant had not engaged in the sort of work-seeking activities that \u201can ordinary and reasonable person\u201d would have undertaken in claimant\u2019s circumstances, including making some contacts with employers other than Seven Brides Brewing.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Claimant\u2019s reliance on the current version of OAR 471-030-0036(5) may be understandable, given that certain parts of the record could be understood to suggest that department personnel believed that the current version of the rule \u2014 including its requirement of \u201cfive work seeking activities per week, with at least two of these being direct contact with an employer\u201d \u2014 governed claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits. For example, the initial administrative decisions in the record state that claimant \u201cwas advised * * * that an adequate work search consisted of two employer contacts and three work seeking activities.\u201d Moreover, a department representative testified at the administrative hearing that an adequate work search would have consisted of \u201cfive work seeking activities, but two of those must be [e]mployer contacts.\u201d On the other hand, the notice issued to claimant by the Office of Administrative Hearings included a copy of the 2006 rule, not the current version of OAR 471-030-0036.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">In the end, however, notwithstanding any confusion over which rule applies, claimant\u2019s arguments on review present no basis for reversal or remand of the final orders, as he has neither challenged the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the 2006 rule nor established that the ALJ\u2019s application of that version of the rule was erroneous. In short, the arguments that claimant has presented on judicial review give us no reason to disturb the EAB\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\"> ORS 657.275(2) provides, among other things, that the EAB \u201cmay enter its own findings and conclusions or may adopt the findings and conclusions of the administrative law judge, or any part thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\"> Claimant makes additional arguments on judicial review that are not sufficiently preserved or developed for our consideration. We reject those arguments without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
