He contends that the court erred by terminating his rights based on extreme conduct because the conduct relied on by the court happened 10 years before the termination trial and did not involve his children. As for termination based on the court\u2019s finding of unfitness, he contends that the court erred in concluding that integration of the children into his home within a reasonable time was improbable. Finally, father asserts that termination is not in the best interests of the children. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.500 (termination of parental rights must be in the best interests of the ward).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">A discussion of the facts would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. On <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 19.415(3)(a), we conclude that the juvenile court properly terminated father\u2019s parental rights for unfitness under ORS 419B.504 and termination is in the best interests of the children. Because we affirm on that basis, we do not consider whether the juvenile court erred by also terminating father\u2019s parental rights because of extreme conduct under ORS 419B.502.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
