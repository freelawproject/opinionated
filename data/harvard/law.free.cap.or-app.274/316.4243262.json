J.</author>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">In this workers\u2019 compensation case, claimant seeks review of an order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (board) that reversed an order of the administrative law judge (ALJ) and upheld SAIF Corporation\u2019s (SAIF) denial of a combined condition claim. In its order, the board concluded that SAIF had established that claimant\u2019s accepted condition was no longer the major contributing cause of his combined condition. As explained below, we reverse and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Claimant had a preexisting injury to his right wrist, arthritis in that wrist, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Then, in May 2012, claimant\u2019s right wrist and thumb were compensably injured in an incident at work. <em>See </em>ORS 656.005(7)(a) (\u201cA \u2018compensable injury\u2019 is an accidental injury * * * arising out of and in the course of employment requiring medical services or resulting in disability or death * * *.\u201d). Based on that incident, claimant made a claim for compensation, and SAIF eventually accepted a claim for \u201ccontusion to the dorsal surface of the right wrist and acute strain of the radial collateral ligament attached to the radial styloid, right wrist.\u201d Claimant also made a claim for compensation based on a combined condition, and, effective May 8, 2012, SAIF accepted a combined condition of \u201cright wrist injury combined with prior right wrist scaphoid non-union fracture and post traumatic arthritis.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) (\u201cIf an otherwise compensable injury combines at any time with a preexisting condition to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the combined condition is compensable only if, so long as and to the extent that the otherwise compensable injury is the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d). However, SAIF concluded that, as of October 16, 2012, the \u201caccepted injury [was] no longer the major contributing cause\u201d of claimant\u2019s disability and, therefore, denied the combined condition claim \u201con and after\u201d that date. <em>See </em>ORS 656.262(6)(c) (\u201cAn insurer\u2019s or self-insured employer\u2019s acceptance of a combined or consequential condition under ORS 656.005(7) *** shall not preclude the insurer or self-insured employer from later denying the combined or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>consequential condition if the otherwise compensable injury ceases to be the major contributing cause of the combined or consequential condition.\u201d); ORS 656.262(7)(b) (\u201cOnce a worker\u2019s claim has been accepted, the insurer or self-insured employer must issue a written denial to the worker when the accepted injury is no longer the major contributing cause of the worker\u2019s combined condition before the claim may be closed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Claimant sought review of SAIF\u2019s decision, and, after a hearing, the AL J concluded that SAIF had \u201cfailed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the compensable injury ceased to be the major contributing cause of claimant\u2019s need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 656.266(2)(a) (\u201cOnce the worker establishes an otherwise compensable injury, the employer shall bear the burden of proof to establish the otherwise compensable injury is not, or is no longer, the major contributing cause of the disability of the combined condition or the major contributing cause of the need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d). Based on that conclusion, the AL J set aside the combined condition denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">SAIF challenged the ALJ\u2019s order, and the board reversed. The board observed that, pursuant to ORS 656.262(6)(c) and (7)(b), after a \u201ccarrier accepts a combined condition, it may deny the combined condition if the otherwise compensable injury ceases to be the major contributing cause of the combined condition.\u201d According to the board, in \u201csuch cases, the issue is whether the accepted condition remains the major contributing cause of the disability or need for treatment of the previously accepted combined condition.\u201d The board noted that, in this case, there was medical evidence that claimant\u2019s medical condition had not significantly changed since the work injury. However, according to the board,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201cthe issue is not whether claimant\u2019s \u2018medical condition\u2019 remains the major contributing cause of his disability and need for treatment or whether he had \u2018significant\u2019 changes in his pathology or symptomatology. Rather, the issue is whether the accepted right wrist contusion and strain remain the major contributing cause of the disability or need for treatment of the combined wrist condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Applying that standard, the board concluded that \u201cthe \u2018otherwise compensable\u2019 right wrist contusion and strain ceased to be the major contributing cause of the disability or need for treatment of the combined condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">On review, claimant asserts that, in light of our decision in <em>Brown v. SAIF, </em>262 Or App 640, 325 P3d 834, <em>rev allowed, </em>356 Or 397 (2014), the board erred when it \u201cconsidered only whether the accepted conditions remained the major contributing cause\u201d of claimant\u2019s combined condition. According to claimant, an \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d is not \u201climited to the accepted conditions for the purposes of determining whether the injury ceased being the major contributing cause under ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) and other applicable statutes.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In <em>Brown, </em>we considered whether, in upholding the denial of a combined condition claim based on proof that the claimant\u2019s accepted condition was no longer the major contributing cause of a combined condition, the board had \u201cimproperly conflated\u201d the statutory terms \u201cotherwise compensable injury\u201d and \u201caccepted condition.\u201d 262 Or App at 646 (internal quotation marks omitted). In evaluating that issue, we observed that \u201cno statutory provision * * * expressly links the compensability of a combined condition to its relationship to an \u2018accepted condition\u2019; rather, the compensability of the combined condition depends on its relationship to the \u2018otherwise compensable injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648. Further, we reasoned that the term \u201ccompensable injury\u201d is \u201cdefined in ORS 656.005 (7)(a) as an \u2018accidental injury\u2019 * * * arising out of and in the course of employment requiring medical services or resulting in disability or death\u201d and that \u201cinjury-incident-based definition\u201d of the term \u201cdoes not make the compensability of an injury dependent on the insurer\u2019s acceptance of particular conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(omission in original). In addition, we noted that the legislative history demonstrated that \u201cthe legislature never meant to equate a \u2018compensable injury\u2019 only with an \u2018accepted condition.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651. We concluded that \u201cthe \u2018otherwise compensable injury\u2019 as used in ORS 656.266(2)(a) and ORS 656.262(6)(c) is, as defined in ORS 656.005(7)(a), the work injury resulting from the work accident that caused the disability or need for treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we held that, in evaluating the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>a combined condition claim in cases such as this one, the \u201cquestion is whether claimant\u2019s work-related injury incident is the major contributing cause of the combined condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656; <em>see also Sather v. SAIF, </em>272 Or App 263, 265, 355 P3d 196 (2015) (\u201c[W]e have held that, in cases such as this one, the board\u2019s task is to determine whether the otherwise compensable injury, as distinguished from the accepted conditions, has ceased to be the major contributing cause of the worker\u2019s disability or need for treatment for an accepted combined condition.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Here, as noted, the board did not apply that standard. Instead, it considered only whether claimant\u2019s accepted conditions remained the major contributing cause of the combined condition. As explained in <em>Brown, </em>that is not the correct legal test. Accordingly, this case must be remanded to the board for it to consider whether \u201cclaimant\u2019s work-related injury incident\u201d \u2014 as distinguished from claimant\u2019s accepted conditions \u2014 continues to be \u201cthe major contributing cause of the combined condition.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>262 Or App at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
