J.</author>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Petitioner seeks review of a Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC or commission) order that upheld an approval by the Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD or department) director of a legislative amendment to the City of Scappoose\u2019s urban growth boundary (UGB). Petitioner contends that certain portions of the LCDC order that overruled her objections to the approval are \u201c[u]nlawful in substance\u201d under ORS 197.651(10)(a). Petitioner argues that, in sustaining the approval, LCDC improperly interpreted and applied statewide planning goals, along with other administrative rules, that require determination of an employment forecast and employment land need as part of the justification of a UGB change to add industrial and commercial land. We conclude that LCDC\u2019s interpretation of the rules is plausible, and that LCDC adequately explained both why the UGB amendment was justifiable under those rules and how it applied its own substantial evidence standard of review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the order under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">I. THE LEGAL CONTEXT</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">This review proceeding arises in the following legal context. Under ORS 197.175(1), cities and counties must exercise their planning and zoning responsibilities in accordance with state land use statutes and special rules (goals) approved by LCDC. Those localities must also \u201c[p]repare, adopt, amend and revise comprehensive plans in compliance with goals approved by [LCDC].\u201d ORS 197.175(2)(a). One of those goals, Goal 14 (Urbanization), requires a city to adopt and maintain an urban growth boundary around its city limits \u201cto provide land for urban development needs and to identify and separate urban and urbanizable land from rural land.\u201d OAR 660-015-0000(14). Establishment and change of a UGB must be based on a number of factors, including a \u201c[d]emonstrated need for *** employment opportunities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under OAR 660-024-0040(5), in turn, the determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>of that need \u201cmust comply with the applicable requirements of Goal 9 and OAR chapter 660, division 9, and must include a determination of the need for a short-term supply of land for employment uses consistent with [OAR] 660-009-0025.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">Goal 9 (Economic Development) directs cities to \u201cprovide adequate opportunities throughout the state for a variety of economic activities.\u201d OAR 660-015-0000(9). It further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">\u201cComprehensive plans for urban areas shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\u201c1. Include an analysis of the community\u2019s economic patterns, potentialities, strengths, and deficiencies as they relate to state and national trends;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201c2. Contain policies concerning the economic development opportunities in the community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\u201c3. Provide for at least an adequate supply of sites of suitable sizes, types, locations, and service levels for a variety of industrial and commercial uses consistent with plan policies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\"><em>\u201c4. </em>Limit uses on or near sites zoned for specific industrial and commercial uses to those which are compatible with proposed uses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-9\"><em>Id.; see also </em>ORS 197.712(2) (codification of Goal 9 requirements for urban comprehensive plans). LCDC, in turn, has adopted rules, found at OAR chapter 660, division 9, to implement Goal 9 and ORS 197.712(2). One of those rules provides guidance on the content of an economic opportunities analysis (EOA). <em>See </em>OAR 660-009-0015.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Thus, in order to justify a UGB expansion to add employment land, a city must demonstrate under Goal 14 that the land is needed for economic opportunities, and, more specifically, must justify that need based on an EOA that is adopted under Goal 9 and its implementing rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Much of the dispute in this case concerns the interpretation and application of the EOA rule, OAR 660-009-0015. Under OAR 660-009-0015, as part of the justification for a comprehensive plan amendment, a city must compare the \u201cdemand for land for industrial and other employment uses to the existing supply of such land\u201d through a \u201creview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>of national, state, regional, county, and local trends,\u201d identification of \u201csite characteristics typical of expected uses[,]\u201d \u201c[[Inventory of [[Industrial and [o]ther [e]mployment lands,\u201d and \u201cassessment of [the] community economic development potential.\u201d A city has some flexibility in the development of an EOA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-4\">\u201cThe effort necessary to comply with OAR 660-009-0015 through 660-009-0030 will vary depending upon the size of the jurisdiction, the detail of previous economic development planning efforts, and the extent of new information on national, state, regional, county, and local economic trends. <em>A jurisdiction\u2019s planning effort is adequate if it uses the best available or readily collectable information to respond to the requirements of this </em>division.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">OAR 660-009-0010(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The issues in this case pertain to whether DLCD and LCDC correctly applied the OAR chapter 660, division 9, rules \u2014 and, in particular, OAR 660-009-0010(5)\u2019s requirement that a city use the \u201cbest available\u201d information in developing an EOA \u2014 as well as related rules implementing Goals 2 and 14 in determining that the city\u2019s comprehensive plan amendments and UGB change were consistent with the statewide planning goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In early 2011, following three years of study and hearings, the city enacted an ordinance to amend its comprehensive plan and zoning code to add (1) a medium-growth population forecast; (2) an EOA; (3) an additional 380 acres of designated industrial and commercial land to the UGB (primarily to accommodate planned industrial growth for airport-related employment in addition to planned commercial growth); (4) a redesignation of some property from industrial to airport employment use; and (5) textual changes to the plan policies on economic growth, public facilities and services, the urban growth boundary, and general land use.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The adopted 2011 EOA was drafted by a private consultant and was based, in part, on information gathered by the consultant at the time of its initial preparation in 2008. That initial information was supplemented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>(1) information obtained by a city advisory committee and the planning commission in 2010 in making their recommendations to the council on the EOA and (2) evidence obtained by the city council during the hearings on the plan amendment ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The EOA report set out the rate of job growth in the city between 2003 and 2007 (prior to the economic recession), assumed a modest decline in employment in the urban area between 2008 and 2010 (during the recession), and then extrapolated from that employment base a robust projection of likely new employment between 2010 and 2030 (the planning period). That projection of future employment was calculated using a high annual growth rate of employment. That growth rate was, in turn, based on the report\u2019s analysis of national, state, regional, and local trends, and an assessment of the economic development potential created by the city\u2019s ability to provide land for businesses that either want to be near the Portland metropolitan area or need to be located near the Scappoose airport. LCDC summarized the city\u2019s conclusions on the need for employment land as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">\u201cThe EOA justifies the potential for strong employment growth in Scappoose over the 20-year planning period as resulting from a number of factors, most notably Scappoose\u2019s locational advantage in relation to Portland and Hillsboro, the presence of the Scappoose Industrial Airpark and related aviation employers, and a documented shortage of certain types of industrial sites within the boundary of Metro. Record at 92-96. The city has identified an employment land need over the planning period, totaling 483 gross acres, based on an analysis of economic opportunities and the site needs of target industries deemed reasonable and appropriate to achieving the city\u2019s economic development objectives, and thus has justified deviating from a straight-line economic forecast based entirely upon historical employment trends. Of the 483 total gross acres, 269 acres is forecast as the industrial land need, 64 acres is forecast for office land need, 40 acres is forecast for retail commercial land need, and 110 acres is forecast for specialized land needs. Record at 98. The specialized land need includes 50 acres for an airport runway expansion, 40 acres of airport hangar space, and 20 acres for a proposed community college site.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>In response to criticism by petitioner and others of some of the factual assumptions in the EOA, the city council approved changes to the report and adopted supplemental findings as part of the UGB amendment ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The UGB amendment ordinance, including the adopted EOA, was submitted by the city to DLCD for approval.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner and others filed written objections with the department. Using the processes set out in ORS 197.633(4) and OAR 660-025-0150, the DLCD director denied the objections and approved the UGB amendment ordinance. Petitioner appealed that approval to LCDC, identifying a number of asserted errors in the decision. LCDC affirmed the director\u2019s decision, entered findings on petitioner\u2019s claims of error, and approved the ordinance. Petitioner now seeks judicial review of LCDC\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We begin by noting one of the difficulties in evaluating petitioner\u2019s contentions on review: Petitioner\u2019s assertions are not framed consistently with our standards of review for an LCDC order on a UGB change. A final LCDC order approving a UGB amendment \u201cmay be appealed to the Court of Appeals in the manner described in ORS 197.650 and 197.651.\u201d ORS 197.626(2). However, ORS 197.651(9)(b) provides that the court \u201c[m]ay not substitute its judgment for that of [LCDC] as to an issue of fact.\u201d Indeed, pursuant to ORS 197.651(10), the court must reverse or remand the order only if the court finds it to be \u201c[u]nlawful in substance or procedure,\u201d \u201c[u]nconstitutional,\u201d or \u201c[n]ot supported by substantial evidence in the whole record as to facts found by the commission.\u201d As we noted in <em>Barkers Five, LLC v. LCDC, </em>261 Or App 259, 285 n 18, 323 P3d 368 (2014), the standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>of review of LCDC orders in ORS 197.651(10) is \u201csubstantively akin to our standard of review of Land Use Board of Appeals orders. <em>Compare </em>ORS 197.651(10) (standard for reviewing LCDC orders), <em>with </em>ORS 197.850(9) (standard for reviewing LUBA orders).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The \u201cunlawful in substance\u201d review standard for LUBA orders under ORS 197.850(9)(a) \u2014 and, by analogy, for review of LCDC orders under ORS 197.651(10) \u2014 is for \u201ca mistaken interpretation of the applicable law.\u201d <em>Mountain West Investment Corp. v. City of Silverton, </em>175 Or App 556, 559, 30 P3d 420 (2001). In <em>Dimone v. City of Hillsboro, </em>182 Or App 1, 6 n 5, 47 P3d 529 (2002), we explained that the \u201cunlawful in substance\u201d standard \u201cis the functional equivalent of the \u2018erroneously interpreted a provision of law\u2019 standard in ORS 183.482(8)(a) that is applicable to our review of an order in a contested case issued by a state administrative agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">We give deference, however, to LCDC\u2019s interpretation and application of its own rules. As set forth in <em>Barker\u2019s Five:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\u201cWe will defer to LCDC\u2019s \u2018plausible interpretation of its own rule[s], including an interpretation made in the course of applying the rule, if that interpretation is not inconsistent with the wording of the rule, its context, or any other source of law.\u2019 <em>DeLeon, Inc. v. DHS, </em>220 Or App 542, 548, 188 P3d 354 (2008) (citing <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com. v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>320 Or 132, 881 P2d 119 (1994)); <em>see also 1000 Friends of Oregon v. LCDC (Lane Co.), </em>305 Or 384, 390, 752 P2d 271 (1988) (explaining that the legislature\u2019s entrustment of an agency \u2018both with setting standards and with applying them can imply that the agency\u2019s view of its standards (assuming that they are within their authorizing law and consistently applied) is to be given some appropriate respect by the courts\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">261 Or App at 302-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Finally, \u201cthe focus of our review is on the issues presented on appeal that have been preserved before LCDC.\u201d <em>1000 Friends of Oregon v. LCDC, </em>244 Or App 239, 268, 259 P3d 1021 (2011) <em>(1000 Friends of Oregon (McMinnville)). </em>Petitioner\u2019s claim that the LCDC order is \u201cunlawful in substance\u201d is limited to evaluating the legal correctness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>LCDC\u2019s resolution of her objections to the DLCD director\u2019s approval of the ordinance. We turn, then, to that evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">IV. LEGAL SUFFICIENCY OF THE LCDC ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">As noted, OAR 660-009-0015 requires cities and counties to adopt an EOA in their comprehensive plans to \u201ccompare the demand for land for industrial and other employment uses to the existing supply of such land,\u201d and to do that comparison through an evaluation of \u201cnational, state, regional, county and local trends,\u201d identification of \u201csite characteristics typical of expected uses[,]\u201d \u201c [i] nventory of [industrial and [o]ther [e]mployment lands,\u201d and \u201cassessment of community economic development potential.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>In her first assignment of error, petitioner asserts that LCDC erred in approving the city\u2019s determinations in the EOA regarding future employment growth and the resulting need for additional land for employment uses. Petitioner contends that LCDC\u2019s approval order \u201cviolates OAR 660-009-0010(5)\u201d (\u201cA jurisdiction\u2019s planning effort is adequate if it uses the best available or readily collectable information to respond to the requirements of this division.\u201d) and Goal 2 (requiring \u201can adequate factual base\u201d for land use decisions), and is lacking in substantial evidence (because various city findings are not supported by substantial evidence), more specifically because the order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-3\">(1) Approved the city\u2019s use of stale information in the EOA (city job increases from 2003 to 2007 and assumed decline in employment between 2008 and 2010) to make findings about the city\u2019s 2010 job base (from which it extrapolated job growth through 2030), rather than more complete, current data that was presented at the hearings that showed actual job losses during the 2008 to 2011 recession and that, according to petitioner, more accurately determined the number of jobs in the city in 2010;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\">(2) Approved the EOA employment forecast based on limited \u201cinformation about national, state, regional, county or local trends\u201d under OAR 660-009-0015(1) (extrapolation of the city job growth rate from 2003 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>to 2007), rather than broader, tri-county data on long-term, historic growth rates that are a necessary component of trend analysis under the rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">(3) Improperly concluded that the city\u2019s findings about its share of future, regional employment growth were supported by substantial evidence in the whole record and failed to require that the city coordinate those determinations with other jurisdictions as required by Goal 2; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">(4) Erred in concluding that the city findings that additional land supply would attract job-creating businesses were supported by substantial evidence in the whole record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Some aspects of those contentions can be quickly dispatched in light of our standards of review. As noted, we have a limited standard of review over LCDC\u2019s determinations about the sufficiency of the evidence to support the city\u2019s factual findings in the EOA about future employment growth, share of regional growth, and the effect of providing additional employment land. We do not review the sufficiency of the city record to support its factual findings to see if our conclusions in that regard match those of LCDC. To do so would run afoul of ORS 197.651(9)(b), which provides that the court \u201c[m]ay not substitute its judgment for that of [LCDC] as to an issue of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Instead, as noted, our review under the \u201cunlawful in substance\u201d standard is limited to determining \u201cwhether [LCDC] applied the correct legal test in deciding whether [the city\u2019s] decision is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>1000 Friends of Oregon (McMinnville), </em>244 Or App at 267-68 (internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude that it did. LCDC determined that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">\u201c[o]n review, the commission considers whether the submittal is consistent with the applicable goals and administrative rules and is supported by substantial evidence. OAR 660-025-0160(2)(a) and (c). *** The Goal 2 requirement for an adequate factual base requires that a legislative land use decision be supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>reasonable person to make that finding. Where the evidence in the record is conflicting, if a reasonable person could reach the decision the city and county made in view of all the evidence in the record, the choice between conflicting evidence belongs to the local government. *** Where substantial evidence in the record supports the city and county\u2019s adopted findings concerning compliance with the Goals and the commission\u2019s administrative rules, the commission nevertheless must determine whether the findings lead to a correct conclusion under the Goals and rules.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">(Citations omitted.) Therefore, to the extent petitioner asks us, in her first assignment of error, to reexamine LCDC\u2019s assessment of the substantiality of the evidence to support the city\u2019s findings in its EOA, she ignores the applicable standards of review. The commission properly stated and applied the substantial evidence rule and, accordingly, its order was not \u201cunlawful in substance\u201d in that regard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>turn, then, to the remaining issues raised by petitioner\u2019s challenges to LCDC\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">1. <em>Whether LCDC erred under OAR 660-009-0010(5) and Goal 2 in approving the use of stale data by the city to compute the baseline employment for 2010 in the EOA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">So framed, this contention pertains to LCDC\u2019s resolution of petitioner\u2019s first objection to the director\u2019s approval. Before the director, petitioner complained about the city\u2019s use of 2003 to 2007 employment data, and an assumed moderate loss of jobs during the 2008 to 2010 recessionary period, to arrive at the number of jobs in the city in 2010. (The city applied an annual employment growth rate to that baseline employment level to arrive at the number of jobs and employment land needs in 2030, the end of the planning period.) Petitioner complained that other data submitted into the record showed the actual job losses in 2008 to 2010 as slightly more than assumed by the city in making the baseline employment projection for 2010 in the EOA. Petitioner argued that the city\u2019s failure to consider all of that evidence in the record meant that the EOA was not based on the \u201cbest available or readily collectable information\u201d under OAR 660-009-0010(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The director concluded that the city did not need to analyze the new information in its adopted EOA, and could consider, as part of the adopted EOA, just the information available when the EOA was drafted: \u201cA city is not required to restart its analysis each time new information becomes available. * * * The city made reasonable conclusions based on data that was available at the time the study took place.\u201d Petitioner objected to those conclusions before LCDC, reasoning that they were (1) incorrect because the EOA was amended as a result of new evidence submitted in the public hearings by the project\u2019s consultant but not as a result of additional evidence submitted by opponents and (2) wrong because a local government is obliged to consider all of the evidence in the record in making its findings and conclusions to support a UGB change.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">LCDC partially agreed with petitioner. The commission interpreted OAR 660-009-0010(5) to allow an EOA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>to be based on information available or collectable at the time of the preparation of the analysis, and concluded that newer information would not \u201crequire the city to undertake multiple, shifting iterations of the same analysis as it moves through the planning and adoption process.\u201d More to the point, however, LCDC determined that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">\u201c[a]ssuming for the purposes of discussion that OAR 660-009-0010(5) or Goal 2 required the city to consider new employment data throughout the planning process, the standard would be whether the city reasonably relied on the employment data information in the record that formed the basis of its EOA, when viewing the record as a whole, including the new employment data that appellants cite. So long as the new employment data does not make it unreasonable for the city to rely on the employment data that it did, the choice between conflicting evidence is the city\u2019s. The appellants have not established and the commission does not find that a reasonable person could not have relied on the employment data the city used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201c* * * The Scappoose EOA updated the base employment data by evaluating economic trends up to 2010 and current knowledge about economic activity in Scappoose during that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">\u201c*** The city did not ignore the testimony regarding new data, as is alleged. The council responded to the testimony in its deliberations, explaining why it did not choose to alter the base year for the assumptions within the EOA. * * * In addition, the consultant that prepared the EOA for the city responded to testimony regarding this objection to the Columbia County Board of Commissioners as part of its deliberations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">(Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">On review, petitioner argues that LCDC erred in (1) interpreting the \u201cbest available or readily collectable information\u201d in OAR 660-009-0010(5) to mean the information available at the time an EOA is prepared; (2) determining that a reasonable person could rely on hypothetical, rather than actual, employment counts for 2010 in making the findings adopted by the city; and (3) determining that the base employment data had been updated by the city based on 2007 to 2009 countywide economic trends when the basis for that update is not apparent in the EOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>As earlier noted, we defer to LCDC\u2019s interpretation of its own rules if that interpretation is plausible in light of the rule\u2019s text and context and other sources of law. <em>Barker\u2019s Five, </em>261 Or App at 302-03. To reiterate, OAR 660-009-0010(5) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\">\u201c[t]he effort necessary to comply with OAR 660-009-0015 through 660-009-0030 will vary depending upon the size of the jurisdiction, the detail of previous economic development planning efforts, and the extent of new information on national, state, regional, county, and local economic trends. A jurisdiction\u2019s planning effort is adequate if it uses the best available or readily collectable information to respond to the requirements of this division.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">OAR 660-009-0015 to 660-009-0030 are a series of rules governing the content and justification for those portions of a comprehensive plan that implement Goal 9, including OAR 660-009-0015, the EOA rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">LCDC\u2019s interpretation of \u201cthe best available or readily collectable information\u201d in OAR 660-009-0010(5) is plausible. As noted, the commission concluded that the database used in connection with preparation of an EOA could be the information available at the time of preparation, so long as that information is not significantly undercut by evidence made part of the EOA adoption record. An EOA is drafted prior to the public hearings on its adoption, typically through a separate community visioning process. <em>See </em>OAR 660-009-0015(5) (\u201cCities and counties are strongly encouraged to assess community economic development potential through a visioning or some other public input based process in conjunction with state agencies.\u201d). Thus, \u201cthe best available or readily collectable information to respond to the requirements of this division\u201d under OAR 660-009-0010(5), for purposes of preparation of an EOA, means the requirement of a prehearing formulation of the analysis in conjunction with that visioning process. LCDC did not err in concluding that the \u201cbest available or readily collectable information\u201d for that requirement means the information available at the time of that formulation and visioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">What is the \u201cbest available\u201d information in the preparation of an EOA is a different question than whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>substantial evidence in the whole record supports particular employment land findings made to justify the UGB change. Petitioner\u2019s objections in that regard amount to assertions that the employment projection findings lack substantial evidence. However, LCDC properly stated the substantial evidence rule in determining those objections. It concluded that the employment projection findings may be based upon the EOA provided that the additional \u201cemployment data does not make it unreasonable for the city to rely on the employment data that it did[.]\u201d Thus, we do not reach petitioner\u2019s objections about LCDC\u2019s application of the substantial evidence rule \u2014 that the information relied upon by the city to make those employment projections was insubstantial either because a reasonable person would not rely upon that information or because the information was not substantiated clearly. As noted earlier, resolution of those objections is not within our scope of review of the commission\u2019s order. <em>See 1000 Friends of Oregon (McMinnville), </em>244 Or App at 267-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">2. <em>Whether LCDC erred in approving the city\u2019s use of employment growth during 2003 to 2007 in Scappoose as a relevant \u201clocal trend\u201d in the preparation of the EOA under OAR 660-009-0015</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Before DLCD, petitioner asserted that the city\u2019s decision was legally defective because the future employment growth rate used by the city in the EOA to calculate the expected number of jobs in 2030 was based, in part, on employment growth in the city from 2003 to 2007. According to petitioner, that period of time was not a \u201cbona-fide long term trend[,]\u201d and, therefore, the EOA was inconsistent with OAR 660-009-0015(1). That rule requires that an EOA be \u201cbased on information about national, state, regional, county or local trends\u201d and with Goal 2\u2019s requirement that land use decisions be based on an \u201cadequate factual base.\u201d The director concluded that the EOA did contain information about trends and that the information was not \u201cdeficient.\u201d The director also noted that the \u201cEOA does not base the employment projection solely on the historic period the objection alleges,\u201d but, instead, based the projected growth rate on other information and trends.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Petitioner disputed that determination before LCDC. She asserted that the other information relied upon by the city was incomplete or undocumented and insufficient to support the growth rate used by the city to calculate future employment. LCDC concluded that the city had, in fact, based its future growth rate on information in addition to the 2003 to 2007 employment growth rate and that all of that evidence was used \u201cto compile an adequate factual basis\u201d for the projected employment land need.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">On review, petitioner contends that LCDC approved an \u201cemployment forecast based on short-term economic \u2018boom\u2019 years growth rates despite longer-term, historical trends and regional forecasts that are much lower [.]\u201d Petitioner also asserts that the EOA did not contain sufficient evidence. We conclude that the LCDC\u2019s explanation of its reasoning was sufficient \u2014 the city did not base its adopted future employment growth rate solely on data from 2003 to 2007, and LCDC did not determine that that information alone was substantial evidence to support the growth rate finding. Moreover, petitioner\u2019s criticism of the quality and sufficiency of the evidence about employment growth rates in the EOA does not demonstrate that LCDC misunderstood its substantial evidence standard of review. Whether the city or LCDC could reach a different conclusion about the future rate of job growth in Scappoose is beside the point in light of our standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">3. <em>Whether LCDC approved a decision based on Scappoose capturing an amount of regional employment growth that is not based on substantial evidence, and instead improperly relied on capturing employment growth planned to occur within other jurisdictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Before the director, petitioner asserted that the part of the EOA that projected that, because of its close location to the Portland metropolitan area and the likelihood of new jobs associated with an expanded Scappoose airport, the city would add new employment was inconsistent with the requirements of OAR 660-009-0010(5), OAR 660-009-0015(1), and Goal 2. Specifically, she contended that that part of the EOA did not comply with the \u201cbest available or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>readily collectible information\u201d requirement of OAR 660-009-0010(5), the requirement in OAR 660-009-0015(1) that a city is \u201cstrongly encouraged [in an EOA] to analyze trends and establish employment projections in a geographic area larger than the planning area,\u201d or Goal 2\u2019s requirements that a comprehensive plan be coordinated and supported by an \u201cadequate factual base.\u201d She also argued that that part of the EOA was not supported by substantial evidence. The director concluded that the city\u2019s employment land need determination was based on an adequate factual base. Petitioner reiterated her objections before LCDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">LCDC determined that the city did, in fact, partially base its employment land needs determination on employment projections from a larger, regional planning area, and that the determination was based on an adequate factual base. In particular, LCDC determined that \u201cthe city provided a rationale for its determination regarding the amount of regional employment growth the city will capture, noting Scappoose\u2019s location adjacent to the Portland Metro area, the lack of industrial lands supply in the Portland Metro area, and the strategic advantage of the Scappoose Airpark\u2019s location adjacent to the city.\u201d LCDC also noted the city\u2019s specific findings with respect to its \u201clocational advantages adjacent to the Portland metropolitan area[,]\u201d past employment growth rates in the city that exceed those within the Portland metropolitan area, a demonstrated shortage of industrial lands in the Portland metropolitan area \u201cleading to increased demand for such sites in neighboring cities such as Scappoose [,]\u201d projections that a significant amount of employment growth associated with the Portland area will occur outside the region\u2019s UGB, and with respect to the relatively small number of projected new jobs for Scappoose compared to the region as a whole. LCDC concluded that \u201csuch information and analysis constitutes substantial evidence to demonstrate why Scappoose would capture employment growth in the Portland region at a rate significantly greater than employment growth proportional to its population.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">On review, petitioner asserts that LCDC erred in determining that the city\u2019s findings on its projected share of regional employment growth were supported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>evidence and that the findings noted by the commission provide a sufficient \u201clegal or factual justification for the City\u2019s chosen forecast.\u201d Petitioner argues that the findings cited by LCDC have less probative value than other evidence in the record and that, even if they show some capture of regional employment growth, they do not justify the extent of the city\u2019s projected share of that growth. As noted, in reviewing UGB amendment approvals by LCDC, we do not reevaluate whether a locality\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. At bottom, petitioner\u2019s contentions about the sufficiency of the evidence to support the city\u2019s forecast of employment growth is nothing more than an argument that a reasonable person could not have made the factual conclusion that the city did about its future share of regional employment growth. Petitioner suggests that the evidence was too weak to overcome the assumption that the share would be in the future what it has been in the past. Petitioner did not explicitly argue below nor does she argue on review that LCDC should have remanded the boundary decision because the city misapplied the law in considering the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Put another way, petitioner does not argue that in deciding \u201cthe percentage of employment growth reasonably expected to be captured for the planning area based on the assessment of community economic development potential\u201d in an EOA under OAR 660-009-0015(1), the city could not consider the facts identified by LCDC as relevant to \u201ccommunity economic development potential.\u201d As we understand it, petitioner\u2019s complaint goes not to the relevance, but to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the city\u2019s findings. That determination is one for the commission, not this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Petitioner also asserts that there is a \u201clack of Goal 2 coordination\u201d in the city\u2019s determination of its share of future regional job growth. Goal 2 requires that \u201c[e]ach plan and related implementation measure shall be coordinated with the plans of affected governmental units.\u201d OAR 660-015-0000(2). \u201cCoordinated\u201d is defined in ORS 197.015(5), which, in turn, provides that \u201c[a] plan is \u2018coordinated\u2019 when the needs of all levels of governments, semipublic and private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>agencies and the citizens of Oregon have been considered and accommodated as much as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">In her objections to the DLCD approval, petitioner does not specifically advance a Goal 2 contention, but does \u201crestate all of [the arguments raised in her objections to the department] in support of this appeal.\u201d In those objections below, petitioner asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">\u201cLUBA has held that if a city located outside the Metro UGB wishes to plan to capture growth currently anticipated to occur within the Metro UGB, then it must specifically coordinate that desire with Metro and the affected units of government within the Metro UGB. <em>1000 Friends of Oregon v. City of North Plains, </em>27 Or LUBA 372 [, <em>aff'd, </em>130 Or App 406, 882 P2d 1130] (1994).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In <em>City of North Plains, </em>LUBA determined that, within Metro\u2019s planning area, when a city expanded its urban growth boundary for employment uses already planned to be accommodated within the Metro UGB, the city must \u201ccoordinate its expanded UGB plan with Metro and other affected units of government or * * * attempt to justify the enlargement of its UGB without relying on growth anticipated to occur within the Metro UGB.\u201d <em>City of North Plains, </em>27 Or LUBA at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Petitioner\u2019s objection to the agency order under Goal 2 is insufficiently developed for review. Petitioner does not explain what plan of a governmental unit is \u201caffected\u201d by the city\u2019s analysis of its share of the employment growth expected to occur outside of the UGB of Portland-area cities, so as to arguably require coordination under Goal 2. The Goal 2 coordination principle articulated by LUBA in the <em>City of North Plains </em>case, even assuming that we would agree with that holding, is inapposite. Here, in the EOA analysis of capturing regional employment growth, the city noted that it could \u201ceasily\u201d capture a small percentage of the employment growth projected by Metro to occur outside its UGB. The city did not seek to capture growth planned to occur within the Metro UGB and associated with the cities within that boundary, as was the case in <em>City of North Plains. </em>Petitioner points to no text in Goal 2, or in rules that implement that or other goals, that require the city to coordinate its EOA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>employment growth projections for areas outside of its UGB with another city\u2019s planned growth located elsewhere and inside of a UGB.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">LCDC concluded that the city had coordinated the UGB amendment with Columbia County under the cooperative process required by Goal 14. OAR 660-015-0000(14) (\u201cEstablishment and change of urban growth boundaries shall be a cooperative process among cities, counties and, where applicable, regional governments.\u201d). Petitioner advances no legal basis for any further coordination requirement. Accordingly, we conclude that LCDC\u2019s determination of Goal 2 compliance was legally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">4. <em>Whether the city assumed the proposed UGB expansion will cause a substantial increase in population growth, beyond historical trends</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Before DLCD, petitioner argued that it was unlawful for the city to base its projected employment growth, in part, on \u201cincreased employment opportunities near the airport as a result of the proposed UGB expansion.\u201d Petitioner claimed that the lack of development of existing industrial parcels near the airport undercut the city\u2019s assumption that an additional supply of vacant parcels would be a catalyst for future development. The director determined that it was lawful to plan for greater employment and employment land need than would be indicated simply by extrapolating from prior employment growth and land development. The city could do so by following the Goal 9 rule, by \u201cidentifying] opportunities, determining] the types and characteristics of sites needed to attract employers, estimating] at least an adequate number of sites, and *** accommodating] the needed number of suitable sites for the 20-year planning period.\u201d Petitioner reiterated her objection before LCDC, suggesting that it was circular reasoning to justify bringing additional employment land into the boundary solely to induce new employment, and that the need determination requires more particular justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>LCDC agreed. It concluded that the city could plan for more employment land than needed based on historic trends, but explained that the additional employment land need must be separately justified under the goals and rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\">\u201cThe city\u2019s <em>intention </em>is to deviate from the historic trend by providing more employment for its citizens, a policy choice that is consistent with Goal 9 and its implementing rules. <em>See </em>Economics Policy 4; Record at 142. As stated in the response to Objections 2 and 3 [involving the application of OAR 660-009-0015, the EOA rule], Scappoose has provided an evidentiary background that supports the feasibility of such a policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">On review, petitioner contends that LCDC did not address her objection that \u201c\u2018increased employment opportunities near the airport as a result of the proposed UGB expansion\u2019 is not a valid reason for concluding that rapid future growth is reasonable or feasible.\u201d We disagree. LCDC plainly concluded that the city could \u2014 and did \u2014 justify adding new industrial land through the process ordained by the Goal 9 rule. As noted, OAR 660-009-0015(1) allows a determination of employment land needs based on locational factors, such as proximity to an expanding regional airport: \u201cA use or category of use could reasonably be expected to expand or locate in the planning area if the area possesses the appropriate locational factors for the use or category of use.\u201d LCDC committed no error in concluding that petitioner\u2019s contention was consistent with applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">5. <em>Whether, by approving a UGB based on an employment forecast that is significantly inconsistent with the adopted population forecast, LCDC\u2019s order violated OAR 660-024-0040(1), OAR 660-024-0040(5), Goal 14, Goal 2 (adequate factual base), and lacked substantial evidence in the whole record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">In her objections to the director, petitioner argued that the EOA violated <em>former </em>OAR 660-024-0040(l).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That rule provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201cThe UGB must be based on the adopted 20-year population forecast for the urban area as described in OAR 660-024-0030, and must provide for needed housing, employment and other urban uses such as public facilities, streets and roads, schools, parks and open space over the 20-year planning period consistent with the land need requirements of Goal 14 and this rule. The 20-year need determinations are estimates which, although based on the best available information and methodologies, should not be held to an unreasonably high level of precision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">OAR 660-024-0040(5) further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cEmployment land need may be based on an estimate of job growth over the planning period; local government must provide a reasonable justification for the job growth estimate but Goal 14 does not require that job growth estimates necessarily be proportional to population growth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Petitioner argued that the 20-year population forecast for the city was a population of 10,022, an increase of 3,342 persons from the 2010 population of 6,680 persons. The EOA, nonetheless, predicted a 2030 job total of 10,492, an increase of 8,067 jobs from the 2010 total of 2,425 jobs. Petitioner claimed that the job-per-resident ratio for 2030 in the EOA was improbably high as compared with the historic ratio in the city and with the current ratio in the Portland metropolitan area, and that the UGB was not \u201cbased on the adopted 20-year population forecast\u201d because that population would not yield the jobs and employment land claimed to be needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The director denied petitioner\u2019s objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u201cThis objection contends the employment forecast in the EOA is inconsistent with the city\u2019s adopted population forecast because the rates of increase are considerably different and the resulting jobs-per-resident ratio is uncommonly high. The objector contends this violates OAR 660-0024-0040(1) and Goal 2. As previously indicated, the city does not use the employment forecast as a sole determinant of need. As made clear in OAR 660-024-0040(5), proportionality is not required. The record includes an explanation of why the two forecasts are not parallel. Record at 359-362. The department finds this analysis adequate in light of not holding the city to an unreasonably high expectation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>regarding precision when the employment forecast wasn\u2019t the sole basis for determining land need.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">(Footnotes omitted.) Petitioner argued to LCDC that \u201cthe justification for the divergence of the employment forecast from the adopted population forecast for Scappoose is very thin and lacks credibility while at the same time the divergence between the employment and jobs forecast is very large, requiring an especially clear and credible explanation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">LCDC concluded that proportionality between population and job growth forecasts is not required by OAR 660-024-0040(5), and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201c[t]he city has documented the reasons why the population and economic forecasts are not parallel. Record at 359-363.<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> In addition to the rationale described in the response to Objections 2 through 4 above [projecting a high employment growth rate for the city because jobs will be filled by persons who reside in the Portland metropolitan area and the city will continue to experience a high employment growth rate based on past history, and that property will develop because of expansion of the Scappoose Airpark and because the Portland metropolitan area lacks comparable industrial land sites], the record demonstrates that employment in the city is tied to the Portland metropolitan region as much as it is to Columbia County, and that the EOA has taken account of the multiplier effect that employment in certain industries has regarding additional employment creation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">In her second assignment of error, petitioner reiterates her argument made to the director and LCDC, contending that the discrepancy between the city\u2019s adopted job-per-resident ratio for 2030 and the historic ratio in the city required a stronger justification than was provided by the city in the EOA. Petitioner does not contend that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>rationale provided by the city, and accepted by LCDC, was legally defective under OAR 660-024-0040(1); that is, she does not assert that, as a matter of law, the city could not project that most of its future residents would be employed locally or that job growth for city residents and nonresidents could not be pegged to uses connected to the airport and related uses. Those considerations are plainly relevant to the projected job growth. We conclude that petitioner is concerned with the persuasiveness of the city\u2019s rationale. That determination is one for the city to make. LCDC correctly concluded that the city\u2019s justification was consistent with the applicable goals and rules.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">V.

We also conclude, applying the rule of deference noted earlier, that LCDC correctly applied the statewide planning goals and its rules implementing those goals to the city\u2019s UGB amendment decision.

Relevant economic advantages and disadvantages to be considered may include but are not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFq\">\u201c(a) Location, size and buying power of markets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWz\">\u201c(b) Availability of transportation facilities for access and freight mobility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aov-\">\u201c(c) Public facilities and public services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au_\">\u201c(d) Labor market factors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-X\">\u201c(e) Access to suppliers and utilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq\">\u201c(f) Necessary support services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuI\">\u201c(g) Limits on development due to federal and state environmental protection laws; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADi2\">\u201c(h) Educational and technical training programs.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b543-4\"> LCDC also correctly framed its standard of review over the reasoning adopted by the city in support of the UGB amendments. It determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201c[t]here is no statute, statewide planning goal or administrative rule that generally requires that legislative land use decisions be supported by findings. <em>Port of St. Helens v. City of Scappoose, </em>58 Or LUBA 122, 132 (2008). However, there are instances where the applicable statutes, rules or ordinances require findings to show compliance with applicable criteria. In addition, where a statute, rule or ordinance requires a local government to consider certain things in making a decision, or to base its decision on an analysis, \u2018there must be enough in the way of findings or accessible material in the record of the legislative act to show that applicable criteria were applied and that required considerations were indeed considered.\u2019 <em>Citizens Against Irresponsible Growth v. Metro, </em>179 Or App 12, 16 n 6, 38 P3d 956 (2002). Such findings serve the additional purpose of assuring that the commission does not substitute its judgment for that of the local government. <em>Id,.; Naumes Properties, LLC v. City of Central Point, </em>46 Or LUBA 304, 314 (2004).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We add that, under ORS 197.633(3)(c), LCDC\u2019s review \u201c[f]or issues concerning compliance with applicable laws, is whether the local government\u2019s decision on the whole complies with applicable statutes, statewide land use planning goals, administrative rules, the comprehensive plan, the regional framework plan, the functional plan and land use regulations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\"> The first assignment of error suffers from another overarching deficiency. ORAP 5.45(3) requires an appellant to \u201cidentify precisely the legal, procedural, factual or other ruling that is being challenged.\u201d The assignment of error broadly claims various errors in LCDC\u2019s approval of portions of the EOA. But it fails to clearly identify and claim error in the particular rulings of the commission that resolved the objections raised by petitioner to the director\u2019s approval as required by <em>1000 Friends of Oregon (McMinnville), </em>244 Or App at 268. We will reframe the assignment of error accordingly and then assess whether the LCDC order was unlawful in substance in that particular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\"> In. fact, the applicable rule suggests that any coordination is not mandatory. OAE 660-009-0030 provides that localities are \u201cstrongly encouraged to coordinate\u201d their economic opportunities analysis with other jurisdictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b553-9\"> OAR 660-024-0040(1) was amended after LCDC issued its order in this ease. We refer to the regulation as it appeared at the time that the action was before LCDC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[8]\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\">8 The record cite refers to a March 1, 2011, letter from the city\u2019s planning consultant to the city. The letter examines the commuting patterns of workers in Scappoose and Columbia County, and concludes that most Scappoose workers commute to jobs outside Columbia County, and that the EOA projects that this will change because of a \u201ctransition of Scappoose from functioning as a bedroom community to a more self-sufficient employment center, providing jobs for local residents and the surrounding area.\u201d The letter also explains how the increased employment projection is largely tied to job increases in aviation manufacturing and the likely multiplier effect of that job increase on related employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\"> As noted, we reject without further discussion petitioner\u2019s substantial evidence challenges to the city\u2019s findings on projected employment in residential areas (third assignment of error), need for additional land for an airport runway and hangar expansion (fourth assignment of error), and the development potential for a parcel not included in the city\u2019s inventory of industrial land (fifth assignment of error).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
