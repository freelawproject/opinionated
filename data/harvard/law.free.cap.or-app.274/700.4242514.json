That statute requires the insurer to pay the claimant\u2019s attorney fees in various circumstances, including, as pertinent here, when the insurer denies a claim for compensation and the claimant\u2019s attorney is instrumental in obtaining rescission of the denial. We conclude that SAIF\u2019s decision to pay for medical services it previously denied constituted a rescission of a denied claim for purposes of ORS 656.386(1), even though SAIF never withdrew the theory on which it based its original denial. SAIF does not dispute the finding that claimant\u2019s attorney was instrumental in obtaining that rescission. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">We summarize the board\u2019s pertinent factual findings, which SAIF does not challenge. Claimant suffered a compensable left knee injury in 2007, which SAIF accepted as a disabling medial meniscus tear. Claimant\u2019s physician, Dr. Hanley, performed the surgery, and SAIF closed the claim. But claimant, who continued to experience symptoms, challenged the closure, and SAIF withdrew the notice of closure pursuant to an order on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">In 2010, Hanley opined that claimant\u2019s meniscus tear had caused a worsening of arthritis in claimant\u2019s left knee. He performed a second surgery and also administered three injections to claimant\u2019s left knee. SAIF again closed the claim and again rescinded its closure when ordered to do so, this time because claimant had become enrolled and was actively engaged in an authorized training program. <em>See </em>ORS 656.268(10) (describing claim processing procedures when worker becomes enrolled in an authorized training program).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">A few months later, Hanley requested authorization to provide an additional series of injections to claimant\u2019s left knee. Oregon Health Systems (OHS), the managed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>health care provider overseeing claimant\u2019s treatment, <em>see </em>ORS 656.260 (describing managed health care providers), declined to authorize the request. It explained that the requested injections were \u201cnot directed towards the accepted condition of: LEFT KNEE MEDIAL MENISCUS TEAR.\u201d Claimant requested administrative review by the Medical Review Unit of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, ORS 656.245(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> SAIF responded with a letter to the Medical Reviewer in which it explained that it denied the payment for the injections because \u201cthe requested injections are not directed to the accepted medial meniscus tear. Rather, *** they are related to degenerative medial compartment changes of an arthritic nature that have not yet been claimed or accepted as a new or omitted medical condition.\u201d The Medical Review Unit referred the matter to the Hearings Division of the board, pursuant to ORS 656.704(3)(b)(C) and (5),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because it determined that the dispute involved a question of medical causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Several months later, Hanley responded to an inquiry from SAIF by expressing his opinion that the injections were intended to treat arthritis in claimant\u2019s left knee and that claimant\u2019s meniscal injury accelerated the arthritis. Claimant then sent SAIF a written request to add the arthritis as an accepted condition. SAIF issued a modified notice of acceptance that included the arthritic condition and then paid for the injections.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Because SAIF had accepted claimant\u2019s arthritic condition and had paid for the requested injections by the time the dispute came up for hearing before the Hearings Division of the board, SAIF argued to the ALJ that the issues presented for hearing were moot. The ALJ apparently rejected SAIF\u2019s mootness argument and found that the proposed injections were causally related to the accepted claim because claimant\u2019s arthritis had become an accepted condition on an accepted claim. The ALJ further concluded that claimant was entitled to insurer-paid attorney fees under ORS 656.386(1) and costs under ORS 656.386(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">On appeal to the board, SAIF no longer argued that the compensation dispute was moot, but asserted that claimant had not prevailed over or obtained a rescission of SAIF\u2019s original denial, as required for an award of fees under ORS 656.386(l)(a). SAIF argued that \u201cthe denial of a relationship between claimant\u2019s medial meniscus tear and the synvisc injections was correct and has never been rescinded.\u201d The board rejected SAIF\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The question presented to the board, and to us on judicial review, is whether ORS 656.386(1) authorizes the award of attorney fees to claimant. That statute provides, as pertinent to the present dispute, that, \u201c[i]n all cases involving denied claims * * * where an attorney is instrumental in obtaining a rescission of the denial prior to a decision by the [ALJ], a reasonable attorney fee shall be allowed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>there is no dispute that SAIF agreed to pay for the disputed injections prior to a decision by the ALJ, or that claimant\u2019s attorney was instrumental in bringing about that change, claimant\u2019s right to recover a reasonable attorney fee for the medical services dispute in this case turns on two elements: (1) whether the case involved a denied claim and (2) whether SAIF\u2019s decision to pay for the disputed medical services amounted to a \u201crescission of the denial.\u201d As it involves a matter of statutory construction, we review the question of claimant\u2019s entitlement to attorney fees under ORS 656.386(1) for legal error. ORS 183.482(8); <em>SAIF v. Wart, </em>192 Or App 505, 507, 87 P3d 1138, <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 248 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">A. <em>Denied Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">On judicial review, SAIF argues that its refusal to pay for the injections did not result in a \u201cdenied claim\u201d for purposes of ORS 656.386(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree. For purposes of an award of fees under ORS 656.386(l)(b)(A), a \u201cdenied claim\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">\u201c[a] claim for compensation which an insurer or self-insured employer refuses to pay on the express ground that the injury or condition for which compensation is claimed is not compensable or otherwise does not give rise to an entitlement to any compensation [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The first element of that definition is met because a claim for medical services is a \u201cclaim for compensation.\u201d ORS 656.005(8) (\u201c\u2018Compensation\u2019 includes all benefits, including medical services, provided for a compensable injury to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>subject worker or the worker\u2019s beneficiaries by an insurer or self-insured employer pursuant to this chapter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">We also conclude that the second element is met\u2014 that SAIF refused to pay for the requested medical services on the \u201cexpress ground\u201d that the \u201ccondition for which compensation is claimed is not compensable or otherwise does not give rise to an entitlement to any compensation.\u201d SAIF expressly denied the claimed compensation \u2014 payment for injections \u2014 on the ground that the injections were treatment for an arthritic condition that had \u201cnot yet been claimed or accepted as a new or omitted medical condition.\u201d That amounts to a denial on the express grounds that claimant sought compensation for a condition that did \u201cnot give rise to an entitlement to any compensation,\u201d within the meaning of ORS 656.386(l)(b)(A), even if SAIF did not expressly deny the arthritic condition. <em>See Wart, </em>192 Or App at 512 (claim denial that recited it was based only on noncooperation and was \u201cnot a denial on the merits\u201d amounted to a denial on the ground that the injury or condition \u201cotherwise does not give rise to an entitlement to any compensation\u201d); <em>cf. Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Cornell, </em>148 Or App 107, 112, 939 P2d 99 (1997) (denial that disputed only the amount that claimant should receive for the expense of traveling to treatment for his injury was not a \u201cdenied claim\u201d within the definition of ORS 656.386(l)(b)(A)). Thus, the case referred to the ALJ for hearing was a case involving a \u201cdenied claim\u201d within the meaning of ORS 656.386(l)(b)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">B. <em>Rescission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">SAIF argues that, even if its refusal to pay for the injections constituted a \u201cdenied claim,\u201d its subsequent decision to pay for the medical service could not be a \u201crescission\u201d of the claim denial unless SAIF also conceded the theory for the denial \u2014 that it did not need to pay for medical services related to a nonaccepted condition. We disagree, because SAIF\u2019s decision to pay for the same requested compensation that it previously denied constitutes a \u201crescission,\u201d regardless of why SAIF made that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">As we have explained, a \u201crescission\u201d for purposes of ORS 656.386(1) \u201cis simply the act of doing away with, taking away, or removing.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Batey, </em>153 Or App 634, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>641, 957 P2d 195, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>155 Or App 21, 963 P2d 732 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 330 (1999). SAIF concedes that the board correctly determined there was \u201cone, and only one, disputed medical service claim\u201d in this case. Indeed, both the record and the board\u2019s findings make clear that the injections for which SAIF ultimately agreed to pay are the same injections that were the object of Hanley\u2019s initial request for payment. That claim for medical services is the claim for compensation that SAIF initially denied and then later paid. As SAIF\u2019s explanation for denying those services made clear, there was no claim for a new or omitted condition and no denial of any claim beyond the claimed medical services. Thus, when SAIF agreed to pay for the previously requested and denied services, it rescinded its denial of that compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\">Nevertheless, SAIF insists that its agreement to pay for the claimed medical services is not a \u201crescission\u201d because it followed a change in circumstances \u2014 claimant\u2019s request to accept arthritis as an additional condition\u2014 and because SAIF never conceded error in the theory for its denial \u2014 that the injections were compensable only if addressed to an accepted condition. A \u201crescission\u201d for purposes of ORS 656.386(1) does not require the insurer to concede its theory for the denial or change its mind without any action on the claimant\u2019s part, as the larger context of ORS 656.386(1) makes clear. The statute provides for an award of fees in \u201call cases involving denied claims\u201d if the claimant prevails in a decision by an ALJ; prevails in a review by the board; prevails \u201cin an appeal to the Court of Appeals or petition for review to the Supreme Court [;]\u201d or obtains a \u201crescission\u201d in the predecision stage. The \u201crescission\u201d portion of ORS 656.386(1), at issue here, was added to the statute following this court\u2019s decision in <em>Jones v. OSCI, </em>107 Or App 78, 810 P2d 1318 <em>(Jones I), withdrawn on recons, </em>108 Or App 230, 814 P2d 558 (1991) <em>(Jones II), </em>in which we held that the then-existing version of ORS 656.386(1) provided no basis for an award of fees if the claimant prevailed prior to a decision at the hearing level. <em>Jones II, </em>108 Or App at 232 (explaining procedural chronology of amendment and reason for withdrawal of original decision). It addressed a gap in the otherwise comprehensive grant of attorney fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>to claimants who prevail in \u201ccases involving denied claims\u201d and must be understood in that broader context.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\">At the other stages for which ORS 656.386(1) authorizes fees, the question is simply <em>whether </em>the claimant prevailed over a refusal to pay requested compensation, not <em>why </em>the claimant prevailed. <em>Stephenson v. Meyer, </em>150 Or App 300, 304, 945 P2d 1114 (1997). We explained in <em>Stephenson </em>that the board awards fees under ORS 656.386(1) \u201cin cases where (1) there is a request for compensation; (2) the request for compensation is denied; and (3) the claimant prevails finally against the refusal to pay compensation as requested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither the language of ORS 656.386(1) nor our case law suggests any reason to define \u201crescission\u201d of a denied claim for compensation as meaning more than obtaining the insurer\u2019s agreement to pay the requested but previously denied compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">In <em>Batey, </em>we disagreed with SAIF\u2019s proposition that the board could not award fees under ORS 656.386(1) when SAIF withdrew a denial of a claimant\u2019s aggravation claim but did not withdraw the theory behind its denial\u2014 that the claimant suffered no compensable aggravation. 153 Or App at 636. The claimant in <em>Batey </em>initially requested that SAIF pay temporary disability compensation, a change that required reclassification of her compensable injury from \u201cnondisabling\u201d to \u201cdisabling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>SAIF responded by instructing the claimant to file an aggravation claim, but then denied that aggravation claim. <em>Id. </em>While the claimant\u2019s request for hearing was pending, SAIF agreed to pay the requested compensation by reclassifying the claim as disabling, and withdrew the aggravation denial as a \u201cprocedural nullity,\u201d but it did not concede that the claimant had suffered an aggravation. <em>Id. </em>SAIF sought review after the board ordered SAIF to pay a penalty plus attorney fees under two different statutory provisions, including an award under ORS 656.386(1), for the claimant\u2019s success in obtaining rescission of the aggravation denial. <em>Id. </em>at 637. Citing the dictionary definition of \u201crescind,\u201d we emphasized that \u201ca rescission does not require replacing that which has been rescinded with something else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we held that SAIF rescinded the denial for purposes of ORS 656.386(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>regardless of the fact it did not issue an aggravation acceptance, <em>i.e., </em>regardless of the fact it did not concede the theory for its denial but withdrew it for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">For purposes of a \u201crescission\u201d under ORS 656.386(1), what matters is that SAIF denied the request for the compensation and then agreed to pay for the requested compensation. Here, the \u201ccompensation as requested\u201d was payment for injections; nothing more. An insurer\u2019s obligation to pay for medical services under ORS 656.245 arises when the treatment relates to the \u201ccompensable injury,\u201d a concept that is not limited to the \u201caccepted conditions.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Carlos-Macias, </em>262 Or App 629, 637, 325 P3d 827 (2014). Thus, SAIF\u2019s theory that the arthritis had to be an accepted condition before claimant could receive the compensation he requested is not the only theory under which claimant could prove the services were compensable. As in <em>Batey, </em>it makes no difference that SAIF did not concede the theory on which it denied the claim or that SAIF paid the requested compensation only after claimant followed the procedure SAIF requested; what matters under ORS 656.386(1) is whether claimant prevailed, not why he prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Although SAIF suggests that the board\u2019s approach allows the medical dispute process to become \u201ca proxy\u201d for the requirement of a formal request before an insurer must consider accepting new or omitted conditions, ORS 656.267(1), that system continues to have significance. An insurer\u2019s acceptance of a new or omitted condition triggers additional obligations such as the obligation to pay compensation for permanent disability related to the condition. ORS 656.268(l)(b), (15). By contrast, the insurer\u2019s obligation under ORS 656.245 to pay for medical services \u201cnecessitated in material part by the \u2018compensable injury,\u201d\u2019 is not limited to services addressing \u201caccepted conditions.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Martinez, </em>219 Or App 182, 191, 182 P2d 873 (2008). Indeed, ORS 656.267(1) expressly contemplates that claims for, and payment of, medical services will occur without formal acceptance of a new or omitted condition: neither a claimant\u2019s \u201crequests for authorization to provide medical services\u201d for a new or omitted condition nor the insurer\u2019s act of \u201cactually providing such medical services\u201d will constitute a claim that the insurer accept the new or omitted condition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Thus, in <em>Martinez, </em>we rejected SAIF\u2019s concern \u2014 a concern very similar to the concern expressed by SAIF here \u2014 that requiring insurers to pay for medical services related to a condition that is not accepted \u201ceffects an 'end run\u2019 around the requirements\u201d of ORS 656.267(1). <em>Id. </em>at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Claimant has never contended \u2014 and could not contend \u2014 that the request for injections was a claim that SAIF add arthritis as an accepted condition. ORS 656.267(1). It was, however, a \u201cclaim for compensation,\u201d and SAIF\u2019s denial of that claim was a \u201cdenied claim\u201d within the meaning of ORS 656.386(1). SAIF\u2019s subsequent decision to pay for the same services, regardless of its rationale for that decision, amounted to a \u201crescission\u201d of the denied claim for purposes of ORS 656.386(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">C. <em>Additional Fee Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Finally, we disagree with SAIF\u2019s concern that our interpretation of \u201crescission\u201d can make an insurer liable for fees simply \u201cfor timely providing for services as they become compensable.\u201d ORS 656.386(1) requires more than just a voluntary payment of compensation that the insurer has previously denied. Rather, it also requires a finding that claimant\u2019s attorney was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in bringing about the insurer\u2019s decision to pay the compensation and that the fee amount is \u201creasonable\u201d given that \u201cinstrumental\u201d effort. In this case, the board found that claimant\u2019s attorney was instrumental in getting SAIF to pay for the previously denied medical services and that $3,000 is a \u201creasonable\u201d fee for the attorney\u2019s efforts. Given those findings, which SAIF does not challenge on review, the board correctly determined that SAIF is liable for that fee under ORS 656.386(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-5\"> ORS 656.245(6) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">\u201cSubject to the provisions of ORS 656.704, if a claim for medical services is disapproved, the injured worker, insurer or self-insured employer may request administrative review by the director pursuant to ORS 656.260 or 656.327.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\"> Some medical services disputes (such as those related to the appropriateness of a particular treatment) are resolved by the director pursuant to ORS 656.704(3)(b)(B). But, when the medical services dispute involves a \u201cmatter concerning a claim,\u201d ORS 656.704(3)(a) assigns jurisdiction to the board to resolve the dispute. Under ORS 656.704(3)(b)(A) and (C), a \u201cmatter concerning a claim\u201d includes medical services disputes in which the issue is the compensability of the treatment or the causal relationship of the treatment to an accepted claim. This case falls within the latter category, as SAIF denied the treatment based on its view that the treatment was not related to claimant\u2019s accepted claim. Although this case originated with the director, the director transferred the matter to the Hearings Division of the board, as provided in ORS 656.704(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\"> The board awarded fees under ORS 656.386, because this medical services dispute is a \u201cmatter concerning a claim,\u201d for which jurisdiction is assigned to the board.

Por medical services disputes resolved by the director pursuant to ORS 656.704(3)(b)(B), the requirements for an award of attorney fees to a prevailing claimant are set forth in ORS 656.385. The parties disagree about whether ORS 656.385 would provide an alternative basis for an award of fees in this case.
