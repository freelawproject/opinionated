Code, \u00a7 10851). He earlier had admitted having served a prior prison term for the same offense. On this appeal, he contends the trial court failed to properly advise him of his rights incident to his admission of the prior and prejudicially erred in denying his <em>Beagle </em>motion and refusing to instruct on joyriding as a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>I: Beagle Error<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">II: Joyriding Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">As noted, appellant contends the trial court prejudicially erred in refusing to instruct on joyriding (Pen. Code, \u00a7 499b) as a lesser included offense of the charged violation of Vehicle Code section 10851. He relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrick </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 115 [187 Cal.Rptr. 716, 654 P.2d 1243], where the Supreme Court partially disapproved its former decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 121 [23 Cal.Rptr. 161, 373 P.2d 97]: \u201cOn reexamination of the question, we conclude that <em>Thomas </em>correctly held that joyriding is not intrinsically a necessarily included offense within Vehicle Code section 10851. We also conclude, however, that <em>Thomas </em>erred in holding that the charging allegation in that case did not render joyriding a necessarily included offense within the charged violation of Vehicle Code section 10851. In our opinion the pleadings in both <em>Thomas </em>and the present case, by accusing defendant of driving <em>and </em>taking a vehicle without the owner\u2019s permission, necessarily charged both a violation of Vehicle Code section 10851 and of Penal Code section 499b.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 133; original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The court reasoned its way to the above result with this analysis of the relationship of the two statutes: \u201cThe principal difference between them is that section 10851 requires a driving or taking with the specific intent to deprive the owner permanently or temporarily of title or possession of the automobile [citation].<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Penal Code section 499b, the joyriding statute, does not require a specific intent to deprive the owner of title or possession of a vehicle [citations].<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the section does require a \u2018purpose\u2019 or \u2018intent\u2019 of \u2018temporarily using or operating the same.\u2019 [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u201cBecause one could conceivably \u2018take\u2019 a vehicle in violation of section 10851 without the purpose of using or operating it in violation of section 499b, the latter is not a necessarily included offense under section 10851. [Citation.] As the <em>Thomas </em>court stated: \u2018It is obvious that the owner of a vehicle could be deprived of possession in many ways which would not necessarily require that the offender use or operate the vehicle.\u2019 [Citation.] Such instances would seem to be rare; but, for example, a vehicle could be towed with the specific intent to deprive the owner of possession without being towed for the purpose of using or operating the vehicle. Thus, so long as the charging allegation alleges merely a taking with the intent to deprive the owner of possession, violation of section 499b is not necessarily included.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u201cSection 10851 speaks in the alternative: a person can violate that section by driving <em>or </em>taking a vehicle. The acts constituting driving a vehicle and taking a vehicle are separate and distinct. [Citations.] As we have seen, a person can take a vehicle without having the purpose of using or operating it. However, one cannot <em>drive </em>a vehicle without the purpose of using or operating it because to drive an automobile is to operate it. [Citation.] Thus, a complaint which charges a defendant with \u2018driving and taking\u2019 an automobile necessarily charges that he took the automobile \u2018for the purpose of temporarily using or operating the same\u2019 and thus violated section 499b.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, although we agree that <em>Thomas </em>correctly held that Penal Code section 499b is not a necessarily included offense within Vehicle Code section 10851, we conclude that the charging allegation in this case does allege facts that necessarily include the former section within the latter.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>pp. 134-135; original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The charging allegation in the instant case differs from those in <em>Barrick </em>and <em>Thomas </em>(and <em>People </em>v. <em>Tiebout </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 1011 [190 Cal.Rptr. 754]) in one significant respect: it includes both driving and taking, but alleges them in the disjunctive: \u201c. . . on or about the 13th day of August, 1981, at and in said County of Kern, State of California, before the filing of this information, did willfully, unlawfully and feloniously drive or take a certain vehicle, to wit: a 1976 Chevrolet Luv pick-up truck, then and there the personal property of Don Swearingen without the consent of and with intent to deprive the said owner of title to or possession of said vehicle, in violation of Section 10851 of the Vehicle Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\"><em>Barrick </em>compels the conclusion that this difference is fatal to appellant\u2019s contention. The Supreme Court has reaffirmed that joyriding \u201cis not intrinsically a necessarily included offense within Vehicle Code section 10851.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Barrick, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 115, 133.) In other words, it is not a statutorily lesser included offense. As respects the elements of driving and taking, the instant pleadings simply track the language of the statute, which speaks disjunctively.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The \u201clanguage of the pleadings test\u201d for whether a crime is a lesser included offense within the charged offense is an <em>alternative </em>to the \u201cstatutory elements\u201d test. Where the language of the pleadings <em>is </em>the language of the statute, the pleadings add nothing to the statutory elements and no alternative theory is available. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 394 [309 P.2d 456].) In such a case, to invoke the language of the pleadings test would be to espouse a distinction that only Lewis Carroll could love.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In sum, a pleading which charges a defendant with \u201cdriving or taking\u201d an automobile does not charge joyriding as a lesser included offense under either the statutory elements or language of the pleadings test. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s request for a lesser included offense instruction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Ill: Admission of Prior<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">IV: Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The judgment is reversed both as to appellant\u2019s conviction of violating Vehicle Code section 10851 and as to the finding that he suffered a prior prison term within the meaning of Penal Code section 667.5.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-12\">Before Hanson (P.
