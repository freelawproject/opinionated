Plaintiff brought this action alleging that defendant had built upon and now occupied a portion of said land, and demanded its possession and damages. A demurrer that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that there was a defect of parties defendant, the town council of the corporation, was sustained by the Circuit Court (Pressley, J.) Plaintiff appealed. Held\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">1. That the concluding words of the warranty imposed a duty upon the town, but it was doubtful whether they created a condition, but, if a condition, the grantor could not maintain an action for the land until he had made entry upon it after condition broken, or made claim, if entry was impossible. <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Railroad Company, </em>15 <em>8.
