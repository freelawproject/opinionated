Such entry therefore is unlawful, and if unlawful it is a trespass. Reeder et al. v. Purdy et al., 41 Ill. 284. The owner in fee of land has no right to make a forcible entry on a tenant holding over, or upon a person wrongfully in the possession. Farwell v. Warren, 51 Ill. 467; Wilder v.

S., does not invest an \u201c owner \u201d with authority to distrain animals belonging to the \u201c occupier.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b125-11\" pgmap=\"125\">It was unlawful under the statute of forcible entry and detainer for the owner in the case at bar to enter upon premises in the actual possession of the \u201c occupier,\u201d his tenant, for the purpose of seizing and removing from the premises animals of the latter. Being unlawful, such entry was a trespass, even though the tenant was holding over wrongfully. Reeder v. Purdy, 41 Ill. 284; Farwell v. Warren, 51 Ill. 467.</p> <p id=\"b125-13\" pgmap=\"125\">Section 21 aforesaid can not be construed to authorize the commission of a trespass.</p> <p id=\"b125-14\" pgmap=\"125\">The cow was, therefore, wrongfully in the possession of Wright and was properly restored to its owner by the judgment in replevin.</p> <p id=\"b125-15\" pgmap=\"125\">Whether the tenant was rightfully in possession of the farm, under the terms of lease, was unimportant.</p> <p id=\"b125-16\" pgmap=\"125\">He had actual possession, and the statute of forcible entry and detainer forbade forcible interference therewith.</p> <p id=\"b125-17\" pgmap=\"125\">Hence the court properly rejected evidence relating to the terms and conditions of the contract under which the tenant obtained possession of the farm.</p> <p id=\"b125-18\" pgmap=\"125\">The evidence upon which the award of damages was made in the main was incompetent.</p> <p id=\"b125-19\" pgmap=\"125\">But it was not objected to, nor was the court asked to withdraw it, or to instruct the jury as to the true measure of damages, or to grant a new trial for that reason.</p> <p id=\"b126-3\" pgmap=\"126\">We are without power to consider objections that might have been, but were not, made, and which might have been obviated in the lower court had they been made.</p> <p id=\"b126-4\" pgmap=\"126\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
