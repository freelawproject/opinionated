(Tare 5 lbs.) Delivered ex warehouse, Chicago. To be shipped or delivered 5 bales August and 10 bales September. Sale severable as to each bale.

A portion of the sample was introduced in evidence by appellant. Appellee gave evidence tending to prove the hops weVe equal to sample. Appellant gave evidence tending to prove the hops were not equal to sample. Appellant then called a hop expert, to prove that the hops were not equal to sample. The examination made by the expert of the ten bales of hops rejected by appellant was made early in April, 1895. The court refused to let the witness testify as to the condition of the hops in April, 1895, on the ground that the condition of the hops in April was not material, the hops having been rejected in September, 1894. The expert was then asked this question: \u201c Would hops similar to this sample change materially from September, 1894, to the present time?\u201d Answer: \u201cHo, sir; they don\u2019t change.\u201d Thereupon the court refused to permit the witness to testify as to the condition of the hops at the time of his examination early in April, 1895. To this ruling exception was then and there taken, and that is the only thing complained of.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-4\" pgmap=\"329\">Edward J.

To attain that result, he must rely upon a retrospective presumption, to wit, that a condition of things once shown to exist, will be presumed to have existed before that time until the contrary is shown. Such a presumption, it has been held, can not be indulged in law, and it is not supported either by reason or authority. Lawson on Presumptive Evidence, Rule 37, page 190; Erskine v. Davis, 25 Ill. 228; Bareli v. Lytle, 4 La. Ann. 25, 557; Taylor v. Crestwell, 45 Md. 422; Murdock v.

Volkes, 153 Ill. 385.</p> <p id=\"b330-5\" pgmap=\"330\">In the case at bar it had not been shown that the hops had\" been kept in a suitable warehouse, or in a manner that would have prevented a change in their condition; nor did it appear with certainty that the hops in Mr. Dewberry\u2019s warehouse, shown to the witness by the party in charge, were the hops in question.</p> <p id=\"b330-6\" pgmap=\"330\">The witness was not asked if the Dewberry warehouse was a suitable one; nor did it appear that he was an expert as to what is the proper way to keep hops so that they will not spoil in six months of storage.</p> <p id=\"b330-7\" pgmap=\"330\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
