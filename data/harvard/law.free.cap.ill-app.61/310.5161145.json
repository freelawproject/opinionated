Hayes, defendant, stating that on or about the. 2d, of .July, 1892, they entered into an agreement in writing with defendant to furnish material and perform labor for constructing masonry work for the building, 293 West Monroe street, for the contract price of $1,347; that they performed the contract and finished same on or about the 7th day of September, 1892, and during the progress of the work, at defendant\u2019s request,. did extra work upon said building, amounting to $23.10; that they duly filed notice for lien with the clerk of Circuit Court; that defendant refused to pay therefor. The bill prays for an account and lien upon the property.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-8\" pgmap=\"309\">The notice, annexed thereto, claims an indebtedness, after allowing all just credits, deductions and set-offs, of $1,370.10, with five per cent interest thereon from September 7,1892, and sets forth that said indebtedness is on account of work and labor done and material furnished in accordance with said contract; that extra material and extra work and labor was furnished, amounting to $23.10, as specified in Exhibit \u201c A,\u201d attached.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-9\" pgmap=\"309(33) 310(11)\">That all said work and labor was done and material furnished continuously from day to day between July 2, and September 7, 1892; that none of it has been paid. A legal description of the property sought to be charged is appended.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-5\" pgmap=\"310\">The notice is verified by the affidavit of John Hammond, dated November 29, 1892, stating that said notice is true in substance and in fact; that the work, labor and material were done, performed and furnished, as in said claim stated, and at the time stated therein, and that the itemized statement of account attached, Exhibit \u201c A,\u201d is a true, accurate and correct statement of account therefor.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-6\" pgmap=\"310\">Said Exhibit \u201c A \u201d claims for the mason work on said building, under contract in writing for same,</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-7\" pgmap=\"310\">dated July 2, 1892,........................... $1,347.00</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-8\" pgmap=\"310\">Extra work and material done, performed and furnished on said building between July 2, 1892, and September 7, 1892, piers in cellar of old building........................................... 5.00</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-9\" pgmap=\"310\">Taking down stone wall to said frames in iio it wall cellar.................................... 3.00</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-11\" pgmap=\"310\">Furnishing one step and setting two steps in rear of old building................................ 6.00</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-13\" pgmap=\"310\">Building chimney in cellar of new building____ 1.50</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-14\" pgmap=\"310\">Pointing chimney of old building............. 2.00</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-15\" pgmap=\"310\">600 brick for catch-basins........ ........... 3.60</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-16\" pgmap=\"310\">Hauling lot of brick and mortar.............. 2.00</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-17\" pgmap=\"310\">Total............ $1,370.10</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-18\" pgmap=\"310\">Interest at five per cent from September 7, 1892.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-19\" pgmap=\"310\">The cause was referred to a master in chancery to take proof and report same to the court, with his opinion of the law and the evidence. The master to whom the matter was referred, took the testimony, and against the objections of the defendant found appellees entitled to a mechanic\u2019s lien for the sum of $1,307.13, with interest thereon at the rate of five per cent per annum, from September 7, 1892, being a reduction of $62.97 (exclusive of the interest) from the claim made by complainants in their notice and bill.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-20\" pgmap=\"310(18) 311(28)\">The court below, on exceptions made, overruled the same,, and confirmed the master\u2019s report, except that it allowed interest only from the \u25a0 date of the filing of the bill, and thereupon entered a decree for complainants, from which decree defendant, Hayes, appeals to this court.</p><attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-5\" pgmap=\"311\">English &amp; Hefferan, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-6\" pgmap=\"311\">Defrees, Brace &amp; Ritter, attorneys for appellees.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b311-7\" pgmap=\"311\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"AZX\" pgmap=\"311\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b311-8\" pgmap=\"311\">The master disallowed $63 of the complainants\u2019 claim; such being the case, it is contended that appellees did not file a just and true statement of account or demand, and therefore should not be allowed a lien. We do not think that a strict construction of the lien law requires us to so hold.</p> <p id=\"b311-9\" pgmap=\"311\">There is nothing tending to show that the complainants did not file their claim in good faith, or that they thought any portion of it unjust or untrue. There is a wide distinction between an unallowable and an unjust claim.</p> <p id=\"b311-10\" pgmap=\"311\">In Culver v. Schroth, 153 Ill. 437, the insertion in the claim of an item disallowed by the court was held not to constitute a failure to comply with the law.</p> <p id=\"b311-11\" pgmap=\"311\">The claim for interest was manifestly for five per cent per annum. Ho citizen of this State could be misled by the claim in this regard. In this case the notice filed sets forth \u201c that the contract or agreement was dated on or about July 2, 1892.\u201d The petition alleges that the contract was of the same date, July 2, 1892.</p> <p id=\"b311-12\" pgmap=\"311\">The evidence shows the contract to have been dated on the 29th of June, \u00cd892.</p> <p id=\"b311-13\" pgmap=\"311\">We think that the statement as to the date of the contract is, under the evidence, a sufficient compliance with the law.</p> <p id=\"b311-14\" pgmap=\"311\">The exceptions to the master\u2019s report are of a general character, failing to point out the evidence relied upon to sustain them. Very little of the evidence is recited by the master in his report; and what is, does not show that any exception should have been sustained.</p> <p id=\"b312-3\" pgmap=\"312\">The rule as to what exceptions must contain is old, and requires that they shall state article by article those parts of the report which are intended to be excepted to, and shall also designate the particular evidence which it is claimed justifies the exceptions. Daniell\u2019s Ch. Pr., 1300, 1315, 1317; Wolcott v. Lake View Bldg. &amp; Loan Assn., 59 Ill. App. 415, and cases there cited.</p> <p id=\"b312-4\" pgmap=\"312\">We do not think that the evidence shows more than one express contract. Whether the building ordinance of the city was violated by appellees, is not a question for determination in this litigation. The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
