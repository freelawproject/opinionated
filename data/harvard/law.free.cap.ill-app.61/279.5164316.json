This is what appellees did. But appellants claim that they should have given notice of the resale. To this there are two answers: First, the law does not require such notice. Second, the appellants expressly waived notice. Ullman v. Kent, 60 Ill. 271; Maulding v. Steele, 105 Ill. 647; Plumb v. Campbell, 129 Ill. 110; Van Brocklen v. Smeallie, 140 N. Y. 70; 35 N. E.

If you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff has sworn positively that the defendant ordered ten thousand of the pictures in controversy from the plaintiff, and that the defendant has sworn just as positively that he did not order ten thousand of the pictures in controversy from the plaintiff, and if you further find from the consideration of the evidence in the case that the testimony of the defendant is entitled to as much credit as that of the plaintiff, and corroborated to the same extent, then, so far as that point is concerned, you should find for the defendant.\u201d Johnson v. People, 40 Ill. App. 382, 140 Ill. 350, is a complete answer. Credibility of witnesses is for the jury.</p> <p id=\"b280-4\" pgmap=\"280\">The really serious question in the case is under the third : \u201c The necessity of notice of resale.\u201d We shall not enter upon the task of reconciling, or extracting the true rule from the many cases on that subject.</p> <p id=\"b280-5\" pgmap=\"280\">The evidence is that on the refusal to accept, one of the appellees asked one of the appellants what he (appellee) should do with the rest, and the reply was that he didn\u2019t care what \u2014do what appellees chose. This waived notice, and only required appellees to show that they disposed of the residue in good faith and with reasonable prudence and discretion.</p> <p id=\"b280-6\" pgmap=\"280\">The bill of particulars is not before us, not being in the bill of exceptions. Bowland v. Lambka, 57 Ill. App. 334. The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
