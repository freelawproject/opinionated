No exception was taken to the action of the court in respect to instructions, except the refusal to instruct the jury to find for defendants.</p> <p id=\"b116-8\" pgmap=\"116\">This refusal was entirely proper. For the want of exceptions taken as to the refusal or modification of other instructions asked by the defense, or the giving of those for the plaintiff, we can not notice the objections now urged in that behalf. This rule is so familiar that no authorities need be cited.</p> <p id=\"b116-9\" pgmap=\"116\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
