First party also agrees to pay for second party any and all extra insurance over what they would have to pay in their former location, 117 and 119 Hamilton street, Peoria.

That by the said contract and lease, plaintiff Smith agreed to purchase of defendants a large quantity of goods of the kind manufactured by defendants, at their lowest jobbing prices, to wit, two thousand dollars\u2019 worth per year, and in consideration thereof, and relying on the promises of said plaintiff so made, defendants executed said lease and took possession of said premises, and then and there undertook and promised the plaintiff to deliver the plaintiff, at such time or times of the year as he should elect, and at the place aforesaid, and the plaintiff undertook and then and there faithfully promised the defendants to purchase the said goods as aforesaid, and pay for the same on delivery; and although the defendants, on, etc., were ready and willing, and then and there offered to deliver the said goods to the plaintiff, and often requested the plaintiff to designate the said goods, and to accept the same and pay for them, yet plaintiff, not regarding his promises and undertaking, but contriving and intending to deceive and defraud the defendants, did not, nor would at any time designate or accept the said goods, save a small amount, to wit, $700 worth, or pay defendants for the same as aforesaid, but neglected and refused so to do; by reason whereof said defendants say they have suffered great damage and loss of large gains and profits, which they should have made but for the refusal of the said plaintiff to perform his contract, to wit, the sum of $700, and defendants say said amount exceeds the sum of money due and owing them from the said defendants to the said plaintiff by virtue of the causes of action in the said declaration mentioned, and out of which sum of money they are ready and willing, and hereby offer to set off and allow plaintiff amount of money due him by virtue of said cause of action.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-4\" pgmap=\"340\">A general demurrer to the plea of set-off was overruled.</p><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-5\" pgmap=\"340\">Wolseley &amp; Heath, attorneys for appellants,</attorneys><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6m\" pgmap=\"340\">contended that the measure of damages for the breach of an executory contract is actual compensation.

They are presumed to have been taken into consideration, and deliberated upon before the contract was made, and formed, perhaps, the only inducement to the arrangement, and such profits or advantages can be recovered.

That defendants were ready, willing, able, and offered to deliver the goods, was proven. The court seemed to be of the opinion that as appellants could not tell what kind of goods appellee would have selected, therefore his contract to purchase $2,000 worth of goods was neither enforcible nor one for the breach of which damages could be recovered.</p> <p id=\"b342-8\" pgmap=\"342\">What were the respective rights and obligations of the parties to this agreement ?</p> <p id=\"b342-9\" pgmap=\"342\">Appellants had agreed to pay to appellee rent at the rate of $50 per month; he agreed to purchase of them at their lowest jobbing prices such goods as they manufacture, to the amount of $2,000 per annum.</p> <p id=\"b342-10\" pgmap=\"342\">Being ready to manufacture and deliver goods, such as, when the contract was made, they were making, they called upon appellee to select and order; he refused to do so.</p> <p id=\"b342-11\" pgmap=\"342\">Whether, under this contract, the right of selection of the kind of goods' manufactured was in appellants or appellee, we do not feel called upon to decide. It was, not because appellants refused to give to him the right of selection that appellee refused to take goods save to the value of $700.</p> <p id=\"b342-12\" pgmap=\"342\">If the right to select belonged to appellee, then it was his duty within the year to make his selection.</p> <p id=\"b342-13\" pgmap=\"342(30) 343(58)\">Appellee having refused to select, appellants became entitled to maintain an action for refusal to order or select.

DeLatour, 20 L. &amp; Eq. 157.</p> <p id=\"b343-4\" pgmap=\"343\">The measure of damages in such special action for refusal to select, is such amount as will fully compensate the vendor for being deprived of the benefit of his contract. Phillpot v. Evans, 5 M. &amp; W. 475.</p> <p id=\"b343-5\" pgmap=\"343\">In the case at bar the goods were contracted for at the defendant\u2019s lowest jobbing prices; the measure of the damages is the difference between this and what it would have cost appellants to make them.
