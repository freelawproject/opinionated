After the filing of the petition, the town clerk, in compliance with the statute, gave notice to each of the commissioners and they met November 10, 1886, and adjourned to November 19, 1886, at nine a. m. for the further completion of said Union District. The clerk then posted notices as required by law, that a meeting of the drainage commissioners would be held at the town clerk\u2019s office of the town of Milton, at the hour of nine o\u2019clock on the 19th day of November, 1886 (which was not less than eight nor more than fifteen days from the date of said notice), for the purpose of organizing said drainage district. He also filed a copy of this notice in his office.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-12\" pgmap=\"414(8) 415(68)\">Pursuant to this notice, the commissioners met November 18, 1886, at 9 o\u2019clock A. m. for the further completion of the said Union District; and thereupon proceeded to ascertain whether the petition contained the signatures of the requisite number of land owners. The necessary affidavit, to be signed by two credible signers of the petition, was duly signed and sworn to by Jesse C. Wheaton, Sr., and H. H. Hadley, and filed with the commissioners.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-4\" pgmap=\"415\">At this meeting, the record shows that the commissioners, after reciting the beginning and terminus of said drain, viz., the beginning to be \u201c at or near the Wheaton road,\u201d and the terminus \u201c to empty into the Du Page river,\u201d after reciting the land over which it should pass, and after a full hearing upon the petition, found in favor of said petition, and thereupon made a written statement of their finding, which was entered of record.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\" pgmap=\"415\">The finding of the commissioners is in accordance with the statute. After the finding of the commissioners in favor of the petitioners, the commissioners adjourned to November 27, 1886 (which was not less than eight, nor more than fifteen days), to meet on the ground of the proposed ditch.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-6\" pgmap=\"415\">On November 27, 1886, the commissioners went upon the lands of the proposed district and examined the same, and then and there duly adjourned to meet at the town clerk\u2019s office on December 10, 1886.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-7\" pgmap=\"415\">On December 10,1886, the map, showing the district, was approved, and the district was duly organized and work was commenced. A portion of the right of way was obtained. (John Bollweg, the petitioner in this suit, having signed a release on December 15,1886, and another release on November 9, 1893.)</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-8\" pgmap=\"415\">A special assessment was made and collected, and everything ran .along smoothly until March 25, 1887, when the drainage commissioners considered the question of changing the boundaries of said ditch, and commissioner Stacey offered a resolution to that effect, that the lower end, or terminus, shall be on the west line of the land of John Weisbroolc * which resolution was adopted.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-9\" pgmap=\"415(10) 416(31)\">At a subsequent meeting, held April 2, 1887, the proposition of each party entering into an agreement to build his own ditch was discussed, and leave was given the land owners to petition the commissioners to abandon the ditch.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\" pgmap=\"416\">A committee was appointed to carry out this proposition; and awaiting the action of this committee, the commissioners adjourned to meet at the call of the chairman.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\" pgmap=\"416\">As the record shows, this was all the action ever taken in reference to changing the boundaries or terminus of said ditch. It does not appear by the record that this committee ever reported nor that any further action in reference to this proposition was ever taken. The commissioners continued their control over said drainage district, making orders as late as August 20, 1890. In October, 1893, the old commissioners having gone out of office, and new commissioners having been elected, it was decided by them to complete the ditch of this drainage district, in accordance with the prayer of the original petition, and the order of December 10, 1886, organizing the drainage district, a part of the work having already been done. The attempted action of the old commissioners in reference to changing the boundaries of said ditch, was rescinded October 28, 1893, and an engineer was employed, a re-survey was made over the old route, the map completed and the ditch ordered constructed and completed, in accordance with the prayer of the original petition. James II. Hill, John Bollweg (the petitioner here) and Christian Fessler signed releases for the right of way; a special assessment was made, from which no appeal was ever taken by any one, a large portion of the work had been done, and contracts for most all the work had been let (John Bollweg agreeing to contract for the work across' his own land) when this petition for a writ of certiorari was filed. Attorneys for appellant raised various questions for consideration and decision.</p><attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b416-7\" pgmap=\"416\">Osarles Wheaton and T. M.

S., Starr &amp; Curtis, which authorizes a dissolution; and the district in whole or in part can not be dissolved otherwise, and a district, possibly, can not be partially dissolved under that section, a question we need not decide. There is no provision of the statute authorizing a change of the district after it is fully organized. But if such an order, changing the district, is invalid, no reason is perceived why such an order may not be revoked by the drainage commissioners.</p> <p id=\"b417-9\" pgmap=\"417\">The order of restriction was void, and the subsequent order annulling it could only have the effect to undo the void act.</p> <p id=\"b418-4\" pgmap=\"418\">Such order should, therefore, stand of record for the purpose of -removing a cloud on the district organization.</p> <p id=\"b418-5\" pgmap=\"418\">The judgment of the court below, quashing the Writ of certiorari, is therefore affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
