Ejectment will not lie in favor of a party who has only an incorporeal hereditament.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-9\">Fourth, The plaintiff has shown nothing but deeds; there is .no evidence that the grantors of those deeds had any estate in or title to the premises, or that they ever had any possession of the premises. This evidence is not enough to put the adverse party on his defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-10\"><em>Fifth, </em>The deeds of conveyance to the plaintiff, and to the plaintiff's grantor, weye void by statute, because the premises were then in the actual possession of the defendant, and had been for more than twenty years, and he held possession under claim of title adverse to the plaintiff, and to the plaintiff's grantors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-11\"><em>Sixth, </em>as an action for rent, the action cannot be sustained, because the relation of landlord and tenant did-not' exist between the parties to the action, and because the deed in which the rent was reserved, was a deed of assignment and not of lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>Seventh, </em>The action could not be maintained for the violation of the condition. The condition was void, because the party in whose favor it was made, had no reversion or estate in the premises to which it could attach; and if not void, it was only personal to him and could not be transferred, bebause there was no estate to which it was attached, and with which it could pass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\"><em>Eighth, </em>If the conditions were operative, it would not help the plaintiff, because it could only avoid the estate \u25a0\u2014in which event the state, and not the plaintiff, would be entitled to the possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">The court denied the-motion for a nonsuit, and the counsel for the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-7\">The court thereupon directed, and the jury found, a verdict for the plaintiff, to which the defendant also excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-8\">The defendant made a case.and bill of exceptions, and the court directed that the same be heard, in the first instance, at the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-9\">M. &amp; D.

The plaintiff could, therefore, only sustain his. action of ejectment:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\"><em>First. </em>By proof of a formal demand of the exact amount of rent due, at the particular place at which it was payable,, on the very day it fell due.. <em>(Van Rensselaer </em>agt. <em>Jewett, 5 Denio, </em>13 ; <em>2 Comst., </em>147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\"><em>Second. </em>By the remedy provided by the Revised Statutes in certain cases. <em>(2 R. S., 1st ed. p. 505, </em>$ 30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The plaintiff does not claim that he did sustain his action at common law. The defendant claims that be did not sustain the action under the statute, because he failed to prove a want of sufficient distress on the premises, or a notice of fifteen days in lieu thereof under the third section of chapter 274 of the laws of 1846.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The section of the Eevised Statutes before cited', provides that whenever any half year\u2019s rent, or more, shall be in arrear, from any tenant to his landlord, and <em>no sufficient distress can be found on the premises to satisfy the rent due, </em>if the landlord has a subsisting right to re-enter for. the non-payment of such rent, he may bring an action of ejectment for the recovery of the possession of the demised premises; and the service of the declaration shall be deemed, and stand, instead of a demand of the rent in arerar, and of a re-entry on the demised premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The act of 1846, abolished the remedy of distress for rent, and the third section of that act provided : That whenever a right of re-entry was reserved to a grantor in default of a <em>sufficiency of goods and chattels whereon to distrain for the satisfaction of any rent </em>due, such a re-entry might be made at any time after default in the payment of such rent, provided fifteen days\u2019 notice in writing should be given, notwithstanding there might be a sufficiency of goods on the lands demised &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">This section was clearly intended to apply to cases where the right of re-entry under the grant or lease was in default of sufficient goods and chattels whereon to distrain for'the rent. The fifteen days\u2019 notice was intended as a substitute for the right to distrain in cases 'where there was a sufficient distress on'the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">v As this was not the case provided for by the -act of 1846, no notice of fifteen days was necessary to maintain the action, nor would such a notice have been of any avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">The plaintiff, not being entitled to recover at common law, the question arises whether the action could be main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>tained under the section of the Revised Statutes, before referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">I think this depends upon the effect of the act of 1846, upon this provision of the statute. The act of 1846, does not, in so many words amend or alter the Revised Statutes; but it abolishes the right of distress absolutely and expressly. It would, therefore, appear to leave the statute in force in every other respect. If this were an original question, I should entertain great doubts whether the abolition of distress for rent of itself, establishes that no sufficient distress can be found on the premises to satisfy the rent due. The leases which contain a clause that in default the lessor might distrain, and should there be no sufficient distress, the lessor might re-enter, are clearly intended to provide for cases where <em>sufficient property </em>could not be found on the premises to pay the rent. The provisions of the Revised Statutes were designed to provide the remedy of ejectment only in such cases, and for the reason that the rent could not be collected. The act of 1846 did not change the common law remedy, but only provided an additional remedy in certain cases. <em>(Williams </em>agt. Potter, 2 <em>Barb., </em>316 ; <em>The Mayor &amp;c. </em>agt. <em>Campbell, </em>18 <em>Id., </em>156.) It would, therefore, seem somewhat doubtful whether the legislature intended to give a remedy by ejectment under the Revised Statutes, without a demand, when there was property on the premises out of which the rent could have been realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The point, however, was considered and'decided otherwise, in the case of <em>Van Rensselaer </em>agt. <em>Snyder, </em>3 <em>Kern., </em>299. Gardiner C. J., in defining what is meant by the terms \u201c sufficient distress,\u201d used in the Revised Statutes, says: \u2018\u2018 The terms \u2018sufficient distress,\u2019 in the grant, are not equivalent for sufficient property to satisfy the rent, they refer to property not only sufficient in kind and value for the purpose, but which, in addition, is subject by law to be distrained and sold in satisfaction of the rent in arrears. They include the idea of an existing legal remedy as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>property subject to it.\u201d Again, \u201c The' tenant might have any considerable amount of property upon the premises, but-he could not, after the passage of the act, have a sufficient distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">He also says: \u201cIn a failure in this particular ((a sufficient distress\u2019) the landlord could proceed at common law, or under the statute (2 <em>R. S., </em>579). Then came the law of 1846. The right to distrain .was abolished. There coqld be no sufficient distress upon or off the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Although, in that case, the. clause of re-entry was upon condition that no sufficient distress could be found upon the premises, .yet the question now discussed was distinctly presented and decided,' and whatever doubts may be entertained, must yield to the express adjudication of a higher tribunal. It must, therefore, be considered as <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">I am inclined to think that the other questions raised are covered by the decisions of this court, in <em>Main </em>agt. Green, (52 <em>Barb. </em>485.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Hew trial denied with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
