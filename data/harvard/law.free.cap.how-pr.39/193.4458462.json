Per </em>Foster, J*.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-6\">A <em>subscribing witness </em>to a <em>deed </em>is within the same principle which allows the subscribing witness to a last will and testament, to give his opinion of the sanity of the testator, and may give his opinion (though not an expert) as to the competency of the grantor to contract, at the time of the execution of the deed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-7\">Where a witness, not properly an expert, hut a person of high character, was called to testify as to the competency of the plaintiff for the transaction of business, whom he had known for many years, was asked the following question: \u201cWhere any fear of difficulty might threaten him or his property, would he, in your judgment, be easily persuaded to do any act, dictated by any person lie considered a friend <em>V*</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-8\"><em>Held, </em>that the witness was competent to answer this question, on the ground that the acts and conduct of the plaintiff, and of his family, in regard to his business matters, which he (the witness) had testified to, made him so. That is, such statements rendered the witness competent, in connection therewith, to express an opinion.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-9\">The rule laid down by the court in the case of <em>Whelan </em>agt. Whelan, (3 <em>Cow., </em>572,) <em>held </em>applicable to this case on its merits, to wit: \u201c That a contract obtained from one party, so much in the power of the other, cannot be manitained, if confidence has been abused ; if there is inadequacy of price, or the inference is plain that advantage has been taken of age and imbecility, and the partiality of a parent has been artfully made use of, to strip him of his property and reduce him to a state of dependence and want.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-10\"><em>JSCeld, </em>that the facts of this case, as proved and referred to by the court, and the several specific facts found by the referee, taken as a whole, appear to be adverse to the general conclusion of the referee that the plaintiff was not incompetent to contract, and that it is not proved that the defendant committed a fraud or unduly influenced him:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b198-11\">On the contrary, the court is satisfied that this judgment should be reversed, as well upon the question of evidence adverted to, as upon the findings of the referee.

Braud, the plaintiff in this suit, respectfully shows, that he will be seventy-five years old on the 10th day of August, 1868, and has for above thirty years last past, resided in the town of Geddes, Onondaga County. That the said defendant, Alida Braud, is the wife of the said defendant,, William G. Brand, as plaintiff is informed and believes, and is now living and cohabiting with him as such. That on the 25th day of. June last his wife died; that he has living two sons, both residents of said county. That during the summer of 1867, the plaintiff was sick and under the doctor\u2019s care, being confined to his house, and some of the time to his bed, for the space of several weeks That the mind of said plaintiff, from the effects of such si.ckness and the loss of his wife, added to the infirmities of age and physical debility, became so impaired as to render him wholly incapable of transacting his own business, and to make him wholly dependent upon others for the management of his affairs, and that the said plaintiff has ever since remained, and is now weak in body and mind, and incapable of managing his own affairs with adequate discretion. That the said defendant, William G. Brand, who is the youngest son of said plaintiff, has, since the second week of November, 1867, lived in the house of said plaintiff, and having the entire confidence of this plaintiff, has acted as his agent in all his business transactions, and exercised entire and exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>control over the same. That the said plaintiff on and prior to the 29th day of January, 1868, was the owner in fee of a certain farm at his said place of residence, worth at least $7,500 ; and personal property, consisting of horses, cows, swine and farming utensils, to the value of at least $500. That the said William G. Brand, designedly, to obtain the property aforesaid of said plaintiff for little or no consideration, knowing the influence he already possessed over said plaintiff, with the design aforesaid, and the better to enable him to accomplish his pm poses, appeared to take an unusual interest in the welfare of the said plaintiff, and by flattery and various other devices, as the youngest son and the confident adviser and agent of said plaintiff, acquiied such an undue influence over him, as to obtain and exercise entire control of the mind and business matters of the said plaintiff. That said plaintiff, still being so enfeebled and weak in mind, and incompetent, and'tinder the-influence of the said defendant, William G. Brand, was induced and influenced by the said William G. Brand, to make and execute the writing, a copy of which is hereto annexed, marked \u201c A,\u201d by virtue of which the said William G. Brand has taken possessisn of, and still retains possession of, his said farm, mentioned in said contract or deed and referred to above, and also with the same \u2019design- and by similar means obtained from this plaintiff, a bill of sale of all his personal property referred to above, by means of which the said William G. Brand has taken possession of, and still retains possession of, the personal property therein mentioned and referred to above; and the plaintiff is unable to give a copy of said bill of sale, it being in the possession of said William G. Brand, the defendant, and he refusing to give said plaintiff a copy. That the said William G. Brand obtained the bill of sale of the said personal property, by falsely and fraudulently representing that it was only an instrument to keep one George Brand, a brother of the defendant William G. Brand, from claiming pay for the use of such personal property from the said William G. Brand, the defendant, in case of the death of this plaintiff; and when this plaintiff signed the said bill of sale, he had no knowledge that he was dispossessing himself of title to said personal property, and did not intend to convey the title away to the said William G. Brand That the same was not read to him before he signed it, and he did not know its contents except as they were represented to him by the said defendant, William G. Baand; and that he signed the same under an entire misapprehension of the contents thereof, constrained and deceived by the undue control and influence of the said William G. Brand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">That the said William G. Brand paid no consideration to this plaintiff either for the said land or the said personal property, but executed a mortgage without a bond back to this said plaintiff on half of said farm, payable without interest, one year after plaintiff\u2019s death, falsely representing to this plaintiff, that he would be compelled to pay the older son of plaintiff, the said George Brand, the full amount of said mortgage, and that by thus representing to said plaintiff that his son George would get the full $1400, within a year from his, said plaintiff\u2019s death, and by urging him to give said deed at once, this plaintiff signed and executed the same, thereby disinheriting his son George nearly, which this plaintiff did not intend nor design to do. *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">That before the commencement of this action, the plaintiff tendered to said defendant William G. Brand, a satisfaction of said mortgage, duly executed and acknowledged, and demanded of said defendants a re-conveyance of the said farm before mentioned, and the bill of sale of said personal property before mentioned, which the said defendant William G.

then Mr. Raynor advised him to ask Willie to re-convey, and if he would not, then he could bring an action, and the court would set the conveyance aside; father holds <em>my </em>note for the $100 I borrowed of him to pay Mr. Raynor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-5\">\n<em>[Adjourned for dinner till %p. m.\\</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-6\">Admitted\" that plaintiff tendered to defendants a deed to be executed by them, and demanded of the defendant William, a delivery up to plaintiff of the bill of sale, and tendered a satisfaction of the mortgage given by William to his father of the $1,400, payable to George one year after his father\u2019s death ;

Shortly after I returned, I asked him if he had made out the writings, as he talked in July; he said not; asked him what he was going to do about it; he said he wanted me to go on .and work and pay the $1,000 mortgage then due, and after that I could have what I could make off the place; I told him that would not answer my purpose; I could not spend my time and money there on uncertainties; I wanted to draw writings, and have it so I would be secure ; then he said he would make a will; I told him a will would be very uncertain\u2014he could alter it any tim\u00e9 he saw fit; I told him I couldn\u2019t go on and improve the place as was necessary, and to pay out my money to do it, without better security; he said then he would deed me half; X told him I could not leave my business with 150 acres improved land of my own, and come back here and try to make a living off 20 acres of improved land; I told him if I had anything to do with it at all, I wanted to have control of the whole; he said he would give me a deed of the whole, but he wanted to keep the personal property; 1 told him I could not afford to work and raise grain to keep cattle, hogs and hens, and whenever there was a pound of butter to sell, it was his, and he was to have the money; he said then he would give me the use of the personal property; I told him I wanted something to show that in case he should be taken away, George couldn\u2019t sue me for the use of the personal property; said he would fix it so he couldn\u2019t; I told him then I would buy the farm, and pay the $1,000 mortgage, and give George whatever he wanted him to have, and would take the personal property towards my loss and expenses getting here, and give him his support; lie did not say what he wanted George to have ; I came down to Syracuse once before the writings were drawn; about a week before ths first deed was drawn; I went to the office of A. G. S. Allis, and had a talk with him, and thence to Mr. Raynor\u2019s; father talked with Raynor\u2014how he thought of giving me a deed of the farm; Raynor asked why he did not divide it equally between the two ; he said George had lived there quite a number of years, and had things as he needed; had his stock kept there, and fire-wood, and had received $300 in that way; said George left home under age, and had always been saucy and ugly, and wouldn\u2019t help him after he left home, and that he never meant that he should have half of it; he said X had staid at home and helped to improve the farm, and had been the means of making it what it was, and he always calculated I should have the most; and if mother died first, he calculated to live with me, and he wanted to fix it so he could do it; Raynor advised him to lease it to \u2022me ; <em>father thought not; </em>nothing said then about the amount George was to have; we came down within a week, him and me, alone; nothing said in the interval about George\u2019s amount; that was on the way down the second time: I asked father h'ow much he proposed to give George; he said $2,000; I told him he had always talked about giving him $1,000 ; he said he thought that was not enough; I told him I would rather he\u2019d pay me something for my trouble and expense getting down here, and he should give me $1,500 for my portion, and give George the rest, and let him take care of him; he said it wopld be poor support he\u2019d get at his ban Is; if he had it, he\u2019d not keep it-two years, and then he\u2019d be out of house and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>home; said he wanted I should have it; I told him I would take it then, if he wanted I should; he explained about the $2,000; said he thought George had had $300, and he held two notes of about $200 against him, and he\u2019d give them up to George, and that would make $500; I assented to it, and we came to Raynor's, and the first deed was drawn ; we <em>stated the </em>substance of our talk to Raynor, and he drew the deed; we had not time to get up the mortgage and bill of sale; we were to come down the next fair day ; I heard of the first deed being destroyed; asked father why he did it; he said George told him I could take advantage of it\u2014by getting it recorded before I executed the mortgage; I said: \u201cYou must be foolish to think I would take advantage of you\u201d; soon after, he said he wanted me to come down before George had a chance to serve an order to show cause on him why a guardian should not be appointed for him; I had been informed of that; I told father I didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with it; had rather give $300 than to have anything more to do with it; that is, in a settlement, I would rather take $300 less than my actual damage; I refused to pay anything towards making the second papers; he said he would dock George $100 for his rascality in getting him to destroy the first deed; I told him, since George had acted so mean, I would not give up my interest in a note he had of mother\u2019s; he gave directions to Raynor to draw the papers; he asked what Raynor was to charge; he said $20; I advanced the money; Raynor asked what the personal property consisted of; I told him; hens were spoken of, father said he wanted the hens to keep them for himself; Raynor read the bill of sale to father; can\u2019t say that Raynor explained it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-5\">Q.

</em>don\u2019t remember the reply; he. only spoke of keeping the liens; he said he wanted I should have the use of the personal property, and wanted me to be secure; <em>father had </em>$600 <em>in bank; </em>I heard of father\u2019s complaint about the bill of sale, from neighbors; he said to me he did not feel satisfied with it; I told him it gave me the control of the personal property; it gave me the power to hold it; he spoke about wanting it back; I told him I didn\u2019t want to give it up; can\u2019t say what reply he made; after suit was commenced, he wanted me to come with him to Fuller\u2019s office and have the suit stopped; he said I could blame George for it; he said he was entirely influenced, by him; that he did not want to sue me; he told Fuller he wanted to stop it; Fuller told him when costs were paid he would stop the suit; he told Fuller, George Was the one who used the undue influence, instead of me ; he told Fuller he had nob the money then, but would come in in a week and pay it; X sold wheat and gave him the money\u2014$45; he told me Fuller charged too much, and he wouldn\u2019t pay it; he argued with Fuller to take less, and he wouldn\u2019t; I talked with the woman I married in Rochester; brought my wife home in January \u2014the 7th, and have been keeping house ever since; father lived with us; I was 21 years of age in 1849; I did not hire out to father; I staid and worked six years before going away 5 I had not the management of the farm; father used to manage; used to buy and sell such property as necessary; <em>I received pay for that six yeavi labor; </em>I was paid $120 in money by Armstrong &amp; Hudson; I had sold them a colt; and took their note; they paid that note to me, and I took a note of the old gentleman of $980, to run ten years, at simple interest; that was $1,100 paid for the six years; I gave the note up to father, and gob a mortgage of $1,068 to run eight years, at simple interest; did not reguest father to make a disposition of his property ; used no threats to get the mortgage; the contract under which I worked was the only authority I ever had; during the five years I did not exercise control, but worked subject-to father\u2019s advice and counsel; I sold the grain; I kept all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>money received from the sale of produce until the end of the year; the settlement \u25a0was with father and mother together; after the first year I had no settlement until the end of the contract; during the last four years I paid no money to father or mother; I bought father\u2019s clothes\u2014such as was necessary; he never aslced for money and I refused; never struck my father; I offered them to set some price for George\u2019s portion, and I would pay him the money, and they might take their choice of houses, and I would live in the other; it was my idea then for them to give me a deed of the whole farm; mother did not want to do so; wanted me to stay on by the month, and offered me $300 a year; nothing was said about a deed in July; I was here in July\u2014one week and one day; father said in July, if X would come back he would fix it so that I would lose nothing; I came back on uncertainties; father had not drawn writings to the effect that I should have control; nothing was said as to what those writings should be ; there has always been a strong enmity between George and myself, from childhood; my object was to make some arrangement by which George should be put off the farm altogether, if 1 was to stay there, for I wouldn\u2019t live near him; <em>I told father that George had always said he would break a will if he made one ; that was one of the reasons I would not work under a will; </em>father proposed to deed me one third, George one third, and keep one .third himself; that was not mentioned at Baynor\u2019s office; it was in July father told me he wanted me to oust George; we both talked in Baynor\u2019s office; Baynor advised him to make some other disposition of his property; the old gentleman said he didn't agree with Baynor; don\u2019t recollect that father said Willie would not- be satisfied with any other arrangement; myself and father came to the office of Fuller to settle and stop the suit; I told father I would take six hundred dollars and give up the whole concern; don\u2019t recollect what Fuller said about the $600; father told me he thought $600 too much; I said that was less than I ought to have ; father agreed finally to give me $600; three months afterwards, I asked him a thousand dollars; some of the provisions are there yet; I did not tell father 1 would not sign the mortgage until I got the $600; father was to sign the bill of sale about sundown; we remained at Baynor\u2019s office while the deed, mortgage, and bill of sale, were being drawn; father did not propose afterwards to sell off any stock; father never told me that he should hang on to the personal property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\"><em>Suspended, to call </em>ELIZABETH WOLF, <em>sworn for defendant, says :</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-6\">I took care of old Mr Brand from the 10th July\u2014after his wife\u2019s death;

I would judge that his mind was weak and vacillating since his wife died; William told me the reason he got the power of attorney, was that he wanted to be boss\u2014make bargains, and manage things himself;

I have noticed this trembling for two years; I think it grows worse on him; I think William\u2019s influence over the old man has been greater sin\u00e9e the old lady died, than before; think his influence greater, because he expects to depend more on Willie; Willie told me he tried to make a bargain with reference to the property before he went west, and wouid have staid if he had succeeded; this was two years ago this spring; he said he wanted to get the farm someway into his possession; think he said he wanted to buy it; he said he thought he could make a trade with the old gentleman, but he couldn\u2019t with the old lady; Willie said that he wanted to get rid of George; George was then living in the house where he now does;

He had three children by his wife: John, George and William. John died nearly twenty years ago, while the plaintiff resided upon his farm in Geddes, leaving George and William (the defendant), who are now living. George is about forty years of age, and William about two years his junior. George has a wife and several children, and lives on a small lot of ground, parcel of the premises in question, in a house built thereon by him with the assent of his father. William remained at home and worked on the farm for his father, about six years after he became of age, and then left home and went to Michigan. He was allowed wages for this service. After remaining away about three years, he returned to hts father\u2019s and worked for him by the month or year, six yeai s, under a written agreement as to wages, and containing a stipulation that he should have the management and control of his father\u2019s business, and the sale of the products of the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"240\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-14\">The $1,000 mortgage above mentioned, was given to Irving Brand, to secure William for the balance which his father owed him for wages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"241\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>William after hia six years had expired, went to Wisconsin and purchased a farm and put on some stock, and was in possession carrying on his farm in Wisconsin in June, 1867, when his mother died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"242\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">While William was absent from home, George worked his father's farfn, generally upon shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"243\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">After the death of the plaintiff's wife, the plaintiff requested William to come and live with him, he at the time being dissatisfied with George, and complaining of the manner in which he conducted the farm and disposed of the produce. The plaintiff was also unfriendly to Geoige\u2019s family, and especially to George's wife, \u2022 and refused to accept from her, services necessary to make him comfortable, but resorted elsewhere for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"244\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">William lele Wisconsin in July, after his mother's death, and made a visit to his father, and while there agreed with his father to break up his business in Wisconsin and come and live with him, and among other things it was understood that William should get married, for reasons which were stated, as a necessary part of the family arrangement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"245\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">It was proved to my entire satisfaction, that William refused to come and live with and take care of his'father, unless he should be allowed to take the entire possession and control of the farm, and George be required, to move off. The brothers were not on friendly terms, and William refused to enter into any arrangement, except upon this condition: that George should be required to leave the premises ; but no particular arrangement was entered into until William returned in November following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"246\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-9\">After various and repeated attempts to make a satisfactory family arrangement between William and his father, they went to the office of Raynor &amp; Vann, attorneys and counsellors at law, in the city of Syracuse, on the 22d day of January, 1868, and after counseling Mr. Raynor, the parties ordered writings to be drawn, setting forth the terms of their agreement. A conveyance was drawn, conveying to William the premises in question, was signed and executed by his father. A mortgage was also drawn up for William to execute to his father, conditioned for the performance of the agreements on the part of William.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"247\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-10\">The conveyance was made expressly subject to the agreement, and was in the following form:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"248\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-11\">41 Subject to the payment of a mortgage on said land of $1,000 and interest, to Irving Brand, which said party of the second part is to pay, and also subject to the payment of $1,500 to George S.

The party of the first part hereby reserving the crop of wheat now growing on said farm, and the right to harvest the same, and also the house now occupied by George S. Brand, and the right of said George to remove the same in one year from this date.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"249\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-12\">It does not satisfactorily appear what particular arrangement the parties had come tp in respect to the personal property of the plaintiff. That consisted, among other things, of two horses, wagon, four cows, pigs and farming utensils and household property. The horses, wagon, cows and farming utensils were of the value of about $500. He bad also money in bank amounting to about $600, besides other property hereinafter mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"250\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-13\">William insisted on having a bill of sale of the horses, wagon, cows, pigs and farming utensils, before he would execute a mortgage to secure the performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the covenants before-mentioned. His father proposed to give William the use of them, but was unwilling to transfer them to William. William said that George would sue him for this property, or for the use of it, after his father\u2019s death, if he did not have a bill of sale; and insisted on having a bill of sale to keep George from suing him for it after his father\u2019s death. Before the arrangement could be completed the parties left and went home. It does not appear that this matter of the personal property was disposed of definitely until the parties met again at Raynor &amp; Vann's office, on the -39th day of January, 1868, to execute new papers,, the plaintiff having destroyed the first deed in the mean time, under the circumstances hereinafter stated. When they met there again, the plaintiff blamed George for breaking up the prior conveyance, and proposed to reduce the amount to be paid to him for his portion of the estate from $1,500 to $1,400. This was accordingly done, and new papers executed, the plaintiff executing to William a conveyance of his farm, with the reservations, and agreed to the conditions, before mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"251\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">The question then arose as to the personal property, and while the plaintiff was desirous to retain that, the defendant, William, insisted upon a bill of sale before he would execute the mortgage to secure the performance of the covenants and conditions specified in the deed of conveyance. Thereupon the plaintiff signed the bill of Bale, conveying to the defendant, William, the horses, cows, pigs, wagon and farming utensils, and then the defendant, William, executed his mortgage on the premisses, to the plaintiff, conditioned as follows: \u201cTo pay to the party of the second part, or his certain attorney, heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, the sum of fourteen hundred dollars, in one year from the death of the said party of the second part, and also subject to the support and maintenance of the party of the second part during his natural life, in a comfortable and suitable manner, or fur the payment to the said party of the second part of $225 in quarterly payments, from January 1, 1868, during the natural life of the said party of the second part, which said sums and conditions herein named, the said William G. Brand hereby covenants to pay and perform, and when paid thus and so peformed, then these presents shall cease and be void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"252\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">This concluded the arrangement, and the parties having duly executed the papers left the office and went back together, and still live together on the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"253\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">There is some evidence tending to show that the plaintiff did not fully comprehend the force and effect of the bill of sale,\u2014supposing that the only real agreement was to prevent George from calling William to account for the personal property, after his death, and leaving him otherwise to treat it as his own,\u2014although lie must have known that it was understood that it was to he used by William and continued on the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"254\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-8\">In a few days after, the plaintiff proposed to sell one of the cows on his own account, and William then informed him that he had no cows to sell. Thereupon he complained that William had been too sharp for him, and after consulting George and others, was induced to bring this suit to rescind the transactions and be restored to his property, upon the grounds and for the reasons stated in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"255\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-9\">A good deal of evidence was given by both parties on the trial, as to the competency of the plaintiff to transact business, and as to the influence \"William had over his father, and the reasons which finally induced the plaintiff to make such an arrangement as he did. While I am satisfied upon the evidence that the plaintiff is a man of very inferior intellect, and liable to be imposed upon and deceived by those who transact business with him, I have come to the conclusion that he is not incapable for want of understanding, from making <em>valid </em>contracts. I have also come to the conclusion from the,evidence, that he is very wavering and unstable in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>his purposes, and jvhen he is with George, is easily persuaded by him to recant from his contracts, and more easily persuaded by William to do as he wants him to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"256\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-5\">After this suit was commenced, he expressed great doubts to on&amp; of his neighbors, whether it was not unadvisedly brought. He saict William was too sharp ; that he wanted.reserved a suitable piece of ground, so that if he got married he might have something for himself, and Willie objected; said he .did not really understand but that some of the personal property was to be reserved to him, and there was a paper lie did not really understand : said George and others advised him to break it up, but he had about made up his mind to let things remain as they were; said one was pulling him one way, and the other the other way, and he scarcely knew what to do. This expressed the true state of his mind and condition at the time of tne transaction, and clearly shows that he was easily led by his two sons, both of whom he was anxious to accommodate and conciliate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"257\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-6\">That William came to live with him with the expectation that he was to have a conveyance of the farm, and the entire control of the business of carrying it on, is proved to my entire satisfaction. There is also evidence in the case tending to prove that his father had expressed his intention of giving William the portion of his estate that would have descended to his eldest son John, in case the latter had survived him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"258\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-7\">After William returned in November, 1867. there was considerable negotiation between him and his father as to the terms of the family settlement. The plaintiff testified that it was not a great while before William asked for a deed of the farm; that he offered to hire him, or to let him have the farm on shares; hut William refused and exacted a deed of the whole; that he told William he was too sharp; then offered him a deed of one third, and to give George a deed of one third, and retain the other third for himself; but that did not suit him. William said he must have a deed of the whole, so as to root George off, and that he would not live by the side of him, and would not take any of the plaintiff\u2019s offers. The plaintiff also testified that George lived on the farm about thirty or forty rods off, and that he told George that William wanted a deed of the whole, but that he concluded to divide the farm between them. He further testified <em>that William told him </em>if he did not give him a deed of the whole, he would leave and he and George might get along together; that he told William he would like to have him stay, but he could not afford to give up all he had and go to the poor house. He further testified that William wanted the personal property, but be told William he would hold on to that; that he would give him the use of it; hut that William wanted a bill of sale to keep George from suing him after his father\u2019s death ; that William agreed to support him or pay $\u2018225 a year for his support and pay George for his portion, $1,600; that he named $2.000 as a proper allowance to George, or something more than $1,600; but William refused to give any more. He further testified that he preferred to make a will, but that William refused, and said many things to dissuade him, among others, stating that George would break it; also, that unless he hurried up the business, George would have him put under guardianship, and urged it upon him so persistently that finally lie was overpersuaded and did what William wanted of him. This is the substance of the alleged fraud and undue influence proved on the part of plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"259\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-8\">William, his son, testified in substance as follows:\u2014Worked for his father nntil 1857, and then went to Michigan. Returned in 1860, and worked five years longer under a written agreement, at $180 per year, besides board and washing, and by the terms of the agreement, he was to have the management of the business and the sale of the crops. After that, worked another year at $360. At the end of that time he went to Wisconsin and bought a farm of 160 acres, at $18 per acre, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>bought team and tools to carry it on. After his mother\u2019s death in June, 1867, his father sent for him, and he left his business in a disordered state and came to Geddes immediately; found his father sick at home alone, but a girl came there the next day to do the work, and that he was not married at the time. His father told him he wanted him to come back and take care of him, and he told his father in that case it would be necessary for him to be married, instead of depending upon a housekeeper, as no prudent woman would be willing to stay there and keep house for them, aud that he* offered to take his father back with him to Wisconsin; but his father was unwilling to leave the place he had worked so bard to improve; that he asked his father if he intended to keep George there; that his father told him he did not; that he had been bothered with George long enough, and could not stand it with him any longer. He told his father that if he got rid of George he would come back; that he had been in a fuss with George there long enough, and had gone a thousand miles to keep out of it; that his father told him he did not wish to go to law with George to get nd of him, but he would fix it so it could be done, and he wanted it done. He then told his father he would come back if he would fix it in that way, and his father told him as soon as he got out he would have it arranged. He told his lather he could not change his situation without great loss; that he had bought when things were high, and now the markets were very low.' His father told him he should lose nothing, and upon that arrangement he went hack to Wisconsin, sold his personal property, rented his farm and returned to his father\u2019s home in Geddes in the following November. Shortly after his return he asked his father if h\u00e9 had made out the writings as he talked of, and his father said he had not; that be asked his father what he was going to do about it, and his father replied that he wanted him to go on and pay up the thousand dollar mortgage, and after that he could have what he could make on the place; he told his father that would not answer his purposes; that he could not afford to spend his time there on uncertainties; that he wanted to have writings drawn, so that he would not bo working for somebody else; that his father proposed a will, and he told his father a will would be very uncertain, and he could alter it at any time he saw fit; that he could not go on and fix up the place, do what was absolutely necessary, and pay out his money to do it without some better security. His father then proposed to give him a deed of one half of the farm; but he told his father he could not afford to leave his business, with 150 acres of improved land of his own, and come back and undertake to make a living off of twenty acres of improved land, and if he had anything to do with the farm he wanted the whole of it. His father then said he would give him a deed of the whole, except the personal property. He then told his father he could not afford to work and raise grain to keep cattle and horses, and whenever there was a hog to sell, or a pound of butter, they would belong to somebody else, and somebody else would take the money. His father then told him he would give him the <em>use </em>of the personal property; but he told his father he wanted something to show in case he should be taken away, that George could not sue him for the <em>use </em>of the personal property; his father told him he would fix it so he could not. He then told his father he would take the farm; would buy it of him on these conditions, viz.:\u2014pay the thousand dollar mortgage; pay George whatever he said he wanted him to have, one year after his father\u2019s death, and take the personal property in consideration of his loss and expenses in selling out, and support his father as long as he lived, and be bound to support him; to which proposition his father gave his assent. No sum was fix\u2019ed upon at that time to give George. When they came to liaynor &amp;. Vann\u2019s office for advice, about a week before the writings were drawn, the sum to be paid to George was discussed between them. Hia father said he considered he had already paid or advanced George $300 ; said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>George had always been sancy and ugly to him, and he never meant to give him half of his property, while William had helped him improve the farm and make it valuable; and he had always calculated William should have the most, and that he calculated to live with William, and wished it fixed so he could live with him. That Raynor advised a lease, but liis father thought not. The amount to be settled upon George was not yet agreed upon. Before going back to Raynor &amp; Vann\u2019s office again, and during the intervening week, he asked his father what sum he proposed to give George, and his father said he thought about $2.000; that he then told his father he had always talked about giving him $1,000, and his father replied that he had reflected upon it since; that that would not be enough, and he ought to give him more. He then told his father that he bad better give him (William) something for his expense and trouble in coming down here, give him $1,500 for his portion of the estate, and let George have the rest and take care of him. His father said it would be poor support he would get at his (George\u2019s) hands, and said if he did it he would not keep it, and in two years he would be out of house and home, and said he wanted him (William) to have it. He then told his father he would take it if he rather have him do so, and his father said he thought George had already the value of $300; that he held two notes against him amounting to about $200; that would make $500, and he would give him up the notes. He (William) assented to this, and under this arrangement they went together to Raynor &amp; Vann\u2019s office to have the writings drawn, and the first deed was drawn, and signed as before stated. After the first deed was destroyed, his father watited him to go to Raynor\u2019s office, and make out the papers again before George had time to serve the papers to show cause why a guardian should, not be appointed, stating that lie had been informed that George was trying to do that. He told his father in reply that he did not want anything to do with it, and he had rather pay him or deduct from his damages in coming here, $300 than have anything to do with it. His father then told him he would dock George $100 for his interference in getting up the first deed, and that he then advised his father not to deliver up the notes to George.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"260\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-5\">William further testified that the matters were all talked over freely in the office of Raynor &amp; Vann and all the papers carefully read over to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"261\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-6\">In this respect he is fully sustained by Mr. Vann.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"262\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-7\">After this suit had been set down for trial, his father came to the office of his attorney in Syracuse to have the suit settled. William testifies that his father told him, he could blame George for it, for he never would have sued him if it had not been for George; that he did not want to sue and told George it would make a fuss; that his father then told his attorney that he wanted to stop the suit, and his attorney told him when the costs were paid he would discontinue it. The costs were fixed at $40, and his father told his attorney he haa not got the money to pay it. His father wanted William to sell some wheat and pay it, and he sold some and gave his father $45 to enable him to pay his lawyer. After that his father told him he had been to see his lawyer and he charged him too much and he would not pay it. This testimony is not contradicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"263\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-8\">There is also some evidence contradicting the statement of the defendant William, in relation to his father\u2019s urging him to come and take care of him as well as other material portions of his statements. The plaintiff told John Pry, one of his neighbors, that he would not let George have the farm any more, but let a stranger have it first. He complained to Arthur Rooney, another neighbor, that George and his family had abused him, and he was going to get rid of George another year, and get William there. He told Mrs. Pry, that he intended to get William back and stay as long as he lived. He told Mr. Remington, another of his neighbors, soon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>after the loss of his wife, that when he got William back, he was going to get George off from the place; found a good deal of fault with George and accused him ot taking property\u2014said be was saucy to him; said William had helped him clear off the farm\u2014had staid at home and worked and helped him pay for it; and told him at different times that he intended William to have John\u2019s portion. He told Mrs. Fry that he intended to get William back and have him stay with him as long as he lived. <em>*</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"264\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">I am satisfied upon the evidence that William was not guilty of any fraud in obtaining the deed of conveyance, although it is apparent that the plaintiff has but little power to resist the influence upon him of either of his sons in the absence of the other. This controversy is really between the two sons, and either of them seem to have sufficient influence over his father to command his acqniesence in whatever course he wishes to adopt towards the other, for the settlement and division of his estate. This suit is evidently undertaken at the instance of George, and is carried on for his benefit rather than for the benefit of his father. Although che plaintiff plainly sees that it is giving him a good deal of trouble and although ne knows that it eonnot- probably result to his benefit whatever the result may be; and although he would gladly settle it and be at peace, he has not sufficient mental energy and independence to put a stop to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"265\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">The evidence also satisfies me that the final settlement as evidenced by the papers was in a great measure brought about by the influence of the defendant William. The oid gentleman was anxious, above all things, to have his son,. William, return home and take care of him, and the fear of losing him was the controlir.g sentiment, which induced Him finally to yield to the exactions required of him, as a condition of his doing so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"266\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\">But I am not satisfied that William used, what in law is termed <em>undue influence </em>to bring about that result. His father yielded to arguments and persuasion, such as a weak old man would be likely to do, under the same or similar circumstances. He had an undoubted right to settle all his estate on one of his sons to the exclusion of the other. If he was not misled and over-reached by playing improperly upon his fears, or by concealing facts which\" it was necessary he should know in order to enable him to comprehend what he was about to do, the influence brought to bear upon him was not fraudulent, but only such influence, as a father has a right to yield to, in the disposition of lus property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"267\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-8\">The whole subject in all its bearings or details, was already pointed out and fully explained to him by Mr. Raynor, to whom he applied for assistance in making &gt;ut the papers. The papers were carefully prepared and read over to him. He knew what he was doing, and then chose to do it in the form in which it was finally agreed upon between the father and son. If we give to plaintiff sufficient intellect to do business and dispose of his estate, there are no grounds upu\u00ab which it can be maintained that the conveyance of his estate may not be permitted. It was not a new thing for him to consider, and he could not have been taken by surprise or over-reached by stvategem. The most that can be claimed is, that he yielded to the conditions imposed upon him by William, because he was anxious to have William remain with him and support him in his old age. He comprehended their nature and import, <em>and rather than have 'William leave him and go away </em>again, <em>he preferred to submit to his exactions.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"268\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-9\">If the conveyance should be avoided, there is no knowing what will happen to him next. If he is allowed to take his own course, without being excited to disaffection by others, it is almost certain that he would hereafter submit to still greater exactions, if necessary, <em>to procure William to take cha/rge of his </em>affairs, <em>and support him in his declining years.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"269\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>It is apparent to me that it will be for his interest and welfare to allow the settlement to stand; and the evidence satisfies me <em>that if he had been let </em>alone, he would have been as satisfied with what he had done as with any other arrangement which could have been made for his benefit. Notwithstanding this action, it seems be still remains with William, eats at his table, and is kindly treated, and his wants carefully provided for. The object of the suit is rather to benefit his son George, than because of any apprehension that he will not be well treated by William, If I could see any real benefit it would be to the plaintiff to set aside the settlement, I should try to find sufficient evidence to justify a decree setting it aside. But regarding his welfare as a paramount object, it does not appear to me that it would be advantageous to him to disturb the settlement. His real estate is worth probably $6,000. The personal property transferred to William may be valued at*$500. He had other personal property, which, together with the notes against George and his bank deposit amounted to $1,000, or thereabouts. William states without contradiction, that his father estimated that he had given or advanced George $300, and held his notes for about $200, which he intended to surrender, which would give George in the neighborhood of $1,900, as his portion of his father\u2019s estate. That it was not made $2,000, the sum first proposed by the old gentleman, was at his instance, for the reason that George had induced him, as he thought improperly, to destroy the first deed. Regarding the real estate as of the value of $6,000, it is charged in William\u2019s hands with the payment of an annuity of $225, the present value of which may he stated at $1,000, or nearly that sum. It is also charged with the payment of a mortgage of $1,000 which, with interest, amounted at the time to about the sum of $1,070.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"270\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-5\">Deducting these incumbrances and the remaining value may be stated in round numbers at $1,000. This would leave $2,000 to be equally divided between the brothers in case the old gentleman should desire to make them equal. Now of this sum his son George is secured the sum of $1,400, which is not to be regarded as a very unjust division, under the circumstances. As to the personal property the amount could not exceed probably much if anything over $1,500. Of this amount George\u2019s notes held by his father amounted to about $200, which were to be surrendered, according to the declared intention of the old gentleman, when he made the settlement; and to that must be added, I think, the sum of $300, which he stated he had already advanced to him. If William was to he allowed anything of consequence (as he thought, not unreasonably, he should be,) for his loss and trouble in breaking up his business in Wisconsin, and eoming to Geddee, to reside, the personal property transferred to him, cannot he regarded as an extravagant compensation. In this aspect of the case, George would secure nearly $2,000 of his fathers estate, and William $2,600 having that advantage only over his brother George. These seem to have been the views of William and his father pending the negotiation between them as to what would be a fair and equitable division of his property. There are strong reasons for believing that it was the settled intention of the plaintiff to give William the largest portion of his estate, especially if be returned home and took care of him during his life. The final arrangement is not so unequal or unreasonable as to induce the court to believe that it was unadvisedly made or that it would be for the interest of the plaintiff to have it set aside. The law is well settled that a man of very inferior intellect may make valid settlements of his estate. If these instruments have not been procured by fraudulent practices or concealments, they are not to be set aside because the person making them afterwards changes his mind. I do not find as a fact in this case, that the conveyance was obtained by fraud, or undue influence and I therefore hold as a matter of law, that the action cannot be sustained. A provision was made in the conveyance,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"271\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>allowing George one year to remove his buildings.

R., </em>595.</p>\n<p data-order=\"331\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-11\">\u201c The true principle, in reference to privileged communications between attorney and client, is, that where the attorney is <em>professionally employed, </em>any communication made to him by his client, with reference to the <em>object </em>or the <em>subject of </em>such employment, is under the seal of professional confidence, and is entitled to protection as a privileged communication.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"332\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u201cThis seal of professional confidence is not the seal of the attorney, but of the client, which the attorney is, <em>by law </em>as well as by <em>professional honor, </em>bound to keep intact; and it cannot be removed except by the consent of the client.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"333\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-5\">\u201c The seal which the law once fixes upon such commucations remains forever, unless removed by the party himself in whose favor it was there placed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"334\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-6\">The chancellor further holds, that the only exception to the doctrine as above stated, is where communications are made to an attorney to obtain professional advice or assistance as to the commission of a felony, or other crime which is <em>malum in se.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"335\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-7\">Even in cases where an attorney is employed by clients to assist them in a transaction which, from what was said in his presence, he must have known to be a fraud upon their creditors, the seal of professional confidence is, nevertheless, stamped upon their communication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"336\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-8\">However much more satisfactory it might be, that this privileged relation of attorney and client should exist only for honest purposes, and not to enable the client to perpetrate a fraud, or evade the lawrs, under advice of counsel, still the law appears to be settled otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"337\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-9\">\u201cThis protection extends to every communication which the client makes to his legal adviser, for the purpose of professional advice or aid, upon the subject of his rights or liabilities.\u201d (1 <em>Greenleaf\u2019s Ev., </em>271.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"338\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-10\">\u201c If the attorney was consulted merely as a <em>conveyancer, </em>to draw deeds of conveyance, the communications made to him in that capacity are within the rule of protection, even though he was employed as the mutual adviser and counsel of both parties.\u201d (1 <em>Greenleaf\u2019s Ev., </em>275.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"339\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-11\">The extent and sacredness of this privilege are ably commented on by the vice-chancellor, in <em>March </em>agt. <em>Ludlum, </em>3 <em>Sandf. Ch. R., </em>45, and numerous authorities cited. Also, in <em>Crosby </em>agt. <em>Berger, </em>(11 <em>Paige Ch.

Y., </em>330.) seems at first view, to hold a different doctrine; in which the learned Justice Selden, in his opinion, seems to go the length of suggesting that, since the Code, \u00a7 390, compelling a party to testify in his own suit at the instance of the adverse party, the reason of this rule is removed and the ne'cessity for its continuance terminated. The learned justice seems to have been alone on that point, though <em>four </em>others reached the same general conclusion, on other grounds, of reversal, and three were for affirmance. This case was first reported in 38 <em>Barb., </em>393. It came up on an appeal from a judgment entered at special term, under the direction of the justice, in favor of the plaintiff, in an action to set aside and cancel a bond and mortgage executed by the plaintiff to the defendant\u2019s testator, on the ground of usury,</p>\n<p data-order=\"341\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">The evidence of the attorney who drew the papers was admitted at special term, under objection. The general term, reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"342\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">An appeal was taken to the court of appeals, which reversed the judgment of both general and special terms, and granted a new trial in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"343\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-8\">This case is ably commented on in a note in a late edition of <em>Edwards' Chancery Reports, Stuyvesant </em>agt. <em>Pechham, </em>(3 <em>Edwards\u2019 Ch.

William returns in November, and finds his father quite smart. In July, sick.</p>\n<p data-order=\"352\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-9\">Now, the father rejects the void arrangement which William had pressed him into in July, when sick, and proposes other arrangements more equitable and just.</p>\n<p data-order=\"353\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-10\">William\u2019s version is given at <em>fol. </em>307, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"354\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-11\">His father\u2019s, at <em>fol. </em>187, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"355\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-12\">From the time of William\u2019s return in November, when the pretended July arrangements were rejected by the father, until the 29th of the following January, the day the last deed was given, <em>not a word was said between (these parties about this marriage </em>!\u2014and this, too, notwithstanding the fact that William took counsel about the property prior to the marriage, but <em>don\u2019t recollect </em>whether or not he was advised to <em>marry </em>before he took the deed, <em>(fol. </em>338).</p>\n<p data-order=\"356\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-13\">The referee aids me at this point, and virtually confirms my position, afterwards, in his report, where he says, at <em>fol. </em>66,\u2014\u201cBut no particular arrangement was entered into, until William returned in November following.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"357\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-14\">The evidence shows that none was entered into until nearly three months afterwards; and that, under immense pressure on the part of William upon his father.</p>\n<p data-order=\"358\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-15\">There is no evidence, therefore, to show that this marriage was a part of the arrangement as it was finally made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"359\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-16\"><em>(b.) </em>The second and third exceptions will be considered together as they necessitate the examination of substantially the same points in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"360\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>They are found at <em>fols. </em>147, 148, relating to <em>fols. </em>78 and 93 of the report.</p>\n<p data-order=\"361\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-5\">Here, I remark, the <em>entire evidence </em>in reference to the personal property goes to show,\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"362\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\"><em>1st. </em>That the plaintiff never intended to divest himself of his personal property, and did not suppose that, by giving the bill of sale, he was doing it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"363\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-7\"><em>2d. </em>That he did not know what a bill of sale meant\u2014 that it was not explained to him at the time he signed it; but that he supposed it to be, as William had told him, merely a paper to keep George from suing William for the <em>use </em>of the personal property after his, the plaintiff\u2019s death, \u2014having no effect to make the property William\u2019s.</p>\n<p data-order=\"364\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-8\"><em>3d. </em>That William\u2019s telling his father he wanted the bill of sale, so as to keep George off, was a mere deception on his part to get his father to do what he did not intend to do, and what, if he had known, he would not have done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"365\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-9\"><em>First. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s evidence is found at <em>fols. </em>212 to 216 inclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"366\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-10\"><em>Second. </em>The evidence of Geo.

It is distinguishable from fraud, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"386\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-8\">2. It implies a confidential relation between the parties, and also confidence given, and influence acquired by reason of such relation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"387\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-9\">Fraud, false pretense, deceit, &amp;c., are terms more appropriately employed to denote cheating among strangers, neighbors, or men in the business world.</p>\n<p data-order=\"388\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-10\">In proportion to men\u2019s estranged relationship, and social or business distance, is their <em>loatchfulness </em>over, and distrust of each other in all business transactions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"389\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-11\">In proportion to this Watchfulness and distrust,'is there less danger of fraud. If fraud be alleged in such cases, it should, for obvious reasons, <em>be established by clear and indisputable </em>proof\u2014it should not be inferred from slight circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"390\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-12\">This rule relaxes, and justly, as you pass from the more estranged relationships, to those of greater confidence and intimacy. These relationships are the more sacred, because they imply, not unfreqnently, the dependence of age and infirmity, upon the strength and manhood of a son,\u2014the confidence of a sister in a brother\u2019s friendly regard,\u2014of a patient-, in the advice and treatment of his physician,\u2014of a client in the counsels of his attorney,\u2014of a member of the Christian flock in the pastor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"391\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-13\"><em>Undue influence, </em>as I understand it, is the term applied where fraud and deceit are practiced by parties upon those who sustain some near and confidential relation to them. It is baser than fraud, because it adds to fraud, abused confidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"392\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-14\">It is meaner than deceit, because it adds to deceit, breach of faith and trust reposed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"393\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>It is more wicked than false pretense, because it adds to false pretense, hypocrisy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"394\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-5\">Being willing to perpetrate wrong, it adds thereto, treachery to friendship, treachery to duty and hostility to truth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"395\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-6\">It wins by villainous smiles, by practicing upon credulity, by awakening groundless fears, by promises to deceive, by threats to intimidate age and infirmity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"396\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad2\">The proof of <em>undue influence </em>is slight in proportion to the nearness and closeness of this relationship.</p>\n<p data-order=\"397\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-8\">Parties sustaining these relations shall not profit by treachery to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"398\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-9\">The rule is just and equitable, that <em>\u201c </em>where a grant is made by an aged father to his child with whom he lives, who has the management of his property, and in whom he reposes particular confidence, if a court of equity sees that any arts or stratagems, or any undue means, or the <em>hast specie </em>of imposition, or the least scintilla of fraud entered into the bargain, it will avoid the grant.\u201d (3 <em>Cow., </em>538.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"399\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-10\">How was undue influence exercised in this case by William, and shown, too, by uncontradicted evidence?</p>\n<p data-order=\"400\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-11\">3.

Why did he go straightway to George, and to Mr. Cowan, and to Mrs. Fry, and inquire what a bill of sale meant, and for the first time learn the deceit that had been practiced upon him? This conduct was either <em>knavish or foolish. </em>But William answers, at <em>fol. </em>310, which I quote:\u2014\u201cFather said, then, he would give me the <em>use </em>of the personal property; I told him I wanted something to show, that in case he should be taken away, George couldn\u2019t sue me for the use of the personal property ; said he would fix it so he couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"413\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-6\">Also, at <em>fol. </em>339\u2014\u201cIt was the understanding that I was to have the <em>use </em>of the personal property on acount of my expenses; that was fue idea of the bill of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"414\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-7\">Also, at <em>fol. </em>319, William swears that \u201c Raynor read the bill of sale to father,\u201d\u2014\u201c didn\u2019t explain it, and father was not told the effect of it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"415\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-8\">William was there; saw him sign, knew he was ignorant of what he was about, and yet, did not set him right, nor explain to him, until after the paper was signed and delivered, and the property secure in his own possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"416\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-9\">Did William really suppose that George could sue him for the use of that personal property after the old man\u2019s death ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"417\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>William knew better.

It discloses fraud and a fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"419\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">It brings the case within <em>Whelan </em>agt. <em>Whelan, </em>(3 <em>Cow., </em>537 <em>; See opinion p., </em>572;) <em>also, Brice </em>agt. Brice, (5 <em>Barb., </em>533 ;) <em>Voorhis </em>agt. <em>Voorhis, </em>(39 <em>N.

The nearest he comes to it is at <em>fol. </em>142\u2014\u201cIf these instruments have not been procured by fraudulent practices or concealments, they are not to be. set aside because the person making them afterwards changes his mind.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"422\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-9\">He then finds the conveyance all right, but leaves the bill of sale to \u201cpaddle its own canoe,\u201d without the bolster of a direct finding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"423\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-10\">But of this hereafter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"424\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-11\"><em>(f.) </em>The eighth exception is embraced in the twelfth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"425\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-12\">The ninth at <em>fol. </em>153, report 133, is well taken. There is no evidence to support it. The plaintiff offered to prove at <em>fol. </em>218, that he had been ill treated by William since he got his property, but the evidence was excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"426\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-13\">Such a finding of the referee, after excluding our evidence on that point, we submit, is erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"427\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-14\"><em>(g.) </em>The tenth exception, at <em>fol. </em>154, report 138, is well taken, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"428\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-15\">1. George is not a party to the mortgage alluded to. <em>(Fol. </em>197, <em>et seq.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"429\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-16\"><em>2. </em>The condition of the deed, <em>(fols. </em>32-3,) does not secure the payment to George.</p>\n<p data-order=\"430\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-17\">3. The mortgage, at best, is a second mortgage, the lien of which would be destroyed by a foreclosure of the $1,000 mortgage, which is past due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"431\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>4. When the father dies that mortgage belongs to his heirs and is half William\u2019s. Nothing short of an assignment to. George, would make it his property. There is no proof of such assignment; hence there was no security of $1,400 to'</p>\n<p data-order=\"432\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqW\">George; hence no foundation for this finding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"433\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\">5. The mortgage, as drawn, is an invalid instrument, and. void by the terms of it. <em>(Fol. </em>197).</p>\n<p data-order=\"434\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\">(h.) The twelfth exception, <em>(fol. </em>155, report 132,) it ap--, pears to me, embraces the most singular reason for denying to a plaintiff a conceded right, or refusing equitable relief, ever before alleged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"435\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-8\">I desire to call special attention to this part of the report.</p>\n<p data-order=\"436\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-9\">It seems to me that this report says substantially to the plaintiff: True, William has got your farm and personal, property without paying for it,\u2014taking it, of course, subject to your support and the incumbrances; true, he threatened to leave you and go far away, unless you gave, him the whole; true, be told you that George would abuse you, and harass you until he got your property, and then would squander it-; \"true, he did and said what he could .to stir up your dislike of George, and called you an old imbecile, not capable of acting or speaking for yourself, and: urged you to hurry up the papers before George should get-a guardian over you ; true, he rejected all your proposals, for a different arrangement, and called you hard names, because you were so slow in acceding to his wishes; true,, you stood out against his importunities from November until the 29th of the next January, until, as you say, you were overpowered, and yet you must have yielded to his bland persuasion and convincing arguments; true, you are stripped of your property by William in this way, and yet you had a right to yield; and I am not fully satisfied but that it was the best thing for you, after all; true, William urged this transaction rather too strong, perhaps, and sufficient evidence might be found to restore your property to. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>you, if it would be for your good, which I doubt; true, the property rightfully belongs to you ; but you must remember that you are a weak-minded, infirm, old man, and so powerfully under the influence of William, that, if your property should be restored to you, there is no knowing what will happen to you next; it .will be just like you to submit to still greater exactions next time, to keep William at home; and for that reason I think things had better remain just as they are; besides, it is better for William, too, for, although he has perpetrated a great wrong upon you this time, yet, if we take the property away from him and give it back to you, it will make him mad, and he may commit a greater wrong upon you\u2014he may get <em>everything </em>next time, owing to your weakness and vacillation, and give you still less in return; for this reason, among others, therefore, let William keep the property,\u2014and your prayer to the court be refused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"437\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-5\">The decision of this case, therefore, seems to have turned upon the question, whether the restoration of his property would be of any real benefit to the plaintiff. That question is not in the case. The plaintiff is in court asking for his equitable rights,\u2014for relief against his son\u2019s fraud. The referee intimates in his report, that there is sufficient evidence to justify a decree for relief, but refuses it on the ground that he can see no real benefit it would be to the plaintiff to grant it. That ground, I argue, is entirely irrelevant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"438\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-6\">The only issues in this case were\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"439\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\"><em>1st. </em>Did William procure that conveyance through th\u00e9 exercise of undue influence over his aged and infirm father?</p>\n<p data-order=\"440\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-8\"><em>2d. </em>Did the old man execute that bill of sale without knowing its meaning or effect\u2014supposing, from William\u2019s explanation, that it was only a paper to keep George off, &amp;c ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"441\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-9\">If the first, we were entitled to a reconveyance of the farm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"442\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>If the second, the bill of sale should have been adjudged void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"443\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-5\">If neither, the judgment is right; if either, it is wrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"444\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-6\">These two are the only issues in the case. It was not in issue whether it would be any real benefit to the plantiff to have his own property. The law says it would ; neither was it in issue what he might possibly ,do with it in the future, if it should be restored to him;\u2014neither was it in issue, whether William would not be more treacherous to his father in the future, than he had been in the past, if deprived of the fruits of his first treachery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"445\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-7\">These questions were not before the referee on this trial, and should not, I respectfully submit, have entered into, nor influenced in the least, his final determination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"446\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-8\">Cannot a man have his rights in a court of justice, because, forsooth, he may be so weak and vacillating in mind, or much under the influence of others, that he may lose them again ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"447\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-9\">Then let regular proceedings be had, and a guardian appointed to watch over his interests, and preserve them from harm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"448\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-10\">It may be said that the referee afterwards found as a fact in the case, that there was no fraud or undue influence. <em>(See fols. </em>123 and 142). The referee says:\u2014\u201cI do <em>not </em>find as a fact in this case, that the <em>conveyance </em>was obtained by fraud or undue influence; and I therefore hold, as a matter of law, that the action cannot be sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"449\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-11\">This relates to the conveyance of the farm only, as I understand it,\u2014not to the bill of sale, as to which the finding is wanting. (See next point.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"450\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-12\">But, notwithstanding this language of the referee at the close of his report, what I insist is, he was manifestly influenced .in this finding and determination, by the outside and irrelevant considerations before mentioned, which was error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"451\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-13\">Point III.\u2014Findings.\u2014(a) The first request to find is at <em>fol. </em>160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"452\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The ground covered by this request was considered in connection with the 6th and 7th exceptions; at least so far as I desire to speak upon it at present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"453\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-5\"><em>(b) </em>The second (at <em>fol. </em>167), embraces the well-known and equitable rule, that whoever is treacherous to the trust and .confidence reposed in him by one nearly related, shall not profit by his treachery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"454\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-6\">See authorities already cited : (3 <em>Cow., </em>537\u2014572; 5 <em>Barb. </em>533; 39 <em>N. Y., </em>463.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"455\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-7\">(c) The third request <em>(fol. </em>169), relates exclusively to the bill of sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"456\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-8\">The referee has virtually found as a fact in this case, <em>(fols. </em>71, 72, 78, .79, 93, 99, 109, 110,) that the old man signed that bill of sale without knowing what it meant, or understanding its effect; and yet he holds, as a conclusion of law, that this action cannot\"be sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"457\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-9\">The old man swears positively that he didn\u2019t know what a bill of sale meant; that he was misled by William about it, and his subsequent conduct shows conclusively that he tells the truth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"458\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-10\">Willliam admits that the idea of the bill off sale was, that it was only a paper to keep George off; and in the face of the testimony of both parties, the referee could not find as a fact, that the old man knew what he did when he gave that bill of sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"459\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-11\">Now, if he executed that bill of sale under a mistake, a court of equity will relieve him, and set it aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"460\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-12\">If William contributed to deceive him, it is utterly void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"461\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-13\">This action is certainly sustainable, therefore, as to the bill of sale. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"462\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-14\">There is no finding of fact relative to the bill of sale on which to base the referee\u2019s conclusion of law, that this action cannot be sustained, at least as to the personal property, the value of which is about $600.</p>\n<p data-order=\"463\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-15\"><em>(d) </em>The fourth request <em>(fol. </em>172), was substantially argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>with the 10th exception, except so far as it relates to the question of fraudulent intent on the part of William.</p>\n<p data-order=\"464\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-5\">Both mortgages cover only the north half of the farm. Why didn\u2019t William give the $1,400 mortgage on the south half, if he was acting in good faith, and intended to pay?</p>\n<p data-order=\"465\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-6\">He saw, as clearly as we see, that the holder of the $1,400 mortgage must take up the $1,000 mortgage, or have his own mortgage cut off by a foreclosure. By becoming the purchaser he gets rid of the second mortgage, and still keeps the farm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"466\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-7\">Point IY.\u2014The j udgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"467\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-8\">R Raynor, <em>counsel for defendants.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"468\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-9\">This purports to be a suit in equity, to set aside a deed of real estate and also a bill of sale of personal property, on the ground of fraud and undue influence; and also on the ground that the grantor was incapable oi fully understanding the nature and effect of such transfer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"469\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-10\">The plaintiff is seventy-five years of age, and has no wife or family. He is the father of the defendant, William Gf. Brand, and of George S. Brand, and these two are his only children and heirs-at-law. Another son, by the name of John, had died about twenty years ago, and was twenty-four years of age when he died. The plaintiff now wanted the comfort and quiet of a good home, and freedom from care; and these he very properly secured to himself, and at the same time executed a long-cherished purpose of making such disposition of his property as he believed to be equitable and just between these two sons, under all the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"470\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-11\">William had lived at home for several years after he was of age, and helped to work, clear up, pay for, and improve the farm; and was prudent, industrious, saving and faithful; while George was an indolent, wandering spendthrift\u2014left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>home two years before he was of age, and wandered around from place to place, without application, industry, prudence or faithfulness, to any thing or any body. Of these facts the plaintiff had become deeply impressed, and had often declared to his neighbors and others, that he should bestow upon William the portion of his property that would have belonged to John: and this, there can be no doubt, he aimed to do by making the conveyances in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"471\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-5\">And the conditions and reservations which the plaintiff imposed as the consideration for such transfers and conveyances, form a full, perfect and adequate consideration, for the property conveyed, as appears by the case, at <em>fols. </em>68 to 70. And it also shows that the plaintiff then intended to, and did, reserve property sufficient to give George the full amount he had so often expressed his intention to give him. All which goes to show that the plaintiff had a clear and full understanding of what he was doing, and that he. adopted the most judicious manner to do it; and we say, therefore, that the report of the referee was just and equitable, and that the same and the judgment entered thereon, should in all things'be affirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"472\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-6\">I. The judgment in this action ought to be affirmed, because</p>\n<p data-order=\"473\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-7\">1st. The referee has found, as a question of fact, that the plaintiff \u201c was not incapable, for want of understanding, from making valid contracts,\u201d <em>(fol. </em>9l\u00a3); and the evidence shows clearly that the papers were carefully read over to the plaintiff and that he said he understood the same, <em>(fols. </em>393 <em>and </em>399); and that the said plaintiff at that time appeared to be capable of doing business <em>(fol. </em>406|).</p>\n<p data-order=\"474\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-8\">H. This judgment ought to be affirmed for the further reason, that the referee has found as a question of fact, that said conveyance was not procured by fraud or undue influence. <em>(See fols. </em>124; 127-9; <em>and </em>142-3.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"475\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-9\">/TIT. The1 consideration paid by William for the premises was fully sufficient to uphold the transfer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"476\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>1st. He is to pay $1,400, by the terms of the mortgage which he gave back to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"477\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\">2d. He is to pay the mortgage given by plaintiff and his wife to Irving Brand, of $1,000 and interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"478\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-6\">3d. He is to support and maintain the plaintiff in a comfortable and proper manner, so long as the plaintiff lives, or give him $225 each and every year during his life, and then of course pay the expenses of his.funeral.</p>\n<p data-order=\"479\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-7\">4th. He is to give up the house occupied by George, and give George a year to take it off, and to occupy it until that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"480\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-8\">IV. The plaintiff reserves:</p>\n<p data-order=\"481\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-9\">1st. The wheat sown on the farm and the right to harvest it, and also the wheat in the granary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"482\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-10\">2d. All the household and kitchen furniture, beds, bed ding, and many other household articles and implements of husbandry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"483\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-11\">3d. $600 or $800 in bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"484\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-12\">4th. Several notes against George, and in addition to what George has had while William was absent from home in the western states.</p>\n<p data-order=\"485\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-13\">V. Then again at the urgent solicitation and request of the plaintiff, William made a heavy sacrifice of time and expense in coming from Wisconsin down here, to look after the welfare of his father; and upon the like urgent solicitation and request, is induced to leave his new home in Wisconsin, sell out as best he could, and finally accept the offer urged upon him by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"486\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-14\">These considerations ought to, and perhaps did, make the plaintiff to be more liberal than he otherwise would have been.</p>\n<p data-order=\"487\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-15\">VI. It is enough to uphold and sustain this judgment:</p>\n<p data-order=\"488\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-16\">1st. That the transaction was not brought about by fraud or undue influence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"489\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-18\">2d. That plaintiff had a perfect knowledge of what he was doing, and was capable of contracting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"490\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>3d. That the consideration was good and sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"491\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-5\">4th. That it was in accordance with his long-settled conviction of what was right and just for him to do, and of his often-repeated intention of giving defendant the portion John would have had had he lived.</p>\n<p data-order=\"492\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-6\">VII. The testimony of plaintiff is not entirely reliable. He swears he did not say he should give William John\u2019s portion, (fol. 229%): and several of the neighbors swear he did say so (see/ofs. 344, 365).</p>\n<p data-order=\"493\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-7\">Again he swears that William, over persuaded him, this the evidence shows is not true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"494\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-8\">William even refused to pay for making the papers the second time. He wanted to be relieved from the urgent importunities of his father, and be allowed to return to his quiet, prosperous, and attractive home in Wisconsin, and offered to take his father with him and to care for him. Then again plaintiff is made to swear that William said \u201che would not come near him if it were not for his property.\u201d This is shamefully untrue and cruel to William.</p>\n<p data-order=\"495\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-9\">VIII. All the evidence goes to show that George is the laggard, always behind, always contentious and even abusive to his father, and allowing his family to treat the old man with neglect, contempt, and ridicule; and he it is that is hanging around \u201c after the property.\u201d After living there on the farm without any charge fora great number of years, and being supported from his father\u2019s granary and crib, has not now the first thing to show as a trophy of industry or frugality; and up to the day of trial, borrowing money of his father to pay little debts with. We ask then again, is there anything strange or unreasonable in the disposition of his property by the plaintiff? The only evidence of \u201c undue influence\u201d is on the part of George. He procured the plaintiff to destroy the first deed, and the conviction of the plaintiff'was so strong of the justnessof what he had first done, that after a week or more of deliberation, he-did the same thing again, and did it a little stronger than the first time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"496\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Then unable to get him to refrain from it or undo it after the second time, George called in the aid of Mr. Fuller to commence this action; which plaintiff tried to have stopped.' and discontinued, and even ordered it to be done, <em>(fol. </em>322,)' and directed that his wheat be sold to pay the cost. Plain-, tiff declaring to his neighbors that he did not want the suit brought. <em>(Fol. </em>342.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"497\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-5\">IX. We submit, therefore, that the judgment in this action should be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"498\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b258-6\">Foster, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auo\">Appeal from a judgment rendered for the; defendants on the report of a referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The plaintiff is the father of the defendant, William G. Brand. On the 29th day of January, 1868, the plaintiff, who was then seventy-five years old, executed to his son, the defendant, a warrantee deed of his farm, containing about seventy-three acres, situated in the town of Geddes, in the county of Onondaga, of the value of from $6,000 to $7,000, the consideration for which was expressed in the deed1 to be the sum of $5,636.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">At the time the deed was executed, there was a mortgage on the north half of the farm, held by one Irving Brand, for $1,000 and nearly one year\u2019s interest thereon had then accumulated. And the deed executed by the plaintiff contained the recital that tlie conveyance was subject to the payment of that mortgage, which the said William G. Brand was to pay, <em>\u201c </em>and also subject to the payment of $1,400, said $1,400 to be paid to George S. Brand, one year after the death of the said Ira C. Brand, according to a mortgage given therefor, and also subject to the support and maintenance of the party of the first part, during his natural life, in a comfortable and suitable manner; or of the payment of the said party of the first part, each and every year of the sum of two hundred and twenty-five dollars, in equal quarterly payments from the 1st day of January, 1868, during his natural life.\u201d The deed also reserved to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>plaintiff the crop of wheat then growing on the premises, and the right to George S. Brand, (another son of the plaintiff,) to remove therefrom a house which he had erected thereon and in which he then lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The plaintiff at the same time executed to the defendant, a bill of sale of stock and farming utensils on the farm, of the value of from $500 to $600, and the defendant executed to the plaintiff a mortgage on the <em>north half of the farm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The consideration for which was expressed therein at the sum of $1,400, and was stamped with an internal revenue stamp of $1.50, and conditioned <em>\u201c </em>to pay, or cause to be paid to the party of the second part, or his certain attorney, heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, the sum of fourteen hundred dollars, in one year from the death of the said party of the second part, and also subject to the support and maintenance of the party of the second part, during his natural life, in a comfortable and suitable manner, or for the payment to the said party of the second part of $225, in quarterly payments from January 1st, 1868, during the natural life of the said party of the second part, which said sums and conditions herein named, the said William G. Brand hereby covenants to pay and perform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">No other obligation or security was given by William G. Brand to his father, and no pecuniary consideration was paid by him; and there was no legal indebtedness to him from the plaintiff existing, when the said conveyances were executed. Soon thereafter, the plaintiff tendered to William G. Brand, a satisfaction of the mortgage and demanded a re-conveyance of the farm and personal property, alleging that the deed and bill of sale had been obtained by the defendant by reason of fraud and undue influence on his part, but the defendant refused to accept such satisfaction of the mortgage and to re-convey the farm or personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">On the 13th of February, 1868; this action was commenced to set aside the conveyances. <em>t</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aqj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The cause was referred and was tried before a referee, and he subsequently found and reported as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Akf\">[Here the learned judge stated the report at length. <em>See p, 222, ante.]</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Judgment was entered upon the report of the referee, in favor of the defendants, and in accordance therewith ; and the plaintiff appealed. Several exceptions were taken on the trial by the counsel for the plaintiff, to the rulings of the referee, in admitting and rejecting testimony; for refusing to find several matters of fact and conclusions of law, as requested by the plaintiff; and to several of the conclusions of fact and of law, which were found and reported by him; so much of which, as well as such portions of testimony as are deemed material in the discussion of the case, will be adverted to in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Before proceeding to the discussion of the questions raised in this case, I propose to advert to the manner in which it has been prepared and argued by the counsel for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Any important departure of counsel from the line of professional duty, occurring in an oral argument, can be most properly noticed at the time when it takes place; but when, as in this case, the printed points and brief of counsel contain matter highly disrespectful to any member or officer of the court, and inconsistent with that courtesy, or at least civility, which should always be observed between the court and the bar, and more especially when the introduction of such matter is entirely uncalled for, and not warranted by any thing which has transpired ; and where the printed points properly form part of any report of the case; it is the duty of the court to express its views of it in such form that they, too, may become a part of such report. To do less than this might leave the impression, when offensive matter forms part of the report, that such unprofessional proceeding of counsel is countenanced by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">While it is the right of counsel to canvass freely and thoroughly, all the findings of fact and conclusions of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>either of a referee or judge, and to point out and expose all errors which they suppose have been committed on a trial, all this can be done without the least indecorum\u2014without giving offense to any one\u2014without any exhibition of ill temper or spleen\u2014and certainly, without evincing an intention to be personally disrespectful to the officer whose decisions are being reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The points of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel are subject to all these objections. The instances which they present are too numerous and extended to warrant the insertion of them here; but they leave no doubt that the counsel was not actuated solely by the desire to correct any errors which the referee had committed; and the tone and manner in which he argued the case, furnished additional evidence that he had other purposes to subserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">A referee\u2014especially when he is a justice of this court\u2014 can only be appointed by the united choice of both parties, and it is very unjust, as well as uncourteous and disrespectful, for the unsuccessful party to assail his motives, either by direct charge or insinuation, unless there is the most satisfactory evidence to sustain such imputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In this case there is not one circumstance showing, or tending to show, any partiality, bias, or leaning of the referee towards either party, and most clearly all that could be claimed is that he may have committed mistakes in his decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">We can no more countenance any wanton attack upon a referee who is not, than if he were, a member of the court. But it is of some consequence that the counsel, when he prepared his points, knew that the referee would be a member of the court to which they would be presented; and if the wrong towards the referee, as such, was no greater than though he had not been a member, the indecency of it was increased by thus thrusting in his face the insinuations which he had made against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The attack was the more inexcusable from the fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>which we have all observed, that up to the time when this cause was argued, the justice of the court who was the referee, had uniformly and always treated his assailant with much courtesy.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">It is objected, on the part of the plaintiff, that the referee erred in excluding the testimony offered by him, to show how the plaintiff was treated by the defendant, after the execution of the conveyance in question, while they were living together on the premises. I think that the referee was right; for while it seems to me, that the offer made was for the purpose of giving proof that the defendant did not treat the plaintiff well and did not conduct towards him as the fair performance of his duty under the deed and mortgage required of him, in the support and maintenance \u00a9f the plaintiff; yet the proposition offered was not so clear gad explicit as to require the referee, without further explanation, to admit the evidence. The offer, in terms, was: yThe plaintiff offers to show how he has been treated by #/iiliam since the deed was given.\u2019; It was not an offer to prove specific acts of abuse, or of the non-fulfillment of the <em>agreement </em>on the part of William, and I think was too general to require the referee to admit it in evidence; because, for aught that appeared, if the offer had been allowed the testimony when given, would not have tended to prove anything improper on the part of the defendants. And besides, if the plaintiff was competent to contract, and did contract with the defendant voluntarily and without any fraud of undue influence on his part, then, whether the defendant performed his contract or not, was immaterial to the issue; and if the defendant did not support him in the manner provided for, the plaintiff could and should have elected to either support himself, and require the payment to him of the $225 per year, or he should have brought his action to compel the defendant to furnish him with such comfortable support and maintenence as the deed and mortgage called for.</p>\n<p id=\"A1A\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>That offer and rejection of it has, however, some bearing upon one of the findings of fact, that <em>\u201cIt seems he still remains with William, eats at his table, and is hindly treated by him, and his wants carefully provided for.\u201d </em>I do not find any evidence tending to show that the defendant treated the plaintiff kindly, or that he carefully provided for his wants, except the mere fact that the plaintiff continued to live with William; and that, I think, did not warrant the assumption that he was kindly treated or carefully provided for. In one sense, the plaintiff ate at the defendant\u2019s table, in that the defendant,, under the deed, owned the house, but there is no evidence that the defendant supported him there; while, on the contrary, the testimony shows that, even down to the time of the trial, not only the plaintiff, but the defendant and his wife and family, used mainly the products of the farm for the year previous (which belonged to the plaintiff,) for thqir sustenance; and the proof also shows that the household furniture on the place still belonged to the plaintiff. Now, if it was immaterial to show, as I have stated, that the defendant did not perform his agreement, it was equally immaterial that he did perform it. And whether material or not, that assumption could only be based upon proof. I find no proof to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">It is clear from the whole case, as presented by the report, that the referee considered the question of competency on the part of the plaintiff, and of fraud or undue influence on the part of the defendant, as a close one; and we must take it for granted that he took the facts so assumed and found by him into the account in arriving at the conclusion not to set the deed and bill of sale aside; in that I think, he erred\u2014first, in assuming the fact without evidence, and second, in giving it any weight in the detertimation of the issue, upon the questions of competency and of fraud or undue influence in obtaining the conveyances.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">It is also claimed, on the part of the plaintiff, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>referee erred in admitting the testimony of Mr. Vann against him, on the ground that Vann was one of the counsel for the plaintiff, and could not be allowed to testify to conversations which <em>he </em>had with the witness, or with his copartner, Raynor, when consulting them as counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">There were three interviews between the plaintiff and defendant with Raynor &amp; Vann, the first being a few days previous to the execution of the former deed which was afterwards destroyed without being delivered to the defendant, at which time they were acting as counsel for the plaintiff. The second being at the time, when that deed was drafted and signed, and the third at the time, when the papers in question were executed, at which time they were acting for both parties, for Vann testifies, <em>\u201c </em>at the second and third times both received counsel with reference to the conveyances of the property.\u201d I have no doubt that the law in regard to prohibiting an attorney, or counsel of a party from testifying to the statements of his client against his consent, is the same now as it was before the Code made parties competent witnesses for or against themselves. And although Selden, J., in his opinion in the case of <em>Whiting </em>agt. Barney, (30 <em>N. Y., </em>330.) comes to the conclusion, that the rule is changed, the case in which that opinion was delivered, I think does not declare any such rule; each of the four judges who concurred with him in a reversal of the judgment of the supreme court, did so on the ground that the communication was made to the counsel, in the presence of the adverse party, and that therefore it was not confidential. The decision of the case, therefore, was made, irrespective of the provisions of the Code, and in conformity with the pre-existing rule, that to be privileged the communication must have been confidential. It was questioned for some time whether the clerk of the attorney or counsel of a party, might not be allowed to testify to communications of the party made to his counsel in the presence of the clerk, on the ground that, being made in the presence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>hearing of the clerk, it was not confidential, but it was decided that it <em>was </em>confidential and was privileged. And in that respect also, I have no doubt that the rule is the same now. I think it is a mistake to suppose that such communications were privileged, for the reason that before the Code, parties could not be made witnesses for or against each other, and indeed in courts of equity, the plaintiff could then require a defendant to answer his complaint or bill under oath; and such answer so far as it confessed the allegation of the bill, was conclusive evidence, against the defendant, and so far as it denied such allegations, it was evidence for the defendant, and it required the plaintiff to prove the- contrary, by \u00a1\u00a1more than the testimony of one witness, in order to overthrow the allegations of the answer. And yet, the communications to counsel'made by a person who was subsequently made defendant in a court of equity, were privileged to the same extent as if the action was pending in a common law court, and the counsel was not allowed to testify to such communications. <em>(March </em>agt. <em>Ludlam, </em>3 <em>Sand. Ch. R., </em>45; <em>Crosby </em>agt. <em>Berger, </em>11 <em>Paige, 377, and cases there cited.) </em>I think the enactment of section 390 of the Code, does not furnish any reason for changing the rule of evidence. In the first place, it is not to be taken as changing the rules of law or evidence, any further than is manifest from what it says. It allows either party to call the other, or to offer himself as a witness. This merely extends to either party a right not before enjoyed. And why should such additional right, clearly defined by the Code, be construed to give him the still further one, of reaching by means of other witnesses, confidential communications made to them, which by the general rules of evidence, in courts of law and equity, were privileged. It is true that the party can at least, partially defend himself from the effects of such evidence, by offering himself to contradict or explain it. 1 do not think, however, that he should be compelled to do so, for it is enough for the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>party, that the Code has given him the right' to call his adversary as a witness, and to compel him to testify to any matter or <em>thing </em>that may be deemed material to the issue. I think also, that the recent amendment allowing husband and wife to be witnesses for or against each other, except in certain cases, contains a provision which shows that the legislature has not intended to change the law, as Judge Seldeb seemed to suppose; for in that amendment they inserted a clause to exempt either of them from disclosing confidential communications; and no good reason, I think, can be given why such communications should still remain privileged any more than such as are made to counsel. And again, if communications to counsel are not privileged, and they are competent evidence against the party making them, then in an action after his death, between his personal representatives and another party, they would still be competent, for it is only the party to the action who, in such case is prohibited from testifying to what has occurred between him and the deceased party, while disinterested witnesses are allowed to testify to the acts or declarations of a deceased party, the same as though he were living and party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">I have examined this question further than I should have done, because I am not willing to concede, that the Code has in the least, changed this rule of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">It must be conceded, however, on the authority of that case (and such was clearly the law before that,) that communications to counsel, made in the presence of the adverse party are not privileged ; and of course, Vann was a competent witness to testify to what took place on the second and third interviews had with the plaintiff and defendant; for so far as appears from the case, the defendant was present all the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Such, however, was not the case in regard to the first interview; for Mr. Vann testifies that William was not present all the time at that interview, while the com <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>munications of the plaintiff were being made to Mr. Raynor, and he was allowed against objection and exception to testify, as well to what the plaintiff said while the defendant was absent, as what he said while he was present. In this I think the referee erred\u2014communications made to one\u2019s counsel as a conveyancer are privileged. <em>(Greenleafs </em>Evidence, \u00a7 241; <em>Cromach </em>agt. <em>Heathcourt, </em>2 <em>Brod. &amp; Bing., </em>4; <em>Wilson </em>agt. <em>Troup, </em>7 <em>J. C. R., </em>25.) And a large share of the testimony of Vann consisted of what was said by the plaintiff in that first interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">It is insisted on the part of the plaintiff that the referee erred in admitting Vann to testify, that in his opinion, the plaintiff was competent to contract when he executed the deed and bill of sale; Vann, though not an expert, was the subscribing witness to the deed, and is within the same principle which allows the subscribing witness to a last will and testament, to give his opinion of the sanity of the testator. <em>(Dewitt </em>agt. Bailey, 9 <em>N. Y., </em>371.) And it does not necessarily follow, as is claimed for the plaintiff, that the question put by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to his witness, Greorge Greddes, was improperly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">That question was, <em>\u201c </em>where any fear of difficulty might threaten him or his property, would he in your judgment, be easily persuaded to do any act, dictated by any person he considered a friend ?\u201d Mr. Greddes was not in the proper sense of the word an expert; though he was a man of high character, and actually well qualified to judge, from the continued actions of one with whom he was acquainted, of his sanity, as well as of his competency to\u2019transact business;. but still he was not competent unless he became so in view of the acts and conduct of the plaintiff which he had witnessed as he had testified. And as to this, it depends entirely upon the question, whether after stating the acts and conduct of the plaintiff, and of his family in regard to his business matters, such statements rendered him competent, in connection therewith to express his opinion. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>yet one acquainted with him, who should hear his statements of the acts and conduct, and character of the plaintiff, would hardly doubt, that in fact he was more competent to express an opinion of the usual mental strength and capacity of the plaintiff than Mr. Vann was to express an opinion of his condition when the conveyances were executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In <em>Culver </em>agt. <em>Haslam, </em>(7 <em>Barb., </em>314,) the court held that \u201con a question as to the mental capacity of the grantor of a deed, the opinion of an intimate acquaintance, not a medical man, as to the condition of the grantor\u2019s mind is competent, when connected with facts and circumstances within his knowledge, and disclosed by him in his testimony, as the foundation of his opinion.\u201d And it was held that the value and force of the opinion depend on the general intelligence of the witness; the grounds on which it is based; the opportunities he has had for accurate or full observation, and his entire freedom from interest or bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In <em>Jackson </em>agt. <em>King, </em>(4 <em>Cow., </em>218,) it will be seen that such evidence was received from several witnesses, and while the court did not question' its \"competency, it held that the facts proved by the witnesses, did not support the opinion which they expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In <em>Stewart </em>agt. <em>Lispenard, </em>(26 <em>Wend.., </em>309,) it will be found that the same kind of testimony in regard to the mental capacity of the testatrix was received, and was considered competent by the court for the correction of errors, and in the opinion of the court it is said, \u201cmere opinions of witnesses\u201d says Judge Washington, \u201cas to mental capacity are entitled to little or no regard unless supported by good reasons founded on facts which warrant them.\u201d To this as a general rule, the opinions of medical men may be considered as an exception, (3 <em>Wash. C. C., </em>587,) and great stress was laid upon such opinions, based as they were, on the facts stated by the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">In <em>Dewitt </em>agt. <em>Bailey, </em>(13 <em>Barb., </em>550,) the plaintiff was permitted to take the opinions of witnesses, as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>grantor\u2019s capacity, founded upon the facts disclosed by them upon the trial, and the court held them to be competent. The case was appealed to the court of appeals, (9 N. <em>Y., </em>371,) and it appears from the report of the case that the precise question on which the case turned was that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was allowed \u201cto ask the witness whether from what he had seen, and the facts within his knowledge, the old man had capacity to comprehend and transact business?\u201d and the witness answered, \u201cthat he had not such capacity.\u201d The court of appeals reversed the decision of the supreme court, and granted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The cause was re-tried and again on appeal came before the court of appeals, (17 N. <em>Y., </em>340,) and it appears from the report, that the same questions on which the case had been previously determined, were not propounded to the witness, but after testifying to the facts within their knowledge, they were asked various questions, calling for their opinions of the degree of his mental imbecility; and the court of appeals held such testimony to be proper, and unanimously limited the former decision of that court \u201cas authoritative only for the doctrine that upon a trial involving the mental imbecility of a testator or grantor, a non-professional witness cannot be asked the broad question whether he considered the party <em>non compos </em>mentis, or, vt hich is the same thing, incapable of managing his affairs.\u201d And in the opinion of the court on page 348, it will be seen that the doctrine that non-professional witnesses, after having stated facts within their own knowledge, may be allowed to give their opinion of the degree of mental imbecility of a grantor or testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In the case of <em>Whelan </em>agt. <em>Whelan, </em>(3 <em>Cow., </em>550,) it appears that testimony was received, that \u201c the appellant was a man credulous- and easily persuaded to anything by those he supposed his friends; and he might be persuaded to do any act dictated to him, when any fear of difficulty might threaten him or his property.\u201d It does not appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>that this testimony was objected to, but it does appear <em>(pp. </em>572 <em>&amp; </em>586,) that the court for the correction of errors laid much stress upon it, saying \u201c it is in proof that the appellant was very credulous and easily persuaded by those whom he believed his friends; that he was easily led by William; that the appellant could be persuaded to do any act dictated to him, when apprehensive that his property was in danger.\u201d I think, upon the whole, that the opinion of Mr. Geddes should have been received and such weight given to it, as the referee should think, under all the circumstances of the case, it was entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">And I may as well add here, for it bears strongly on the next question to be discussed, that the court, at page 572, laid down the rule, and which is applicable to the case before us: \u201cThat a contract obtained from one party so much in the power of the other, cannot be maintained if confidence has been abused, if there is inadequacy of price, or the inference is plain that advantage has been taken of age and imbecility, and the partiality of a parent has been artfully made use of to strip him of his property and reduce Mm to a state of dependence and want.\u201d The proof shows that the plaintiff.had no property besides that conveyed to the defendant, except some $500 or $600 deposited in a savings bank; toe small amount of household furniture, being in the house on the premises in question; a small amount of the products of the farm for the previous year; and the wheat then growing thereon, which had been sown in the autumn preceding the execution of the deed. His habits had, some years previous, been very bad, and had affected his mind, and for many years previous to the time in question, his business affairs had been mainly managed by his wife or his 'son, the defendant. And his wife died in the summer of 1867. He had two children, being the defendant, and his son George, who had a wife and four children, and was in very moderate circumstances, his property amounting to not more than $1,000, and that in all he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of about $200, for which he held his notes, and that he had let him have, in addition, from time to time, in one way and another, an amount not exceeding $300 <em>more; </em>and it very clearly appears that, as between the two sons, the defendant was the one most favored, and as against Greorge, had his own way with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">After the defendant became of age he worked for the plaintiff on the farm about six years; during which time he accumulated, from the wages to be paid to him besides his support, about the sum of $1,000; after which he went to Michigan, and remained about one year. He then returned to Onondaga county and rented the premises in question of the plaintiff, for one year, at the rent of $100. He then went again to Michigan; and afterwardsrreturned to Onondaga county in February, 1860; entered into an agreement in writing with the plaintiff, to work for him and manage the farm for him for five years, at the yearly compensation of $180 per year (with his board and washing), payable at the end of each and every year. That agreement was under the seal of the parties, and contained a provision as follows: \u201cThe said party of the second part\u201d (William Gr. Brand,) \u201cshall take and have the general and special management of the carrying on of said farm and the exclusive control of all the business belonging to, or in anywise appertaining to, the management, control and carrying on the said farm for said term. The cultivation thereof, as well as the sale and disposition of all produce, of every name and nature, raised or grown thereon during the said term. The buying and selling of any stock, or other personal property, which the said party of the second part may at any time deem proper. The said party of the second part shall, at the close of each and every year during said term, render unto the said party of the first part a true and faithful account of all moneys had and received by him, for or on account of any and all property so sold by him, and of all moneys paid out and ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>pended by him, for or on account of the said party of the first part or his family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">It was proved by the testimony of George S. Brand, that William, while at work under this contract, told him that he had a power of attorney to do as he was a mind to, to buy and sell and anything else he chose; and the witness further said: \u201cI asked him what that was for? and he said, father was not capable of doing business, and would go to the poor-house, if he did not have some one to manage the property for him.\u201d On the cross-examination the witness repeated the above statement, and also testified that William in speaking of the said contract, said: \u201che was going to have it so that he could be boss himself.\u201d No part of this testimony was contradicted by the defendant. William G. Brand, id his testimony in reference to this contract, said : \u201cThe contract under which I worked, was the only authority I ever had during the five years; I did not exercise control, but worked subject to father\u2019s advice and counsel; I sold the grain; I kept all the money received from the sale of pfoduce until the end of the year; the settlement was with father and mother together; after the first year, I had no settlement until the end of the contract; during the last four years I paid no <em>money to </em>father or mother; I bought father\u2019s clothes, such as was necessary; he never asked for money and I refused.\u201d In the year 1866, the defendant continued to work for the plaintiff for one year, at the price of $300 for his services. He then went west again, and remained there until in the fall before the conveyances in question were executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">It is not claimed that any pecuniary consideration entered into the making of the conveyances, except such as are specified in the recitals of the deeds, and in the conditions of the mortgage, except that the defendant claims that he was entitled to something for leaving his place in the west, and returning to live with his father. And he claims that it was intended by the plaintiff to secure his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>own support and maintenance, and to secure the residue of his estate for the benefit of the defendant and of George; and that it was intended by the plaintiff to give him a much larger amount than he meant to give George.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The testimony of Mr. Vann is, that it was the intention of the plaintiff to secure the portion coming to George to his children, and that is the reason alleged by him for not making the $1,400 mentioned in the mortgage, payable thereby to George. But the testimony of the defendant is that the share of George was to be secured to him, and such is the recital in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Now, nothing can be plainer than that by the conveyances m question, not one dollar was in any way <em>secured </em>either to George or to his children. If that matter had rested on the recitals of the deed alone, the defendant would have taken the estate charged, as between him and George, with an equitable lien thereon in favor of George. But it does not rest at all on such recitals, for in the first place, the recitals in the deed declare that the conveyance is \u201csubject to the payment of $1,400, said $1,400 to be paid to George S. Brand, one year after the death of the said- Ira C, Brand, <em>according to a mortgage given </em>therefor.\u201d And in the second place, the mortgage does not allude to George; but by its express terms the condition of the mortgage is, that \u201cthe said party of the first part, his heirs, executors and administrators, shall well and truly pay to the party of the second part, or his certain attorney, heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, the sum of $1,400, in one year from the death of the said party of the second part.\u201d So, too, the equitable lien which would have been created by the recital in the deed upon the whole farm, was limited, not only, as I have said, by the mortgage to the benefit of the personal representatives of the plaintiff, and not to George or his children, but the mortgage narrowed the lien and confined it to \"the premises- described in the mortgage alone, being <em>the north half </em>of the farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>only; thus releasing the south half entirely from such \u2022lien or claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">It is also claimed by the defendant, that a part of the portion of the estate which George was to receive, consisted of the aforesaid demands which the plaintiff held against him, being the notes for about $200, and the other advances of nearly $300, and yet no provision was made in this arrangement for giving up or canceling that debt, or any part of it; and the defendant testified that he \u201cadvise^ his father not to give up the said notes to George.\u201d In short, nothing was secured to George of any kind, by that arrangement, except to allow him to remove from the premises a dwelling which he had at his own expense, and with the consent' of his father, erected thereon.' ' And this arrangement was so managed with the plaintiff) who, the proof shows, could neither write or read writing, that while at least $3,600 was secured to the defendant, over and above all that was charged upon him either by the deed or the mortgage, nothing was secured to George, and there was nothing to prevent the defendant, if he could induce his father to do so thereafter, from obtaining the whole of the small share which, it is alleged, was intended for George. And it was so arranged that in case the plaintiff should die, without making a further disposition of it, that only one half of that small share would become the property of George, and the other half would be added to the share which <em>was </em>secured to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Again, there was, as has been said, a mortgage on the <em>north half </em>of the farm, in favor of Irving Brand of $1,000, and interest had accumulated thereon, at the time of these conveyances, to about $70. The $1,400 mortgage executed by the defendant was on that same north half alone, and the support and maintenance of the plaintiff) or the $225 per year in lieu of it, was, by the terms of the mortgage, made a specific charge on <em>that part </em>alone, and the value of which the referee found to be $1,000. So that while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>value of the whole premises, as found by the referee, was $6,000, the north half was incumbered to the amount in all, of $3,470, while the south half was left to the defendant entirely unincumbered. The incumbrance on the north half being <em>at that time </em>more than it was actually worth. But I think the <em>referee </em>overestimated <em>the amount for </em>which the defendant was liable for the support of the plaintiff, when he put it at the sum of $1,000. The estimated life of the plaintiff at seventy-five years, according to the tables, is 4.3-54 years; of course the whole sum to be furnished by the defendant at $225 per year, would amount only to $979; but this sum was not payable then, but in sums of $225 each year; the interest, therefore, on the whole sum of $979 should be deducted for one half of that time, at six per cent., and after deducting that from the principal, would leave the present value of that sum at $850, being $150 less than the referee has estimated, but <em>it </em>would <em>still leave the </em>incumbrance on the north half of the farm at more than one half his estimate of the whole premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">So, too, the referee erred in estimating the value of the $1,400 to be paid pursuant to the mortgage. The referee has put it at that amount as of the time when the mortgage was executed; but that could not be so, even if the plaintiff had died the next day, for it is not payable, or on interest, until one year after the death of the plaintiff. But according to the tables, his estimated life being 4.354, and it being payable one year after his death, we must cast the interest on the $1,400 at six per cent, for one year and multiply that by the 5.354, and after deducting the product from the $lz400 it would leave the liability of the defendant, therefor only $950, with interest from the date of the mortgage. So that calling the whole farm only $6,000 and the personal property included in the bill of sale at $500, as the referee has estimated it, the defendant had secured to him the sum of $6,500, while all the liabilities-incurred by Aim is $2,870, leaving him the net sum of $3,630.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The referee found that about $2,000 was intended to be secured to George, and he assumed that it was so secured by the transactions between the plaintiff\" and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">I have already shown, I think, that nothing was <em>secured </em>for George or his .children. But, in fact, no such sum was either secured or left (independent of the $600 in the savings bank, and which formed no part of the transaction) for any one; for, in making the estimate of $2,000, the referee took into the account (and it is all which he could include) only the said sum of $1,400, which I have shown in fact to be only $950, and the amounts which George owed his father amounting to $500, so that, of all the property taken into the account, William' actually received $3,630 net, and left of that which was intended for George and his heirs, only the sum of $1,450 instead of the $2,000; and that, so far as George\u2019s interests were concerned, instead of being a security, was a mere sham ; he has no title or security for the $1,400\u2014he still owes his father the $500 or $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">And he has no security that the defendant who the referee thinks, can obtain from the plaintiff whatever he tries to, and gives as one of the reasons why the conveyances should' not be set aside, that it might be worse for him, and that the defendant in such case might get all that he now has, together with the residue of his property. I say George has no security that William will not succeed, if this transaction is allowed to stand, in obtaining from the plaintiff while living with him, the small residue of his property, which by the transaction in question, was intended by the father, for George. If I have correctly stated the legal results of the transaction in question ; how is it possible that the plaintiff, if competent to transact business, and also if not unduly influenced, could ever have consented to dispose of his property by such legal instruments as he then executed? And it is surprising to me that good lawyers, if the object of the parties was what Mr. Vann testifies it was, should have prepared for them a deed, bill of sale and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>mortgage in the form of the ones which were executed, without anything to secure either to George or his children, any portion of the property. Surely no good lawyer <em>should </em>have prepared such papers for such an object, and it is difficult to believe that any really sane man who was not improperly influenced, would ever have signed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The facts which I have referred to, and the several specific facts found by the referee, taken as a whole, appear to me to be adverse to his general conclusion, that the plaintiff was not incompetent to contract, and that it is not proved that the defendant committed a fraud, or unduly influenced him. The referee also found that he was liable to be improperly influenced by either of the sons. I am convinced from what, appears in this case, that the defendant could so influence him. But, though at various times, the defendant was entirely away from him, and George was so situated that he had abundant opportunity, and with the mother, who the case showed favored George, there is not the least evidence to prove that he ever attempted to get- control of his father\u2019s property, in anyway, or to exercise any control over it, or him.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The only thing appearing in the case from which the referee could have drawn his inference is, that during twenty years and upwards, after George became of age, he had of his father in all, the $500 above mentioned, and which was conceded to be a debt due from him to his father, and for a part of which his father held his notes ; together with, the fact that he assisted his father m getting up the first deed to William, before it was delivered, and in his attempt to cause the conveyances in question to be canceled, and although two witnesses testify that the plaintiff said he should let the deeds stand if it had not been for George, and other like statements. Both the plaintiff and George testify that in each instance, the plaintiff came to George complaining of the conduct of William in obtaining the conveyances to be executed, and asking his assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>But it is very clear that this case does not disclose that any attempt has been made by George to obtain any diposition of this property in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Upon the direct evidence of competency of the plaintiff, Mr. Vann, who was the subscribing witness, thought him competent when the papers were executed. It does not appear that he had any acquaintance with him, so as to be able to speak except from what <em>then </em>took place, while to say nothing of the opinion of Mr. Geddes, whatever it may have been, his testimony concerning the acts, conversation and conduct of the plaintiff, several years before that, and on repeated occasions, show in my judgment that his mind was then not only feeble but that it was disordered to a very considerable extent, and no attempt has been made to prove that, since that, as he grows older, the general character of his mind has improved. I think the defendant should not be allowed to claim that-the plaintiff was competent to contract, in so important a transaction as this was. He would nottrust to any will that the plaintiff should make in his favor, because he alleged George would break it. But how could he fear that George would break such will, if the testator was of sound mind, and competent to make it. But stronger testimony than this to show that William did not consider him competent, is to be found in the argument which he obtained for the working of the farm for the five years; for the purpose of being boss himself, and securing to himself among other things, the sole right, not only to sell products and stock, when and how he pleased, but to purchase also as he pleased.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">I will refer to one other fact which was established, that the defendant in order to induce him to make these conveyances, told him that George was about to have a committee appointed over him, and urged for that reason the speedy execution of the papers. This was not in any way denied by the defendant, and the failure to deny it, was not from inadvertence, for the plaintiff testified to it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>three times in his several examinations. If it was untrue it is of itself evidence of falsehood and fraud on the part of the defendant, and also that the defendant must have known that the mind of the plaintiff was very weak. And if it was true, and William did not mean to cheat the plaintiff in the execution of the papers, it furnishes evidence that the plaintiff was considered by George to be then incompetent to manage his affairs; and that the defendant also believed so, and that it was probable such an attempt, if made by George, would be successful. In either aspect it appears to me to be fatal to the conveyances.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">A number of other questions are presented by the case, but I am satisfied that this judgment should be reversed, as well upon the questions of evidence which have been adverted to, as upon the findings of the referee; I-think, the case shows a much stronger one for an interference to set aside the conveyance, than was that of <em>Whelan </em>agt. <em>Whelan, </em>(3 <em>Cow., </em>537, 572;) <em>Brice </em>agt. <em>Brice, </em>(5 <em>Barb., </em>533,) <em>&amp; Voorhees </em>agt. <em>Voorhees, </em>(29 <em>N. Y., </em>463, 467.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The case is still stronger in favor of the plaintiff in regard to the bill of sal\u00e9. It is perfectly clear to my mind, that the plaintiff only intended to give the use'of the personal property to the defendant, and that for one year only. In regard to that, Mr. Vann testified, that when, the parties came to the office of Raynor &amp; Vann, the plaintiff expressed his intention of giving the personal property to William, and he speaks of this property having been the subject of conversation in the second interview. In this, I have no doubt he was mistaken, he was not the person with whom they consulted. It was his partner with whom they talked, and who advised them what to do, and although Mr. Vann was his co-partner, and doubtless, heard much of what was said, he might well have mistaken as to whether anything was said about the personal property, (except the $600 in the savings bank,) in the second interview, and also whether the proposition to let the defendant have the personal prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>erty, occurred at an early or late stage of the third interview; at all events, his testimony in that respect, is in direct conflict with that of the defendant as well as of the plaintiff. Neither of them state that anything was said about this personal property previous to the third interview, or that it was at an early part of that interview, and there is no contradiction between them in the fact that the plaintiff did not propose to give it to him at any time. It nowhere appears from the testimony of William that his father agreed to give him the property, but he says expressly that his father proposed to give him the use of it, and he does- not in any way state the length of time such use was to be given, nor does he even state that in any way, except by the language used in the bill of sale, any intention was manifested to give him the property as his own. And yet, before he was examined, his father had testified, \u201cI told William, I should hang on to the personal property any way,\u201d then he wanted some paper to keep George from suing him for the use of it after I was dead; I asked Raynor if he had got that thing up to keep George \u00f3ff, and he said yes ; he brought it to me and I signed it; I did not know what it was; George was not there; I sat back and did not say much. Willie would put in before I had a chance; William would not sign any mortgage to me until I signed the paper to keep George off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Again he testified, \u201cI had told them at Raynor\u2019s office, that I would not let William have the personal property; then Raynor advised William to buy the personal property, and William did not make much reply; I offered to sell it to him, but he would not buy it, <em>then I offered to give him the use of it for a </em>year; and then he wanted the writing got up to keep George from making him pay for the use of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">When William was called as a witness he testified, \u201cI-wanted control of the whole; he said he would give me a deed of the whole, but he wanted to keep the personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>property; I told him I could not afford to work and raise grain and keep cattle, hogs and hens, and whenever there was a pound of butter to sell it was his, and he was to have the money; he said then he would give me the use of the personal property ; I told him I wanted something to show that in case he should be taken away, George could not sue me for the use of the personal property; said he would fix it so he could not.\u201d So, that the only testimony there is to fix and limit the <em>use </em>is that of the plaintiff, who states it was for one year, and this is not contradicted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Now1, it is not enough in such a case as this that the bill of sale may have been read to the plaintiff, for it is apparent from the whole case, that the plaintiff would not have executed it, if he had not been improperly led to believe that it only transferred the <em>use </em>of the property for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">I think the judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs, to abide the event.</p>\n<author id=\"b281-7\">Morgan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMUB\">This being an equity case, the exceptions are not to be viewed with the same strictness as in actions at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">It is supposed that an error was committed by the referee in refusing to allow Mr. Geddes to testify whether, in his judgment, the plaintiff would be easily persuaded to do an act dictated by any person he considered his friend. Mr. Geddes had already been permitted to give bis opinion of the plaintiff\u2019s ability to transact business, and as to his soundness of mind. He had testified that in his opinion, he was a man of inferior mind, badly shattered by bad habits, and that he was never sound in his mind since he knew him; and he gave illustrations to fortify his opinion. It seems to me, therefore, that it was very much in the discretion of the referee, whether the examination should go further and Mr. Geddes be permitted to state his opinion upon a hypothetical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>case. I have no recollection of any such exception, and while I do not deem it of sufficient importance to call for a new trial, I am ready to <em>acquiesce </em>in the views of my brethren upon the point, and agree to a new trial if they deem it of sufficient importance to call for one.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Another objection is, that the mortgage did not provide for the payment of the $1,400 to George S. Brand. But the deed did make that provision and referred to the mortgage, which was silent on the subject as to whom the payment of the $1,400 was to be made.. In the absence of the condition contained in the deed, it is true the payment of the $1,400 would have to be made to the administrators of the grantor. But the defendant having accepted the deed is clearly bound by the condition, notwithstanding the language of the mortgage. If both are left to operate, then the defendant would be required to pay $1,400 to his brother George, and another $1,400 to the plaintiff\u2019s administrators. But the case is too clear to admit of argumentation, that the language of the mortgage failed to express in full the agreement of the parties, and a court of equity would have no difficulty in correcting it, so as to conform to the condition of the deed, and the real contract entered into between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">A good deal of stress is laid upon the mistake of the referee in estimating the amount secured, to George S. Brand, and a close calculation is made to show that be did not obtain as much by the settlement as was charged to him. I have not called to my aid the Northampton tables, to ascertain what a nice calculation would furnish as the net result of the settlement. It is clear that the referee did not attempt to state the amount with accuracy, nor did the parties when they entered into the arrangement, make any such calculation. A mistake of the referee in that respect in not fatal to the judgment; no doubt it was discretionary with the plaintiff to secure to his son George, any sum he pleased as. his portion of his property; he fixed the sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>after a good deal of discussion about it; and it is not for the court to break up the arrangement, because he did not make it larger.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">If the plaintiff was not over-reached or misled by the defendant, the inadequacy of the sum has but very little, if anything, to do with the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">It is said the referee' has found as a fact, that the plaintiff still lives with the defendant, eats at his table, and has his wants kindly provided for, and yet, evidence was excluded to show the contrary. The evidence set out in the case, does not affirmatively show whether the old gentleman is, or is not, kindly treated by the defendant, but shows that he still lives with the. defendant, and eats at his table. The offer was in general terms to show <em>how </em>he was treated.' If that fact was material, the evidence ought to have been admitted. The offer, however, was not pointed enough to show that the defendant had treated his father unkindly or failed to provide for his wants. But the provision in the deed of settlement, was drawn so as to permit the old gentleman to take his board elsewhere, in case he did not prefer to remain in the defendant\u2019s family. It is very suggestive that the old gentleman still lived with the defendant, and eat at his table, when he could have run over to his son George\u2019s house in a minute\u2019s time, and had his wants supplied. The whole case seems to support the evidence that the plaintiff was not suffering from bad treatment in the defendant\u2019s family. As the offer of evidence objected to, did not necessarily point out any ill treatment in the defendant\u2019s family, it is not of sufficient consequence perhaps, to call for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">It is also objected, that the fact mentioned by the defendant to the old gentleman, that George was about to institute proceedings to put him under guardianship, is conclusive evidence that the defendant brought improper influence to operate upon the plaintiff, to induce him to make the settlement. '</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>It does not appear affirmatively that his son George threatened to institute any such proceedings\u2014but it seems to have been taken for granted on the trial, that he had made such threats. The question was not asked George.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Without doubt, such afactif unfounded, or if well founded, if it was used to persuade the plaintiff to do an act which he would not otherwise be likely to do, ought to be sufficient to induce the court to break up .the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">While the evidence does not satisfactorily show that this fact in any manner influenced the plaintiff in making the settlement, it called upon the defendant to show on his part that it was fairly made, and that every opportunity was afforded to the plaintiff to understand the act he was about to perform, and as the plaintiff was coutessedly a weak minded man, and easily persuaded to adopt a particular course of conduct at the instance of the defendant, the court should require the most satisfactory proof, that the act performed was his own act, while in. a condition not only to understand its effect, but sufficiently independent to refrain from its performance if he did not approve of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">And this brings us to the inquiry whether the evidence of Mr. Vann, the attorney, was admissible to show that the plaintiff was fully informed of the effect of the settlement before it was made; for without,his evidence, I have no hesitation in saying that the settlement ought to be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In my opinion his evidence was admissible for that pur-, pose. The grounds of objection are fully stated in the case. It appears that Mr. Bichard Baynor drew the papers, and that Mr. \u2022 Vann was his partner and heard the conversation between the parties, and read over the papers carefully to the plaintiff. 'There were at least three interviews in which the terms of the settlement were freely discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">The first day the bargain fell through, because the plaintiff was unwdlling to give a bill of sale of his personal property. The next day the plaintiff went again to the office with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>son Geoi\u2019ge, and canceled the deed, and he afterwards concluded to accede to the requirements of the defendant, and went back again to Raynor\u2019s office, and the writings were completed. Mr. Yann says, he is not sure that William was present all the time the old man was; but no objection was taken that any of the conversations took place in the absence of William. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The objection is, that Yann was one of the attorneys of the plaintiff at the time, and the conversations were confidential\u2014and that since the transaction, Raynor &amp; Yann have refused to actas counsel for the plaintiff, on the ground that they were counsel for William. After the testimony was closed, the plaintiff's counsel moved to strike out Yann\u2019s evidence, upon the ground that William received advice from Raynor &amp; Yann, with reference to the conveyance, and acted as counsel for both parties in said interviews, and that the statements of both parties were privileged. Another ground for the motion was, that Raynor &amp; Yann were not the regular attorneys or legal advisers of either party prior to the interviews, but were employed and paid by both parties for their advice and services. And especially because Raynor &amp; Yann must have known from what had taken place at the second interview, that there would be a law-suit on account of George\u2019s hostility to the settlement, and therefore, the statements made at that interview were privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">These objections are frivolous, except so far as they involve the question as to whether the statements of the plaintiff were privileged communications. The attorneys were the legal counsel and advisers of both parties at the time, so far only as the form of the settlement was concerned. But it seems Mr. Raynor took it upon himself to advise the old man not to make such a settlement, and suggested that $225 a year was not sufficient for his support.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">But no objection is, or can be taken to this friendly admonition. The parties were there to make their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>arrangements; and it is an entire misapprehension to suppose that any law-suit was contemplated at the time, or that any statements were made or advice given in expectation of a law-suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Nor is there the slightest pretext for saying that any of the matters disclosed by Mr. Yann, were confidentially or professionally intrusted to him or his partner Mr. Raynor, by the old gentleman or by his son William. It would be a waste of time to take up the matters sworn to one by one, in order to show that none of them were confidentially communicated to Mr. Yann. They were not stated to him in order to obtain his advice as counsel, to regulate their future conduct, but to enable him to draw the papers. They were the statements of both parties, and not the secret of either, so as to require concealment. Doubtless, the authorities are not all one way in relation to the admission .of this species of evidence; but since the decision of the court of appeals in <em>Whiting </em>agt. Barney, (30 <em>N. Y., </em>333,) the law must be considered as settled in this state that the attorney may testify to a negotiation or bargain between the parties, when he had been mutually consulted by them. And so it seems when only one of the parties consults the attorney. <em>(Prouty </em>agt. Eaton, 41 <em>Barb., </em>410, <em>and see </em>Johnson, J., <em>(p. </em>416,) <em>as to what was decided in Whiting </em>agt. Barney, (38 <em>Barb., </em>398,) <em>and subsequently overruled in </em>30 <em>N. Y., </em>330.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">. I am clearly of opinion that the case of <em>Whiting </em>agt. Barney, controls this case and. that the testimony of Yann was admissible as to what transpired between the parties at the time of the negotiation in Mr. Raynor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">But there is another ground upon which the evidence was admissible. The plaintiff himself had already testified to the same matters, and thus waived any right, he had to keep the matter secret o.r privileged from disclosure. This is too obvious to be seriously questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">At the time of the trial, Mr. Yann had dissolved his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>nection with Raynor, and had no further interest in the suit; he was the partner of Mr. Fuller, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and his evidence was entitled to full credit; he testified without bias, and in such a manner as to command the fullest confidence in his statements. And I think, no one can read his testimony, without coming to the conclusion that the old gentleman was fully informed of the consequences of the act he was about to perform. The subject of the bill of sale was fully explained to him, and led to the abandonment of the settlement the first day; afterwads he agreed to it, and told some of his neighbors that he had parted with all his property. When it is recollected that he broke off the first negotiation, because his son insisted upon the bill of sale, it can hardly be said that he did not know what it was. If he had any capacity for business, he must have known that he was required to sign it before William would consent to enter into the arrangement. After a good deal of hesitation, and without any undue influence, as it seems to me, he consented to sign it, with certain restrictions dictated by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">If the case is one where the referee has a right, to find upon the evidence, that the plaintiff was not of unsound mind, it was also a case where I think, he had a right to find, that the settlement was not obtained by the fraud or undue influence of the defendant. If Mr. Vann\u2019s evidence is to be credited, then it is entirely clear that the plaintiff was reckless in his statements as to what took place between him and his son William, and very little if any credit could be placed in what he said. The testimony of William was clear and straight-forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Nothing appeared in his evidence to show that he had attempted to make out a case by suppressing the truth or exaggerating it. And it was corroborated in many important details by the evidence of Irving Brand and his neighbors. While I am entirely satisfied with the j udgment, I shall be glad to have the case submitted to a jury for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>determination. When they have seen the witnesses and heard them testify, and weighed the evidence, their verdict ought to be satisfactory to both parties. If the case goes back for a new trial, the referee should be discharged and issues settled. The only two questions of importance are, first, whether the plaintiff was of sound mind when he made the settlement, and if so, whether the settlement was procured by fraud or undue influence. The referee may have mistaken the character of the witnesses and the import of the evidence. Ho one is a good judge of his own bias in such a case, and I may have been misled by it. All that can be claimed is, that my conclusions were honestly drawn from the facts as they appeared to me on the trial.</p>\n<author id=\"b288-5\">Bacon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoI\">I am not prepared to say that, on the merits of this case, I should be disposed to differ from the conclusions of the learned referee touching the mental capacity of the plaintiff, and his freedom from such influences as the law has stamped as undue and illegitimate. On such questions, much is necessarily submitted to the judgment and good sense of a referee, which the court that does not see the witnesses, and has, therefore an imperfect opportunity to judge of the bearing and reliability of their testimony, cannot so well appreciate.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Without, therefore, expressing any opinion on the main facts disclosed by the testimony, and waiving their consideration, I shall vote for a reversal of the judgment and the granting of a new trial solely upon the erroneous ruling of the referee, as I consider it, on a single point. It is the re-. jection of the question propounded to the witness., George Geddes, at the 249th folio of the case. The principle of law involved in this point is fully discussed in the opinion of my brother Foster, and the authorities cited, which show, in my judgment, that the question was entirely proper and should have been allowed. What weight might have be\u00e9n attached to the testimony' is not a subject of dis* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>cussion, but that it was competent, I think, is very clear from the authorities. The rule is well stated in the case of <em>Cohn </em>agt. Haslam, (7 <em>Barb. </em>314.) that on a question of mental capacity the opinion of an intimate acquaintance as to such condition is competent when connected with facts and circumstances within his knowledge, and disclosed by him in his testimony as the foundation of his opinion, Mr. Gfeddes stood in this relation substantially to the plaintiff, and he disclosed facts and circumstances which well qualified and authorized him to express an opinion on the precise point on which it was proposed to interrogate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">It may be well also, in case of a new trial to express an opinion as to the competency of the evidence given by the witness Vann, which was received by the referee under the objection that the matters he testified to, being the communication of a client to his counsel, they were received under the professional seal of secrecy, which could not be broken without the express assent of the client. Perhaps the rule is not yet established in this state, (although there are stong intimations to that effect,) that where a party offers himself as a witness, he may be interrogated as to any admissions ' or statements made to his counsel, and the counsel may be examined as to the same matters by the opposing party, either in chief or by way of impeachment. If it were necessary, I think, I should be prepared to hold this doctrine. But on another ground, the evidence of Vann was competent. The communications which passed between the plaintiff and Vann, were not in reference to any suit then pending or contemplated. They were made with the object of avoiding any legal controversy by bringing about an amicable arrangement, and with a view to the future conduct and relations of the plaintiff and his son the defendant. The case of <em>Whiting </em>agt. <em>Barney, </em>(30 <em>N. Y., </em>330,) holds that the rule which protects the disclosure of professional communications of clients to their attorneys only extends to such communications as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>have relation to some suit, or other judicial proceeding then pending, or anticipated. Within this rule, the evidence objected to was clearly competent, and was properly received by the referee.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b290-6\">Note.\u2014A very abort explanation only (if-any), is necessary in the case of <em>Brand </em>agt. <em>Brand </em>which occupies nearly this entire number. It will be seen at once that it is a <em>leading case, </em>and is nearly parallel with the case of <em>Whelan </em>agt. <em>Whelan, </em>3 Cowen, 537, which occupies 53 pages of that book. It involves not only the important question of \u201cundue influence\u201d contained in <em>Whelan </em>agt. <em>Whelan, </em>but also the very important question of \u201c privileged communications both of which questions are discussed with great ability by Judge Foster.\u2014Hep.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">But on the ground heretofore stated, I am in favor of reversing the judgment and sending the case to a jury, as one very proper to be passed upon by them, on the issues of the mental capacity of the plaintiif, and the alleged fraud, or undue influence of the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
