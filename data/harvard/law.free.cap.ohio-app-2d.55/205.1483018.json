J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay0\">This case arises out \u00f3f a series of commercial paper transactions. Plaintiff-appellant, The George Whatley Company (plaintiff), brought suit against defendant-appellee, The National City Bank (defendant), on March 27, 1973. Plaintiff alleged that defendant cashed and debited to plaintiff a series of forged checks between January and June, 1972. The checks were drawn on plaintiff\u2019s corporate checldng account maintained at defendant\u2019s Chester-40th branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">In Count. I, plaintiff sought $30,000 compensatory damages based on defendant\u2019s refusal to credit plaintiff\u2019s account with the amount of the forged instruments. In Counts II and III, plaintiff alleged that defendant had acted negligently and recklessly in cashing the checks. Defendant answered and denied any wrongdoing. Defendant also charged that any loss sustained by plaintiff was due to-plaintiff\u2019s negligent acts in (1) hiring and supervising its bookkeeper<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) failing to examine its bank statements promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The case was tried to the court on April 6, 1976. The judge found in favor of plaintiff for $858.97<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on Count I and in favor of defendant on Counts II and III. The judge supported his decision with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal. Plaintiff assigns six errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">The first and second assignments raise the same issue. They are treated together.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\n<em>Assignments of Error Nos. 1 and 2:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">\u201c1. Finding of Fact No. 3 is not supported by any evidence in the record in that there is no evidence that Nancy Cherauka forged all the checks in issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201c2. Finding of Fact No. 11 is not supported by any evidence in the record as there is no evidence to establish that each check in issue was forged by Nancy Cherauka.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The trial court found that plaintiff\u2019s exhibits 1-4 and 9-50 (checks) and plaintiff\u2019s exhibits 5, 6, and 8 (photocopies of cheeks) were drawn on plaintiff\u2019s account at National City Bank.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court further found that the drawer\u2019s signature on each check was forged by Nancy Cherauka, plaintiff\u2019s former bookkeeper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">There is little direct evidence in the record that Ms. Cherauka forged the instruments. She did not testify at trial. There is no eyewitness testimony to the forgery. Victor Whalley did testify, however, without objection that to his knowledge Cherauka plead guilty to forging the checks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The record also contains circumstantial evidence on the issue. For example:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">(1) Plaintiff hired Ms. Cherauka in December, 1971, and discharged her in June, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">(2) The first forged instrument was dated January 24,1972, and the last was dated May 31,1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">(3) Victor Whalley testified that there had been no further forgeries after Ms. Cherauka\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">(4) Of the 49 checks admitted into evidence, Nancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Cherauka\u2019s name appeared as both payee and endorser on five.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\">(5) She is also listed as payee on plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 6.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">(6) The first forged instrument was applied to her installment loan held by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">(7) Ms. Cherauka was in complete charge of plaintiff\u2019s books and financial records during her tenure at the Whalley Company. Her specific duties included preparing all checks, handling petty cash, and keeping records of accounts payable and receivable. She also took the company deposits to defendant\u2019s Chester-40th branch every business day. She was not, however, authorized to sign or cash checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">(8) Victor Whalley testified as to the procedure followed upon receipt of the company bank statement and cancelled checks. He stated that he examined the statement to determine the account balance, but that he did not look at the individual checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">(9) He then gave the checks and statement to the bookkeeper, but Ms. Cherauka did not report back to any corporate officer concerning the account. Nancy Cherauka was, therefore, the only person who examined the cancelled checks and had an opportunity to discover and report any forgeries. She did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">A lower court finding of fact can properly be based on circumstantial evidence, see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>White </em>(1925), 3 Ohio Law Abs. 522, 523. Circumstantial evidence is sufficient <em>\u201c* </em>* * where the chain of circumstances leads to a conclusion which is more probable than any other hypothesis reflected by the evidence.\u201d <em>McComis </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1974), 40 Ohio App. 2d 332, 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">From the evidence presented, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that it was more probable that Nancy Cherauka was the forger. Findings of Fact 3 and 11 are both supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Assignments of Error Nos. 1 and 2 are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"APp\">Assignment of Error No. 5 is discussed out of sequence because of the logical relationship it bears to the first two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><em>Assignment of Error No. </em>5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">\u201c5. The verdict and judgment was <em>(sic) </em>against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Plaintiff argues under this assignment that the trial court erred in finding (1) that the checks were all forged! by the same person; (2) that the defendant-bank was not negligent in its check-cashing procedures employed by its tellers; and (3) that plaintiff could not recover for the checks cashed and debited in May despite the fact that plaintiff gave notice of the forgery in June. The first argument under this assignment is without substance for the reasons assessed in the discussion of Assignments Nos. 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The trial court based its judgment on R. C. 1304.20. The section provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">\u201c Sec. 1304.29 (UCC 4-406) Customer\u2019s duty to discover and report unauthorized signature or alteration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">\u201c(A) When a bank sends to its customer a statement of account accompanied by items paid in good faith in support of the debit entries * # * the customer must exercise <em>reasonable care </em>and <em>promptness to examine </em>the <em>statement and items to discover his unauthorised signature </em>or any alteration on an item and must notify the bank promptly after discovery thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-11\">\u201c (B) If the bank establishes that the customer failed with respect to an item to comply with the duties imposed on the customer by division (A) of this section, the <em>customer is precluded from asserting against the bank:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aug\">\u201c(1) <em>his unauthorised signature </em>or <em>any alteration </em>on the item <em>if </em>the bank <em>also establishes that it suffered a loss by reason of such failure,; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-12\">\u201c(2) ah unauthorized.'signature \u00f3r alteration by the <em>same </em>wrongdoer on any other item paid in <em>good faith </em>by the bank after the first item and statement was available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>to the customer for a reasonable period not exceeding fourteen calendar days an&lt;J <em>before </em>the bank <em>receives notification </em>from the customer of any such unauthorized signature or alteration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">\u201c(C) The preclusion under division (B) of this section does not apply <em>if the customer establishes </em>lack of ordinary care on the part of the bank in paying the item.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The initial question under Part (A) of the statute is whether defendant acted in good faith in paying the disputed items.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This term is defined in the Code as \u201chonesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned,\u201d R. C. 1301.01. The trial court found that good faith is presumed. Whether the statement of presumption was accurate or not, there is no evidence to the contrary. Further, the evidence affirmatively established that Ms. Cherauka was known to the defendant\u2019s tellers as The Whalley Company bookkeeper. There was also testimony that the forged signatures were very similar to the genuine one. It is reasonable to conclude from this that defendant acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The next consideration is whether plaintiff exercised reasonable care and promptness in examining its bank statement and cheeks. The requirement is designed to detect and prevent a wrongdoer \u2014 including a forger \u2014 from repeating his or her acts, see R. C. 1304.29, Comment 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s procedure upon receipt of the bank statement was discussed under Assignments 1 and 2. A reasonable trier of fact could conclude that this pattern of <em>unsupervised </em>bookkeeping constituted a failure to exercise reasonable care.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Once the bank established that it acted in good faith under R. C. 1304.29(A) and that plaintiff\u2019s behavior did not satisfy the requirements of the same subsection, the preclusion mechanism under R. C. 1304.29(B)(2) was triggered.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The date on which the first item was \u201cavailable\u201d to plaintiff then determines whether plaintiff can recover for the May forgeries. Plaintiff received a bank statement and checks on approximately the third of each month.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, on about February 3, 1972, plaintiff received! its January statement which included the initial forged check dated January 24, 1972. The first item, then, was \u201cavailable\u201d to plaintiff on about February 3, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">\"When plaintiff entrusted the cancelled checks and statement to a surrogate, it was still charged with the knowledge that an honest employee would have acquired, see <em>White Castle System, Inc. </em>v. <em>Huntington Nat\u2019l Bank </em>(1941), 36 Ohio Law Abs. 253, 259, where it is noted that some courts have followed the legal principle that \u201cthe customer is bound to know that which an honest employee would have ascertained in his reconcilement.\u201d This imputed knowledge is particularly appropriate where, as in the instant case, the customer permitted the same employee to both prepare the checks and reconcile the statements without supervision, <em>cf. White &amp; Summers, </em>Uniform Commercial Code Section 16-6, p. 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Therefore, plaintiff had until 14 days after receipt of the January statement to discover and report any irregularities. Plaintiff did not do so until shortly after June 3, 1972. Accordingly, plaintiff is precluded from asserting any unauthorized signature on the items paid by the bank after 14 days following the January, 1972, statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Plaintiff argues that the preclusion mechanism does not apply because defendant did not exercise ordinary care. Section (C) of the statute does provide that the preclusion is inoperative where the customer establishes that the bank did not use ordinary care \u201cin paying the item.\u201d This refers back to \u201cthe first item and statement\u201d described in part (B)(2). The question of the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>ordinary care is, therefore, limited to the bank\u2019s actions in cashing the first forged item.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiff does not call attention to specific evidence in the record to demonstrate lack of ordinary care in cashing the initial January 24, 1972, check, see App. R. 12. Although plaintiff states that an expert characterized the cashing of every check as \u201cnegligence\u201d, a careful reading of the record reveals that the witness was making a general statement about the practice of cashing post-dated checks. The lower court found that plaintiff did not establish defendant\u2019s lack of ordinary care. There is sufficient evidence in the record to support a reasonable mind in that conclusion and, thus, to support the judgment that defendant was liable only for the three forged items charged to plaintiff during the 14-day period following plaintiff\u2019s receipt of the January statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Assignment of Error No. 5 is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. 3:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201c3. Defendant\u2019s Exhibit N was admitted into evidence in error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Exhibit N is a.National City Bank pamphlet titled \u201cRules and Regulations Governing Commercial Accounts.\u201d Paragraph 7 of the Rules requires a depositor to notify the bank of any irregularity within 10 calendar days of receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Plaintiff contends that the lower court erred in admitting the document because of lack of a proper foundation. The allegation of lack of a foundation stems from the fact that counsel did not establish that the rules were posted in the bank in conformance with R. C. 1107.06 (D).Reliance on this statute is misplaced. It does not govern a foundation element. The question whether the rules must be posted is a distinct issue pertinent to materiality and relevance. W\u00e9re it otherwise, counsel could hardly eom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>plain. For he did not object to the lack of a foundation at the time the exhibit was introduced. Therefore, any. objection on that score, well founded or not, was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Considerations of evidential relevancy require an examination of R. C. 1107.06(D):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201cAll owners of any interest in each account, commercial or savings, who are such on January 1, 1968, shall be bound by the bank\u2019s rules and regulations of such date govering accounts. Subsequent amendments to such rules and regulations shall be posted in the bank and <em>shall be binding thereafter upon the then owners of any interest in all then existing </em>accounts.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The cover of Exhibit N indicates that it became effective May 15, 1964. The trial court found that the rules had been in effect prior to January 1, 1968. Because plaintiff was \u201cowner of an interest\u201d on January 1, 1968, it was bound by the rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The statute does not require that rules effective as of January 1, 1968, be posted. The plain language of the statute shows that only <em>subsequent </em>amendments must be posted. There is no evidence in the record that any such amendments exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Assignment of Error No. 3 is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. 4:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">\u201c4. Pursuant to Local Rule 21<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Dennis Griesmer should not have been permitted to testify as an expert in defendant\u2019s case in chief because they never provided plaintiff with his identity and a summary of his opinions although requested to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">Mr. Griesmer was called by defendant as an expert witness on the subject of check cashing and processing in the banking industry. Defendant did not inform plaintiff that it intended to call this witness. Plaintiff contends that defendant should have been barred from presenting the witness under Local Rule 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Local Rule 21(1) (A) precludes certain witnesses from testifying when counsel fails prior to trial to furnish the-opposing party with any report made by such witness. In describing the type of information required to be exchanged, the rule speaks specifically in terms of damages sought to be proved for \u201cmedical expenses, lost earnings, [and]' property damage <em>* * </em>In cases <em>other </em>than for recovery of damage to person or property, the provisions \u201c* * * shall apply to the extent to which they are applicable,\u201d' Rule 21(1) (A) paragraph 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The trial court held the rule inapplicable because the testimony of the witness was \u201c* * * of a general nature,, the very substance of a major part of this lawsuit.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s claim of unfair surprise is, therefore, without foundation. The decision as to the applicability of the rule was within the sound discretion of the trial court. Such a decision enjoys a strong presumption of regularity. On the record there was no abuse of discretion shown nor was. the presumption rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Assignment of Error No. 4 is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. 6:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">\u201c6. The Court failed to rule on plaintiff\u2019s motion in limine filed prior to trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Plaintiff sought by motion <em>in limime </em>prior to trial to prevent defendant from asserting under R. C. 1303.42 that plaintiff had \u201csubstantially contributed\u201d to the making of the unauthorized signatures.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiff argued that this was an affirmative defense that was waived unless specifically plead under Civ. R. 8(c). It now complains that the trial court erred in not ruling on the motion. Giving the most favorable consideration to plaintiff\u2019s contention and assuming such judicial omission to be error, the error is harmless. For it is apparent that either defendant\u2019s Second Defense to Counts One and Two<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or its Second De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>fense to Count Three, both alleged in its answer, is sufficient to legitimize evidence supporting defenses under R.
