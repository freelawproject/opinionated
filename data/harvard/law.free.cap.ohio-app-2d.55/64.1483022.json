Having received a sentence of four to twenty-five years at the Ohio Reformatory, he now appeals, claiming the court failed to determine that he understood the maximum penalties involved, in violation of-the requirements of Crim. R. 11(C) (2)., We -agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">The record discloses, and the state agrees, that the judge did not mention the penalties involved, much less determine if Wilson understood them. But the record also discloses that Wilson signed an \u201cEntry Withdrawing Plea Of Not Guilty And Entering Plea Of Guilty-,\u201d in which the penalties (incarceration and fine) were fully set forth, and further that at the subsequent sentence hearing, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>pellant clearly indicated that he knew when he offered the plea that he could be sentenced to seven to twenty-five years. The state claims there was substantial compliance with Crim. R. 11(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">How much has the strict rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Caudill </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 342, been modified by <em>State </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St. 2d 86? <em>Stewart </em>speaks of substantial compliance with Crim. R. 11(C) and of the need to show prejudice before a guilty plea can be vacated. However, for the several reasons set forth below, we believe the <em>Stewart </em>exception must be limited to the facts in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The syllabus in <em>Stewart </em>reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">\u201cWhere an individual is indicted on a charge of \u00e1g-' gravated murder, with specifications thereto, and the trial court accepts a plea of guilty to the lesser included offense of murder. (R. C. 2903.02) without personally advising the' defendant that he is ineligible for probation, such omission does not constitute prejudicial error, and there is substantial compliance with the provisions of Crim. R. 11. (Paragraph one of the syllabus in <em>State </em>v. Caudill, 48 Ohio St. 2d 342, modified.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">We note that the first paragraph of the <em>Caudill </em>syllabus is only modified, not reversed, and that the other two paragraphs thereof are unchanged. As promulgated in 1976, the three paragraphs of <em>Caudill </em>read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">\u201c1. In accepting a written plea of no contest to a felony charge, the trial court must adhere scrupulously to-the provisions of Crim. R. 11(C) (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">\u201c2. Adherence to the provisions of Crim. R. 11(C)(2) requires an oral dialogue between the trial court and the defendant which enables the court to determine fully the defendant\u2019s understanding of the consequences of his plea, of guilty or no contest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">\u201c3. The requirements of Crim. E. 11(C)(2) are not satisfied by a- written statement by the defendant or by representations of his counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">A meaningful dialogue is still required, and written statements do not satisfy the requirements of the. rule. The dialogue in the instant case, considering the total ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>sence of any mention of the penalty, eonld not lead to a full understanding by appellant of the consequences of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The potential sentence hanging over a pleading defendant is one of the important matters on his mind, if not the most important, it being a major \u201cconsequence\u201d of his plea. The court need take but a few moments to determine whether the accused understands- the penalties involved, a necessary step in finding the. answer to the central question whether the plea is offered voluntarily. We deem it proper to obligate the court to spread on the record at this pivotal hearing the entire basis of its conclusions and determinations when a plea is. offered, thus foreclosing repeated future attempts by the offender to evade the plainly foreseeable results of his deliberate choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Adherence to Grim. R. 11(C) does not require \u201crote recitation\u201d or \u201critualistic incantation.\u201d The ascertainment of voluntariness demands an inquiry into specific constitutional waivers and defendant\u2019s knowledge of certain aspects of the aftermath of his plea. The language of the rule need not be repeated <em>verbatim, </em>but its checklist of essential items should be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">When we weigh the advantages and disadvantages. of strict adherence to the rule, the balance tips in favor of full compliance. For the sentencing judge, strict adherence is not burdensome: it takes a matter of minutes. But the accused is subjecting himself to possible incarceration for a matter of months, if not years. This is a moment of considerable significance in his life. In addition to waiving trial, he is, then and there, testifying against himself, and his waiver of his. Fifth Amendment rights cannot logically be called knowing, intelligent and voluntary unless he is aware of the consequences. A presumption of prejudice is--proper, when and if the court, which is the final arbiter of constitutional rights, fails to take every reasonable step to -protect the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u2022\u2022 Finally, this court has held that strict adherence is required, in a series of cases beginning with <em>State v. Dur</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>ham, </em>No. C-74595, rendered September 29, 1975. Our decision in the instant ease is consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\">The assignment of error is well taken. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b85-5\">Shannon, P.
