He argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction and that several comments by the prosecutor and Government witnesses rendered his trial unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-19\">Hernandez moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case-in-chief but failed to renew the motion at the close of all evidence. Therefore, our review of his sufficiency challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>is limited to whether there has been a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice,\u201d which occurs when the record is devoid of evidence of guilt or if the evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would shock the conscience. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>576 F.3d 528, 529-30 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 303, 307 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Hernandez argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish his identity as a co-conspirator; he argues that the crucial factor of the Government\u2019s case was proving that an individual known as \u201cD-Town\u201d was Hernandez but that the Government\u2019s only two eyewitnesses did not positively identify him at trial. He also argues that the Government failed to prove his knowledge of the conspiracy and his voluntary participation in same. Contrary to Hernandez\u2019s assertions, the record demonstrates that a co-conspirator, Jose Pedraza, unequivocally identified Hernandez as the individual he met with to discuss the transaction and who later delivered the cocaine to him and also that a Drug Enforcement Administration agent identified Hernandez\u2019s voice as belonging to the same person he spoke to when calling the D-Town phone. The evidence also included substantial corroborating evidence, such as (1) the arrest of Hernandez and his friend Ricardo Garcia, whose fingerprint was on the cocaine packaging, as the two men were following a truck to the purported payoff locale; (2) the recovery of the D-Town phone in close proximity to Hernandez; (3) Garcia\u2019s statement that Hernandez \u201cgets the phone calls\u201d; (4) the record of phone calls between the D-Town phone and Pedraza\u2019s phone; and (5) the recovery of phone numbers for Pedraza, the Mexican cocaine suppliers, Hernandez\u2019s friend, and his wife\u2019s best friend from the directory of the D-Town phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Hernandez\u2019s concerted actions with other known members of the conspiracy rose to a level of more than just mere association or mere presence in an unsavory atmosphere. <em>See United States v. Garcia Abrego, </em>141 F.3d 142, 155 (5th Cir.1998). The record contains ample direct and circumstantial evidence of Hernandez\u2019s involvement in the drug conspiracy; accordingly, he has failed to demonstrate that the record is devoid of evidence of his guilt or that the evidence on a key element of his offense is so tenuous that his conviction should shock the conscience. <em>See Rodriguez-Martinez, </em>480 F.3d at 307; <em>see also United States v. Ramirez-Velasquez, </em>322 F.3d 868, 881 (5th Cir.2003) (affirming conspiracy conviction, under a less strict standard, where the \u201caggregation of circumstances\u201d supported jury\u2019s verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Hernandez also argues that the prosecutor and certain Government witnesses made improper statements during trial, closing argument, and rebuttal closing argument. Because he did not object to the remarks at trial, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 508 (5th Cir.2009). Hernandez first challenges the prosecutor\u2019s statements during the rebuttal closing argument, urging the jury to consider the facts, not \u201ctrial tactics,\u201d \u201ccharacter assassination,\u201d or \u201ctrickery.\u201d However, viewed in context, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were directed to defense counsel\u2019s arguments, not the integrity of defense counsel. Even assuming that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks constituted obvious error, Hernandez has not shown that they had the \u201cprobable effect\u201d of preventing the jury from \u201cjudgpng] the evidence fairly.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 12, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). The evidence against Hernandez was \u201csubstantial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 20, 105 S.Ct. 1038, and Hernandez points to no reason why the jury should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>not be presumed to have heeded the district court\u2019s instructions that remarks of counsel are not evidence. <em>See United States v. Gallardo-Trapero, </em>185 F.3d 307, 321 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Another comment during closing argument about which Hernandez complains \u2014 that he was the nephew of Nene, the Mexican source of the drugs \u2014 was not improper because the prosecutor was merely urging those inferences and conclusions she wished the jury to draw from the evidence. <em>See United States v. Machuca-Barrera, </em>261 F.3d 425, 436 (5th Cir.2001). Consequently, there was no prosecutorial misconduct in this regard. Hernandez next complains that the prosecutor and Government witnesses made repeated misleading statements during trial that the D-Town phone was taken from his person. It is not necessary to decide the question of the propriety of those comments as Hernandez cannot demonstrate any prejudice. That is, the record shows that several law enforcement agents testified explicitly that the D-Town phone was recovered from the front dashboard area of the vehicle at issue, not from Hernandez\u2019s person. Because he cannot demonstrate that the comments prejudiced his substantive rights and in light of the overwhelming evidence of his guilt (including his responsibility for the D-Town phone), Hernandez has not shown plain error. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>482 F.3d 781, 785 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Hernandez additionally argues that the prosecutor, in challenging his theory of defense during closing argument, improperly commented on his right to remain silent and his failure to testify on his own behalf. There is no error, however, as the complained-of comments simply pointed out the lack of evidence in support of the defense theory that Hernandez was in the Dallas area searching for vehicles to purchase and resell. <em>See United States v. Mackay, </em>33 F.3d 489, 495-96 (5th Cir.1994). Finally, Hernandez contends reversal is required due to cumulative error of the prosecutor\u2019s comments. \u201cHaving determined ... that none of his claims warrant reversal individually, we decline to employ the unusual remedy of reversing for cumulative error.\u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>483 F.3d 313, 362 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
