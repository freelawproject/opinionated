The sentence was above the advisory guidelines sentencing range of 262 to 327 months but below the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Appellate courts must review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If error is preserved, as in the instant case, an appellate court reviewing for reasonableness \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The abuse of discretion standard applies \u201cwhether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-15\">We reject Kelly\u2019s claim that the district court improperly considered records pertaining to his past. \u201c[A] sentencing judge [may] exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in\u201d selecting a sentence. <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1240, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661. This discretion is not to be curbed by limitations concerning \u201cthe source from which [sentencing information] may come,\u201d except as set forth by law <em>Pepper, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1240 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3. We decline Kelly\u2019s invitation to \u201cinvent a blanket prohibition\u201d concerning the evidence that sentencing courts may consider. <em>Pepper, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1241 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-18\">We reject also Kelly\u2019s due process challenge based on an appearance of bias. Kelly does not assert that the district court was biased or even presumptively biased against him; yet only actual bias or presumptive bias gives rise to a due process violation. <em>See Richardson v. Quarterman, </em>537 F.3d 466, 475 (5th Cir.2008). Kelly has thus abandoned this claim by failing to offer any legal support for it. <em>See United States v. Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d 428, 439-40 (5th Cir.2009). Additionally, circuit precedent forecloses the claim that the district court violated Kelly\u2019s constitutional rights of confrontation and cross-examination by considering exhibits. <em>See United States v. Navarro, </em>169 F.3d 228, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>236 (5th Cir.1999). We find no merit in Kelly\u2019s claim that the district court failed to provide adequate reasons for the sentence. The district court made clear that it imposed an upward variance due to the nature and circumstances of the offense as well as Kelly\u2019s history and characteristics and in order to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide a just punishment, adequately deter future criminal conduct, and protect the public from further crimes by Kelly. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">If a sentencing court determines that a sentence within the initial advisory range would be insufficient to serve the purposes of sentencing, it may impose either of two types of sentence falling outside that range: a departure, which is a sentence authorized by one or more provisions of the Guidelines, or a variance, which is a sentence that finds no specific authorization in the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). As the district court\u2019s statement of reasons makes clear, Kelly\u2019s was a variance sentence. As a substantive matter, a sentence must be supported by the factors contained in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). A variance \u201csentence unreasonably fails to reflect the [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors where it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We reject Kelly\u2019s speculative assertion that the district court determined that his traumatic childhood was not truly a mitigating factor and instead supported a more onerous sentence. We find no record support for Kelly\u2019s contention that the district court improperly justified \u201cincreased punishment\u201d based on his need for mental-health counseling and on its availability in prison. And we find no merit in Kelly\u2019s assertion that the selected sentence presents a clear error in the balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and that a sentence of 327 months would have been reasonable. \u201cThe sentencing judge is in a superior position to\u201d determine whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the variance imposed. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court stated that it sentenced Kelly as it did based on substantive considerations, including Kelly\u2019s characteristics and extensive criminal history starting at age 17, much of which was not taken into account in determining his criminal history score. The fact that Kelly, or we, might \u201creasonably ... conclude that a different sentence was appropriate is [alone] insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b536-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
