Rosales argues the BIA incorrectly found that she did not qualify for withholding of removal because she established that she suffered past persecution on account of her political activities in Venezuela and because she established a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Rosales failed to dispute the denial of asylum and CAT relief in her appeal to the BIA; therefore, she failed to exhaust these issues below and waives them on review. <em>See Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861 n. 5 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (holding that an applicant failed to exhaust an issue because he did not raise the issue before the BIA). Rosales\u2019s sons are ineligible for relief under INA \u00a7 241(b)(3) because aliens cannot receive derivative eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Delgado, </em>487 F.3d at 862 (holding that the withholding-of-removal statute, unlike the asylum statute, confers no derivative benefits). Thus, the only issue on review is Rosales\u2019s application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo </em>and factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001). Under the highly deferential substantial evidence test, we affirm the BIA\u2019s factual determination that an alien is statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal if the determination is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284 (quotation omitted). We reverse the BIA\u2019s finding of facts only if the record compels it, but \u201cthe mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the [BIA\u2019s] findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). We review \u201conly the Board\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. Here, the BIA issued its own opinion and relied on the IJ\u2019s reasoning without expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s opinion; therefore, we \u201creview the BIA\u2019s decision, with regard to those matters on which it rendered its own opinion and reasoning.\u201d <em>Tang v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1275 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">Withholding of removal is granted if an applicant establishes that more likely than not the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal because of the applicant\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The applicant has the burden to show that he or she meets the requirements for withholding of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b). \u201c[Persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Carrizo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>652 F.3d 1326, 1331 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (quotation omitted). \u201cIf the applicant can show that the persecution was, at least in part, motivated by a protected ground, then the applicant can establish eligibility for with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>holding of removal.\u201d <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Rosales argues that the IJ erroneously applied the standard required by the REAL ID Act, and the BIA relied on this incorrect reasoning. Although it is clear from the IJ\u2019s decision that he applied the incorrect standard, the BIA cured this defect by applying the correct pre-REAL ID Act standard in its opinion. Specifically, the BIA found that Rosales failed to establish that she was persecuted on account of any of the protected grounds. Substantial evidence supported the finding that any harm that Rosales experienced resulted from the efforts of the Venezuelan government to confiscate her husband\u2019s property, not from her political activities. Finally, substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the harm against Rosales did not rise to the level of persecution because she only suffered property damage, threatening notes, and threatening telephone calls. <em>See, e.g., Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (holding that the bombing of a restaurant where the applicant worked, along with threats, did not constitute past persecution that would require reversal of an IJ decision); <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that a threatening note and telephone calls were mere harassment rather than persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">An applicant who has not suffered past persecution may demonstrate that her life or freedom would be threatened in the future by establishing future persecution, by a preponderance of the evidence, on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2); <em>see also Imelda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 724, 728 n. 3 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">There is substantial evidence in the record to support the BIA\u2019s conclusion that there is no likelihood of future persecution. The BIA found that Rosales\u2019s return trips to Venezuela were not the actions of an individual who is genuinely fearful for her life. Moreover, during both of the return trips home no harm came to Rosales, and during the most recent return trip home no one threatened Rosales. <em>See De Santamaria v. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>525 F.3d 999, 1011 (11th Cir.2008) (finding that voluntary returns to a home country may weaken or undermine an applicant\u2019s claim of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny Rosales\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
