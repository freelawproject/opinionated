Richardson argues that his sentence, which was outside the recommended policy range, is unreasonable because he had completed approximately 34 months of his three-year supervised release \u201cprior to the earliest allegations in the Government\u2019s petition.\u201d He contends that the district court should have imposed a lesser sentence because he has been either on supervision, home confinement, or incarcerated for the relevant offense since 2004. Richardson also claims that the 24-month sentence is unreasonable because the district court improperly considered the veracity of his revocation testimony when imposing the sentence. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">When a district court revokes supervised release, it may impose any sentence within the statutory maximum term of imprisonment, taking into account the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) as well as the nonbinding policy statements of Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines codified at \u00a7 3583(e) of the same title. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>520 F.3d 425, 427-28 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">This court recently held that revocation sentences are reviewed under Section 3742(a)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011). We explained that the use of this more deferential standard was appropriate \u201cgiven that the goal of revocation is to punish a defendant for violating the terms of the supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843. That objective is different from the purpose of an offender\u2019s original sentence; therefore, \u201cthe use of different reviewing standards is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\u201cWe evaluate whether the district court procedurally erred before we consider \u2018the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008)). Only if the sentence is unreasonable, do we then consider if the error was \u201cobvious under existing law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">We find no procedural error. Richardson\u2019s contention that the court relied on his credibility as a sentencing factor is inaccurate. The transcript shows that the assessment of his truthfulness may have motivated the court\u2019s determination that the allegations were \u201ctrue and correct,\u201d but played no role in its subsequent sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">Because the 24-month sentence Richardson received on revocation was not greater than what is authorized by statute, it is \u201cclearly legal.\u201d <em>United States v. Pena, </em>125 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Richardson had an extensive history of violations of the conditions of probation and of his supervised release. His 2004 conviction involved counterfeiting of a United States security. Since then, he has numerous violations including theft by check and fraudulent use of identifying information. Based on that history, a 24-month sentence was not plainly unreasonable. We have \u201croutinely upheld release revocation sentences in excess of the advisory range but within the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 265 (5th Cir.2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted). In <em>Whitelaw, </em>we affirmed a 36-month sentence when the policy range from the Guidelines was identical to Richardson\u2019s. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
