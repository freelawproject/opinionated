Because we do not find clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that Ledet was not contributorily negligent nor in its damage award, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">The facts, as found by the district court, are as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-17\">On October 17, 2009, Ledet was assigned to the SMITH HUNTER, a seagoing tug owned by Smith Marine. The crew working with Ledet on that date consisted of Captain Randy Martin, Relief Captain Todd Delaune, and Sean Martin, Captain Martin\u2019s son. The SMITH HUNTER was towing an unloaded offshore deck barge, the Tideland No. 21, from a dock near Amelia, Louisiana to the Eugene Island Sea Buoy in order to release it to the awaiting HARVEY INVADER, a substantially larger tug. The Tideland No. 21 was equipped with its own towing equipment, or \u201cchain bridle,\u201d which consisted of two chains attached to its front corners connected by a \u201cfishplate\u201d and a pendant wire that extended from the fishplate to the SMITH HUNTER. The \u201csocket\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>pendant wire was attached to the \u201chard eye\u201d of the SMITH HUNTER\u2019s \u201csnatch line\u201d by a \u201cshackle.\u201d The snatch line is a double rope connected to the SMITH HUNTER\u2019S towing wench, which is located in the center stern of the vessel. A \u201cshackle\u201d is a metal device that can be opened and closed. Captain Martin testified that the Tideland No. 21\u2019s chain bridle made it different from the barges he had towed on other occasions. In other instances, the tug\u2019s towing gear attached directly to the barge, without the use of a pendant wire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">Before arriving at the Eugene Island Sea Buoy, Captain Martin, Ledet, and Sean Martin convened for a joint safety analysis (JSA), during which they discussed the method for releasing the Tideland No. 21 and its towing equipment to the HARVEY INVADER. Captain Martin instructed Ledet and Sean Martin that they would retrieve the Tideland No. 21\u2019s pendant wire to a point where it would be positioned over the stern deck of the SMITH HUNTER. Captain Martin would then have one of the deckhands insert the SMITH HUNTER\u2019s starboard norman pin into its holster at the extreme stern of the vessel. A norman pin is a four-foot medal rod that sticks up two to three feet from the grating in the stern of the vessel when in place. Once the norman pin was inserted, Captain Martin would pivot the vessel so that the Tideland No. 21\u2019s pendant wire was resting against the norman pin and then instruct the deckhands to tie the pendant wire to the norman pin. The purpose of securing the pendant wire was to allow Martin to create slack in the pendant wire and the snatch line so that the two could be unshackled. During the JSA, there was a miscommunication as to which rope Captain Martin intended for the deckhands to use when tying the pendant wire. Captain Martin wanted the pendant wire tied with a soft, nylon rope that Sean Martin had prepared for that purpose, but Captain Martin did not specify that to Ledet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">After the pendant wire was attached to the norman pin, the deckhands \u2014 while standing on the port side of the vessel\u2014 would then disconnect the shackle linking the Tideland No. 21\u2019s pendant wire to the SMITH HUNTER\u2019s snatch line. Once the shackle was disconnected, the deckhands would then throw a 100-foot line attached to the Tideland No. 21\u2019s towing gear to the HARVEY INVADER from the starboard side of SMITH HUNTER, allowing the HARVEY INVADER\u2019S crew to pull the barge\u2019s towing gear onto that vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">At the JSA, Ledet proposed an alternate method for disconnecting the Tideland No. 21\u2019s towing gear that he had seen used by other captains. Ledet suggested using the SMITH HUNTER\u2019s anchor drum wire, or \u201csuitcase wire,\u201d to secure the Tideland No. 21\u2019s pendant wire during the transfer. The suitcase wire is attached to the anchor drum, which is a small wench located directly below the towing wench in the center stern of the vessel. Under Ledet\u2019s plan, the suitcase wire, which is outfitted with a \u201cpelican hook,\u201d would have been attached to the pendant wire with a second shackle, or \u201cslider,\u201d placed behind the pendant wire\u2019s socket. The suitcase wire would have been used to \u201csuck up\u201d the pendant wire to a point where the crew could disconnect it from the shackle connecting it to the snatch line. Captain Martin rejected Ledet\u2019s proposal to secure the pendant wire with the suitcase wire because tying the pendant wire to the nor-man pin would take less time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">The SMITH HUNTER arrived at the Eugene Island Sea Buoy at approximately 2:30 a.m. Ledet was sleeping in his cabin, and Sean Martin woke him up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>so that Ledet could assist with the transfer. At the time, the sea conditions were somewhat rough, with three-to five-foot waves and wind at 20 to 25 miles per hour. Captain Martin was in the \u201cdoghouse\u201d on the starboard side of the vessel, which provided him with a bird\u2019s-eye view of the stern deck, and he was equipped with a PA system that allowed him to be heard by the deckhands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">Ledet exited the interior of the vessel from the back door on the port side. On his way out, he grabbed a plastic rope hanging near the door. Ledet then approached the norman pin from the port side and used the plastic rope to tie the Tideland No. 21\u2019s pendant wire to the norman pin. Ledet then walked around the bow of the SMITH HUNTER in order to get to the starboard side, where he waited underneath the doghouse. Sometime after, Martin used the PA system to order Ledet to tie the pendant wire to the norman pin using the nylon rope that Sean Martin had prepared. By then, Sean Martin had placed the nylon rope on the starboard grating in the stern of the vessel, adjacent to the norman pin. Following [Captain] Martin\u2019s orders, Ledet approached the norman pin from the starboard side. When Ledet reached the starboard grating, the vessel dipped in the trough of a wave, and the pendant wire came untied and slipped over the norman pin, striking Ledet, throwing him against the vessel\u2019s bulwarks, and knocking him unconscious. At that time, the HARVEY INVADER was pulling up on the starboard side of the SMITH HUNTER and was not yet parallel to the vessel. Although Ledet understood that the starboard side of the vessel was a \u201cpressure zone\u201d or \u201cdanger zone\u201d until the pendant wire was released from the snatch line, he testified that he thought there was slack in the pendant wire at the time Captain Martin ordered him to tie the pendant wire to the norman pin with the nylon rope. Martin also testified that it was his intention to keep slack in the line once the pendant wire was tied to the norman pin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">After the accident, Sean Martin awoke Relief Captain Todd Delaune. Delaune left his sleeping quarters and exited onto the deck from the port side of the vessel. Delaune then proceeded to jump over the snatch line, which was then slack, to reach the starboard side, where Ledet had been thrown by the pendant wire against the bulwarks. Delaune administered first-aid to Ledet and assisted him into the galley. Delaune then went back on deck to unshackle the Tideland No. 21\u2019s pendant wire and transfer it to the HARVEY INVADER from the starboard side. By that time, the HARVEY INVADER had pulled alongside the SMITH HUNTER, which kept the SMITH HUNTER from bouncing in the waves. As a result, the towline was slack on the deck, and Delaune was able to make the transfer quickly without securing the pendant wire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\"><em>Ledet v. Smith Marine Towing Corp., </em>No. 2:10-CV-1713, 2011 WL 1303918, at *1-3 (E.D.La. Apr.4, 2011) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">When the SMITH HUNTER returned to land, Ledet was taken to the hospital where he underwent a CT scan which indicated that he had suffered a compression fracture to his LI vertebra. A few days later, Ledet went to see Dr. Brian Chais-son, who diagnosed Ledet with compression fractures to both his <em>T12 </em>and LI vertebrae, gave Ledet a back brace, and prescribed him pain medication. A subsequent MRI confirmed Chaisson\u2019s diagnosis of fractures to both T12 and LI. About a month after the accident and after wearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the back brace all day, every day without any reduction in pain, Ledet went to see a pain specialist, Dr. Socrates Zapata Cam-pusano. Campusano also diagnosed Ledet with T12 and LI vertebral fractures as well as edemea. Campusano advised Le-det of two strategies to try to combat the pain: kyphoplasty (surgery involving attachment of cement to stabilize compressed vertebrae) or epidural streoid injections to control the pain and decrease inflammation around the area of the trauma. Ledet chose the injections. Because of lingering pain even after receiving the injection, Campusano referred Ledet to Dr. Arthur Ulm, a neurosurgeon. Ulm prescribed Ledet additional pain medication (Lortab).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">After four months of conservative, pain-management-focused treatment, Ulm recommended that Ledet undergo a laminec-tomy. Ledet\u2019s laminectomy was a three-level surgical fusion of his Til to L2 vertebrae. The surgery helped Ledet to a degree, but he still experienced a substantial amount of pain following the surgery. By June 27, 2010, Ledet\u2019s final visit to Ulm, Ulm had concluded that Ledet\u2019s fusion and implants were successful but that \u201chis response with regards to pain has been less than satisfactory.\u201d Ledet\u2019s options going forward were to either have an internal pain pump installed or to continue controlling his pain through oral pain medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Ledet sued Smith Marine on June 10, 2010 in the Eastern District of Louisiana. Ledet sought damages pursuant to the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104 (2006), and general maritime law for injuries he sustained during the October 17, 2009 accident aboard the SMITH HUNTER. A bench trial was held on February 7 and 8, 2011. On April 4, 2011, the district court entered judgment in favor of Ledet, in the amount of $1,894,728.39-$37S,863 in future wage loss; $300,000 past pain and suffering; $1,000,000 in future pain and suffering; $219,379.30 in future medical expenses; and $1,486.09 in additional maintenance. Smith Marine timely appealed, seeking remittitur and review of the district court\u2019s finding that Ledet was not eontributorily negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">\u201cThe standard of review for a bench trial is well established: findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and legal issues are reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>Kona Tech. Corp. v. S. Pac. Transp. Co., </em>225 F.3d 595, 601 (5th Cir.2000). We will only reverse based on clear error if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">(1) the [district court\u2019s] findings are without substantial evidence to support them, (2) the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, and (3) although there is evidence which if credible would be substantial, the force and effect of the testimony, considered as a whole, convinces the court that the findings are so against the preponderance of credible testimony that they do not reflect or represent the truth and right of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-11\"><em>World Wide St. Preachers Fellowship v. Town of Columbia, </em>591 F.3d 747, 752 (5th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). For example, \u201c[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer, </em>470 U.S. 564, 572, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). Embodied in this standard is significant deference to the district court. This deference is even greater when the factual findings are \u201cbased on the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v. FLORA MV, </em>235 F.3d 963, 970 (5th Cir.2001) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)[ (6) ]; <em>Anderson, </em>470 U.S. at 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504). Additionally, \u201c[i]n a bench tried [maritime] case, a district court\u2019s findings concerning negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>gence and causation are findings of fact.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Cenac Towing, Inc., </em>544 F.3d 296, 303 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">A district court\u2019s damages award is a finding of fact reviewed for clear error. <em>Jauch v. Nautical Servs., Inc., 470 F.3d </em>207, 213 (5th Cir.2006). We only reverse an allegedly excessive award on the \u201cstrongest of showings;\u201d that is, when it \u201cexceeds the bounds of reasonable recovery.\u201d <em>LeBron v. United States, </em>279 F.3d 321, 326 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u2018\u201cWe apply the loosely defined \u201cmaximum recovery rule\u201d when deciding whether a remittitur is in order. This judge-made rule essentially provides that we will decline to reduce damages where the amount awarded is not disproportionate to at least <em>one factually similar </em>case from the relevant jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Douglass v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>897 F.2d 1336, 1344 (5th Cir.1990)) (emphasis in original). \u201cThe rule does not necessarily limit an award to the highest amount previously recognized in the state; indeed, the rule does not become operative unless the award exceeds 133% of the highest previous recovery in the relevant jurisdiction for a factually similar case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). \u201cBecause the facts of each case are different, prior damages awards are not always controlling; a departure from prior awards is merited if unique facts are present that are not reflected within the controlling caselaw.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AFg\">A. Comparative Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Smith Marine asserts that Ledet was negligent because he knew that Captain Martin\u2019s plan created a pressure zone and that when he stepped forward beyond the \u201cH-beams\u201d he would be in the pressure zone. Nonetheless, Smith Marine contends, Ledet went ahead and entered the pressure zone, where he was injured. On this point, the district court found that Ledet was reasonable in complying with Captain Martin\u2019s orders, despite the fact that the plan was \u201cconceptually flawed from a safety standpoint from the get go\u201d because of Captain Martin\u2019s \u201csuperior vantage point an control of the vessel.\u201d <em>Ledet, </em>2011 WL 1303918, at *5. Because the district court found that Ledet was following orders, Smith Marine\u2019s argument about Ledet\u2019s own negligence is foreclosed by <em>Williams v. Brasea, Inc., </em>497 F.2d 67 (5th Cir.1974). There we held that \u201ca seaman may not be contributorily negligent for carrying out orders that result in his own injury, even if he recognizes possible danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, as stated above, findings of fact, like that Ledet was not negligent, are even harder to upset when they are based on a credibility determination of the district court. <em>Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Ins., </em>235 F.3d at 970. The district court specifically found that Captain Martin\u2019s testimony was not credible. <em>Ledet, </em>2011 WL 1303918, at *3. Therefore, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that Ledet was not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">B. Remittitur</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Smith Marine further urges error based on the district court\u2019s award of $1.3 million in damages for past and future pain and suffering. Both Smith Marine and Ledet admit that there are relatively few cases from Louisiana involving injuries to the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine to use as comparators for the maximum recovery rule. Ledet points us to <em>Mihalopoulos v. Westwind Africa Line, Ltd., </em>511 So.2d 771 (La.Ct.App.1987), as a suitable comparator. In <em>Mihalopoulos, </em>the plaintiff brought a Jones Act suit against his employer for a serious injury he suffered aboard the M/V DESERT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>PRINCE. <em>Id. </em>at 773. The jury awarded Mihalopoulos $1,125 million in damages, including past and future lost wages, which the appellate court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 780-81. Mihalopoulos, like Ledet, underwent a laminectomy \u2014 Mihalopoulos\u2019s was a single-level where as Ledet\u2019s was a three-level. <em>Id. </em>at 779. Mihalopoulos also lost his livelihood as a seaman and had to have assistance to walk. <em>Id. </em>at 779-80. Admittedly, Mihalopoulos underwent three surgeries, was initially paralyzed, and had other complications such as depression and incontinence \u2014 things that Ledet has not experienced. <em>Id. </em>at 779. Ledet, however, lives with chronic pain that likely cannot be improved. Even if we subtract out the approximately $750,000 that the economic report in <em>Mihalopoulos </em>said were lost wages, there is still a $475,000 verdict in 1987 dollars, which would be about $946,750 today.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Ledet verdict is about 137% of the <em>Mihalopoulos </em>verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">As additional proof of the verdict\u2019s reasonableness, Ledet points to a non-maritime <em>case </em>\u2014 Carrier <em>v. Nobel Insurance Co., </em>817 So.2d 126 (La.Ct.App.2002). In this more recent case, the Louisiana Court of Appeals affirmed a $1,159 million award ($850,000 in past and future pain and suffering plus $300,000 in loss of enjoyment of life), <em>id. </em>at 133, where the plaintiff, after being injured in a car accident, underwent a one-level lumbar fusion, <em>id. </em>at 129. Unlike Ledet, Carrier also had \u201curinary dysfunction and torn shoulder ligaments,\u201d <em>id., </em>but did not suffer chronic pain like Ledet does. One hundred thirty-three percent of the $1,159 million award in <em>Carrier </em>would be over $1.5 million, which is in excess of the district court\u2019s $1.3 million award.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">From the \u201crough guidance\u201d of <em>Mihalopoulos </em>and <em>Carrier, </em>we find the maximum recovery rule to be inapplicable. <em>See Moore v. M/V ANGELA, </em>353 F.3d 376, 385 (5th Cir.2003). Smith Marine has provided us with no other basis to upset the district court\u2019s award; therefore, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s award and affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
