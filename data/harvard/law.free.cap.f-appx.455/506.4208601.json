The district court sentenced him to serve fifty-one months in prison, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. In this appeal, Rodriguez-Rosales charges error in two aspects of the district court\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">First, Rodriguez-Rosales contends that the district court erred by concluding that his prior conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b) is a drug trafficking offense for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 purposes. Our review of the record shows that Rodriguez-Rosales may have waived this issue at sentencing. \u201cNevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, we will review for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.2006). To meet the plain error standard, a defendant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">Rodriguez-Rosales\u2019s claim fails because the error alleged is not clear or obvious. The relevant question here is whether Rodriguez-Rosales\u2019s prior conviction was for using a telecommunications device to facilitate the commission of another crime that was itself a drug trafficking offense. <em>See United States v. Henao-Melo, </em>591 F.3d 798, 803-04 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2392, 176 L.Ed.2d 782 (2010). The Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>asserts that the charging document shows that the underlying offense was for possession of drugs with intent to distribute, a drug trafficking offense. Rodriguez-Rosales asserts that it shows that the underlying offense was for simple possession, which is not a drug trafficking offense. Both parties present colorable arguments in support of their positions, and it is unclear which should prevail. The error is not clear or obvious. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">Next on appeal, Rodriguez-Rosales asserts that the district court plainly erred by assessing one criminal history point for a 2001 conviction that he committed as a juvenile, which did not result in confinement. Rodriguez-Rosales has shown a clear or obvious error in connection with this claim: The challenged conviction did not merit a criminal history point; without this point, Rodriguez-Rosales would have been in a different criminal history category and would have had a different guidelines sentencing range. Nevertheless, he is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">\u201cIn the sentencing context, ... an appellant can show an impact on substantial rights \u2014 and therefore a basis for reversal on plain error review \u2014 where the appellant can show a reasonable probability that, but for the district court\u2019s error, the appellant would have received a lower sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 (5th Cir.2010). The district court sentenced Rodriguez-Rosales using a guidelines range of fifty-one to sixty-three months in prison. Without the incorrectly assessed criminal history point, his correct range would have been forty-six to fifty-seven months. These two ranges overlap, and the fifty-one-month sentence imposed is \u201csquarely in the middle of his corrected\u201d sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Jasso, </em>587 F.3d 706, 713 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-17\">When a disputed sentence falls within both the correct and incorrect guidelines ranges, this court has shown considerable reluctance in finding a reasonable probability that the district court would have settled on a lower sentence\u201d and \u201cdo[es] not assume, in the absence of additional evidence, that the sentence affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Blocker, </em>612 F.3d 418, 416 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 181 S.Ct. 623, 178 L.Ed.2d 452 (2010). Rodriguez-Rosales points to no such evidence, and our review of the record reveals none. His raises only the possibility of a different sentence absent the error; he does not show the probability that is required to meet the plain error standard. <em>See id.; see also Davis, </em>602 F.3d at 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
