The district court dismissed Cloud\u2019s civil rights complaint under the three-strikes provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), determining that Cloud had not made a showing that he was in imminent danger of serious physical injury, and certified that, for the same reasons, Cloud\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-22\">By his motion, Cloud is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). His assertion that \u00a7 1915(g) is unconstitutional because it seeks to chill a prisoner\u2019s access to the courts is without merit. <em>See Carson v. Johnson, </em>112 F.3d 818, 821 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-23\">Our review of the cases relied upon by the district court confirms that Cloud had at least three prior civil rights complaints or appeals dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim and, thus, he has three \u201cstrikes.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>see also Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Cloud v. Webb, </em>54 Fed.Appx. 405 (5th Cir.2002) (affirming dismissal as frivolous of civil rights com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>plaint); <em>Cloud v. Webb, </em>165 F.3d 23 (5th Cir.1998) (dismissing as frivolous appeal following dismissal as frivolous of civil rights complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Cloud does not provide any details of the confrontation with or threats made by another inmate allegedly at the behest of one of the defendants. Even with the benefit of liberal construction, Cloud\u2019s bare assertions that he has been threatened at unspecified dates in the past by inmates who have beaten other inmates at the direction of one of the defendants does not rise to the level of a showing that he was in \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d when he filed his complaint. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>see also Ba\u00f1os v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 884-85 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Because Cloud has failed to present a nonfrivolous issue regarding the district court\u2019s certification, his motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. As the facts surrounding Cloud\u2019s motion to proceed IFP are inextricably intertwined with the merits of this appeal, the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Cloud is CAUTIONED that any future frivolous filings will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b558-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
