United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the Supreme Court established a bifurcated process for conducting a reasonableness review. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). We must determine first whether the district court committed any procedural errors, including \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If we determine that the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, we will \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence that falls within the applicable guidelines range \u201cis presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding the application of the presumption of reasonableness to sentences within a properly calculated guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Contrary to Verma\u2019s contention, the five-level increase imposed by the district court pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) was warranted; the district court\u2019s determination that Verma\u2019s possession of the images in question constituted relevant conduct is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Ekanem, </em>555 F.3d 172, 175 (5th Cir.2009). As Verma fails to identify any ambiguity in \u00a7 2G2.2(a), we reject his contention that the rule of lenity requires that he be afforded a lower base offense level. <em>See United States v. Shabani, </em>513 U.S. 10, 17, 115 S.Ct. 382, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">The district court\u2019s explicit recognition of the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines belies Verma\u2019s contention that it did not understand its authority to deviate from the guidelines range. As for Verma\u2019s contention on appeal that the district court failed adequately to explain the reasons for the sentence imposed, his failure to object on this basis in the district court limits our review to plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). As Verma fails to show that his sentence would have been different had the district court offered a fuller explanation for it, he fails to show plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 365 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">Although Verma asserts that the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence by rejecting his various policy arguments assailing \u00a7 2G2.2, including that \u00a7 2G2.2 deserves no deference because it lacks empirical support, we will not second-guess the district court\u2019s sentencing decision on such grounds. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 367. The fact that we might rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>sonably conclude that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
