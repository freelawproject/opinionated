After a review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-19\">Haynes, a citizen of Jamaica, had been deported after his conviction for a drug-related offense, later reentered the United States without permission, and was arrested after he used a false birth certificate to obtain an Arizona driver\u2019s license under an assumed name. When he was arrested, he presented this driver\u2019s license and falsely claimed to be a U.S. citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-20\">The district court determined the applicable guidelines range to be 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. Haynes\u2019s criminal history included a prior drug conviction and also cited his previous deportation, other drug-related charges, presenting false identification, and a firearms charge. Haynes urged the court to consider his difficult childhood in Jamaica, the threats he faced in Jamaica based on his father\u2019s political activities, and his cooperation with authorities. The government noted that Haynes had multiple children by numer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>ous women, lacked steady employment, and had distributed drugs during a previous stay in the United States. The district court considered Haynes\u2019s request to sentence him below the advisory guideline range and the government\u2019s argument that Haynes was a likely recidivist before denying Haynes\u2019s request for a downward variance. After listening to the parties\u2019 arguments and considering the statutory factors, the court stated that it found no reason to depart or vary from a guideline sentence and thus sentenced Haynes to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">On appeal, Haynes argues that the court failed to explain the sentence adequately and failed to give proper weight to his cooperation with authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1229 (11th Cir.2007). The reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first look to whether the district court committed procedural error, and then we look to whether the sentence was substantively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, <em>1378 </em>(11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Procedural unreasonableness includes \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence....\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). The court need not \u201cstate on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or [] discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Rather, it is sufficient for the district court to have considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in light of all the facts and circumstances, as indicated in the sentencing hearing record. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">A sentence is substantively unreasonable if, based on the totality of the circumstances, the district court committed a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a). A clear error of judgment occurs when the district court\u2019s decision is outside of the \u201crange of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Within that range, however, the \u201cweight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Although we do not presume that a sentence falling within the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range is reasonable, we do ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Here, we conclude that Haynes\u2019s sentence was both proeedurally and substantively reasonable. The court requested testimony and argument relating to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, stated on the record that it considered the statutory factors as well as Haynes\u2019s arguments, and subsequently stated in open court that it found no reason to vary from the applicable guideline range. The sentence was also substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. The 41-month sentence was at the low end of the applicable guideline range and well below the statutory maximum sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). We generally leave the weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the district court, and will only reverse if the court commits a clear error of judgment. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190. Haynes has failed to show that the sentence imposed was outside the range of reasonable sentences based on the facts of this case or that the court failed to consider his cooperation as a factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-9\">. Haynes's sentence consisted of 41 months for his illegal reentry count and 36 months for impersonating a U.S. citizen, to run concurrently. The statutory maximum for the illegal reentry was 20 years' imprisonment; for impersonating a U.S. citizen, the statutory maximum sentence was 3 years. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
