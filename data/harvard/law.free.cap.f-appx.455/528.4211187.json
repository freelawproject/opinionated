Fearce did not file a timely notice of appeal after the district court sentenced him to 240 months of imprisonment. He later initiated 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings, challenging, among other things, his trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness for not filing a direct appeal despite a request to do so. The district court granted Fearce the right to file an out-of-time appeal and dismissed his remaining \u00a7 2255 claims without prejudice. The district court, however, did not reenter the judgment of conviction. Thus, Fearce\u2019s instant notice of appeal was filed more than three years after the original criminal judgment was entered against him and before the reentry of the criminal judgment, and it is untimely. <em>See United States v. West, </em>240 F.3d 456, 459-60 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). However, the time limit for filing a criminal appeal is not jurisdictional and can be waived. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388-89 (5th Cir.2007). Because the Government does not oppose Fearce\u2019s out-of-time appeal, it has waived the application of Rule 4(b). Accordingly, we may address Fearce\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-18\">Fearce argues that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel who Fearce alleges (1) advised him to plead guilty without informing him of all the essential elements of the charges to which he was pleading; (2) promised him he would receive a ten-year sentence in exchange for giving up his rights to a jury trial; and (3) failed to challenge the pre-sentence report which Fearce says overstated the seriousness of his criminal history and impermissibly and erroneously double counted convictions and criminal history points. He contends that, as result of counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the district court imposed a sentence that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>both procedurally and substantively unreasonable for a variety of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The record has not been sufficiently developed to allow consideration of Fearce\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and Fearce has not shown that this court should make an exception to the general rule that such claims generally are not resolved on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006). A postconviction motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255 is the appropriate vehicle for Fearce\u2019s claims that trial counsel was ineffective. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>588 U.S. 500, 504-06, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). We note, however, that Fearce has already raised at least one similar claim before the district court in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion which was dismissed without prejudice pending the outcome of his reinstated direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, </em>211 F.3d 862, 871 n. 15 (5th Cir.2000). Fearce has the option of presenting any previously raised, but unadjudicated, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel to the district court for consideration on the merits. <em>See id. </em>We express no opinion as to which claims Fearce can successfully assert as opposed to others that may be barred by AEDPA\u2019s restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d motions. <em>See id. </em>at 867-68; <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b553-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
