His sentence was increased based on an incident that resulted in convictions under Washington law for third-degree assault and \u201cFelony Harassment \u2014 Domestic Violence.\u201d Rivas contends that neither of the Washington offenses was a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Because Rivas raises the claims for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, 557 </em>F.3d 200, 205 (5th Cir.2009). To prevail, Rivas must show an error that is \u201cclear and obvious, rather than subject to reasonable debate.\u201d <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377-78 (5th Cir.2009). He also must show that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429. If he makes these showings, we have the discretion to correct the error if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1429 (internal quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-15\">The relevant definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in this case is the residual definition of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. (l)(B)(iii)), which is an \u201coffense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d As this residual definition is indistinguishable from the \u201chas as an element\u201d residual definitions set forth in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a), we may rely on authorities discussing those definitions. Under the residual definition of crime of violence, \u201cthe use of physical force must be a fact that is necessary for the prosecution to secure a conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Velasco, </em>465 F.3d 633, 638 (5th Cir.2006). \u201c[T]he phrase \u2018physical force\u2019 means <em>violent </em>force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1271, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010) (discussing the catchall definition found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-18\">Rivas contends, and the government concedes, that the third-degree assault conviction under Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.36.031(l)(f) was not a crime of violence because it required only \u201ccriminal negligence.\u201d <em>Cf. Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 9-10, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004) (holding that negligence does not satisfy the physical force requirement for a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16). We need not decide this issue however, because we affirm on the ground that the district court did not commit plain error by treating Rivas\u2019s alternate convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>tion for harassment under Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.46.020(1) as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Section 9A.46.020(1) provides that a person commits harassment if he knowingly <em>threatens </em>either to cause bodily injury, to cause physical damage to property, to subject a person \u201cto physical confinement or restraint; or ... [mjaliciously to do any other act which is intended to substantially harm the person threatened or another with respect to his or her physical or mental health or safety; and [that he] places the person threatened in reasonable fear that the threat will be carried out.\u201d \u00a7 9A.46.020(1). Rivas argues only that \u201cbodily injury\u201d is not an element of violent force and thus does not render a violation a crime of violence. He relies on <em>United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d 874, 879 (5th Cir.2006), in which we held that a Texas statute penalizing the infliction of bodily harm did not have as an element the requisite use of violent force required to render it a crime of violence. <em>Villegas-Hemandez, </em>however, did not concern a threat of harm accompanied by placing the victim in a reasonable fear of harm. <em>See Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The government asserts that only a threat of violent force would satisfy the Washington statute\u2019s requirement that the victim be placed in a reasonable fear of harm and, accordingly, that a threat of violent force is an implicit but necessary element of the Washington harassment crime. There is support for the government\u2019s position. In <em>United States v. Mohr, </em>554 F.3d 604, 610 (5th Cir.2009), we decided that a South Carolina stalking offense was a crime of violence. The stalking statute did not explicitly require the use of force but defined stalking as \u201ca pattern of words ... or a pattern of conduct that ... is intended to cause and does cause a targeted person and would cause a reasonable person in the targeted person\u2019s position to fear\u201d death, assault, bodily injury, criminal sexual contact, kidnaping, or property damage. <em>See id. </em>at 608 (quoting former S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-3-1700(B)(2002), now S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-3-1700(0(2005)). We reasoned that \u201cwords or conduct that are intended to cause and do cause reasonable fear of death, assault, injury etc., pose at least as much risk of physical injury as the \u2018threatened use of force\u2019 [that] automatically qualifies the offense as a crime of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In an analogous context, the Eleventh Circuit explicitly embraced the reasoning put forth by the government, finding it \u201cinconceivable that any act which causes the victim to fear death or great bodily harm would not involve the use or threatened use of physical force.\u201d <em>United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1245 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">As this appeal involves only plain-error review, we are not required to decide conclusively whether the Washington harassment offense is a crime of violence under the residual definition. This is because the government\u2019s argument and our examination of the law reveal that Rivas\u2019s claim is at least \u201csubject to reasonable debate.\u201d As such, he has not shown an error that is clear or obvious. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429; <em>Ellis, </em>564 F.3d at 377-78. As Rivas has not shown plain error, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b556-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
