The court also dismissed the bank\u2019s interpleader action and ordered the interpleaded account funds returned to the bank. The bank has since surrendered the funds to the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">In this appeal, Michael Cox emphatically does not challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, as he agrees \u2014 for his own eccentric reasons\u2014 that the court lacked jurisdiction. He does not want the case reinstated in federal court; instead, he wants this court to order the district court to remand the interpleader action back to state court from whence it came. Mr. Cox fundamentally misunderstands the jurisprudence applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-18\">The federal district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1) to decide that the United States had not waived its sovereign immunity in this case. When it did so, there was no further basis for jurisdiction over the interpleader action because there were not two adverse claimants to the bank account. When the district court dismissed the case and returned the funds to the bank, it lost control over those funds completely.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-19\">The court\u2019s action simply placed Cox and the bank in their respective pre-suit positions. As this court explained in a similar case, because the district court returned the funds in question, those funds are now gone, and the question of who is entitled to those funds is moot. <em>Settlement Funding v. Transamerica Occidental Life, </em>555 F.3d 422, 426 n. 4 (5th Cir.2009). Here, the federal district court, having given up control of the funds and dismissed the bank from this action, cannot now exercise jurisdiction over the bank\u2019s property by remanding the suit to state court. Neither the district court nor this court can resurrect jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>funds that have been disbursed from the court\u2019s registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Judgment AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b523-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
