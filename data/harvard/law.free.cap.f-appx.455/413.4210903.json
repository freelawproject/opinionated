Pollett raised numerous additional claims in the district court that he did not brief here; therefore, those claims have been abandoned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-18\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Pollett\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the appeal of Pollett\u2019s motion for a restraining order/preliminary injunction is moot because Aurora has already foreclosed on his home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, we dismiss those claims respectively for lack of jurisdiction and for mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>With respect to Pollett\u2019s assertion that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against Aurora for fraud and for wrongful foreclosure, we review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to suggest a plausible ground for relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The district court correctly determined that Pollett had failed to state a claim for wrongful foreclosure under Texas law because he failed to plead all elements of that cause of action. In particular, he failed to allege (1) that his home sold for a grossly inadequate selling price and (2) a causal connection between a defect in the foreclosure sale proceedings and the grossly inadequate selling price.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Likewise, the district court did not err in dismissing Pollett\u2019s fraud claim against Aurora because he did not plead this claim with specificity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although he alleged that Aurora told him to default on his mortgage so that he would qualify for a loan modification and that it would not foreclose despite the default, he did not allege in the district court when and where Aurora\u2019s allegedly fraudulent statements were made.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">With respect to Pollett\u2019s challenge to the dismissal of Belvidere for lack of timely service, the district court dismissed Belvidere before 120 days from the date Belvidere was named as a defendant had elapsed. Further, the court failed to give Pollett notice of its intent to dismiss Belvidere.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, even if the district court abused its discretion,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we can \u201caffirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any grounds supported by the record.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The only claim that Pollett raises on appeal with respect to Belvidere is that it engaged in predatory lending practices under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) because it sold him a loan that was designed to be unaffordable. Pollett has failed to state a claim against Belvidere pursuant to the DTPA because he alleges only that Belvidere sold him a loan that was designed to be unaffordable and that it should not have done so. Pollett has not alleged sufficient facts to suggest a plausible ground for relief because he has not adequately alleged (1) that he was victimized by false, misleading, or deceptive acts, failures to disclose, or an unconscionable course of action, (2) which was a \u201cproducing cause\u201d of damages.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims against Belvidere on this alternate ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Pollett\u2019s motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> wherein he argued that the substitute trustee was prohibited by Texas Property Code \u00a7 51.0074(b)(1) from advocating on Aurora\u2019s behalf at the injunction hearing. Because Pollett presented no evidence establishing the identity of the substitute trustee or any authority supporting his position, he has failed to establish that the district court based its decision to deny his motion on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION AND IN PART AS MOOT; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
