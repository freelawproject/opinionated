Green contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. Because Green did not move for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence, we review the claim under the more stringent \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice\u201d standard. <em>See United States v. Avants, </em>367 F.3d 433, 449 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cUnder this exacting standard of review, a claim of evidentiary insufficiency will be rejected unless the record is devoid of evidence pointing to guilt or if the evidence is so tenuous that a conviction is shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>477 F.3d 215, 219 (5th Cir.2007) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Green has not shown that the record is devoid of evidence of guilt or that the evidence was so tenuous that his conviction is shocking. <em>See Phillips, </em>477 F.3d at 219. The testimony of accomplices Joshua Smith and Justin Mosqueda and of cab driver Edgar Girral, as well as the surveillance video at Wal-Mart, established that Green was the black man who participated in the robbery of the Cricket Store, that Green possessed and fired a firearm during the robbery, that the robbers \u2014 Smith, Mosqueda, and Green \u2014 took a cab to a Wal-Mart store immediately afterward, and that they divided the money from the robbery at the Wal-Mart store. <em>See United States v. Rasco, </em>128 F.3d 222, 229 (5th Cir.1997) (holding that a defendant may be convicted based on the uncorroborated testimony of a coconspirator). The testimony of Smith and Mosque-da alone was sufficient even though they were \u201cinterested due to a plea bargain or promise of leniency, unless the testimony is incredible or insubstantial on its face.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bermea, </em>30 F.3d 1539, 1552 (5th Cir.1994). Green does not argue that the testimony of Smith and Mosqueda was incredible or insubstantial on its face. Further, the credibility of Smith and Mos-queda was a matter for the jury, and this court will not reevaluate the jury\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See United States v. Ramos-Cardenas, </em>524 F.3d 600, 605 (5th Cir.2008). Green does not dispute that he was a convicted felon at the time of the robbery. The testimony of Officer Silvio established that Green knowingly possessed a short-barreled shotgun at the time of his arrest, as the barrel of the shotgun was protruding from Green\u2019s backpack. In view of the evidence, the jury could infer that Green knowingly possessed the firearm. <em>See United States v. Fuchs, </em>467 F.3d 889, 904 (5th Cir.2006). Further, the Government presented ballistics evidence that linked the shotgun in Green\u2019s possession at the time of his arrest to the one used in the robbery. Therefore, the record is not devoid of evidence of Green\u2019s guilt or so tenuous that his convictions are shocking. <em>See Phillips, </em>477 F.3d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Green argues that the admission of his identification by Girral, the cab driver who drove the three robbers from the Cricket Store to a Wal-Mart store immediately after the robbery, violated his due process rights because police presented Girral with still photographs from the Wal-Mart surveillance video before he was able to make a 100 percent positive identification. Green asserts that the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">We need not decide whether it was error to admit Girral\u2019s identification because any error would be harmless, as the evidence of Green\u2019s guilt was not only \u201csufficient\u201d but was \u201cso overwhelming as to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See United States v. Watkins, </em>741 F.2d 692, 695 (5th Cir.1984). The evidence was sufficient to support Green\u2019s convictions even without Girral\u2019s testimony: Mosqueda and Smith testified that Green and Smith robbed the Cricket Store while Mosqueda located a cab as a a getaway vehicle; the Government introduced the surveillance video of a Wal-Mart store, showing Smith, Mosqueda, and Green together shortly after the robbery; Officer Silvio testified that at the time of Green\u2019s arrest, Green was carrying a backpack with the barrel of a shotgun protruding out of the top of it; and the shotgun had a short barrel and was linked through ballistics evidence to the one used in the robbery. In view of the totality of the circumstances including all of the evidence against Green, the admission of Girral\u2019s identification testimony, if it was error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>was harmless error. <em>See Watkins, </em>741 F.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Green argues that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A) because the victim\u2019s ringing in his ears was not qualifying a bodily injury. The district court did not clearly err in finding that the victim had a bodily injury as he suffered temporary hearing loss, irritation, and continuing ringing in his ears as a result of Green\u2019s firing a shotgun toward the wall approximately three to four inches away from his face. <em>See United States v. Jefferson, </em>258 F.3d 405, 413-14 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Maiden, </em>606 F.3d 337, 339-40 (7th Cir.2010) (upholding enhancement where defendant used mace causing victim to suffer burning sensation in her eyes and to be unable to wear contact lenses); <em>United States v. Hoelzer, </em>183 F.3d 880, 882-83 (8th Cir.1999) (affirming enhancement where store clerk suffered bruises to her face, chest, and legs); <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>132 F.3d 1324, 1326 (10th Cir.1997) (affirming enhancement where victim sustained \u201csmall laceration and bruising\u201d and continued neck and shoulder pain); <em>United States v. Greene, </em>964 F.2d 911 (9th Cir.1992) (affirming enhancement where a victim was slapped in the face, causing pain, swelling, and redness). Because the victim suffered temporary hearing loss, irritation, continued ringing in his ears from the time of the robbery to the time of the trial, and sought medical attention for the problem and received prescriptions, the district court did not clearly err in imposing the enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(A). <em>See United States v. Griffith, </em>522 F.3d 607, 611-12 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
