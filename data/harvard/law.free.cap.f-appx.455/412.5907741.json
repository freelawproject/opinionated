After serving his term of imprisonment, he was released and began serving his term of supervised release. He violated the conditions of his supervised release when he robbed a bank. The district court revoked Black\u2019s supervised release and imposed a 12-month term of imprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised release. Black now appeals his revocation sentence, arguing that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583, the district court was not authorized to impose a five-year term of supervised release. He argues that under \u00a7 3583(b)(1), the applicable maximum term of supervised release is five years, and under \u00a7 3583(h), any period of incarceration imposed as a result of the revocation of supervised release must be deducted from that five year maximum supervised release term. Therefore, he argues, his 12-month term of imprisonment must be subtracted from the five-year maximum term of supervised release, leaving a maximum of only four years of supervised release to which the district court could sentence him.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-21\">A sentence that exceeds the statutory maximum is an illegal sentence and therefore constitutes plain error; review of the issue is thus de novo. <em>See United States v. Vera, </em>542 F.3d 457, 459 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-22\">Black\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3583 for a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) is contrary to circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>559 F.3d 368, 370 (5th Cir.2009). Black correctly notes that under \u00a7 3583(h), the length of a term of supervised release imposed upon revocation \u201cshall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d \u00a7 3583(h). However, under the plain language of \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) (the \u201cstatute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release\u201d), there is no limit on the length of supervised release that may be imposed upon conviction for the offenses listed therein or, consequently, upon revocation of the term of supervised release imposed for such a conviction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Since \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) does not specify a maximum term of supervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>release, the maximum is life. <em>See Jackson, 559 </em>F.3d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Black\u2019s reliance on Vera is misplaced because that case involved a conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324, not a conviction under \u00a7 841. <em>See Vera, </em>542 F.3d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Black\u2019s revocation sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
