On appeal, Gilmore argues that the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s (\u201cDOL\u201d) Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Program (\u201cOWCP\u201d) failed to properly implement the decision of the DOL\u2019s Employees\u2019 Compensation-Appeals Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d), dated February 23, 2005, that required the OWCP to restore his full benefits and make retroactive payments. He maintains that the OWCP\u2019s actions were a violation of his Fifth Amendment due process rights. Gilmore also states that pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, the district court retained jurisdiction to enforce the Board\u2019s 2005 decision because he was not asking for a review of the facts of the case, but rather, seeking an adjustment of benefits previously awarded, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and construe the facts favorably to the plaintiff. <em>Parise v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1463, 1465 (11th Cir.1998). To establish jurisdiction, \u201cthe pleader must affirmatively allege facts- demonstrating the existence of jurisdiction and include \u2018a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court\u2019s jurisdiction depends.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Appleton, </em>30 F.3d 1365, 1367 (11th Cir.1994) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)). Although we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings, <em>pro se </em>litigants nonetheless are required to abide by procedural rules. <em>Moton v. Cowart, </em>631 F.3d 1337, 1341 n. 2 (11th Cir.2011). The district court has an obligation to look behind the label of a <em>pro se </em>motion and, if possible, interpret it as any request for relief over which the court may have jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-18\">Federal courts have limited jurisdiction and are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, </em>405 F.3d 964, 975 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Univ. of S. Ala. v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>168 F.3d 405, 410 (11th Cir.1999)). If at any time during the proceedings the court determines that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, \u201cthe court must dismiss the action.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3). \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. However, even a claim that arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States may be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction if (1) \u201cthe alleged claim under the Constitution or federal statutes clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction,\u201d or (2) \u201csuch a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u201d <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala. v. Sanders, </em>138 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">The FECA is a comprehensive and exclusive workers\u2019 compensation scheme for federal civilian employees who are injured or killed while performing their work duties. <em>Noble v. United States, </em>216 F.3d 1229, 1234 (11th Cir.2000). Central to the FECA\u2019s statutory scheme is the Secretary of Labor (the \u201cSecretary\u201d), who has the authority to administer and decide all questions arising under the FECA. <em>Id. </em>The Secretary has delegated its authority to oversee the FECA\u2019s administration and implementation to the Director of the OWCP. <em>Id. </em>The Secretary retains the ability to review an award for or against payment of benefits at any time on his own motion, or by application. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">However, the FECA bars judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decision allowing or denying an award of benefits. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b). The Supreme Court has noted that the \u201cFECA contains an \u2018unambiguous and comprehensive\u2019 provision barring any judicial review of the Secretary of Labor\u2019s determination of FECA coverage.\u201d <em>Sw. Marine, Inc. v. Gizoni, </em>502 U.S. 81, 90, 112 S.Ct. 486, 116 L.Ed.2d 405 (1991) (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201c[cjonclusions of law and fact made by the Secretary or the [Employees\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board] are also immune from judicial review.\u201d <em>Woodruff v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>954 F.2d 634, 637 (11th Cir.1992) (citation omitted). However, there are two instances in which a federal court may exercise jurisdiction over a final decision of the Secretary under the FECA, namely, when (1) a clear statutory mandate or prohibition has been violated, or (2) there is a colorable constitutional claim. <em>Id. </em>at 639-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Gilmore alleges several constitutional and statutory violations by the Director of the OWCP. However, the only matters of substance that would fall within the two exceptions to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b) are Gilmore\u2019s assertions that the Director deprived him of his substantive and procedural due process rights. Gilmore alleges that he suffered a deprivation of property (back pay and interest) when the Director failed to implement the Board\u2019s February 2005 decision. However, a review of that decision shows no entitlement to back pay and interest \u2014 only that the OWCP should have considered a modification of Gilmore\u2019s wage-earning capacity based on his alleged recurrence of total disability. On remand, the OWCP concluded that a modification was not warranted and further denied Gilmore\u2019s motion for reconsideration. As the OWCP\u2019s decision was based on a factual inquiry, it is immune from judicial review. <em>Woodruff, </em>954 F.2d at 637 (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b)). As for the alleged procedural due process claim, the Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he fundamental requirement of due process is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>opportunity to be heard \u2018at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, (1976) (citation omitted). Gilmore does not demonstrate a deprivation of the opportunity to notice or hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Because the record demonstrates that Gilmore failed to show that the Director violated a clear statutory mandate or assert a colorable constitutional claim, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed his complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
