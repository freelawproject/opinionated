Urias, Texas prisoner # 1189938, was convicted by a jury of aggravated sexual assault of a child, enhanced, and sentenced to life in prison. Urias instituted an action in the district court by filing a motion for the appointment of counsel pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A. The district court denied Uri-as\u2019s motion, which was the only relief sought by Urias, and dismissed the action. This appeal followed. We review the district court\u2019s denial of Urias\u2019s motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987) (considering the denial of a motion for the appointment of counsel in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 case filed by a prisoner).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">No constitutional right to counsel exists in federal postconviction proceedings. <em>Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987). However, under Rule 8(c) of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases, \u201cif an evidentiary hearing is warranted, the [district court] must appoint an attorney to represent a petitioner who qualifies to have counsel appointed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A.\u201d Furthermore, under \u00a7 3006A(a)(2)(B), a \u00a7 2254 petitioner should be appointed counsel when \u201cthe interests of justice so require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">The district court concluded that Urias\u2019s motion was premature. Because. Urias had not actually filed a \u00a7 2254 petition, he had not raised any issues requiring an evidentiary hearing; thus, Urias was not entitled to appointed counsel under Rule 8(c) of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases. Urias has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion. <em>See Cupit, </em>835 F.2d at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Urias\u2019s motion for default judgment is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b547-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
