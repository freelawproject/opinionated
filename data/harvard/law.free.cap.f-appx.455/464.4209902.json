We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Morris contends that the district court erred in failing to order sua sponte an evidentiary hearing to determine if the Government had breached the plea agreement in bad faith by not moving for a departure below the statutory minimum sentence based on his substantial assistance to the Government; that the district court erred by failing to depart sua sponte below the guidelines range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, based on his cooperation with local enforcement agencies before his federal indictment; and that his right to due process was infringed because there is no bad faith exception to the motion requirement for a downward departure for substantial assistance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Morris further contends that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not moving for specific performance of the plea agreement and by not moving for a downward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0 based on his cooperation with local law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Because Morris raised none of these issues in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, Morris must at minimum point to an error that is clear or obvious. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). As explained below, Morris cannot show plain error because he can show no error at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">We reject Morris\u2019s contentions that the Government breached the plea agreement and that the district court should have proceeded on its own initiative to inquire about the Government\u2019s reason for not moving for a departure for substantial assistance, a reason that Morris claims was rooted in bad faith. Section 3553(e) authorizes a district court to depart below a statutory minimum if the Government so moves based on the defendant\u2019s having provided substantial assistance to it, with the court to be guided in its sentencing decision by the factors set forth in \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>Melendez v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 120, 129-31 &amp; n. 9, 116 S.Ct. 2057, 135 L.Ed.2d 427 (1996). The Government has the discretion, not the duty, to file such a motion. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Without such a motion a court may not grant a downward departure for substantial assistance. <em>United States v. Krumnow, </em>476 F.3d 294, 297 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">The plea agreement makes it clear that Morris did not bargain for a substantial assistance departure but only for the possibility of one \u2014 a possibility entirely dependent on the Government\u2019s exercising its contractually unfettered discretion in the matter. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>95 F.3d 364, 368 (5th Cir.1996). Also, the district court was without authority to question the Government\u2019s choice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>not to move for a substantial assistance departure because Morris did not allege that the Government\u2019s choice pivoted on an unconstitutional basis (e.g., Morris\u2019s race or religion or another reason \u201cnot rationally related to any legitimate Government end\u201d). <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Consequently, Morris\u2019s \u201cunadorned [suggestion] of general arbitrariness must fail.\u201d <em>United States v. Urbani, </em>967 F.2d 106, 110 (5th Cir.1992). Morris thus fails to demonstrate that the district court had a basis on which to conduct an evidentiary hearing concerning the Government\u2019s decision. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840; <em>Urbani, </em>967 F.2d at 110-11. We also reject Morris\u2019s claim that his due process rights were violated by the lack of a bad faith exception to the rule that a Government motion is necessary for a substantial assistance departure. <em>See United States v. Aderholt, </em>87 F.3d 740, 742-43 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Morris asserts that he cooperated with local law enforcement officials before he was indicted in the instant case and is therefore entitled to a downward departure under \u00a7 5K2.0 because there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance not taken into account elsewhere in the Guidelines. Morris is mistaken. Section 5K2.0 does \u201cnot authorize a departure from a statutory minimum sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>382 F.3d 489, 498 (5th Cir.2004); <em>see also Krumnow, </em>476 F.3d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">We dismiss Morris\u2019s ineffectiveness claims without prejudice to Morris\u2019s right to raise them in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See United States v. Stevens, </em>487 F.3d 232, 245 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 560, 581 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
