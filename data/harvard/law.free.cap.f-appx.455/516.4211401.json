He argues that the district court plainly erred in considering punishment in imposing his sentence. During the pendency of this appeal, Hayes completed his sentence of imprisonment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>and he has no further term of imprisonment or supervised release to serve. The appeal is, therefore, moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 14, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the APPEAL IS DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
