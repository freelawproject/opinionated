Cordeschi acknowledges that she was granted voluntary departure in 2004, but argues that she was unable to depart in accord with her voluntary departure order because she had to care for her sick husband, who is a United States citizen and, at the time, a return to her native country, Argentina, was difficult due to political strife. She argues that she is eligible to adjust her status to that of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>lawful permanent resident based on her marriage to a United States citizen, and the BIA abused its discretion by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>our subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWe lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted [her] administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">As an initial matter, Cordeschi exhausted her administrative remedies with respect to the arguments she proffers in her petition for review. In her brief to the BIA, Cordeschi argued that changed circumstances, in the form of her husband\u2019s diagnosis with prostate cancer, as well as dire country conditions, warranted reopening her case and excused her failure to depart. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review these claims. <em>See Id. </em>at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Where, as here, the BIA issued its own decision, without expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning, we review the BIA\u2019s decision only. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of the a motion to reopen removal proceedings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009). The moving party bears a \u201cheavy burden,\u201d and judicial review \u201cis limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Ordinarily, an alien who is subject to a final order of removal and wishes to reopen the proceedings may file one motion to reopen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A). This motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of the final removal order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Nevertheless, the time limit is inapplicable if the alien can demonstrate \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). An alien cannot circumvent the requirement of changed country conditions by demonstrating only a change in his personal circumstances. <em>Zhang, </em>572 F.3d at 1319. \u201cAn alien who attempts to show that the evidence is material bears a heavy burden and must present evidence that demonstrates that, if the proceedings were opened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">\u201cVoluntary departure is a discretionary form of relief that allows certain favored aliens \u2014 either before the conclusion of removal proceedings or after being found deportable \u2014 to leave the country willingly.\u201d <em>Dada v. Mukasey, </em>554 U.S. 1, 8, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 2312, 171 L.Ed.2d 178 (2008). \u201cWhen voluntary departure is requested at the conclusion of removal proceedings, as it was in this case, the statute provides a voluntary departure period of not more than 60 days.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 128 S.Ct. at 2313 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(2)). \u201cThe alien can receive up to 120 days if he or she concedes removability and requests voluntary departure before or during removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(a)(2)(A)). \u201cThe voluntary departure period in no event may exceed 60 or 120 days for \u00a7\u00a7 1229c(b) and 1229c(a) departures, respectively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(f) (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>The failure to timely depart, in accord with a voluntary departure, renders an alien ineligible, for a period of 10 years for adjustment of status. <em>Id. </em>at 18, 128 S.Ct. at 2818 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d)(l)). \u201cIn return for anticipated benefits, including the possibility of readmission, an alien who requests voluntary departure represents that he or she has the means to depart the United States and intends so do so promptly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 128 S.Ct. at 2819 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(l)(D); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1240.26(c)(1 )-(2)) (internal quotation marks omitted). One of the substantive burdens imposed upon the alien when selecting voluntary departure is the obligation to arrange for departure, and actually depart, within the proscribed time period, and substantive limitations are not subject to equitable tolling. <em>Id. </em>at 19, 128 S.Ct. at 2319 (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he alien has the option either to abide by the terms, and receive the agreed-upon benefits, of voluntary departure; or, alternatively, to forgo those benefits and remain in the United States to pursue an administrative motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 128 S.Ct. at 2319-20. \u201cIf the alien selects the latter option, ... she gives up the possibility of readmission and becomes subject to the IJ\u2019s alternate order of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 128 S.Ct. at 2320 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The relevant statutory provision, INA \u00a7 240B(d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d), states that an alien, who fails to depart timely pursuant to a grant of voluntary departure, is ineligible for adjustment of status for 10 years, and it does not provide for the consideration of exceptional circumstances in making this ineligibility determination. <em>Ugokwe v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>453 F.3d 1325, 1328 n. 5 (11th Cir.2006) (stating that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, specifically excised statutory language in the INA which stated that \u201cany alien allowed to depart voluntarily ... who remains in the United States after the scheduled date of departure, other than because of exceptional circumstances, shall not be eligible for relief\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Cordeschi\u2019s motion to reopen. First, Cordeschi\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely, as she waited nearly 5 years to file it, and such a motion is normally required within 90 days. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Second, no exception\u2014 such as changed country conditions \u2014 applied. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Third, she made no showing that the outcome would have been different if her motion to reopen was granted. <em>See Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Specifically, Cordeschi had until March 16, 2005, to voluntarily depart the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order. She concedes that she failed to depart. Her arguments with regard to \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d or \u201cchanged country\u201d conditions are immaterial and inapposite with regard to the adjustment of status that she sought. <em>See Dada, </em>554 U.S. at 18, 128 S.Ct. at 2318; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). She failed to voluntarily depart in the time afforded to her, and she is subsequently ineligible for adjustment of status for 10 years, regardless of any consideration of exceptional circumstances. <em>Ugokwe, </em>453 F.3d at 1328 n. 5; <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d). Because we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Cordeschi\u2019s motion to reopen, we deny her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
