Oscar Mejia DIAZ, also known as Oscar Diaz Mejia, also known as Oscar Diaz-Mejia, also known as Oscar Mejia-Diaz, also known as Oscar Mejia, also known as Pedro Gutierrez, also known as Leonides Mejia, also known as Leonides Diaz Mejia, also known as Marcos Torres Mejia, also known as Leonides Metia, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b515-10\">No. 11-20277</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"A6f\">Summary Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b515-11\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b515-13\">Dec. 27, 2011.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-14\">Ernest Carlos Garcia, Renata Ann Gow-ie, Assistant U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Houston, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-15\">Marjorie A.

He argues on appeal that his sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that the sentencing court failed to consider his estranged wife\u2019s poor health and the needs of their children. He properly acknowledges that his argument that the illegal reentry guideline is \u201cpenologically flawed\u201d and lacks an empirical basis is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-21\">When, as here, the district court has imposed a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, the sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Review is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Mejia Diaz has not shown that the sentencing court considered any irrelevant or improper factors or that the court made a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, he has failed to demonstrate that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 347, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"AEE\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
