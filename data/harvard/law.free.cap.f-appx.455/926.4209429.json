On appeal, Reaid argues his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2. He claims the enhancements to \u00a7 2G2.2 are unsupported by empirical data and result in irrational sentences, and \u00a7 2G2.2 is thus fundamentally incompatible with the sentencing requirements and purposes under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After review, we affirm Reaid\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">Reaid\u2019s 97-month sentence is substan- ' tively reasonable. We have previously held that \u00a7 2G2.2 adequately takes into account empirical data and national experience. <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1201 n. 15 (11th Cir.2008). We also noted the child pornography guidelines refleet Congress\u2019s \u201clongstanding concern for recidivism in [child pornography] cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Reaid\u2019s sentence is reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. The district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see United Stales v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1281 (11th Cir.2007), and the court noted that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offense and the need for adequate deterrence. The court also imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range based on Reaid\u2019s arguments in mitigation. Reaid has not met his burden to show an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-14\">.
