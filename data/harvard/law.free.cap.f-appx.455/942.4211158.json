United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse of discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances and the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range). The record demonstrates that, in determining Cash\u2019s sentence, the district court considered the Chapter 7 policy statements,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determined that the 5-to-11-month Guidelines range was not long enough to serve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a), and found that an upward variance was warranted. <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006) (stating a district court is required to consider these policy statements, and when exceeding the recommended range, \u201cmust normally indicate that it considered [them]\u201d). Specifically, the court noted the seriousness of Cash\u2019s violations and that he had absconded for three years, indicating that he had no regard for the conditions of his supervised release. Thus, the district court accounted for the need to promote respect for the law, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the history and characteristics of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2). Although Cash contends the court focused exclusively on his criminal history in imposing his sentence, the record shows the court accounted for the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and this Court will not disturb the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors absent a clear error of judgment by the district court. <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (stating this Court will remand for resentencing only if it is \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case\u201d). Further, contrary to Cash\u2019s argument, the court specifically addressed his substance-abuse problem by recommending his participation in a substance-abuse program while incarcerated. Thus, we affirm Cash\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-11\">.
