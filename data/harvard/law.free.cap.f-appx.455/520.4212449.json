He argues that his prior Texas conviction for manufacture/delivery of a controlled substance by actual transfer and by offering to sell was not an aggravated felony and that the district court therefore plainly erred in sentencing him pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which provides for a 20-year maximum statutory sentence, instead of \u00a7 1326(b)(1), which provides for a 10-year statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-22\">Because Duran-Villagran did not challenge being sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) in the district court, the question whether the district court erred in sentencing him under that subsection is reviewed for plain error. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>1428, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To show plain error, he must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1429. If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Duran-Villagran\u2019s prior Texas conviction for manufacture/delivery of a controlled substance by actual transfer and by offering to sell was not an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>See United States v. Morales-Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 356, 358-60 (5th Cir.2007). Therefore, it was error for the district court to find that his statutory maximum sentence was 20 years pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">But the record does not indicate that the district court\u2019s error affected Duran-Villigran\u2019s substantial rights. First, his sentence \u2014 57 months \u2014 fell within the properly calculated guidelines range of 57 to 71 months, and the district court\u2019s error did not affect the properly calculated guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Second, his sentence fell within the proper 10-year statutory maximum, and there is no evidence in the record that the district court\u2019s belief that the statutory maximum was 20 years affected its decision to sentence Duran-Villagran to 57 months in prison. Accordingly, he has failed to demonstrate reversible plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 369 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Duran-Villagran also argues that a remand is required so that the judgment can be corrected to reflect that he was convicted and sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b)(1). The district court\u2019s judgment, however, was not incorrect: it indicated that Duran-Villa-gran had been convicted and sentenced under \u201c8 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 1326.\u201d Duran-Villa-gran has not demonstrated that this court should remand for a correction of a clerical error in the judgment; he likewise has not shown that this court should reform the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36; <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 369. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
