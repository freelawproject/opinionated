While in the Philippines, Rodriguez obtained a Cl/D visa after representing on her application to the United States Department of State that she was a \u201cseafarer,\u201d and subsequently gained admission to the United States on that visa. Rodriguez now argues that the BIA erred when it pretermitted her application for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>concluding that she was statutorily ineligible for such relief because she was a crewman. She asserts that she was not a crewman because she came to the United States intending to work at a country club, and never intended to work on a ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">As an initial matter, we review only the BIA\u2019s judgment because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">I. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether we have subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). We do not retain jurisdiction to review a BIA judgment regarding the granting of adjustment of status. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), <em>cross referencing </em>INA \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255. Nonetheless, we do have jurisdiction to review a question of law or constitutional claim raised in a petition for review. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We have jurisdiction to review non-discretionary legal determinations as to statutory eligibility for discretionary relief. <em>Alvarado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>610 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">We conclude from the record that we have jurisdiction over Rodriguez\u2019s claim because she challenges the BIA\u2019s non-discretionary legal determination that she was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">II. Alien Crewman</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">We review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>including the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretations. <em>De Sandoval v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2006). We give Chevron<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> deference, where appropriate, to single-judge, non-precedential BIA decisions where the BIA relied upon its own precedential opinion. <em>See Quinchia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>552 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2008) (distinguishing cases where the agency relied on a federal court\u2019s or the BIA\u2019s precedential opinion, and concluding that a single-judge, non-precedential BIA opinion is not entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference where it does not rely on existing BIA or federal court precedent). We must defer to the BIA\u2019s construction of a statute that it administers if it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress. <em>Id. </em>The first step in <em>Chevron </em>analysis is to determine whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781. We, as well as the BIA, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. <em>Id. </em>Where a statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the precise issue at hand, however, the question for us is whether the BIA\u2019s answer is based upon a permissible construction of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2782. In such a case, we may not substitute our own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the BIA. <em>Quinchia, </em>552 F.3d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">The Attorney General, at his discretion, may adjust the status of an alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien meets certain requirements. INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). An alien bears the burden of proving her eligibility for adjustment of status. INA \u00a7 240(c)(4), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4). Alien crewmen, however, are statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status. INA \u00a7 245(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>The INA defines a \u201ccrewman\u201d as a person serving in any capacity on board a vessel or aii-craft. INA \u00a7 101(a)(10), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">When determining whether an alien qualifies as a crewman, the BIA examines the alien\u2019s visa and the circumstances surrounding her entry into the United States. <em>Matter of G-D-M-, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 82, 85 (BIA 2009). An alien is a crewman if it is apparent that she was issued a visa as a crewman and entered the United States in pursuit of her occupation as a seaman, and, upon entry as a crewman, the alien cannot avoid the limitations associated with that status. <em>Id. </em>at 84-85. The focal issue in determining whether an alien qualifies as a crewman is whether she entered the United States in pursuit of her calling as a seaman. <em>Parzagonis v. I.N.S., </em>747 F.2d 1389, 1390 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">We conclude that the BIA\u2019s finding that Rodriguez was a crewman despite her subjective intention to work in the United States at a country club was a reasonable construction of the Immigration and Nationality Act to which we must defer. Because Rodriguez was a crewman, she was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">After a careful and thorough review of the administrative record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny Rodriguez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-11\">. <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.
