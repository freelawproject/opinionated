The district court dismissed the action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal, Jones does not address the district court\u2019s determination that he did not state a claim. Rather, his brief contains new allegations of racial discrimination and official misconduct that have no relation to his misdemeanor prosecution in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">When an appellant does not identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Jones has not addressed the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to state a claim, he has abandoned the only issue for appeal. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748; <em>Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
