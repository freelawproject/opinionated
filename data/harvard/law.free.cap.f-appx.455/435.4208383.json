That sentence was enhanced because Maddox was found to be an armed career criminal based on his three prior convictions for violent felonies, including a concealed-weapon conviction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The district court sua sponte dismissed the case without prejudice to the extent that it claimed relief under \u00a7 2241 and for lack of jurisdiction to the extent that it could be construed as seeking relief under the savings clause 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Maddox claims that his sentence was improperly enhanced on the basis of a conviction for a crime \u2014 carrying a concealed weapon \u2014 that he deemed not to be \u201ca crime of violence.\u201d In support of that contention he cites, inter alia, <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 141-47, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). He thus asserts that he merits relief under \u00a7 2241 on the ground that he was actually innocent of the career offender sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-21\">Section 2255 is the primary authority for a collateral attack on a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>sentence, and \u00a7 2241 is the proper procedural vehicle for challenging the manner in which a sentence is executed. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). As Maddox \u201cattacks errors that occur[red] at trial or sentencing,\u201d \u00a7 2255, and not \u00a7 2241, provides the correct statutory basis for his plea for relief. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). The district court had no jurisdiction to grant Maddox relief under \u00a7 2255, however, as a \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed in the sentencing court \u2014 here, the Middle District of Alabama. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(a); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 895 n. 3 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) would authorize Maddox to proceed in a habeas corpus action under \u00a7 2241, however, if he were able to demonstrate that no adequate or effective relief was attainable by a motion to vacate, correct, or set aside his sentence under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). Unlike a \u00a7 2255 motion, a \u00a7 2241 application is properly filed \u201cin the district of the prisoner\u2019s incarceration,\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 895 n. 3 \u2014 here, the Western District of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u201c[T]he inadequacy or inefficacy requirement is stringent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 901. To proceed under \u00a7 2241, Maddox was required to establish that \u00a7 2255 provides an inadequate or ineffective remedy because his claim (1) is \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (2) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904. The first \u201cfactor requires that a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establish that the petitioner is actually innocent,\u201d meaning that he \u201cmay have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law.\u201d <em>Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830-31 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This savings-clause factor is not satisfied by an assertion that the applicant is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of a sentencing enhancement. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 427. As Maddox does not claim to be innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, he cannot satisfy both prongs of the savings clause and consequently cannot obtain habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830-31; <em>Kinder, </em>222 F.3d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The district court did not commit legal error by denying relief to Maddox under \u00a7 2241 or under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
