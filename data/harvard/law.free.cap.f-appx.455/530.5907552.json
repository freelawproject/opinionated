He contends -that the guidelines range of 41 to 51 months is excessive because it resulted in an unwarranted disparity between defendants like him, who cannot avail them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>selves of a \u201cfast-track\u201d program, and other defendants. He further contends that the conditions he faces in prison as an alien and his unique concern for his family\u2019s safety called for a variance from the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">When the district court imposes sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, giving proper weight to the Sentencing Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, this court gives \u201cgreat deference to that sentence and will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines in light of the sentencing considerations set out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). In reliance on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), Campos asserts that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply, but, as he concedes, his argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">To the extent that Campos argues that the lack of a \u201cfast-track\u201d program creates an unwarranted sentencing disparity, as he concedes, that issue also is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-64 (5th Cir.2008). Campos\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the appropriateness of his within-guidelines sentence does not suffice to show error in connection with his sentence. <em>See Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66. Campos has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable, and he has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554-55. Campos has not shown that the district court abused its discretion under <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and thus has shown no error, plain or otherwise. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
