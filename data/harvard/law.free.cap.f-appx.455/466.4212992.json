Wilson is serving a 37-year sentence for one count of conspiracy to distribute certain controlled substances, three counts of using a communications facility to commit a felony under Title 21, and one count of money laundering.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">When a district court certifies that an appeal is not taken in good faith, a prisoner may either pay the filing fee or challenge the district court\u2019s certification decision by moving for IFP in this court. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into the prisoner\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d\u2019 <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and its decision to deny a motion for reconsideration are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009); <em>cf. Martinez v. Johnson, </em>104 F.3d 769, 771 (5th Cir.1997) (Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion); <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enterprises, Inc., </em>38 F.3d 1404, 1408 (5th Cir.1994) (Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6) motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Wilson argues that the district court failed to recognize that the addendum to the presentence report (PSR) stated that the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for his conspiracy count was five years and that a sentencing guidelines range of life imprisonment was therefore inapplicable. He asserts that his base offense level should have been 23 \u201cfor a Class-D felony\u201d and that the district court should have imposed a 20 year sentence, the statutory maximum sentence for the money laundering count, with all other sentences running concurrently. He also argues that the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when ruling on his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Wilson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence was based upon Amendment 505 to the Guidelines, a retroactive amendment which lowered from 42 to 38 the maximum base offense level for drug offenses under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. As determined by the district court, even if Wilson\u2019s base offense level is lowered to 38, his total offense level and criminal history category correspond to a recommended guidelines range of life imprisonment. Moreover, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d), the statutory maximum sentences for each of his counts of conviction would run consecutively for a total term of imprisonment of 37 years.</p>\n<p id=\"AuE\">Eligibility for a \u00a7 3582 reduction \u201cis triggered only by an amendment ... that lowers the applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)); <em>see United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 581 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). As the applicable guidelines range was not lowered in Wilson\u2019s case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or in denying his motions for reconsideration. <em>See Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d at 983. To the extent that Wilson attempts to otherwise challenge the sentencing court\u2019s calculation of the applicable Guidelines, those claims are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Because the appeal lacks any arguable legal merit, Wilson\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d at 220; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
