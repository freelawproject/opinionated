California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Deese has filed a response. Deese also has filed a motion for rehearing of the Deputy Clerk\u2019s order denying his motion to substitute retained counsel for appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">In his pro se response, Deese alleges, without explanation, that his case was presented to the grand jury based on a false statement and that the district court erred by failing to grant him an evidentiary hearing. We will not consider those claims because Deese has not briefed them adequately. <em>Cf. United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 446-47 (5th Cir.2010); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Deese also contends that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to address those issues. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Deese\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; such a claim generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Deese\u2019s remaining claim. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Deese\u2019s motion for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b462-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
