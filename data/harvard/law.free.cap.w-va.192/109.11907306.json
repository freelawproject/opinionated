The issue on appeal is whether a circuit court has the authority to impose an alternative sentence of work release, coupled with home confinement when the defendant is not at work, where the offender was convicted of second offense driving under the influence of alcohol. The Circuit Court of Upshur County concluded that it did not have such authority. We disagree and remand this ease back to the Circuit Court of Upshur County.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-30\">There is no dispute as to the facts. The defendant was convicted in magistrate court of second offense driving under the influence of alcohol and was sentenced to six months and one day in the county jail. On June 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>1993, she filed a motion for alternative sentencing in the Circuit Court of Upshur County pursuant to W.Va.Code, 62-12-4 (1948).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that motion, the defendant requested that she be given an alternative sentence of home confinement under W.Va.Code, 62-11B-1 (1988), and, in addition, work release under W.Va.Code, 62-11A-1 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The Circuit Court of Upshur County acknowledged that it had authority under syllabus point 2 of <em>State v. Kerns, </em>183 W.Va. 130, 394 S.E.2d 532 (1990), to impose work release as an alternative sentence for the misdemeanor of second offense driving under the influence of alcohol. The defendant in <em>Kerns </em>had entered a guilty plea to second offense driving under the influence of alcohol. He then filed a request for an alternative sentence with the circuit court. The court found the authority to impose work release, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">A circuit court has the authority under <em>W.Va.Code, Q2-12-4 </em>[1943] to apply the work release provisions of <em>W.Va.Code, </em>62-11A-1 [1988] in lieu of a sentence of ordinary confinement imposed by a magistrate court in a misdemeanor case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">At the time <em>Kerns </em>was written, a conviction for first or second offense driving under the influence of alcohol was a misdemeanor that carried a jail sentence of one year or less. W.Va.Code, 17C-5-2(d)(2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (h)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (1986). Consequently, under W.Va.Code, 17C-5-2(m),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> work release under W.Va.Code, 62-11A-1 <em>et seq. </em>(1990), was authorized. In <em>Kerns, </em>we discussed the alternate availability of home confinement and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-12\">A circuit court has the authority under <em>W.Va.Code, </em>62-12-4 [1943] to order electronically monitored home confinement, in a county having the equipment therefor, in lieu of incarceration imposed by a magistrate court in a misdemeanor case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-13\"><em>Id. </em>at syl. pt. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">In this ease, the Upshur County Circuit Court was concerned that if the sentence was modified to include both home confinement and work release, it would be tantamount to probation or a suspended sentence. Probation or suspension is prohibited under W.Va. Code, 17C-5-2(m), which states \u201c[t]he sentences provided herein ... are mandatory and shall not be subject to suspension or probation.... \u201d However, as pointed out, this language is not absolute, as this section recognizes, home confinement as an excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>Kerns </em>recognized the right to release an offender on home confinement for second offense driving under the influ-.enee of alcohol. <em>Id. </em>at syl. pt. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">When the legislature initially adopted the home confinement statute, it stated that it was \u201c... another form of incarceration.W.Va.Code, 62-llB-4(a) (1990).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The entire statutory scheme indicates that home confinement is designed to place substantial restrictions on the offender.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A violation of these restrictions results in the offender being subject to incarceration under the penalties prescribed for the crime. W.Va.Code, 62-llB-9(b) (1990). The penal nature of home detention is recognized under W.Va.Code, 62-llB-9(b), as it provides credit for time spent in home confinement towards the imposition of any sentence following a violation of home confinement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude that home confinement under W.Va.Code, 62-11B-1, et seq. (1990), constitutes an alternative sentence and, therefore, is authorized under W.Va.Code, 17C-5-2(m) (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">As indicated above, the Upshur County Circuit Court was troubled by the defendant\u2019s request to be given home detention with the right to be released to go to work. However, the right to be released to go to work has been an established part of the home detention act since its enactment in 1990. Under W.Va.Code, 62-llB-5(l)(A) (1990), a court could, as an adjunct to home confinement, allow the person to travel to his or her place of employment and return home.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This provision is different from the work release statute, W.Va.Code, 62-11A-1 (1992), where the individual is released from jail to go to work and then returns to the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">Although the parties do not recognize this point, the home detention statute has clear language that authorizes a court, as an adjunct to granting home detention, to allow the offender to travel to and from work. Thus, even prior to 1994, when the legislature authorized the right to home detention as a second alternative sentence to work release under W.Va.Code, 17C-5-2(o) (1994), W.Va.Code, 17C-5-2(m) (1986), provided the authority for a sentencing court to give the offender home detention with the right under W.Va.Code, 62-llB-5(l)(A), to travel to and return from the offender\u2019s place of employment for the misdemeanor offense of first or second offense driving under the influence of alcohol. It would appear that both parties overlooked W.Va.Code, 62-llB-5(l)(A).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">However, we emphasize that these legislative options are not mandatory. They provide the circuit judge with the discretion to exercise such alternative sentencing as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>may be warranted in a given ease. In this case, the circuit court declined to give the defendant both work release and home confinement. Consequently, we do not reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision, but merely remand the ease so that the court may have an opportunity to reconsider the case in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-5\">Brotherton, C.J., did not participate.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b158-6\">Miller, Retired J., sitting by special assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-21\">.
