On October 14, 1919, Beth Weber, plaintiff, commenced an action of the 'first class in assumpsit in the municipal court of Chicago against Thomas H. Hulbert, defendant, to recover the sum of $1,250, which she had previously paid to defendant under circumstances hereinafter mentioned. The cause was tried before the court without a jury. The court found the issues against defendant and assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages at $1,250, and on March, 8, 1921, entered judgment against defendant in that sum. This appeal followed.</p><p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-7\" pgmap=\"348(83) 349(107)\">In August, 1919, plaintiff was engaged in business at No. 36 South State street, Chicago, and defendant had an office at No. 81 East Madison street, where he was engaged in selling lots in a subdivision owned by him and known as the \u201cHulbert Fullerton Avenue Highlands Subdivision No. 11,\u201d in Chicago, Illinois. One Everett Ham was an agent of defendant employed to make sales of the lots. On August 19, 1919, Ham met plaintiff, and solicited her to buy one or more of the lots as an investment. Late in the afternoon of that day Ham, plaintiff and a friend of plaintiff\u2019s visited the subdivision and plaintiff was shown (among others) a certain corner lot and urged to purchase it at the price of $12,500. Early the following morning Ham called at plaintiff\u2019s place of business and had an interview with her, which resulted in plaintiff delivering to Ham her check drawn on the First National Bank of Chicago for $1,250, payable to defendant\u2019s order, and Ham delivering to plaintiff a receipt signed by him and which plaintiff also signed. The receipt is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-4\" pgmap=\"349\">\u201cChicago, August 20, 1919.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-5\" pgmap=\"349\">\u201cReceived from Miss Beth Weber $1,250, on account of her proposal for purchase of Lot 1 in Subdivision No. 11 in The Fullerton Avenue Highlands for the price of $12,500, without interest;dollars more to be paid on or before-19-, and the balance in installments of $125 on or before the 1st day of each and every month after. This receipt being issued subject to prior sale and to acceptance by Thomas H. Hulbert.

The said \u201cproposal\u201d as presented to and as signed by plaintiff is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-13\" pgmap=\"349\">\u201cChicago, Illinois, August 20, 1919.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-14\" pgmap=\"349(25) 350(42)\">\u201cI hereby propose to purchase from Thomas H.

Hulbert.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-11\" pgmap=\"351(139) 352(57)\">Plaintiff testified, in substance, that on the following morning, August 21, after making investigations, she was informed by real estate men that the property in question was not worth the sum of $12,500; that she went to the First National Bank for the purpose of stopping payment on the $1,250 check, but was there informed that it had been certified on the previous afternoon, shortly after she had delivered the same to Ham; that during the afternoon or early the following morning (August 22), she personally called at defendant\u2019s office and for the first time met him; that she told him that the property was not worth $12,500, that she did not want it, and that she wanted her money back; and that defendant said that he could not return the money, that the deal had been closed and that he had applied her check on Mr. Ham\u2019s commissions. Evidence introduced by defendant showed that on August 21 he had issued checks, payable to the order of Ham and one Mendell, respectively, whereby he paid them commissions aggregating $1,250 on the \u201cWeber\u201d deal, and which checks were paid on August 23.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-6\" pgmap=\"352(268) 353(12)\">Defendant testified, in substance, that on August 20 he received from a lady employee of his office the duplicate copies of the proposal signed by plaintiff; that after his cashier had informed him that plaintiff\u2019s check for $1,250 had been certified, he signed both copies \u201cThomas H. Hulbert\u201d below the form of receipt thereon and gave them so signed back to the cashier with instructions to immediately send one of them by registered mail to plaintiff. Defendant introduced in evidence the receipt of the post office for the package, containing said proposal, addressed to plaintiff. It is dated \u201cChicago, Ill., August-22, 1919.\u201d Defendant also introduced the return receipt which discloses that plaintiff receipted for the' package and that it was delivered to her on August 23, 1919. Defendant further testified that immediately after he signed said proposal and directed it to be mailed he withdrew the lot in question from the market and did not sell it until February 20, 1920, when he sold it for $12,500 to another party; that since the signing of the proposal he had caused a cement sidewalk to be. placed on one side of the lot; and that he personally did not meet plaintiff until August 23, when, she visited him in his office and demanded the return of the $1,250. The evidence, however, clearly discloses that plaintiff informed defendant that she did not want the lot and demanded the return of the $1,250, before the registered package was received by her. The evidence further discloses that the package, in addition to the proposal as signed by plaintiff, contained the following letter, dated August 21, 1919, addressed to her:</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-4\" pgmap=\"353\">\u201cDear Madam: I enclose herein your proposal. I am sure that your Proposal to Purchase will give you many times the profit you could get from any other investment, for it is direct to me, the owner, with no middle-men\u2019s profits, at a price which is correspondingly low. I insist that the Hulbert Fullerton Avenue Highlands be handled on honor, without misrepresentation and without any agreement or promise whatsoever other than those contained in the Proposal to Purchase, and I signed the receipt attached thereto with the understanding that this is the basis on which you signed. * * *</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\" pgmap=\"353\">Thomas H. Hulbert,</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\" pgmap=\"353\">Per M. Gray.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-7\" pgmap=\"353\">The evidence further discloses that on October 8, 1919, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys wrote defendant making formal demand for the return to plaintiff of said $1,250, and that on the following day defendant wrote the attorneys refusing the demand.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-8\" pgmap=\"353(159) 354(92)\">Plaintiff\u2019s amended statement of claim discloses a claim for money had and received \u2014 viz., $1,250, with legal interest thereon from October 10, 1919. The proposal, as so signed by both parties, is attached to the statement and made a part thereof. Plaintiff alleged that no consideration was received by her for the $1,250 paid and that the proposal was never at any time accepted by defendant. Defendant in his amended affidavit of merits alleged that on August 20, 1919, he received through Everett Ham the said check and plaintiff\u2019s written proposal; that defendant accepted said proposal and signed a receipt for the payment, which was attached to a duplicate of the proposal and forwarded to plaintiff; that on the same day he withdrew said real estate from sale, and continued to withhold the same from sale until February, 1920; that on August 21, 1919, he paid as commissions to the parties obtaining and delivering said proposal and cheek to him, the sum of $1,250, which was the usual and customary compensation for the services rendered; that .on September 9, 1919, in compliance with the terms of the proposal, he caused to be placed adjacent to the lot a cement sidewalk at a cost of $46; and that plaintiff has never withdrawn or rescinded her proposal, either in writing or orally, neither has she demanded of this defendant, either orally or in writing, the return of said $1,250, in accordance with the terms of the proposal and the receipt.</p><attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-5\" pgmap=\"354\">George W. Wilbur, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-6\" pgmap=\"354\">MoGilvray, Eames, Vaughan &amp; Tilley, for defendant in error.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b354-7\" pgmap=\"354\">Mr. Presiding Justice Gridley</author> <p id=\"ARnu\" pgmap=\"354\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b354-8\" pgmap=\"354\">After carefully reviewing the evidence introduced upon the trial and considering the several points made by counsel for defendant as grounds for a reversal of the judgment, we are of the opinion that the trial court\u2019s finding was right and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b354-9\" pgmap=\"354(150) 355(69)\">If the so-called proposal, signed by plaintiff and dated August 20, 1919, be considered as a proposal by her to purchase of defendant the lot therein described, it was withdrawn by her before any acceptance thereof by defendant and notice to her of such acceptance. In the case of Gross v. Arnold, 177 Ill. 575, it is decided that a written proposal to buy land, signed and acknowledged and delivered to the agent of the owner of the land, to become operative upon acceptance of the terms by such owner, may be revoked at any time before acceptance, the court saying (p. 577): \u201cIt is familiar law an offer to enter into an agreement may be withdrawn at any time while it remains unaccepted. The proof here shows a proposal by the appellees and a withdrawal thereof before notification of acceptance. This prima facie esta,blisies a contract was not completed. If the appellant in any binding way accepted the proposal before it was revoked it devolved on him to prove such acceptance. We find no proof of that character in the record.\u201d (See also Smith v. Weaver, 90 Ill. 392, 393; Crandall v. Willig, 166 Ill. 233, 239; Corbett v. Cronkhite, 239 Ill. 9, 17; Clark v. Potts, 255 Ill. 183, 188.)</p> <p id=\"b355-4\" pgmap=\"355(280) 356(337) 357(120)\">If the so-called proposal, as finally signed by the parties at the times shown, be considered as an attempt to incorporate into a contract all the terms of the purchase of the lot therein mentioned, it is void as a unilateral contract. When, on the morning of August 20, plaintiff gave Ham her check for $1,250, payable to defendant\u2019s order, she received a receipt signed by Ham, in which it was stated that the amount was received \u201con account of her proposal for purchase\u201d of the lot in question for the price of $12,500, and that the receipt was issued \u201csubject to prior sale and to acceptance\u201d by defendant, and that said sum was to be returned to her in case of prior sale or such nonacceptance. When these things were done it is clear that defendant was under no obligation to make a conveyance of the lot to plaintiff. When later in the same day Ham again called on plaintiff and presented the duplicate proposals to plaintiff for her signature, and she signed them, and Ham had delivered them to defendant, it is equally clear that defendant was under no obligation to make such conveyance. And, in our opinion, after defendant had signed said duplicate proposals and after one copy thereof had been received by plaintiff by mail, defendant was not bound thereby to make a conveyance of the lot to plaintiff even though she should have thereafter elected to make, and did make, further payments up to $6,250. In the third clause of the proposal is the statement: \u201cThe said above described, property, if conveyed, is to be conveyed by a. good and sufficient warranty deed,\u201d etc. Then follows the recital of various restrictions and conditions. Then under plaintiff\u2019s signature to the proposal proper there follow certain statements in the form of a receipt, under which appears defendant\u2019s signature. He therein acknowledges the receipt from plaintiff of $1,250, \u201cas deposit on the above proposal,\u201d but he does not accept the proposal as made. All the agreement on his part is, that, if all the subsequent payments agreed in said proposal to be made by plaintiff have been made promptly when due, said sum of $1,250, together with subsequent payments, is to be returned \u201cif for any fault, failure or neglect chargeable to me the said above recited property shall not be conveyed in accordance with the terms of the said proposal.\u201d He does not promise to convey the lot to plaintiff even though the subsequent payments mentioned should be promptly made by her. The mere fact that he has the right, as stated, to return all moneys paid by her presupposes the fact that he has a right to refuse to convey the lot, if he should so desire. The contract, if it is a contract, is unilateral, lacking in mutuality and void. (Vogel v. Pekoc, 157 Ill. 339, 342; Joliet Bottling Co. v. Joliet Citizens Brewing Co., 254 Ill. 215, 218; Kingsbury v. Cornelison, 122 Ill. App. 495, 500.) This construction of the instrument is strengthened possibly when consideration is given to certain statements contained in defendant\u2019s letter of August 21, 1919, which accompanied the instrument as returned to plaintiff, in which he writes that he insists that \u201cHulbert Fullerton Avenue Highlands be handled on honor, without misrepresentation and without any agreement or promise whatsoever other than thos\u00e9 contained in the Proposal to Purchase, and I signed the receipt attached thereto with the understanding that this is the basis on which you signed.\u201d There was no eonsideration for plaintiff\u2019s payment of the $1,250 and for her promise to make the further payments mentioned, and she was entitled to recover back the $1,250 in an action for money had and received. (Smith v. Weaver, 90 Ill. 392, 393; Bradford v. City of Chicago, 25 Ill. 411, 424; Laflin v. Howe, 112 Ill. 253, 262; Drennan v. Bunn, 124 Ill. 175, 186.) The acts of the defendant in withdrawing the lot from the market on August 20, 1919, and withholding it from sale until February 20, 1920, in placing a cement sidewalk adjacent to the lot, and incurring the expenses mentioned for commissions did not bind him, to make a conveyance of the lot to plaintiff.

Cronkhite, 239 Ill. 9, 17.)</p> <p id=\"b357-4\" pgmap=\"357\">For the reasons indicated the judgment of the municipal court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b357-5\" pgmap=\"357\">Affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b357-6\" pgmap=\"357\">Barnes and Morrill, JJ., concur.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
