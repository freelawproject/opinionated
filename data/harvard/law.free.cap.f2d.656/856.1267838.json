Because we have concluded that the district court properly applied the claimed exemptions to the information here in question, we affirm the judgment insofar as it found that this information is properly withheld.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because, however, we have also concluded that the district court underestimated the causative impact of this litigation on the voluntary release of a substantial number of documents, we remand the case to the district court for further consideration of the question of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">At issue in this litigation are approximately five hundred thousand pages of documents <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> generated in the course of six investigations conducted by the Watergate Special Prosecution Force (WSPF). By letter dated November 18, 1975, appellant Fund for Constitutional Government (FCG) requested that WSPF produce for inspection and copying \u201call non-exempt records of [WSPF] of the investigations which it carried out from May 25, 1973 to October 15, 1975, and which are no longer in process.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The then special prosecutor, Charles F. C. Ruff, advised FCG that he would have to deny the request because of its generality but that, within limits imposed by a reduced staff, the office would assist in formulating a more specific request.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> FCG\u2019s reformulated request specifically sought release of information pertaining to: (1) investigations of \u201cthe 18V2 minute tape gap\u201d; (2) the I.T.T. investigation; (3) investigations of corporate campaign contributions; (4) the \u201cTownhouse\u201d investigation; (5) the \u201cMilk-Fund\u201d investigation; and (6) the Hughes-Rebozo investigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Because even this limited request encompassed a massive number of documents, FCG agreed to allow WSPF more than the ten day time period prescribed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A) to respond fully to its request. After reviewing the entire \u201cTownhouse\u201d file, WSPF released a few documents but withheld the vast majority in reliance on one or more FOIA exemptions. FCG requested immediate review of representative documents from the I.T.T. and Hughes-Rebozo files. After these requests were treated in a similar fashion, FCG commenced this action in the district court on September 30, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">Shortly after filing the complaint, FCG made a motion to require WSPF to produce an index of the withheld documents in accordance with the dictates of <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. 340, 484 F.2d 820 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 977, 94 S.Ct. 1564, 39 L.Ed.2d 873 (1974). WSPF opposed the <em>Vaughn </em>motion and moved for a stay of proceedings in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In reliance on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Open America v. Watergate Special Prosecution Force, </em>178 U.S. App.D.C. 308, 547 F.2d 605 (1976),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the district court granted WSPF\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">In April 1977, FCG suggested that, rather than continue a document by document review, WSPF review the closing memoranda of each of the six investigations. Shortly after the parties had struck this agreement, WSPF was finally terminated and custody of the documents was transferred to the National Archives and Records Service (NARS). NARS completed the review of the closing memoranda, including those of the Townhouse file, the I.T.T. file and the Hughes-Rebozo file which had previously been reviewed by WSPF. As a result of this review, a substantial amount of information not previously made available was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">As to the information still being withheld, NARS filed affidavits, detailed <em>Vaughn </em>indices and copies of the redacted documents with the district court. NARS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>moved for summary judgment on March 3, 1978. In a thorough memorandum, the district court, treating the motion as one for partial summary judgment,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> ordered the release of certain documents to FCG<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but upheld the claimed exemptions as to the majority of the information. <em>Fund for Constitutional Government v. National Archives and Records Service, </em>485 F.Supp. 1 (D.D.C.1978). Subsequently, the district court ordered the entry of final judgment while retaining jurisdiction to monitor compliance with its prior orders. J.A. at 135-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">A. <em>Exemptions Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">NARS contends, and the district court concluded, that a substantial amount of information contained in these files is properly exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 7(C). That section exempts from the FOIA mandatory disclosure requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-15\">[Mjatters that are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-16\">(7) investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would ... (C) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). FCG apparently concedes for the purpose of this appeal that the information in question is contained in \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">The district court upheld the invocation of Exemption 7(C) for the following three general categories of information: (1) information which would reflect investigations of allegations of possible wrongdoing by individuals who were neither indicted nor prosecuted; (2) information which revealed facts pertaining to individuals who were not the targets of investigation; and (3) information which would reveal the identity of a confidential source.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>While the dominant objective of the FOIA is disclosure, <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 361, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 1599, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976); <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. at 343, 484 F.2d at 823, Congress made a considered judgment that under certain circumstances the public\u2019s right of access to governmental information should yield to the legitimate interest in personal privacy of individuals about whom the government maintains information for any of a variety of purposes. This Congressional judgment is embodied in FOIA Exemptions 7(C) and 6,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> both of which provide an exemption from the Act\u2019s mandatory disclosure requirement for information which if released would result in an \u201cunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d In determining the applicability of both, the court must undertake a balancing of the public interest in disclosure on the one side and the individual\u2019s interest in privacy on the other. <em>See, e. g., Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. at 372, 96 S.Ct. at 1604; <em>Lesar v. U.S. Department of Justice, </em>- U.S.App.D.C. -, -, 636 F.2d 472, 486 (1980); <em>Deering Milliken, Inc. v. Irving, </em>548 F.2d 1131, 1136 (4th Cir. 1977) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Appellant contends that-the district court failed to properly balance these competing interests in this case. Appellant argues that most of the information in question was not properly within Exemption 7(C) because the individuals to whom it relates are high level government and corporate officials whose interest in privacy is at best minimal. FCG further urges that, in any event, this type of information is not of the type contemplated by the FOIA privacy exemptions. Finally, FCG argues that the district court underestimated the public interest in disclosure of this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-22\">At the outset, it should be noted that, while similar in scope and application, Exemptions 6 and 7 of the FOIA are distinguishable in two significant respects. First, while Exemption 6 refers to \u201ca clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u201d Exemption 7(C)\u2019s reference is to an \u201cunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d The omission of the word \u201cclearly\u201d from the Exemption 7(C) standard was a considered choice made during the passage of the 1974 amendments to that section, Pub.L. No. 93-502, \u00a7 2(b), 88 Stat. 1563,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and was intended to provide somewhat broader protection for privacy interests under Exemption 7(C) than normally afforded under Exemption 6. <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. at 378-79 n.16, 96 S.Ct. at 1607; <em>Congressional News Syndicate v. U.S. Department of Justice, </em>438 F.Supp. 538, 541 (D.D. C.1977). While we do not attempt to quantify this distinction, we do observe its utility as a relevant benchmark.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Second, the threshold criterion governing applicability of FOIA Exemption 6 is that the information be contained in personnel medical or similar files. By contrast, Exemption 7 is applicable to information contained in \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d In Exemption 6 cases, applicability of the exemption has been limited to information of an intimate or personal nature similar to that usually contained in an individual\u2019s personnel or medical files. <em>See Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. at 377, 96 S.Ct. at 1606; <em>Board of Trade v. CFTC, </em>200 U.S.App.D.C. 339, 346, 627 F.2d 392, 399 (1980). It appears, however, that this limitation is imposed by the specific threshold criterion of Exemption 6, <em>see Board of Trade v. CFTC, </em>200 U.S.App.D.C. at 345, 627 F.2d at 398, and does not consequently place a similar limitation on invocation of the personal privacy provision of Exemption 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">Furthermore, this second distinction serves to illuminate the reasoning behind the first. As Judge Pratt observed in <em>Congressional News Syndicate v. United States Department of Justice, </em>438 F.Supp. 538 (D.D.C.1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-5\">The difference in breadth in turn is attributable to the inherent distinctions between investigatory files and personnel, medical and similar files; that an individual\u2019s name appears in files of the latter kind, without more, will probably not engender comment and speculation, while, as the government argues here, an individual whose name surfaces in connection with an investigation may without more, become the subject of rumor and innuendo.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">438 F.Supp. at 541. Thus, it is apparent that, contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, information in an investigatory file tending to indicate that a named individual has been investigated for suspected criminal activity is, at least as a threshold matter, an appropriate subject for exemption under 7(C). <em>Baez v. Department of Justice, </em>208 U.S.App.D.C. 199, 209, 647 F.2d 1328, 1338 (1980); <em>Kuehnert v. FBI, </em>620 F.2d 662, 667 (8th Cir. 1980) <em>(citing Librach </em>v. <em>FBI, </em>587 F.2d 372, 373 (8th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 910, 99 S.Ct. 1222, 59 L.Ed.2d 459 (1979); <em>Maroscia v. Levi, </em>569 F.2d 1000, 1002 (7th Cir. 1977)).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Having determined that this information falls within the threshold requirements of Exemption 7(C), the question remains whether the district court properly struck the balance between the public interest in disclosure and the individual\u2019s interest in privacy. The traditional role of the prosecutor in our criminal justice system provides a relevant background against which to address the issues raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">As the district court properly noted, the decision to prosecute an individual for a crime is one typically entrusted solely to the prosecutor\u2019s discretion and rarely subject to judicial -review or public scrutiny. 485 F.Supp. at 6; <em>see Newman v. United States, </em>127 U.S.App.D.C. 263, 264, 382 F.2d 479, 480 (1967). <em>See also United States v. Bell, </em>165 U.S.App.D.C. 140, 155, 506 F.2d 207, 222 (1974). The exercise of that discretion is properly informed by a variety of factors and not solely by the prosecutor\u2019s determination of the prognosis for a successful prosecution. <em>Nader v. Saxbe, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 89, 92 n.18, 497 F.2d 676, 679 n.18 (1974).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, it is apparent that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>ult\u00edmate decision not to prosecute does not necessarily reflect the prosecutor\u2019s assessment of the probable guilt or innocence of the accused.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The decision to prosecute an individual for a crime is attended by consequences beyond the risk of conviction. When the individual or the crime has attracted general notoriety, institution of proceedings typically provokes widespread speculation attended by at least some damage to the reputation of the individual involved. Common experience teaches that this speculation is not quieted when, and if, a jury finally announces its verdict. Typically, the decision not to prosecute insulates individuals who have been investigated but not charged from this rather significant intrusion into their lives. In <em>Baez v. Department of Justice, </em>208 U.S.App.D.C. 199, 647 F.2d 1328 (1980), this Court quoted with apparent approval from an affidavit submitted to the district court prepared by an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-, tion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-5\">To release the identities of these individuals and the information collected about them where it does not pertain to [appellant] would announce to the world that these individuals were targets of an FBI investigation. There can be no clearer example of an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy than to release to the public that another individual was the subject of an FBI investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">208 U.S.App.D.C. at 209, 647 F.2d at 1338. Obviously, this is true, with equal if not greater force, as it pertains to individuals who were the subjects of investigations by WSPF.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-17\">Appellant contends, however, that where, as here, the individuals are public figures, high level government or corporate officials, their privacy interests are entitled to little, if any, consideration. This Court has already explicitly rejected the proposition that government officials, by virtue of their positions, forfeit their personal privacy for FOIA purposes. <em>Baez v. Department of Justice, </em>208 U.S.App.D.C. at 210, 647 F.2d at 1339; <em>Lesar v. Department of Justice, </em>204 U.S.App.D.C. at 215, 636 F.2d at 487; <em>accord, Nix v. United States, </em>572 F.2d 998, 1006 (4th Cir. 1978); <em>Maroscia v. Levi, </em>569 F.2d at 1002.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> At the same time, there is a suggestion in those cases that public officials, by virtue of their positions, might be entitled to a lesser degree of protection than private citizens. <em>See, e. g., Lesar v. Department of Justice, </em>204 U.S.App.D.C. at 215, 636 F.2d at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Appellant places significant reliance oh <em>Common Cause v. National Archives and Records Service, </em>202 U.S.App.D.C. 179, 628 F.2d 179 (1980). In <em>Common Cause, </em>this Court, remanding the case to the district court for further development of the factual record, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-4\">[T]his case presents some special circumstances which have provoked different results in cases in our own district court. Without suggesting that the presence of these circumstances will always or even usually tip the balance in favor of disclosure under 7(C), we mention two. First, the individuals whose privacy interests are argued here were candidates for federal office, not private citizens. As such they may have been \u201cpublic figures\u201d with less privacy interest than others in information relating to their candidacies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-5\">Second, the information sought about them concerned campaign contributions, contributions which were then and are now required by law to be reported publicly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">202 U.S.App.D.C. at 184, 628 F.2d at 184 (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">We might be persuaded under appropriate circumstances that an individual\u2019s status as a \u201cpublic figure\u201d would tip the 7(C) balance in favor of disclosure. This is not, however, such a case. While such a status might somewhat diminish an individual\u2019s interest in privacy, the degree of intrusion occasioned by disclosure is necessarily dependent upon the character of the information in question. As we have already indicated, revelation of the fact that an individual has been investigated for suspected criminal activity represents a significant intrusion on that individual\u2019s privacy cognizable under Exemption 7(C). The degree of intrusion is indeed potentially augmented by the fact that the individual is a well known figure and the investigation one which attracts as much national attention as those conducted by the WSPF.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The disclosure of that information would produce the unwarranted result of placing the named individuals in the position of having to defend their conduct in the public forum outside of the procedural protections normally afforded the accused in criminal proceedings. <em>Congressional News Syndicate v. United States Department of Justice, </em>438 F.Supp. at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">Likewise, we cannot say that in conducting the balance the district court gave insufficient weight to the public\u2019s interest in disclosure. In finding that the public interest in disclosure was insufficient to overcome the legitimate privacy interests of the individuals in question, the district court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-13\">In the present case, all three branches of the Federal Government have thoroughly assessed the Watergate scandal, and it does not appear that any further prosecutions are anticipated at this time. It is, therefore, difficult to see how plaintiffs would be fulfilling their stated intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>of exposing governmental wrongdoing under these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">485 F.Supp. at 6. This assessment standing alone might appear to understate the public interest in disclosure. When viewed within the total context of this case, however, it appears to express a view which we endorse, that the legitimate and substantial privacy interests of individuals under these circumstances cannot be overridden by a general public curiosity. <em>Rushford v. Civiletti, </em>485 F.Supp. 477, 479-80 (D.D.C.1980), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>656 F.2d 900 (D.C.Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">In sum, we do not state a <em>per se </em>rule that, in every case where individuals have been investigated but not charged with a crime, that information is properly exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7(C). We adhere to the view that any <em>per se </em>approach would be inconsistent with the Court\u2019s duty to balance <em>de novo </em>the privacy interests at stake against the public interest in disclosure. We do observe, however, that release of this type of information represents a severe intrusion on the privacy interests of the individuals in question and should yield only where exceptional interests militate in favor of disclosure.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> No such circumstances being present in this case, the district court properly concluded that this information was exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">B. <em>Exemptions Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) and Fed.KCrim.P. 6</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEr\">The district court found that a substantial amount of information deleted from the documents was properly withheld on the basis of FOIA Exemption 3 which exempts from the Act\u2019s mandatory disclosure requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-13\">[M]atters that are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-14\">(3) specifically exempt from disclosure by statute . . . provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ais-dedup-0\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). In this case, NARS and the district court relied upon Fed.R. Crim.P. 6(e), 18 U.S.C., as a relevant statute. Rule 6(e), which is reprinted in pertinent part below, provides, with certain exceptions, a prohibition on disclosure of \u201cmatters occurring before the grand jury.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>1. <em>Rule 6(e) as a Statute Under Exemption 3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">At the outset, appellant contends that the district court\u2019s reliance on Rule 6(e) was misplaced because the Rules of Criminal Procedure do not qualify as statutes for Exemption 3 purposes. The contention finds its genesis in this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, </em>195 U.S.App.D.C. 363, 603 F.2d 945 (1979) (per curiam). In <em>Scientology, </em>this Court held that a protective order entered in other litigation between the parties pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e) did not serve as an appropriate basis for invocation of Exemption 3 because the rule simply was not a statute.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Unlike Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c), however, Fed.R. Crim.P. 6(e) was positively enacted by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Congress has delegated authority to prescribe rules for the conduct of criminal litigation in the federal courts to the United States Supreme Court. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Proposed rules become effective ninety days after the Chief Justice reports them to Congress. <em>Id. </em>Congress may, and does occasionally, suspend or modify the rules by enactment. <em>Cf. Walko Corp. v. Burger Chef Systems, Inc., </em>180 U.S.App.D.C. 306, 309 n.29, 554 F.2d 1165, 1168 n.29 (1977). Thus, rules of procedure typically take effect through Congressional inaction rather than Congressional action.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">Rule 6(e), however, was not enacted as a result of the ninety day layover provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771. By order of April 26, 1976, the Supreme Court adopted amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which were duly reported to Congress. Congress voted to delay the effective date of several of the proposed rules, among them Rule 6(e), \u201cuntil August 1, 1977, or until and to the extent approved by Act of Congress, whichever is earlier.\u201d Pub.L. No. 94-349 \u00a7 1, 90 Stat. 822 (1976). Subsequently, Congress, by statute, enacted a modified version of Rule 6(e) in substantially its present form. Pub.L. No. 95-78, \u00a7 2(a), 91 Stat. 319 (1977).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It is quite apparent that by any definition Fed.R. Crim.P. 6(e) is a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">Appellant apparently concedes that Rule 6(e), if a statute, satisfies the other criteria set forth in Exemption 3. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>agree. The rule makes quite clear that disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury is the exception and not the rule. It further sets forth in precise terms to whom, under what circumstances and on what conditions grand jury information may be disclosed. Any disclosure to persons outside of the government may only be made pursuant to a court order. Fed.R. Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(C). Therefore, the rule\u2019s ban on disclosure is for FOIA purposes absolute and falls within subpart (A) of Exemption 3. See <em>American Jewish Congress v. Kreps, </em>187 U.S.App.D.C. 413, 417, 574 F.2d 624, 628 (1978).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">2. <em>The Scope of Rule 6(e)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Having determined that Rule 6(e) is a relevant statute within the meaning of FOIA Exemption 3, the only remaining inquiry is whether information withheld on that basis is actually included within the reach of the rule. See <em>Goland v. CIA, </em>197 U.S.App.D.C. 25, 36, 607 F.2d 339, 350 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 927, 100 S.Ct. 1312, 63 L.Ed.2d 759 (1980).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The legislative history and cases construing the rule indicate that it was intended to preserve the traditional rule of grand jury secrecy with certain limited exceptions. See S.Rep. No. 354, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 7\u20148 (1977); <em>United States v. Tager, </em>638 F.2d 167, 168 (10th Cir. 1980). See <em>also SEC v. Dresser Industries, Inc., </em>202 U.S.App.D.C. 345, 359, 628 F.2d 1368, 1382 (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 993, 101 S.Ct. 529, 66 L.Ed.2d 289 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Four exceptions to the general rule of secrecy are enumerated in the rule. The first two, involving limited disclosure to government attorneys and other government personnel, are clearly inapplicable. Rule 6(e)(3)(A). The remaining two permit disclosure pursuant only to a court order. The fourth permits disclosure to a criminal defendant for use in preparing a motion to dismiss an indictment. Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(ii). The only exception even arguably applicable to the present proceedings is that which permits disclosure \u201cwhen so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\u201d Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i). But an examination of the language and legislative history of that section reveals that it contemplates disclosure in the course of parallel civil proceedings and \u201cdoes not include the very proceeding instituted for the purpose of obtaining disclosure.\u201d <em>Hiss v. Department of Justice, </em>441 F.Supp. 69, 70 (S.D.N.Y.1977); <em>see </em>S.Rep. No. 354, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1977); 123 Cong.Rec. 25196 (1977) (remarks of Rep. Wiggins).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Thus, this case is governed by the general rule and not its exceptions. Because the exceptions have no application in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>this FOIA case, reference to cases ordering disclosure of grand jury information for use in other proceedings based upon a showing of particularized need <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> are of only limited utility for our present purposes. Specifically, the present inquiry does not require the Court to balance the interest in continued secrecy against the particular interest in disclosure, see <em>Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, </em>441 U.S. 211, 223, 99 S.Ct. 1667, 1675, 60 L.Ed.2d 156 (1979), but rather requires a determination of whether disclosure would, in the language of the rule, \u201cdisclose matters occurring before the grand jury.\u201d Rule 6(e)(2).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">We believe that the district court properly applied the rule to the information at issue in the present ease. The rationale for maintaining grand jury secrecy has recently been restated by the Supreme Court: <em>Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, </em>441 U.S. at 219, 99 S.Ct. at 1673 <em>(citing United States v. Rose, </em>215 F.2d 617, 628-629 (3d Cir. 1954)). In order to effectuate these objectives, the scope of the secrecy is necessarily broad. It encompasses not only the direct revelation of grand jury transcripts but also the disclosure of information which would reveal \u201cthe identities of witnesses or jurors, the substance of testimony, the strategy or direction of the investigation, the deliberations or questions of the jurors, and the like.\u201d <em>SEC v. Dresser Industries, Inc., </em>202 U.S.App.D.C. at 359, 628 F.2d at 1382.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-5\">First, if preindictment proceedings were made public, many prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come forward voluntarily, knowing that those against whom they testify would be aware of that testimony. Moreover, witnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be less likely to testify fully and frankly, as they would be open to retribution as well as inducements. There also would be a risk that those about to be indicted would flee, or would try to influence individual grand jurors to vote against indictment. Finally, by preserving the secrecy of the proceedings, we assure that persons who are accused but exonerated by the grand jury will not be held up to public ridicule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">The district court upheld deletions under Exemption 3 for information: naming or identifying grand jury witnesses; quoting or summarizing grand jury testimony; evaluating testimony; discussing the scope, focus and direction of the grand jury investigations; and identifying documents considered by the grand jury and conclusions reached as a result of the grand jury investigations. 485 F.Supp. at 10; First Affidavit of James B. Rhoads, J.A. Exhibit 1, at 2. It is apparent that this information falls within the broad reach of grand jury secrecy as described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Disclosure of this information would reveal matters occurring before the grand jury and is, therefore, properly exempt from disclosure pursuant to FOIA Exemption 3 and Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e). Witness names are clearly covered, as are documents subpoenaed as exhibits. Potential witnesses and potential documentary exhibits, while less clearly within the rule, if dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>closed would reveal the direction and strategy of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">This is not an instance where documentary information coincidentally before the grand jury would be revealed in such a manner that its revelation would not elucidate the inner workings of the grand jury. <em>See SEC v. Dresser Industries, Inc., </em>202 U.S.App.D.C. at 360, 628 F.2d at 1383; <em>United States v. Stanford, </em>589 F.2d 285, 291 (7th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 983, 99 S.Ct. 1794, 60 L.Ed.2d 244 (1979); <em>United States v. Interstate Dress Carriers, </em>280 F.2d 52, 54 (2d Cir. 1960). In this case, appellant seeks information from an. entity whose possession of that information is directly linked to its role relating to the grand jury investigations. The relevant inquiry is not whether the party seeking the information has an interest other than in its role in a grand jury investigation but whether revelation in the particular context would in fact reveal what was before the grand jury. <em>See Murphy v. FBI, </em>490 F.Supp. 1138, 1141 (D.D.C.198), vacated as moot, No. 80-518 (D.D.C. Jan. 8, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">A passage from this Court\u2019s en banc decision in <em>SEC v. Dresser Industries, Inc. </em>will serve to illuminate the distinction between the situation addressed there and that present in this case. As stated by the Court in <em>Dresser:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-6\">Dresser\u2019s documents at issue here were created for an independent corporate purpose, not directly related to the prospect of a grand jury investigation. The SEC \u2022 has subpoenaed them directly from Dresser, without mention of the grand jury. They do not reveal what occurred before the grand jury; they reveal what occurred in Dresser\u2019s foreign operations. [Citation] The fact that a grand jury has subpoenaed documents concerning a particular matter does not insulate that matter from investigation in another forum. In fact, if the grand jury proceedings are genuinely secret, other agencies and courts will not know the subject matter of the grand jury investigation and thus will not be able to determine whether their own inquiry will overlap that of the grand jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">202 U.S.App.D.C. at 359-60, 628 F.2d at 1382-83 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> By contrast, these documents in the possession of WSPF were not obtained for any independent purpose but were obtained for use in grand jury investigations. As such, their disclosure would reveal matters occurring before the grand jury and is prohibited by Fed.R. Crim.P. 6(e) and the information is, as the district court properly concluded, exempt from FOIA disclosure under Exemption 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">C. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"ago-dedup-0\">The FOIA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-11\">The court may assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E).

The district court properly recognized that a court order compelling disclosure is not a necessary prerequisite to an award of fees. 485 F.Supp. at 14. <em>See, e. g., Cox v. United States Department of Justice, </em>195 U.S.App.D.C. 189, 194, 601 F.2d 1, 6 (1979) <em>(per </em>curiam); <em>Cuneo v.

The district court went on to observe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-4\">It does appear to the court, nevertheless, that disclosure of much of the released material followed as a matter of course after the transfer of the investigatory files to the formal custody of the National Archives and Records Service where they were subjected to experienced and thorough FOIA processing. Although it is difficult to estimate with precision how many documents the defendant released in response only to this lawsuit, the present case was not one \u201cof absolute resistance to disclosure before the plaintiff sought judicial review\u201d .. . [T]he court cannot find that the lawsuit had the causative effect upon the release of the information sought necessary to justify an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">485 F.Supp. at 15 <em>(quoting Nationwide Building Maintenance, Inc. v. Sampson, </em>182 U.S.App.D.C. at 95, 559 F.2d at 716). This is a finding of fact which is to be overturned only if clearly erroneous. <em>Crooker v. U. S. Department of the Treasury, slip op. </em>at 4 <em>(citing Cox v. Department of Justice, </em>195 U.S.App.D.C. at 194, 601 F.2d at 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">In holding that this finding was clearly erroneous, we rely in large part upon a factor which appears to have been overlooked by the district court; that is, appellant filed this action only after WSPF, in the early stages of processing this request, revealed that it would make only scant disclosures from the files in question. This is not a case where a FOIA requester, impatient with justifiable delays at the administrative level, resorts to the \u201csqueaky wheel\u201d technique of prematurely filing suit in an effort to secure preferential treatment. To the contrary, appellant exhibited a cooperative understanding of the administrative burden until it became apparent that the administrative process was not about to yield that to which it was entitled under the Act. It seems clear that appellant had in fact encountered virtually \u201cabsolute resistance to disclosure before [seeking] judicial review.\u201d <em>Nationwide Building Maintenance, Inc. v. Sampson, </em>182 U.S.App.D.C. at 95, 559 F.2d at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">It is true that disclosure followed closely on the heels of processing in the more experienced hands of NARS. It is also true that WSPF with its reduced staff and in the process of winding down its operations was understandably ill-equipped to deal with a request of this magnitude. But it does not follow that these factors excuse the government\u2019s failure, albeit temporary, to comply with FOIA disclosure requirements. <em>Cf. Crooker v. Department of the Treasury, slip op. </em>at 4-5. Furthermore, the mere fact that a FOIA requester might have ultimately received the documents in question in the absence of litigation is not a sufficient basis for a finding that it has not substantially prevailed for purposes of an award of attorney fees. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Rather, in addressing the question of whether a party who has received documents absent a court order requiring disclosure has substantially prevailed, the court must determine that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApA\">prosecution of the action could reasonably be regarded as necessary to obtain the information, <em>Vermont Low Income Advocacy Council, Inc. v. Usery, </em>[546 F.2d 509, 513 (2d Cir. 1976)] and that a causal nexus exists between the action and the agency\u2019s surrender of the information, <em>Cuneo v. Rumsfeld, supra, </em>180 U.S.App. D.C. at 190, 553 F.2d at 1366.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-10\"><em>Cox </em>v. <em>United States Department of Justice, </em>195 U.S.App.D.C. at 194, 553 F.2d at 6. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>In this case, appellant was confronted by what amounted to a forthright and final administrative denial of its FOIA request prior to its initiation of the district court action. Thus, appellant was faced with a choice between accepting that determination or litigation. Appellant could not have reasonably been expected to persevere at the administrative level in the hope that an eventual transfer of custody of the documents would produce a more favorable response. From appellant\u2019s perspective, initiation of this lawsuit was the only reasonable means by which it could accomplish its goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Moreover, under the rather unique circumstances of this case, we believe that a sufficient causal nexus exists between this litigation and the release of the documents to warrant a determination that appellant is eligible for attorney fees. It appears that NARS undertook to review the documents in question, including those already reviewed by WSPF, in conjunction with the duty it inherited as defendant in this action to prepare a detailed justification for the items withheld.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It would further appear quite likely that in the absence of this litigation and the need it imposed to specifically justify each deletion NARS would not have voluntarily undertaken to review those files already reviewed by WSPF. While it is probable that the inevitable transfer of these documents to the custody of NARS \u201cwas a cause of their release[,] [t]he initiation and prosecution of this litigation . . . was in our opinion the direct cause of their disclosure.\u201d <em>Church of Scientology of California v. Harris, </em>209 U.S. App.D.C. at 329, 334, 653 F.2d 584, 589; <em>see also Crooker v. U. S. Department of the Treasury, </em>U.S.App.D.C., <em>slip op. </em>at 4.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">Our holding that appellant is eligible for an award of attorney fees does not determine that appellant should in fact receive an award of fees. The ultimate resolution of this question requires the district court to determine whether appellant is also entitled to attorney fees. After finding that appellant had not substantially prevailed, the district court did not go on to address the factors which govern the decision whether to award fees to a party who has established eligibility. This Court has consistently left that question to be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>in the first instance by the district court. <em>See, e. g., Church of Scientology of California v. Harris, </em>209 U.S.App.D.C. at 336, 653 F.2d 584, at 591; <em>Crooker v. U. S. Department of the Treasury, </em>U.S.App.D.C., <em>slip op. </em>at 5; <em>Cox v. United States Department of Justice, </em>195 U.S.App.D.C. at 195, 601 F.2d at 6. Accordingly, on remand the court should determine whether FCG is entitled to an award of fees.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">We have determined that Exemption 7(C) of the FOIA, as a threshold matter, protects from disclosure the names of individuals who are investigated for suspected criminal activity but are never subsequently charged or indicted. While it is conceivable that high level government and corporate officials may have a somewhat diminished interest in personal privacy, we do not believe that fact tips the balance in favor of disclosure under the circumstances of this case. We have also concluded that Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e) is an exempting statute within the meaning of FOIA Exemption 3. Applicability of the exemption depends solely on whether disclosure would reveal matters occurring before the grand jury. As the information withheld on that basis in this case met that requirement, the district court properly concluded that it is exempt from FOIA disclosure. Finally, we have concluded that FCG did \u201csubstantially prevail\u201d in this action and is therefore eligible for an award of attorney fees. On remand, the district court should determine whether FCG is also entitled to an award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-11\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b921-12\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b921-13\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b921-14\">.

It should be noted that at least one category of information, category E, <em>see </em>note 14 <em>supra, </em>would apparently meet the threshold requirement of Exemption 6 as well.

Thus, the chronological remoteness of grand jury proceedings bears no relevance to this FOIA inquiry. The general rule admits to no exception for old grand jury proceedings and whatever relevance that factor might have for a party seeking disclosure under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) simply has no applicability to this case. Furthermore, it is quite clear that this factor alone does not remove grand jury information from the protection afforded by the general rule of secrecy.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">For in considering the effects of disclosure on grand jury proceedings, the courts must consider not only the immediate effects upon a particular grand jury, but also the possible effect upon the functioning of future grand juries. Persons called upon to testify will consider the likelihood that their testimony may one day be disclosed to outside parties.... Thus, the interests in grand jury secrecy, although reduced, are not eliminated merely because the grand jury has ended its activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\"><em>Douglas Oil Co. v.

The initiation and prosecution of this litigation, however, was in our opinion the direct cause of their disclosure, for absent this litigation, following the unsuccessful administrative request, the 31 documents would never have been identified as falling within the scope of Scientology\u2019s FOIA request, and the documents would never have been evaluated to determine whether they should or could be released under the guidelines set forth in the Attorney General\u2019s letter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-14\"><em>Church of Scientology of California </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>209 U.S.App.D.C. 329 at 334, 653 F.2d 584, at 589.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b935-9\">.
