In February 1978, she reported to the Social Security Administration, which administers the SSI program under the direction of the Secretary, that she had married an ineligible person whose sole income was approximately $295 per month from retirement benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. Because her spouse\u2019s includable income was $5.80 above the amount allowed by the Secretary\u2019s regulations, appellant was terminated from all benefits in June 1978. After exhausting her administrative remedies, appellant brought an action for judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decision in the district court. The court affirmed the Secretary\u2019s termination of appellant\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">Appellant argues that the Secretary has breached her statutory duty to determine whether, \u201cunder [appellant\u2019s] circumstances,\u201d deeming appellant\u2019s income to include so much of her ineligible husband\u2019s income as disqualifies her from SSI benefits is \u201cinequitable.\u201d We find, however, that appellant has not shown that the Secretary has violated any statutory duty. Section 1382c(f)(l) does impose on the Secretary a duty to determine under what circumstances deeming ineligible spouse income to be eligible spouse income is inequitable. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>cordingly, the Secretary has promulgated regulations providing for numerous exclusions from the generally applicable deeming requirement of \u00a7 1382c(f)(l), such as exclusions of amounts used (1) to support ineligible children living in the same household, (2) to fulfill an approved plan for achieving self-support, or (3) to comply with the terms of court-ordered support. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.-1185. Appellant concedes in her brief that in determining whether appellant was entitled to receive SSI benefits after her marriage, the Secretary included in her calculation an exclusion for unearned income of $20.00. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 5-6. Appellant\u2019s argument is that the Secretary must be required to consider the particular equities of appellant\u2019s circumstances and to determine whether those equities entitle appellant to some further exclusion from the deeming provision beyond the generalized exclusions of \u00a7 416.1185. We hold, however, that the Secretary acted within her discretion in choosing not to engage in case-by-case adjudications of inequitable circumstances and not to include among the regulatory exclusions each and every equitable particular of persons in precisely appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">We have previously held that the language \u201cexcept to the extent determined by the Secretary to be inequitable under the circumstances\u201d does not require the Secretary to engage in case-by-case determinations. <em>Hammond v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>646 F.2d 455 (10th Cir. 1981) (construing this clause in \u00a7 1382c(f)(2), in which the language is identical to that in the equities clause of \u00a7 1382c(f)(l)). As we indicated in <em>Hammond, </em>we also follow the First Circuit\u2019s ruling that in defining the equitable exceptions, the Secretary need not expressly rule on every conceivable or rational category or circumstance, but may rely upon generalized rules that fall within the scope of his discretion to effectuate lawful congressional purposes. <em>See Kollett v. Harris, </em>619 F.2d 134 (1st Cir. 1980). In this case, the Secretary has set forth detailed regulations which are rationally related to the purposes and concerns of Congress in enacting \u00a7 1382c(f)(l), and which, as Congress intended, avoid those difficulties of individual determinations that outweigh the marginal increments in the precise effectuation of congressional concerns which they might be expected to produce. <em>See generally Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 785, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2476, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The Secretary\u2019s decision not to make an additional exception for those whose circumstances are like appellant\u2019s, therefore, is not an abuse of the Secretary\u2019s broad discretion. Even though appellant\u2019s circumstances are very appealing to the equitable conscience, we could find that the Secretary has abused her discretion under these circumstances only by requiring her to make case-by-case adjudications in every \u00a7 1382c(f)(l) case or to define the exclusionary categories narrowly enough to amount to essentially the same thing. We have already declined in the <em>Hammond </em>case to impose such requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
