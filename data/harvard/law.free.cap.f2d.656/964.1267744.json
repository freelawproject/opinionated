Allen, a bookmaker in Baltimore, had joined with one James Hooper, a former Baltimore City Policeman, and others to bribe officers on the Baltimore City Police Department. Hooper tried to bribe two officers in exchange for protection for the bookmaking operation. The officers reported Hooper\u2019s offer to their superiors who in turn contacted the FBI. The FBI, in consultation with the United States Attorney\u2019s office, conducted the investigation which resulted in this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-19\">The Government\u2019s evidence of the nexus between Allen\u2019s activities and interstate commerce consisted of showing that supplies used in the bookmaking operation had traveled in interstate commerce. Since Allen\u2019s racketeering activities were limited strictly to Baltimore City, he contends, therefore, that the Government failed to show a nexus between the enterprise, which he claims is the bribery scheme, and interstate commerce. Thus he claims he should not have been prosecuted under RICO, but rather under the Maryland bribery statute, Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 23. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-20\">The RICO statute under which Allen was convicted provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-21\">(c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated <em>with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, </em>to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-22\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) (emphasis added). We have held that \u201c[t]he Government need not demonstrate that the alleged acts of racketeering themselves directly involved interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Altomare, </em>625 F.2d 5, 8 n. 8 (4th Cir. 1980). Thus the supplies used in Allen\u2019s bookmaking operations which originated outside of Maryland provided a sufficient nexus between the enterprise and interstate commerce to invoke RICO. <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>The judgment of conviction is accordingly AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
