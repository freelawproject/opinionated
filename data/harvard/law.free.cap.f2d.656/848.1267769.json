ROBINSON, III, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">John H. Anderson prosecuted a suit in the District Court against the Internal Revenue Service under the Privacy Act of 1974.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After prevailing on the merits, he moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The amount he sought was reached by placing a market value on the services his two lawyers had rendered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That far, Anderson\u2019s motion gave the appearance of a matter comparatively routine in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">What made it something else was the nature of the relationship preexisting between Anderson\u2019s counsel and a labor organization, particularly with respect to court-awarded attorney\u2019s fees. As salaried employees of the National Treasury Employees Union, they had represented Anderson pursuant to the union\u2019s prepaid legal services plan,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and had been compensated by the union at rates well below those utilized in the computation of the fees requested.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The union claims that the fees belong to it rather than counsel,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the fee award was sought, not for counsel, but for the union. The District Court, resolving to limit the recovery to the union\u2019s financial outlay on Anderson\u2019s behalf, allowed only $2,000 in fees, observing that more would \u201cresult in a windfall profit to the union at the expense of the public fisc.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-20\">When we addressed this appeal earlier, we deemed pivotal the frank reaffirmation of union counsel at oral argument that all fees realized in consequence of Anderson\u2019s motion would go into the union\u2019s treasury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We held that \u201c[s]ince the objective in this case is essentially a fee award for the union and not for counsel themselves ... no fee exceeding the expenses incurred by the union \u2014 in terms of attorney\u2019s salaries and other out-of-pocket expenses \u2014 should be allowed.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A higher award, we reasoned, would permit the union to reap a profit on the services its attorneys had furnished Anderson, and thereby involve the union in the unauthorized practice of law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus we concurred in the District Court\u2019s analysis, though we directed remand of the case for recalculation of the amount proper.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-21\">Shortly after our opinion issued, however, the court elected to accord <em>en bane </em>reconsideration to <em>Copeland v. Marshall,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a case involving a superficially related problem. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>The question in <em>Copeland </em>was whether awards of attorney\u2019s fees in Title VII suits against federal agencies <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> are to be measured by the market value of the attorney\u2019s services or instead by his costs plus a reasonable profit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> With the appearance, at least superficially, of a possible relationship between the problems there and here, we deferred action on Anderson\u2019s suggestion for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed our mandate pending resolution of <em>Copeland.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Our <em>Copeland </em>decision has now been announced,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and we find nothing in it \u2014 or in the vigorous arguments of appellant and amici curiae for rehearing <em>en banc </em>in this case \u2014 to lead us to believe that our original ruling was in error. Nonetheless, because we may not have been fully understood, we deem it appropriate to issue, <em>sua sponte, </em>a supplemental opinion elaborating on the principles underlying our earlier adjudication, and on the limited nature of our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">I. THE BASIS OF OUR HOLDING</p>\n<p id=\"aqu-dedup-0\">Were this a case wherein attorney\u2019s fees were requested for the attorneys themselves, our approach would be completely conventional. The Privacy Act authorizes assessment against the United States of reasonable fees in favor of a complainant who has substantially prevailed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Congress has made plain that fee determinations in such instances are to be reached by consideration of \u201cthe criteria as delineated in the existing body of law governing the award of fees,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and <em>Copeland </em>points the way to market value of services as the general standard.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The mere fact that Anderson\u2019s counsel were salaried employees of the union would not affect the size of the fees to which they would be entitled,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> nor would the governmental character of the agency required to pay them.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In sum, the allowance would emerge as the product of the same methodology applicable to any other legal practitioner requesting an attorney\u2019s fee for himself in a Privacy Act case.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">What makes for the difference here is the simple fact that the fees are not sought for the lawyers who had handled Anderson\u2019s case, but for the union in whose hire they did so. Of that there can be no doubt. At oral argument, union counsel told us that the entire fee recovery would be turned over to their employer; moreover, the union itself asserts the claim that whatever fees are forthcoming will belong, not to the lawyers, but to it.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> So patent it is that the union is the real party in interest that we have granted its motion for substitution as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>the appellant herein in Anderson\u2019s stead.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> No less now than earlier, we must treat the matter for what it really is \u2014 a quest by the union to recover attorney\u2019s fees aggregating more than the cost to it of supplying the legal services Anderson utilized in his Privacy Act suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The obstacle the union faces is rooted in canons prescribed by the American Bar Association\u2019s Code of Professional Responsibility.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> While technically not binding on the court and, of course, in any event subordinate to any contrary dictate of federal law,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the Code enshrines the collective wisdom of the legal profession on what is acceptable behavior within its ranks. Beyond that, the ethical considerations and rules comprising the Code derive their considerable force from the power of the bench and bar to discipline errant attorneys,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and they afford the public its best assurance of competent and responsible legal service.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We believe, then, that the principles the Code effectuates are due great deference in the absence of any countervailing reason of law or policy.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> And, as we indicated in our original opinion,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> we think the Code stands squarely athwart the road that the union hopes to travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Quite conspicuously, the Code\u2019s strictures on the attorney\u2019s professional alliances strongly exert their influence here.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Lawyers are free to accept employment by an organization offering a prepaid legal services plan to its members,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> but only if \u201c[s]uch organization, including any affiliate, is so organized and operated that no profit is derived by it from the rendition of legal services by lawyers.... \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> This restriction is closely related to two more of the Code\u2019s most fundamental prohibitions. Attorneys may not split fees with laymen or lay organizations,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> or enable them to engage in the unauthorized practice of law.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Courts<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and bar groups<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> alike have re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>peatedly endorsed these ethical maxims. We, too, recognize their inestimable value as safeguards against the imposition of incompetent and irresponsible law practice on the public.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">To honor these wholesome principles here is hardly the radical step that the union charges. Indeed, as our earlier opinion noted,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> obedience is expressly required by an <em>en banc </em>decision of this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-5\">It is our view that the award [of attorney\u2019s fees] must go to counsel rather than to the organizations which pay their salaries .... This procedure' avoids all problems of whether the organization might, by receiving an award directly, be involved in the unauthorized practice of law. On the other hand, . . . counsel [must] reimburse their respective organizations for the kinds of expenses they incurred which would normally be included in an attorney\u2019s fee. . . . But any amount in excess of such reimbursement belongs to counsel themselves.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOt3\">The admitted fact here is that the employing organization \u2014 the union \u2014 compensated the lawyers who represented Anderson at rates well below the going value of their services on the open market.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Manifestly, then, the union would profit \u2014 perhaps handsomely \u2014 on the legal activities of those lawyers under any arrangement whereby market-value fees wend their way into the union\u2019s general treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Drawn as we are into the area of the attorney\u2019s professional relationships, we remain sensitive to the danger of inadvertently treading on associational or other constitutionally-grounded rights.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We therefore take pains to identify certain activities with respect to which we perceive no legal objection. Reasonableness, in terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>market value of the services rendered, is the sole limit on fee awards to organizationally-hired lawyers when the fees are to be paid to the lawyers alone.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The organization, whatever its character, may recoup in full the expense it incurred in supplying the services to the client.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Lawyers may, if they wish, voluntarily donate some or all of their fees to charity,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> or even to their employers,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> just as they may spend their other monies as they please.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">None of these situations is before us, however. Rather, the settled expectation of the union employer and the employed attorneys that all fees recovered belong to the union means that the employing lay organization would capitalize on the attorney\u2019s services, reap a profit therefrom, and put the monies thus made to any use it chooses. In the absence of any compelling reason to disregard the ethical considerations implicated \u2014 and we discern none here \u2014 we believe that an allowance of above-cost fees to the union is inappropriate.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">II. THE LIMITS ON OUR HOLDING</p>\n<p id=\"Ac1h\">The union and amici curiae advance two principal arguments for an award of market-value fees in this instance. To do otherwise, the union suggests, will bring us inevitably into conflict with our recent holding in Copeland<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Amici offer an even more apocalyptic scenario: our decision, they contend, will destroy the public interest bar by squeezing out of existence those legal aid organizations that depend on court-awarded attorney\u2019s fees for part of their funding.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">Certainly, if true, these would be powerful objections. But onto every parade of horribles some dispersing rain must fall, and we are not persuaded that our decision will have such baleful effects. On the contrary, these criticisms reveal a profound misunderstanding of the principles underlying our original opinion, and as well a failure to appreciate the limited nature of our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">A. <em>Implications for the Public Service Bar</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">Amici point out that a number of courts have approved market-value attorney\u2019s fee allowances directly to legal aid offices and public interest organizations. We are aware that at least nine circuits have vindicated such awards.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Those decisions, however, bear no relevance to the instant case. The Code of Professional Responsibility permits a lawyer to divide fees with or distribute them to other members of his \u201claw firm or law office,\u201d <footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and we see no reason why this authorization should not extend to pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>lie as well as private legal practitioners.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The same principle leaves a salaried attorney at liberty to surrender his fees to a public interest organization dedicated entirely to litigative activities.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">These results, we think, are firmly rooted in sound policy. As the Third Circuit has noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-5\">[t]he award of fees to legal aid offices and other groups furnishing <em>pro bono publico </em>representation promotes the enforcement of the underlying statutes. . . . Legal services organizations often must ration their limited financial and manpower resources. Allowing them to recover fees enhances their capabilities to assist in the enforcement of congressionally favored individual rights.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Other courts across the country are in accord.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> We ourselves have observed that full-fee allowances to public interest law firms may be necessary to effectuate the \u201cprivate attorney\u2019s general\u201d concept implicit in much of Congress\u2019 antidiscrimination legislation.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Indeed, Congress itself has sanctioned such awards, at least in the civil rights area, for, as the Supreme Court recently observed, \u201cCongress [has] endorsed .. . decisions allowing fees to public interest groups when it was considering, and passed, the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976<footnotemark>56</footnotemark>. . . which is legislation similar in purpose and design to Title VII\u2019s fee provision.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The important consideration is that in these instances the fees are plowed back into the litigative programs that made their recovery possible in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">Here, in contrast, there is no hint whatsoever that the sought-after fees would be similarly devoted. So far as we know, they would go toward enrichment of the union\u2019s coffers and support of its diverse operations. The amount over and above the union\u2019s actual cost, we reemphasize, would be a profit on the legal services generating the fees. The ethical exception for fee-splitting within a law office<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> obviously is not applicable, and the policies endorsed by Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>and the courts<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> are not implicated. As we have noted, full-fee awards are appropriate when the monies are to become the attorneys\u2019 own;<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> perhaps, too, such allowances would withstand criticism when the monies are directed into a fund for maintenance of a legal services program.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> But the first of these situations is certainly not the one before us, nor from aught that appears is the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">B. <em>The Impact of Copeland v. Marshall: Of Apples and Oranges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">In <em>Copeland, </em>we held that attorney\u2019s fee awards in Title VII litigation were to be computed on the basis of the market value of the services rendered the client.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> While the awardees there were attorneys associated with a private for-profit law firm, we made clear that our holding applied equally to lawyers employed in public interest law offices.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> This, the union argues, is at war with our conclusion today.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">The answer, once again, is that the instant case is simply not <em>Copeland </em>reincarnated. The distinguishing wrinkle here is that above-cost fees are requested by a lay organization, a circumstance interposing grave ethical difficulties not arising in <em>Copeland, </em>where market-value fees were sought for the attorneys themselves. There thus was no occasion in <em>Copeland </em>for operation of the well-entrenched ethical principles blocking the union\u2019s way in the case at bar.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> With no overriding facet of law or policy evident, we think our decision should indulge these principles their accustomed sway.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">We do not imply, of course, that Congress could not assign the considerations at stake values different from those ascribed by the legal profession. It suffices merely to observe that for cases like the one before us, Congress has not done so. It is noteworthy that the <em>Copeland </em>fee award was for services rendered in an employment discrimination action, and that some of our most telling arguments for a market-value allowance \u2014 the private enforcement scheme of Title VII<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> and congressional affirmation of fee grants to public interest law firms<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> \u2014were grounded in a perceived need for widespread citizen-litigation to translate a broad governmental goal into reality.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The instant suit, by contrast, involves the Privacy Act, which lacks any comparable background, and the attorney\u2019s fee provision of which <footnotemark>68</footnotemark> has the comparatively modest function of removing disincentives to the prosecution of individual actions.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">Our holding, then, is very narrow. We deem it crucial that market-value attorney\u2019s fees are sought here, not by a private law firm or its public counterpart, but by a lay organization, to enable it to turn a profit on what distinctly was lawyers\u2019 work. We decide no more than that an above-cost allowance in these circumstances would be improper, and that the organization must be limited to recovery of the expense to which it was put in supplying the legal services in question. We remand the case to the District Court for computation and award of the amount thus due the union.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-16\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b911-12\">.

The prohibition against the practice of law by a layman is grounded in the need of the public for integrity and competence of those who undertake to render legal services. Because of the fiduciary and personal character of the lawyer-client relationship and the inherently complex nature of our legal system, the public can better be assured of the requisite responsibility and competence if the practice of law is confined to those who are subject to the requirements and regulations imposed upon members of the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, EC 3-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">A non-lawyer who undertakes to handle legal matters is not governed as to integrity or legal competence by the same rules that govern the conduct of a lawyer. A lawyer is not only subject to that regulation, but also is committed to high standards of ethical conduct. The public interest is best served in legal matters by a regulated profession committed to such standards. The Disciplinary Rules protect the public in that they prohibit a lawyer from seeking employment by improper overtures, from acting in cases of divided loyalties, and from submitting to the control of others in the exercise of his judgment. Moreover, a person who entrusts legal matters to a lawyer is protected by the attorney-client privilege and by the duty of the lawyer to hold inviolate the confidences and secrets of his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\"><em>Id., </em>EC 3-3 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">Since a lawyer should not aid or encourage a layman to practice law, he should not practice law in association with a layman or otherwise share legal fees with a layman.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\"><em>Id., </em>EC 3-8 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b914-17\">. <em>Anderson v.
