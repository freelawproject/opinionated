Although the petition raises difficult substantive and procedural questions with reference to the abatement of interstate air pollution, we discern no basis for overruling the agency determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">The Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7401 et seq. (1976 &amp; Supp.1979), (CAA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> places upon the states the \u201cprimary responsibility\u201d for the maintenance of air quality standards. CAA \u00a7 107(a), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407(a). Pursuant to \u00a7 110 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410, each state has adopted a state implementation plan, or \u201cSIP,\u201d which details its program for attainment and maintenance of the EPA-promulgated \u201cnational ambient air quality standards\u201d (NAAQS) (see CAA \u00a7 109, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409). New York\u2019s SIP is set forth at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.-1670 et seq. A proposed change in the New York SIP gives rise to the present dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">On February 4, 1979, the Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (\u201cCon Edison\u201d) petitioned the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) for permission to perform a one-year experiment, or \u201ctest burn,\u201d whereby Units 2 and 3 of its Arthur Kill Generating Facility on Staten Island, New York, and Unit 3 of its Ravenswood Generating Facility in Queens, New York, would be allowed to use fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of 1.5% by weight. In particular, Con Edison wished to analyze the sulfur dioxide emissions produced by 1.5% sulfur oil, inasmuch as apparently these emissions are roughly equal to those produced by the 1% sulfur coal which the company hopes to utilize in the future as part of a long-term Con Edison energy conservation program. DEC authorization of the \u201ctest burn\u201d was necessary because of the .3% limitation on sulfur in oil imposed by state air pollution regulations, <em>see </em>6 NYCRR Part 225. After a public hearing was held and after considerable technical data was considered by the DEC\u2019s Regional Director, the State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, acting pursuant to his power under 6 NYCRR 225.2(c), issued a one-year \u201cspecial limitation\u201d allowing the \u201ctest burn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">As New York\u2019s sulfur-in-fuel regulations have been incorporated into the state\u2019s SIP, EPA approval of the \u201cspecial limitation\u201d was necessary before testing could begin. CAA \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(3)(A); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.6. Accordingly, the \u201cspecial limitation\u201d was submitted to the EPA on November 29, 1979. Pursuant to 40 C.F.R. Part 52, the EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking for approval of the \u201cspecial limitation\u201d on January 17, 1980. 45 Fed.Reg. 3331. Public comment was invited, with comments required to be received by February 19. The comment period was subsequently extended to March 4 <em>(see </em>45 Fed.Reg. 12266, Feb. 25, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">The States of New Jersey and Connecticut, the petitioners herein, commented. Their comments expressed concern that an approval of the New York SIP revision would endanger regional economic growth and have a strong, undesirable impact on air quality within their own state boundaries. These comments led EPA to re-open the comment period so that the issues raised by the two states could be addressed by all interested parties. 45 Fed.Reg. 26101 (April 17,1980). During this extended period, Connecticut and New Jersey formalized their opposition to the revision by filing petitions under CAA \u00a7 126(b), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides that any state may petition the EPA Administrator for a finding that a pollution source in another state violates the Act\u2019s interstate pollution provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>On August 11, 1980, EPA approved the New York SIP revision. The agency found that the one-year \u201ctest burn\u201d would not violate any National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), or exceed any maximum allowable increase in pollutants as set forth in the Clean Air Act\u2019s provisions for prevention of significant deterioration in air quality (\u201cPSD\u201d). Approval of the revision, however, was made contingent upon conversion by Con Edison from oil to natural gas at several sites in Manhattan. The EPA took no action with reference to the \u00a7 126(b) petitions filed by New Jersey and Connecticut. Nor did it act on a request by the State of Connecticut on August 13,1980 for a stay of its final rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">On September 9, 1980, Connecticut and New Jersey filed a joint petition for review of the EPA action. We permitted Con Edison and the State of New York to intervene as respondents. On December 3 and 4, 1980, the EPA held a public hearing on the \u00a7 126(b) petitions filed by Connecticut and New Jersey. No final determination has yet been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">At the outset intervenor New York State argued that this court lacks jurisdiction to review EPA\u2019s approval of the SIP revision inasmuch as the \u00a7 126(b) petitions are still pending. New York urged that, in view of the possibility that EPA should grant the relief requested in petitioners\u2019 \u00a7 126(b) applications and the \u201ctest burn\u201d thereby be blocked, the doctrine of \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d precludes judicial review at this time. We disagree. The \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d doctrine governs the question of whether a particular issue or claim is \u201cinitially cognizable\u201d in a court action or must be presented to an administrative agency for determination in the first instance. <em>See United States v. Western Pac. R. Co., </em>352 U.S. 59, 63-64, 77 S.Ct. 161, 164-165, 1 L.Ed.2d 126 (1956); 3 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 19.01 (1958 &amp; Supp.1976). Its usefulness lies in identifying the proper <em>initial forum. </em>Where, as here, there is uncertainty as to the proper time for <em>judicial review, </em>the concept of \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d is of no relevance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">New York\u2019s argument appears to be that New Jersey and Connecticut will not have exhausted their administrative remedies with reference to New York\u2019s SIP revision application until their \u00a7 126(b) petitions are ruled upon. The relationship between these two petition procedures is central to the merits of this case and will be more fully discussed below (see III, <em>infra). </em>At this point we merely note that there is absolutely no authority to the effect that exhaustion of the \u00a7 126(b) procedure is a condition precedent to a judicial review of an EPA approval of an SIP revision. The EPA Administrator\u2019s grant or denial of such an approval is a final administrative action reviewable by the Courts of Appeals under .the Clean Air Act\u2019s judicial review provision, \u00a7 307(b), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b). <em>See, e. g., U. S. Steel Corp. v. EPA, </em>633 F.2d 671 (3d Cir. 1980). To impose an additional, judicially-created barrier to such a review would be grossly inappropriate for reasons which are graphically illustrated by the present case. EPA\u2019s approval of the New York SIP revision has already taken effect and the \u201ctest burn\u201d has commenced. The petitioning states are immediately concerned with the deleterious effects which the \u201ctest burn\u201d may have during the period preceding final agency action on their \u00a7 126(b) petitions. To defer the exercise of our jurisdiction until such time as EPA renders its final decision on those petitions would thus effectively moot this entire dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>We therefore turn to the merits of petitioners\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Petitioners\u2019 first contention is that EPA erred by rendering a final decision on New York\u2019s SIP revision application without first completing proceedings on the \u00a7 126(b) petitions filed by them during the comment period. Although this objection is essentially procedural, it requires us to analyze not only the SIP revision process but also the Clean Air Act\u2019s provisions dealing with interstate air pollution abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Our starting point is CAA \u00a7 110(a)(2), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(2), the section of the Act which sets forth the requirements which must be met by state implementation plans. As SIPs are designed to promote timely attainment of national air quality standards, each of \u00a7 110(a)(2)\u2019s several paragraphs addresses a particular aspect of the implementation and the maintenance of these standards. Various provisions, for instance, require each SIP to establish emissions limitations (\u00a7 110(a)(2)(B), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(B)), to provide assurances that the state will provide personnel and funding adequate to achieve plan goals (\u00a7 110(a)(2)(F)(i), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(F)(i)) and to mandate a program of periodic motor vehicle inspection (\u00a7 110(a)(2)(G), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(G)). Paragraph (E) describes the provisions which an SIP must contain with reference to interstate air pollution. As originally enacted, this paragraph merely required that each SIP make \u201cadequate provisions for intergovernmental cooperation.\u201d Congress, however, finding that paragraph (E) offered an inadequate answer to a serious problem, strengthened it considerably as part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub.L. 95-95, 91 Stat. 685 (1977). <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 329-31, reprinted in [1977] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1077, 1408-10. As amended, \u00a7 110(a)(2)(E) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-7\">The Administrator shall approve such plan, or any portion thereof, if he determines that it was adopted after reasonable notice and hearing and that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-10\">(E) it contains adequate provisions (i) prohibiting any stationary source within the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will (I) prevent attainment or maintenance by any other State of any such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard, or (II) interfere with measures required to be included in the applicable implementation plan for any other State under part C of this subchapter to prevent significant deterioration of air quality or to protect visibility, and (ii) insuring compliance with the requirements of section 7426 of this title, relating to interstate pollution abatement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">The interstate pollution abatement provisions of an SIP, like all other aspects of the plan, may be revised with the approval of the EPA Administrator. The revision process is governed by CAA \u00a7 110(aX3)(A), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(3)(A), which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azu-dedup-0\">The Administrator shall approve any revision of an implementation plan ... if he determines that it meets the requirements of paragraph (2) and has been adopted by the State after reasonable notice and public hearings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">As is illustrated by Congress\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall,\u201d approval of an SIP revision by the EPA Administrator is <em>mandatory </em>if the revision has been the subject of a proper hearing and the plan as a whole continues to adhere to the requirements of \u00a7 110(a)(2). <em>Union Electric Co. v. EPA, </em>427 U.S. 246, 257, 96 S.Ct. 2519, 2525, 49 L.Ed.2d 474 (1976); <em>Mision Indus., Inc. v. EPA, </em>547 F.2d 123 (1st Cir. 1976). Applying this principle specifically to the interstate aspects of an SIP, it becomes clear that EPA must approve an SIP revision regardless of its interstate impact as long as the revision will not violate the standards set forth in \u00a7 110(a)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">The Act\u2019s other provision regarding interstate pollution disputes, referred to in \u00a7 110(a)(2)(E)(ii), is \u00a7 126, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>This section was added to the Act as part of the 1977 amendments. Subsection (a) states that each state implementing an SIP shall give nearby states a notice of at least sixty days before the commencement of construction of any new possible pollutant source where the air quality of those neighboring states may be significantly affected by emissions from pollution sources. Subsection (b) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-4\">[a]ny State or political subdivision may petition the Administrator for a finding that any major source emits or would emit any air pollutant in violation of the prohibition of section 7410(a)(2)(E)(i) of this title. Within 60 days after receipt of any petition under this subsection and after public hearing, the Administrator shall make such a finding or deny the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Subsection (c) goes on to detail the process by which EPA shall enforce determinations made pursuant to subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">After a careful review of these portions of the Act, their legislative history and relevant case law, we conclude that where a state files a \u00a7 126(b) petition in order to challenge a neighboring state\u2019s proposed SIP revision, completion of the \u00a7 126(b) procedure is not a prerequisite to EPA approval, pursuant to \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A), of the revision. Petitioners rely principally upon \u00a7 110(a)(2)(E)(ii)\u2019s requirement that an SIP must contain provisions \u201cinsuring compliance with [\u00a7 126].\u201d Inasmuch as, as noted above, \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A) incorporates all the requirements of paragraph (E) into the SIP revision process, petitioners reason that no revision may be approved until \u00a7 126(b) proceedings are completed. A sensible reading of the language of the Act, however, cannot support such an interpretation. When \u00a7 110(a)(2)(E)(ii) requires an SIP to insure compliance with \u00a7 126, it clearly refers to subsection (a) only and not to the petition procedure set forth in subsection (b). Subsection (a) of \u00a7 126 is really an extension of \u00a7 110(a)(2) in that it describes further pollution-control measures which must be present in every SIP. It is thus altogether natural that \u00a7 110(a)(2)(E) would incorporate it by reference. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 126, on the other hand, cannot rationally be so incorporated. It directs the EPA Administrator to hold a hearing and make a determination within a given time period. Since state officials obviously cannot control the Administrator\u2019s actions, it defies logic to require the state\u2019s implementation plan to insure that EPA comply with the statutory procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">In a larger sense, petitioners have misapprehended the relationship between the SIP revision process and the \u00a7 126(b) petition procedure. In approving an SIP revision which will have interstate ramifications, EPA is required by \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A) to observe the substantive standard set forth in \u00a7 110(a)(2)(E)(i), i. e., whether pollutants will be emitted in quantities likely to block another state\u2019s attainment and maintenance of an NAAQS or interfere with measures required to be adopted under the Act\u2019s PSD provisions. \u00a7 126(b) by its own terms adopts this same standard. As the substantive inquiry for decision is the same in both proceedings, an argument that one proceeding must be completed as a prerequisite to a final decision in the other makes no sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">In view of the broad overlap between the two procedures, and noting that they call for the same substantive inquiry, it seems clear that they are intended to be utilized in differing procedural settings. As the SIP revision process is set forth comprehensively in \u00a7 110(a)(3) and was already in place when \u00a7 126(b) was enacted in 1977, \u00a7 126(b) appears to have been primarily designed as a means for resolving interstate pollution disputes in situations where an SIP is not being revised. This analysis is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of the SIP revision process in <em>Train v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>421 U.S. 60, 95 S.Ct. 1470, 43 L.Ed.2d 731 (1975). In holding that \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A) is the proper vehicle for approving SIP variances to individual pollution sources not interfering with attainment of national air quality standards, the <em>Train </em>Court emphasized the limited role to be played by the federal government in setting emissions limits once an initial SIP has been submitted and approved. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>79-80, 95 S.Ct. at 1481-1482. To hold that the \u00a7 126(b) procedure, which involves an independent public hearing to be held by the EPA Administrator, may be invoked whenever an SIP revision is submitted and must be completed as a prerequisite to approval of the SIP revision, would be contrary to the spirit of the Court\u2019s comprehensive opinion in <em>Train</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Of course, we do not hold that it would never be proper for EPA to consolidate a \u00a7 126(b) petition with an SIP revision application under \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A). Indeed, such a procedure would probably have saved considerable time and energy in the present case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We merely conclude that EPA\u2019s failure to conclude \u00a7 126(b) proceedings prior to its approval of New York\u2019s SIP revision does not constitute grounds for vacating that approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Petitioners\u2019 second contention warrants little discussion. They claim that EPA erred by failing to assess the aggregate impact which a long-term use of high-sulfur oil by pollution sources in New York would have upon air quality in downwind states. The simple answer to this contention is that the issue of long-term effects was not before the EPA Administrator. The \u201cspecial limitation\u201d as approved by New York State is explicitly limited to one year\u2019s duration. Although the Administrator could properly have inquired into the potential effects of long-term use of high-sulfur oil as a factor to be considered in weighing the merits of the proposed one-year \u201ctest burn,\u201d he was not obligated to do so. In considering an SIP revision under \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A), the proper inquiry is whether the particular revision itself will cause the plan to fail to meet the standards set forth in \u00a7 110(a)(2). <em>See Train, supra, </em>at 93, 95 S.Ct. at 1488. Since qualifying revisions are to be \u201creadily approved,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 95 S.Ct. at 1480-1481, the Administrator\u2019s failure to address the complex and necessarily speculative issue of high-sulfur oil use\u2019s long-term impact does not justify overturning his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Petitioners\u2019 fear that New York can permanently avoid any inquiry into the long-term effects of high-sulfur oil use by enacting a series of short-term SIP revisions is unfounded. As we have just noted, EPA may, in its discretion, properly inquire into the long-term prospects as part of the revision process even when only a short-term revision is proposed. Submission of consecutive one or two-year test burns would undoubtedly prompt the Agency to do just that. Moreover, the long-term issue is one which may be broached as part of the \u00a7 126(b) process. That this latter option is available is illustrated by the present case, for the Administrator has expressed his intention to investigate the long-term inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>state impact of high-sulfur oil use as part of the \u00a7 126(b) proceedings pursuant to the Connecticut and New Jersey petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Nor is there any merit to the argument that EPA was required to investigate the potential interstate impact of high-sulfur fuel use by multiple pollution sources in New York. The \u201cspecial limitation\u201d was granted only as to Con Edison\u2019s Arthur Kill and Ravenswood sites. For purposes of a revision application under \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A), \u201cthe proper inquiry is directed to the emissions of a <em>particular source </em>of pollution . . .,\u201d <em>Ohio Envir. Council v. EPA, </em>593 F.2d 24, 30 (6th Cir. 1979) (emphasis supplied). Should the state attempt to adopt a new SIP revision allowing high-sulfur fuel use at additional sites to these two sites, a new \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A) application will have to be submitted and the interstate impact of multiple-site emissions can be addressed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Finally, petitioners contend that EPA was required to consider the potential impact of the \u201ctest burn\u201d upon efforts to attain air quality standards established by state law. Specifically, Connecticut and New Jersey both claim that EPA, in approving New York\u2019s SIP revision, failed to take into account their own adopted state standards for sulfur dioxide emissions, standards which are more strict than the relevant federal rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">CAA \u00a7 116, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7416, provides that the states shall be free to adopt air quality standards more stringent than required by the NAAQS or other federal law provisions. Nothing in the Act, however, indicates that a state must respect its neighbor\u2019s air quality standards (or design its SIP to avoid interference therewith) if those standards are more stringent than the requirements of federal law. Indeed, \u00a7 110(a)(2)(E) appears to have been carefully drafted to preclude any such interpretation. It provides that each SIP must assure that nearby states will not be hindered in attaining any <em>\u201cnational </em>primary or secondary ambient air quality standard\u201d or implementing any \u201cmeasures <em>required </em>to be included in [its SIP] under part C of [the Act] to prevent significant deterioration of air quality ...\u201d The clear intent of the statute is to require interstate comity only insofar as is necessary to allow each state to comply with the NAAQS and the Act\u2019s PSD provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">Nevertheless, petitioners contend that the EPA was obligated to consider the neighboring states\u2019 air quality standards before approving the SIP revision. They rely primarily on the legislative history of the Act\u2019s interstate pollution abatement sections, and they place particularly strong emphasis upon a footnote to the House Report, <em>supra, </em>which appears to state that in affording interstate protection to NAAQS and PSD attainment measures, the legislators intended also to prevent interference with state air quality standards no matter how strict those standards might be.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">We do not find it necessary to investigate the legislative history of the relevant statutes, for \u00a7 110(a)(2)(E)(i) is quite explicit in limiting interstate protection to federally-mandated pollution standards. Where the text of a statute is unequivocal, there is no need to speculate as to Congress\u2019s intent in enacting it. <em>Southeastern Commun. Coll. v. Davis, </em>442 U.S. 397, 99 S.Ct. 236, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979); <em>United States v. Oregon, </em>366 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>1278, 6 L.Ed.2d 575 (1961). It may be that the House Report and other legislative materials relied upon by petitioners do not accurately reflect Congress\u2019s intent in passing the final version of the interstate pollution provision, and it may be, as intervenor Con Edison suggests, that the scope of federal intervention in interstate pollution controversies was narrowed at the last moment by the House-Senate Conference Committee which drafted many of the 1977 amendments. In any event, it would be inappropriate to speculate as to Congress\u2019s intent regarding state air quality standards where to do so could only result in contravention of the Act\u2019s unambiguous terms. In construing the Clean Air Act, we are compelled to follow the statute\u2019s plain meaning, \u201ceven though effectuating that meaning may have undesirable public policy ramifications.\u201d <em>Manchester Envir. Coalition v. EPA, </em>612 F.2d 56, 60 (2d Cir. 1979), citing <em>TVA v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 173, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2291, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">We are aware of the EPA Administrator\u2019s announced intention to consider New Jersey\u2019s and Connecticut\u2019s state air quality standards in passing upon the pending \u00a7 126(b) petitions. 45 Fed.Reg. 72707 (Nov. 3, 1980). Our holding that EPA is not obligated to consider state law before approving an SIP revision under \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A) is not also a determination that EPA is prohibited from doing so when confronted with a \u00a7 126(b) petition. Since our review today is limited to the agency\u2019s approval of New York\u2019s \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A) application, this issue is not now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Petition for review denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">MANSFIELD, Circuit Judge:</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-8\">. Hereinafter, all references to \u201cthe Act\u201d or \u201cCAA\u201d are to the Clean Air Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b966-13\">. This subsection of the Act is quoted in full <em>infra, </em>at pp. 906-907.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b967-7\">. Concededly, the \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d doctrine would bar us from passing upon the merits of the Connecticut and New Jersey \u00a7 126(b) petitions, since EPA has not yet completed its proceedings thereon. We also recognize that some of the issues raised in the present case may necessarily be similar to those which will be raised should an interested party seek judicial review of EPA\u2019s eventual decision on the \u00a7 126(b) petitions. However, these considerations do not impair our jurisdiction to review EPA\u2019s approval of the SIP revision under the entirely separate provisions of \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b970-7\">. Our holding is also consistent with the legislative history of \u00a7 126(b). In approving its version of \u00a7 126(b), the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee stated that the petition process it sets forth \u201cis intended to expedite, not delay, resolution of interstate pollution conflicts.\u201d House Report, <em>supra, </em>at 331, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 1410. In rejecting the notion that the \u00a7 126(b) procedure must be exhausted as a prerequisite to commencement of a \u201ccitizen suit\u201d under \u00a7 304 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604, the committee went on to state that the \u00a7 126(b) process is designed to provide an <em>\u201centirely alternative method </em>and basis for preventing and abating interstate pollution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied). These comments bolster our conclusion that EPA may approve an SIP revision without requiring interested parties to expend the time and effort necessary to complete the \u00a7 126(b) process.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">We also note that the District of Columbia Circuit, in a recent discussion of the Act\u2019s interstate provisions, viewed \u00a7 126(b) as an independent vehicle for challenging the legality of interstate pollution and made no mention of a requirement that it be exhausted where approval for an SIP revision is sought. <em>Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, </em>636 F.2d 323, 366-7 (D.C. Cir.1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b970-11\">. Nor do we condone EPA\u2019s seeming disregard of \u00a7 126(b)\u2019s requirement that a hearing be held within 60 days after receipt of a petition. The agency has offered neither explanation nor excuse for its tardiness. Had it timely fulfilled its statutory responsibilities, the proceedings under \u00a7 126(b) could easily have been consolidated for decision along with New York\u2019s \u00a7 110(a)(3)(A) application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b971-9\">. House Report, <em>supra, </em>at 331 n. 14, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1977, p. 1410 n. 14. The passage reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-10\">The committee intends that the prohibition against interstate pollution which interferes with prevention of significant deterioration plans in new section 110(a)(2)(E) and new section 126 of the act be construed as including a prohibition on interstate pollution which prevents timely attainment or maintenance of State or local ambient air quality standards or other measures adopted under section 116 of the act. The prohibition should also be construed to protect State or local plans to prevent significant deterioration which are more stringent than is required by ... the act. The same considerations apply for the purpose of the visibility protection provisions of new section 161 of the act.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
