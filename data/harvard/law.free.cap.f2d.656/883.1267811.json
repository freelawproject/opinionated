SKELLY WRIGHT.</p>\n<author id=\"b946-5\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Petitioner Charles Helton seeks review of a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) decision finding that his union, Teamsters Local 515, did not commit an unfair labor practice under Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act (the Act)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when it refused to allow him to post materials critical of the union on the union\u2019s bulletin board, even though it would have permitted him to post any other materials.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the union may not restrict employees\u2019 rights of expression in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">Teamsters Local 515 represents employees at the Chattanooga, Tennessee terminal of Roadway Express, Inc. (the company). The union bulletin board was located in the employees\u2019 \u201cbreakroom\u201d at the terminal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was maintained pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement in effect between the union and the company, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5v\">The Employer agrees to provide suitable space for the union bulletin board in each garage, terminal or place of work. Postings by the union on such boards are to be confined to official business of the union.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-17\">Although the collective bargaining agreement stated that the board was to be used only for official union business, this provision was not enforced. From at least 1967 until 1978<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the union had permitted employees and nonemployees to post a wide variety of notices. Items posted on the board included for-sale notices, announcements of church revivals, nonunion political campaign materials, and even <em>Playboy </em>centerfolds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-18\">Two other bulletin boards were also located in the employees\u2019 breakroom. The company kept its own bulletin board, which was glass-covered and locked, and which was used for posting work rules and safety notices. Occasionally, the company would also allow the union to place notices there. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>third board, which was relatively small, was an all-purpose board used primarily to post notices regarding the employees\u2019 sick fund. This board was commonly referred to as the \u201csick fund board.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">In late 1978 petitioner Helton, who was a company employee and a union member, joined the Professional Drivers\u2019 Council (PROD). PROD is an organization of rank- and-file Teamsters that promotes truck safety and seeks to expose union corruption and pension fund abuse.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Shortly after he became a member Helton received some literature from PROD, including a copy of a newspaper article describing Internal Revenue Service charges against a Las Vegas gambler to whom the Teamsters\u2019 pension fund had loaned large sums of money and a PROD editorial critical of the Teamsters\u2019 pension fund management.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">On December 14, 1978 Helton posted the newspaper article and the PROD editorial on the union bulletin board. Later that day the union\u2019s job steward, acting pursuant to instructions of the union\u2019s business agent, removed this literature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When Helton asked the business agent why the materials had been removed, the agent stated that \u201cbeing a union official he had the legal right to add to or delete from that board, whatever he saw fit.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Several weeks later, on January 8, 1979, Helton posted new PROD material on the union board. This literature was also critical of the Teamsters and accused several union officials of improper and illegal conduct. Again, the job steward removed the literature.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The union did not take any other action against Helton, however.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">Shortly after these incidents occurred the union board, the company board, and the sick fund board were removed from the breakroom so that the walls could be painted. When the painting, was completed only the company board and the union board were returned. Both were placed under locked glass.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thereafter Helton asked union officials for permission to post PROD literature on the union bulletin board. They refused to grant permission. However, they continued to allow employees to use the union bulletin board for nonunion business and for personal notices.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">Petitioner filed unfair labor practice charges against Teamsters Local 515 with the NLRB on February 6, 1979. The General Counsel issued a complaint, and a hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in June 1979.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At the hearing the union\u2019s business agent testified that he had removed the PROD material from the bulletin board because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-14\">It was derogatory, it was adverse toward our local union and the Teamsters in general. And, I felt it shouldn\u2019t be there because it created controversy among the members ... I felt it should not go on the board. . . .f<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>l</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">In his decision the ALJ ruled that the union had committed an unfair labor practice under Section 8(b)(1)(A), which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to \u201crestrain or coerce * * * employees\u201d in the exercise of their rights under Section 7 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>the Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He began by stating that Hel-ton\u2019s activities were clearly encompassed by Section 7.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> He then observed that according to well settled precedent an employer would commit an unfair labor practice under Section 8(a)(1) if it prevented its employees from posting union literature on company bulletin boards but allowed them to post other noncompany materials.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The ALJ reasoned that unions should be held to the same standard of conduct with respect to their own bulletin boards.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion the ALJ found that the availability of alternative means of communication, for example, leaving the material on tables in the breakroom, was immaterial. He further found that there was no danger that employees would mistake PROD literature for official union literature and that, although the PROD literature was extremely critical of the union, it was not so offensive that it did not deserve protection. Finally, the ALJ rejected as \u201cmere conjecture\u201d the business agent\u2019s contention that the literature might lead to altercations among employees.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">The union filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision in September 1979. A three-member panel of the NLRB reversed by a vote of 2 \u2014 1. The majority did not overturn any of the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact. It also conceded that Helton\u2019s activities were encompassed by Section 7. It ruled, however, that unions should not be held to the same standard of conduct as employers.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Section 8(a)(1) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto <em>interfere with, </em>restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section [7]\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Section 8(b)(1)(A), on the other hand, only makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents \u201cto restrain or coerce\u201d employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by Section 7.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> According to the majority, there was no restraint or coercion here; the union did not discipline or threaten Helton, and its actions were \u201ccompletely devoid of any implications of retribution * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The majority also noted that \u201cHelton had ready access to other, equally effective, means of distribution.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>The dissenting member of the panel would have found a violation of Section 8(b)(1)(A). He argued that \u201cit is difficult to conceive of a greater restraint or coercive impact on Section 7 rights than that which suppresses freedom of expression concerning matters inherent in that section.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The absence of a threat of reprisal did not \u201clegitimize the action.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> He agreed with the AU that the availability of alternate channels of communication was immaterial.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">II. THE NLRB\u2019S INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 8(b)(1)(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">As we have seen, the NLRB concedes that Helton\u2019s activities on behalf of PROD are encompassed by Section 7 of the Act.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It further concedes that under Section 8(a)(1) an employer may not prohibit employees from posting union materials on its bulletin board when it allows them access to the board for other purposes.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The NLRB reasons, however, that Section 8(b)(1)(A) is far more narrow than Section 8(a)(1); it only proscribes union conduct that involves threats of violence, economic reprisal, or discipline. To support this position it points out that Section 8(b)(1)(A) does not contain the words \u201cinterfere with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">We find that Section 8(b)(l)(A)\u2019s prohibition against restraint or coercion does apply to the union conduct at issue here; its range of application is not limited to union conduct involving threats of violence or economic coercion.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The NLRB\u2019s narrow interpretation is inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>the plain meaning of the statute and with the legislative history, is not supported by Supreme Court decisions or the NLRB\u2019s own precedent, and is fraught with practical difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">A. <em>The Statutory Language and the Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">As a preliminary matter, the meaning of a statute should be sought in the language in which it is framed. <em>See Local 1976, United Brhd of Carpenters &amp; Joiners v. NLRB, </em>357 U.S. 93, 100, 78 S.Ct. 1011, 1016, 2 L.Ed.2d 1186 (1958); <em>see also Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </em>442 U.S. 397, 411, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2369, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1976); <em>Internat\u2019l Brhd of Teamsters v. Daniel, </em>439 U.S. 551, 566 n.20, 99 S.Ct. 790, 800 n.20, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979); <em>Caminetti v. United States, </em>242 U.S. 470, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917). The action taken by the union here certainly falls within the plain meaning of Section 8(b)(1)(A). When the union removed Helton\u2019s literature from the bulletin board, it \u201crestrained\u201d him in the exercise of his Section 7 rights, at least as the word \u201crestraint\u201d is commonly understood.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">As the NLRB emphasizes, however, interpretation of Section 8(b)(1)(A) cannot be governed solely by reliance on the statutory language. The Taft-Hartley Act, which added Section 8(b)(1)(A) to the National Labor Relations Act, was \u201cthe result of conflict and compromise between strong contending forces and deeply held views on the role of organized labor in the free economic life of the Nation and the appropriate balance to be struck between the uncontrolled power of management and labor to further their respective interests.\u201d <em>Local 1976, United Brhd of Carpenters &amp; Joiners v. NLRB, supra, </em>357 U.S. at 99-100, 78 S.Ct. at 1016.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Thus the Supreme Court has stated that interpretations of Section 8(b)(1)(A) must be guided not just by the section\u2019s literal language, but also by an understanding of the congressional purpose. <em>NLRB v. Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co., </em>388 U.S. 175, 179, 87 S.Ct. 2001, 2005-06, 18 L.Ed.2d 1123 (1967); <em>NLRB v. Drivers, Chauffeurs, Helpers, Local Union No. 639, </em>362 U.S. 274, 292, 80 S.Ct. 706, 716, 4 L.Ed.2d 710 (1960).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Our review of the legislative history fails to convince us that Congress intended Section 8(b)(1)(A) to apply solely to union conduct involving threats of violence, economic reprisal, or discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">The sponsors of the Taft-Hartley Act, in explaining their proposed legislation, focused primarily on the need to control union violence and economic coercion. For example, Senator Taft, in responding to a request for examples of the sort of conduct that Section 8(b)(1)(A) would prohibit, described threats of bodily harm, mass picketing in organization campaigns, and coercion that prevented employees not involved in a labor dispute from going to work. 93 Cong. Rec. 4435-4436 (1947), 2 Legislative History of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Leg.Hist.) 1205-1206 (1948). See <em>also </em>93 Cong.Rec. 4016-4017, 4271, 4432, 4434, 2 Leg.Hist. 1018-1021, 1139, 1199, 1203 (remarks of Senator Ball). However, nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>in the legislative history supports the conclusion that violence and economic reprisal were the sole evils at which Section 8(b)(1)(A) was aimed. Rather, it appears that Congress intended Section 8(b)(1)(A) to cover a range of conduct as broad as that covered by Section 8(a)(1). Senator Ball, a co-sponsor of the legislation, stated that \u201cthe purpose of the amendment is very simple. It is to insert an unfair-labor practice for unions <em>identical </em>with the first unfair labor practice prohibited to employers in the present act * * 93 Cong.Rec. 4016 (1947), 2 Leg.Hist. 1018 (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>93 Cong.Rec. 4021, 4023, 4025, 4436 (1947), 2 Leg.Hist. 1028, 1031, 1032, 1207; S.Rep.No.105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 50, 1 Leg.Hist. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">Omission of the words \u201cinterfere with\u201d from Section 8(b)(1)(A) was not intended to indicate that union conduct should be measured against a less demanding standard than employer conduct. The legislation as originally proposed contained these words. They were deleted because it was feared that they would unduly restrict union organization campaigns; they might be \u201cconstrued to mean that any conversation, any persuasion, any urging on the part of any person, in an effort to persuade another to join a labor organization, would constitute an unfair labor practice.\u201d 93 Cong.Rec. 4399 (1947), 2 Leg.Hist. 1138 (remarks of Senator Ives). Senator Taft agreed to the deletion because he was convinced it would have no effect on the application of Section 8(b)(1)(A):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-5\">I have consulted with the attorneys and they tell me that elimination of the words \u201cinterfere with\u201d would not, so far as they know, have any effect on the court decisions. Eliminating those words would not make any substantial change in the meaning. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Id. (remarks of Senator Taft). Similarly, Senator Ball stated that \u201cthe words \u2018interfere with\u2019 are very vague,\u201d that even with respect to employers \u201cno complaint is ever issued on the interference angle,\u201d and that, because union organizational activities might be affected, it is \u201cimportant that such vague language be eliminated * * 93 Cong.Rec. 4399 (1947), 2 Leg.Hist. 1139 (remarks of Senator Ball). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">B. <em>Supreme Court Decisions Interpreting Section 8(b)(1)(A)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">The NLRB argues that the Supreme Court decisions interpreting Section 8(b)(1)(A), which rely in part on the legislative history, support the position it has \u25a0 adopted here. We disagree. These decisions do not hold that Section 8(b)(1)(A) only proscribes union conduct involving threats of violence, intimidation, or economic reprisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">The NLRB relies heavily on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>NLRB v. Drivers, Chauffeurs, Helpers, Local Union No. 639, supra. </em>In that case the Court held that peaceful recognitional picketing by a labor union did not restrain or coerce employees within the meaning of Section 8(b)(1)(A). The NLRB points out that in reaching this conclusion the Court reviewed the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act and concluded that the chief evil at which Section 8(b)(1)(A) was aimed was \u201cthe elimination of the use of repressive tactics bordering on violence or involving particularized threats of economic reprisal.\u201d 362 U.S. at 287, 80 S.Ct. at 714. The Court then emphasized the peaceful nature of the picketing in question. The NLRB suggests that by adopting this line of reasoning the Supreme Court endorsed a narrow interpretation of Section 8(b)(1)(A). However, the Court never expressly held that the sole purpose of Section 8(b)(1)(A) was to prevent union violence <footnotemark>37</footnotemark>; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>in particular, it never suggested that Section 8(bXl)(A) might not apply to union conduct lying somewhere between threats of violence and simple peaceful persuasion. In fact, the Supreme Court decided to uphold peaceful recognitional picketing primarily because provisions in the House version of the bill that would have explicitly prohibited such picketing were deleted in conference. The Court also relied on statements in the Senate debates clearly indicating that the bill\u2019s sponsors did not intend it to apply to peaceful methods of persuasion. 362 U.S. at 287-289, 80 S.Ct. at 713-715.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Although <em>Drivers Local 639 </em>might be read as containing some support for the NLRB\u2019s narrow interpretation of Section 8(b)(lXA), a subsequent decision significantly undercut that support. In <em>Internat\u2019l Ladies\u2019 Garment Wkrs Union v. NLRB, </em>366 U.S. 731, 738, 81 S.Ct. 1603, 1607-08, 6 L.Ed.2d 762 (1961), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-5\">In the Taft-Hartley law, Congress added \u00a7 8(b)(1)(A) to the [National Labor Relations] Act, prohibiting, as the Court of Appeals held, \u201cunions from invading the rights of employees under \u00a7 7 in a fashion comparable to the activities of employers prohibited under \u00a7 8(a)(1).\u201d * * * It was the intent of Congress to impose upon unions <em>the same </em>restrictions which the [National Labor Relations] Act imposed on employers with respect to violations of employee rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">(Emphasis added; citation and footnote omitted.) The Court then held that, just as an employer violates Section 8(a)(1) by granting exclusive bargaining representative status to a union that does not have majority support, so also a union violates Section 8(b)(1)(A) by accepting such status.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">The NLRB also relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>NLRB v. Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co., supra, </em>388 U.S. 175, 87 S.Ct. 2001, 18 L.Ed.2d 1123. In that case the Court held that a union did not violate Section 8(b)(1)(A) when it fined its members for violating union membership rules. As the NLRB correctly points out, this union conduct would seem to fall within the literal meaning of the terms \u201crestrain\u201d or \u201ccoerce.\u201d However, the Court did not approve the union fines because it believed that the words \u201crestrain or coerce\u201d should be given a narrow interpretation.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>the Court decided to protect the union\u2019s conduct because it concluded that Congress had not intended to regulate internal union affairs. It noted that Section 8(b)(1)(A) contains an internal union affairs proviso, which states that the section \u201cshall not impair the right of a labor organization to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership[.]\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The NLRB did not rely on this proviso in reaching its decision here. In any event, as we explain in Part III <em>infra, </em>we do not believe that the proviso protects the union\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">C. <em>NLRB Precedent</em></p>\n<p id=\"adr-dedup-0\">The NLRB further argues that it has consistently held that Section 8(b)(1)(A) applies only to union conduct involving threats of violence, economic coercion, or discipline. If this were true, deference to the agency interpretation might be appropriate. An administrative agency\u2019s consistent, longstanding interpretation of the statute under which it operates is entitled to considerable weight.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <em>Internat\u2019l Brhd of Teamsters </em>v. <em>Daniel, supra, </em>439 U.S. at 566 n.20, 99 S.Ct. at 800 n.20; <em>United States v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Securities Dealers, </em>422 U.S. 694, 719, 95 S.Ct. 2427, 2442-43, 45 L.Ed.2d 486 (1975); <em>Saxbe v. Bustos, </em>419 U.S. 65, 74, 95 S.Ct. 272, 279, 42 L.Ed.2d 231 (1974); <em>Investment Company Institute v. Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 626-627, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 1097, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971); <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). Even in its own decisions, however, the NLRB has not relied on a narrow interpretation of Section 8(b)(1)(A); the NLRB has never before held that the section applies only to threats of violence, economic reprisal, or discipline.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">The NLRB has pointed out that the central focus of the congressional debate over the Taft-Hartley Act was on union tactics involving physical violence and economic coercion. <em>See Nat\u2019l Maritime Union, </em>78 NLRB 971, 982-987, <em>enforced, </em>175 F.2d 686 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>338 U.S. 954, 70 S.Ct. 492, 94 L.Ed. 589 (1949).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>over, it has consistently held that union violence and intimidation violates Section 8(b)(1)(A). <em>See, e. g., NLRB v. Union Nacional de Trabajadores, </em>540 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1039, 97 S.Ct. 736, 50 L.Ed.2d 750 (1976) (enforcing NLRB order); <em>Nat\u2019l Cash Register Co. v. NLRB, </em>405 F.2d 497 (6th Cir. 1972) (same). And the Board has held that economic coercion is unacceptable under Section 8(b)(1)(A). <em>See, e. g., Teamsters Local </em>1040, 174 NLRB 1153 (1969).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> However, the NLRB has also found Section 8(b)(1)(A) violations in situations where the union had not threatened discipline or other retribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">For example, in <em>Internat\u2019l Union of Elec., Radio &amp; Machine Wkrs, Local 601, </em>180 NLRB 1062 (1970), an employee sought to exercise his Section 7 right to refuse to authorize a payroll dues deduction and to tender his dues by personal check instead. The union refused to accept his checks. The ALJ found that the union had violated Section 8(b)(1)(A) in part because he believed the union\u2019s conduct constituted an implied threat to the employee\u2019s job. In adopting the ALJ\u2019s proposed order the NLRB rejected this finding of an implied threat, stating \u201cwe do not find it necessary to rely on any surrounding threatening circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1062. The simple fact that the union had prevented the employee from exercising his Section 7 right to refuse to allow a payroll deduction was sufficient to support a finding of an unfair labor practice. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>46</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Similarly, in <em>General Motors Corp., </em>168 NLRB 1723 (1966), and <em>General Motors Corp., </em>147 NLRB 509 (1964), the NLRB held that a union violated Section 8(b)(1)(A) when it agreed to contractual provisions banning distribution of rival unions\u2019 literature during nonworktimes and in nonworking areas. The union\u2019s conduct in these cases, which presented an issue closely related to the issue we confront here, clearly did not involve threats of economic coercion.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">D. <em>Practical Difficulties With NLRB Interpretation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">We also believe that the NLRB\u2019s interpretation of Section 8(b)(1)(A) poses substantial practical problems. The NLRB, the unions, and the courts would be required to distinguish between conduct that restrains or coerces employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights, but does not involve threats of violence or economic reprisal, and conduct that restrains or coerces employees and also involves threats of violence or eco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>nomic reprisal. This line-drawing exercise, which would be unnecessary if the plain meaning of the statute controlled, would require resolution of difficult issues of fact.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The facts of this case help illustrate the potential difficulties. The NLRB, which emphasized that no disciplinary action was ever taken against Helton, apparently believes that the union\u2019s conduct cannot be viewed as intimidation.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> It might be argued, however, that the union\u2019s conduct carried an implicit threat, namely, that Hel-ton would be punished if he continued his activities on behalf of PROD. Although this question was apparently not explored at the hearing before the AU, it is quite possible that Helton was intimidated by the union\u2019s action. Thus, under the NLRB\u2019s interpretation of Section 8(b)(1)(A), proper resolution of this case might require determining whether Helton felt threatened, whether his fears were reasonable, and whether the union intended to threaten Helton.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> All of these questions would be avoided if the statute is interpreted to prohibit any action that restrains an employee in the exercise of his Section 7 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">III. RELEVANCE OF INTERNAL UNION AFFAIRS PROVISO</p>\n<p id=\"A65\">Section 8(b)(1)(A) is different fr&lt; Section 8(a)(1) in one essential respect. As we noted in our discussion of <em>Allis-Chalmers, supra, </em>Section 8(b)(1)(A) contains an internal union affairs proviso which states that a union does not commit an unfair labor practice when it prescribes \u201cits own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership!)]\u201d <footnotemark>51</footnotemark> This proviso extends some protection to union conduct that would otherwise fall within the prohibition against restraint or coercion of employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights. We conclude, however, that it does not insulate the conduct at issue here.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">In adopting the internal union affairs proviso Congress recognized that unions have an interest in preserving and strengthening their positions as collective bargaining agents. It further recognized that they cannot serve this interest unless they have some freedom to discipline members who violate rules and regulations governing membership.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> However, union power cannot be absolute. The desire to minimize intrusion upon internal union affairs must be balanced against the need to protect employees who wish to assert their independence from the union, as well as against any other public policies embodied in the federal labor laws.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">In <em>Scofield v. NLRB, </em>394 U.S. 423, 89 S.Ct. 1154, 22 L.Ed.2d 385 (1969), the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>preme Court set forth a test for determining whether union action is protected by the proviso that accommodates these competing concerns. The Court stated that Section 8(b)(lXA) leaves a union free to enforce \u201ca properly adopted rule,\u201d provided that the rule (1) \u201creflects a legitimate union interest,\u201d (2) \u201cimpairs no policy Congress has imbedded in the labor laws,\u201d and (3) \u201cis reasonably enforced against union members who are free to leave the union and escape the rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 89 S.Ct. at 1158.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">The union\u2019s conduct here does not pass this test. At the outset, there is a serious question whether the union\u2019s decision to prohibit the posting of PROD materials was made pursuant to a \u201cproperly adopted rule.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Certainly there was no such rule in the union bylaws or constitution or in the collective bargaining agreement. Nor was Helton given any other form of prior notice.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> But even assuming the union\u2019s action was pursuant to a valid rule, it fails to satisfy the three criteria set forth in <em>Scofield. </em>First, removal of Helton\u2019s PROD materials does not reflect a legitimate union interest. The union claimed that removal was necessary to prevent altercations and to limit undesirable criticism. But the NLRB has expressly held that the desire to prevent controversy or to suppress criticism of union leadership does not constitute a legitimate union interest.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> <em>See Internat\u2019l Union of Operating Engineers Local 400, </em>225 NLRB 596 (1976); <em>Carpenters Local Union No. 22, </em>195 NLRB 1 (1972).<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> In any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>event, the AU found that the union\u2019s fear that \u201csuch literature could lead to altercations between parties\u201d was \u201cmere conjecture and without any evident[i]ary support.\u201d <footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Second, the union\u2019s conduct impairs policies imbedded in the labor laws. It restrained expression protected not only under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> but also under Title I of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), the \u201cBill of Rights\u201d for union members.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Section 101(a)(2) of that statute, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(2) (1976), provides that \u201c[ejvery member of any labor organization shall have the right to meet and assemble freely with other members; and to express any views, arguments or opinions[.]\u201d <footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Congress intended this free speech right to parallel the rights conferred under the First Amendment; it hoped to secure union democracy by establishing a right to express dissenting views without fear of discipline. The LMRDA was in part \u201cdesigned to protect the rights of union members to discuss freely and criticize the management of their unions and the conduct of their officers.\u201d <em>Salzhandler v. Caputo, </em>316 F.2d 445, 448-449 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 996, 84 S.Ct. 344, 11 L.Ed.2d 275 (1963).<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">The importance of protecting the free speech rights of union members has been consistently recognized by courts asked to consider the scope of Section 101(a)(2) of the LMRDA. <em>See, e. g., Grand Lodge of Internat\u2019l Ass'n of Machinists v. King, </em>335 F.2d 340, 344 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 920, 85 S.Ct. 274, 13 L.Ed.2d 334 (1964).<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Indeed, the right of free speech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>has been described as \u201calmost absolute.\u201d <em>Turner v. Air Transport Lodge 1894 of Internat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists, </em>590 F.2d 409, 410 (2d Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Thus it is clear that the union conduct at issue here, by interfering with Helton\u2019s efforts to challenge the Teamsters\u2019 leadership, deprived him of rights guaranteed by the LMRDA. If the union\u2019s conduct were endorsed, an important policy of the federal labor laws would be undermined.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">As for the third prong of the <em>Scofield </em>test, it seems unlikely that Helton could have avoided the union\u2019s action by resigning his membership. Presumably, the union would have removed Helton\u2019s materials from' the bulletin board even if he had not been a union member. Under the circumstances, it is difficult to view the union\u2019s activity simply as an effort to police its membership.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">IV. AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNA- . TIVE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">As further support for its decision in this case the NLRB notes that \u201cHelton had ready access to other, equally effective, means of distributing]\u201d PROD material.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> It suggests that Helton could have posted the material on the sick fund board, or simply left stacks of literature in the break-room. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">In the first place, it is not clear that Helton actually did have access to equally effective alternatives. He was not permitted to use the locked company board. Items posted on the sick fund board, which is no longer available, might not have had the same impact as items posted on the union board. Leaving stacks of literature in the breakroom would have been an inadequate substitute because company custodians would have removed the literature whenever they cleaned up.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Moreover, there is no assurance that the union itself would not have removed such material. In any event, this approach would have been relatively expensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">More important, the existence of alternatives is irrelevant. It is well established that the availability of other channels of communication does not justify employer restraint of employees\u2019 Section 7 rights in nonwork areas at nonwork times. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number><em>NLRB v. Magnavox Co., </em>415 U.S. 322, 94 S.Ct. 1099, 39 L.Ed.2d 358 (1974), the Supreme Court stated that unless the employer could show that productivity or discipline required restraint of Section 7 rights, it would not be appropriate to \u201cbalance the availability of alternative channels of communication against a legitimate employer business justification for barring or limiting in-plant communications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326-327, 94 S.Ct. at 1102-1103. <em>See also Eastex, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>437 U.S. 556, 570-576, 98 S.Ct. 2505, 2514-2517, 57 L.Ed.2d 428 (1978); <em>NLRB v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., </em>351 U.S. 105, 113, 76 S.Ct. 679, 685, 100 L.Ed. 975 (1956); <em>Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, </em>324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945).<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> We see no reason why a different rule should apply here, where union conduct is at issue.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The simple fact that the union has attempted to restrain an employee in the exercise of his Section 7 rights is enough to justify a finding of a Section 8(b)(1)(A) violation.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">We conclude that the union committed an unfair labor practice. The union\u2019s conduct constituted restraint of Helton\u2019s Section 7 rights within the meaning of Section 8(b)(1)(A). It was not insulated by the internal union affairs proviso since it did not serve a legitimate union interest and would have frustrated the free speech rights guaranteed by the LMRDA. Even if alternative means of communication were available, their availability was irrelevant. We grant Helton\u2019s petition for review. The NLRB will submit a proposed decree in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-10\">.

Magnavox Co., </em>415 U.S. 332, 94 S.Ct. 1099, 39 L.Ed.2d 358 (1974). In that case a union challenged an employer\u2019s rule against distribution of literature on company property. This rule was presumptively invalid. However, the collective bargaining agreement in effect between the union and the employer provided that the employer could issue rules governing use of plant property; it also provided that there would be bulletin boards for union notices. Thus the Court was confronted with the question whether the union had waived the employees\u2019 \u00a7 7 rights by agreeing to an otherwise invalid no-distribution rule in return for the use of a union bulletin board. The Court held that the union could not waive the individual employees\u2019 \u00a7 7 rights. The bulletin boards were not an adequate substitute since they were to be used only for union notices and thus would not give a union\u2019s adversaries an opportunity to communicate with their fellow employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Member Jenkins suggests that <em>Magnavox </em>effectively holds that a union may not restrict the employees\u2019 right to disseminate views critical of the union. The majority distinguished <em>Mag-navox </em>on several grounds. First, this case, unlike <em>Magnavox, </em>involved \u00a7 8(b)(1)(A) rather than \u00a7 8(a)(1). Second, there was no contractual waiver of individual employees\u2019 \u00a7 7 rights.

In fact, it also noted those portions of the legislative history suggesting that Congress intended the scope of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(A) to be as broad as the scope of \u00a7 8(a)(1). The Court referred to the legislative history primarily because it wished to demonstrate the absence of any intention to regulate the internal affairs of unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">Other Supreme Court decisions have also suggested that \u00a7 8(b)(1)(A) is aimed primarily at violence or economic reprisal.

The NLRB argues that these cases do involve economic coercion. \u201cIn waiving employee distribution rights in the contracts in those cases, the unions used the inherently coercive powers of the employer to prevent employee distribution of literature adverse to the unions * * Respondent\u2019s brief at 11. We find this contention unpersuasive. The union does not engage in economic coercion simply because it joins forces with the employer. Economic coercion, as we understand it, involves conduct that threatens employees with loss of their jobs or with some other pecuniary sanction.

The requirement that the disciplinary action be taken pursuant to a \u201cproperly adopted rule\u201d is intended to protect union members from arbitrary or discriminatory union action. It might be argued that where the union did not act pursuant to a properly adopted rule, but where it can show that its action was justified and that it did not behave in an arbitrary or discriminatory fashion, it deserves some protection under \u00a7 8(b)(1)(A); the proviso, as well as the legislative history, indicate a strong congressional desire to minimize intrusion upon internal union affairs. Even if this argument is correct, however, the principles set forth in <em>Scofield </em>would continue to apply; the union action would have to serve a legitimate union interest, it could not impair any policy imbedded in the labor laws, and there would have to be evidence suggesting that the employee could have escaped the union\u2019s action by resigning his union membership. We explain <em>infra </em>that the union conduct at issue here does not satisfy these requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b956-7\">. On the other hand, even if the union did not have a formal rule against such postings when it decided to remove Helton\u2019s literature, its policy regarding such materials is now clear. Although it does not appear that a rule has been formally adopted, employees are on notice that if they post anti-union literature on the union bulletin board, it will be removed.

The NLRB argues- that the availability of alternatives is relevant where union conduct is involved because it demonstrates that the union \u201chas not engaged in collusion with the Company to alter employee communication rights incident to the employment relationship.\u201d Respondent\u2019s brief at 13 n.4. In other words, it has not engaged in economic coercion by relying on the economic power implicit in the employer-employee relationship. But we have already rejected the NLRB\u2019s contention that simple restraint is not enough to violate \u00a7 8(b)(1)(A), and that the union must engage in economic coercion or threaten violence. In any event, we find the NLRB\u2019s claim that union conduct closing all channels of communication constitutes economic coercion to be unconvincing. <em>See </em>note 47 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"73\">\n<p id=\"b959-15\">. In addition to his claim that the union committed an unfair labor practice, Helton contends that it breached its duty of fair representation.
