After unsuccessfully seeking the Commission\u2019s leave to present evidence bearing on the current propriety of a divestiture order emanating from that proceeding, RSR asserted in the District Court that the Commission\u2019s refusal to reopen was not only arbitrary but also contaminated by ex parte communications with its staff. The District Court concluded that RSR had not shown circumstances extraordinary enough to justify setting aside the decision against reopening.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b781-22\">RSR engages primarily in the recovery of recycled or \u201csecondary\u201d lead from scrap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>sources such as used batteries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1972 RSR acquired through merger substantially all of the assets of another secondary lead smelting firm, Quemetco, Inc., and thereby increased its share of the secondary lead market in the United States from 12.16 to 19.18 percent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Resultantly, in 1974 the Commission issued a complaint<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> charging RSR with a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After a three-month hearing, an administrative law judge ruled, <em>inter alia, </em>that RSR\u2019s merger with Quemetco contravened Section 7 because it could substantially lessen competition in the national market for secondary lead,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and recommended divestiture of one of four smelting plants RSR had derived from the merger.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission accepted the judge\u2019s finding of a Section 7 transgression,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but ordered RSR to divest itself of almost all of its Quemetco assets.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Ninth Circuit affirmed,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court declined further review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">RSR thereafter petitioned the Commission to reopen the proceeding on the ground that changed conditions in the secondary lead smelting industry had rendered the divestiture order unnecessary to remove any prior anticompetitive effect.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> RSR also alleged that ex parte communications of an undisclosed nature had occurred between the Commission and its prosecutive staff regarding the decision to reopen,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and sought to bar any such future contacts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Commission ruled that RSR\u2019s proffered evidence was insufficient on its face to warrant reopening,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that consideration of RSR\u2019s petition to reopen was not a process subject to ex parte constraints.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-16\">RSR then came to the District Court for an order to reopen. The grounds of suit were that the Commission\u2019s refusal to reopen was arbitrary, and was vitiated by ex parte contacts with the prosecutive staff.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This appeal followed the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-17\">RSR argues that the Commission\u2019s decision not to reopen the Clayton Act proceeding was incorrect on the merits.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> RSR further contends that the claimed communications between the staff and the Commission regarding the decision to reopen violated RSR\u2019s procedural due process rights as well as relevant provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We consider each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-18\">II. REFUSAL TO REOPEN</p>\n<p id=\"A6P\">In ruling that the Commission did not err in declining to reopen a proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>that already had spanned six years,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the District Court considered the submissions of both parties, including the extensive record compiled before the Commission, and found that it had made a \u201creasoned and reasonable statement on the record denying [RSR\u2019s] administrative application for reconsideration.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The court acted in full accord with the applicable law, and we readily affirm on this aspect of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Both the Supreme Court and this court consistently have subscribed to the rule that administrative agencies are not to be required to reopen their final orders \u201cexcept in the most extraordinary circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The need for that principle is evident, for \u201c[i]f upon the coming down of the order litigants might demand rehearings as a matter of law because some new circumstance has arisen, some new trend has been observed, or some new fact discovered, there would be little hope that the administrative process could ever be consummated in an order that would not be subject to reopening;\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> moreover, \u201cthere would [be] little assurance that at the conclusion of such a reopening, and the time required to digest the new material, the record would not again have become \u2018stale.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Consequently, \u201c[i]t has been almost a rule of necessity that rehearings were not matters of right, but were pleas to discretion^] [a]nd likewise it has been considered that the discretion to be invoked was that of the body making the order, and not that of a reviewing body.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has admonished, \u201cthere is sound basis for adhering to [the] practice of declining to require reopening of the record, except in the most extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">The record before us amply supports the District Court\u2019s view that the Commission acted reasonably in declining to reopen the proceeding leading to the divestiture order. RSR contends vigorously that changed circumstances in the secondary lead smelting industry \u2014 most notably the advent of a new maintenance-free battery<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> \u2014 has rendered the Commission\u2019s divestiture order unnecessary to counteract whatever anticompeti-tive effects RSR\u2019s 1972 merger with Quem-etco may have occasioned.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This same argument, however, was advanced unsuccessfully not only before the administrative law judge<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> but also before both the Commission<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the Ninth Circuit on appeal.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> All three tribunals felt that the speculative nature of RSR\u2019s claim sapped whatever strength it might otherwise have had. Moreover, both the administrative law judge and the Commission ruled that even if taken as true, RSR\u2019s thesis would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>justify setting aside the divestiture order.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In denying RSR\u2019s petition to reopen the proceeding, the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-4\">Given that the affidavits submitted, if accepted at face value, serve at most to undermine, to some limited degree, the validity of one of the <em>Brown Shoe </em>criteria,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the Commission cannot conclude that a basis has been shown that would warrant reopening as to the product market and conducting a second trial as to the merits of the various claims made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">With respect to [RSR\u2019s] claim that a national market for secondary lead no longer exists, the facts asserted by the affiants are at most slight variants of those that were considered in detail by the administrative law judge and the Commission in the original trial of this matter. While the market definition question was undoubtedly open to reasonable disagreement, it was fully litigated, and the Commission\u2019s disposition was affirmed by the Court of Appeals with <em>cer-tiorari </em>denied by the Supreme Court. The facts presented in the instant motion to reopen are not such as would warrant a re-adjudication of the geographic market question.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In these circumstances, we cannot say that the District Court was amiss in ruling as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">III. EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"AsH\">RSR\u2019s complaint of ex parte communications refers exclusively to a presentation the prosecutive staff is said to have made to the Commission\u2019s members on the petition to reopen.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> There is no claim of any sort of contact between the agency and outsiders.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The question, then, is whether it was improper for those who had to pass on the petition to make use of the staff in reaching their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-14\">The Administrative Procedure Act states pertinently, with exceptions not applicable here, that</p>\n<p id=\"b784-15\">in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing, . . . [a]n employee or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for an agency in a case may not, in that or a factually related case, participate or advise in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review . . . except as witness or counsel in public proceedings.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-16\">That, of course, is a command that the Commission must scrupulously observe. But, as the legislative language itself makes evident, this prohibition obtains only when some statute necessitates adjudication of the matter in question on the administrative record.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The statute governing Commission consideration of a proposal to reopen imposes no such procedure; it simply authorizes reopening \u201cwhenever in the opinion of the Commission ... conditions of fact or of law have so changed as to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>such action or if the public interest shall so require.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">RSR nevertheless asserts that the Commission\u2019s consideration of a request to reopen \u201chas all the hallmarks of an adjudicative proceeding.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Certainly the Commission does not think so, for its regulation on reopenings prescribes no procedure whatsoever beyond the filing of a reopening request containing specified information.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Indeed, the Commission fashioned this regulation in that manner for reasons directly pertinent here. As it then explained,</p>\n<p id=\"A-_\">no provision of the FTC Act . . . requires notice and opportunity for hearing with respect to the Commission\u2019s predecisional deliberations on petitions to reopen; hence, the APA adjudicatory provisions are inapplicable to these deliberations. The mere filing of a petition to reopen, in other words, does not under the FTC Act automatically trigger the adjudicative process. That process begins only if the Commission after reviewing the petition issues an order . .. reopening the proceeding when in its opinion changed conditions of fact or law or the public interest require such reopening.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">We concur in this analysis. RSR\u2019s petition requested reopening of an administrative order that had long since become final. The adjudicative process producing that order came to an end when the order was promulgated. When the Commission addressed RSR\u2019s petition, it was merely seeking to reach a conclusion on whether it should reopen the record underlying the order and thereby initiate a new round of adjudication. And in pondering that question, the Commission treated as true RSR\u2019s allegations,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> thus avoiding the need for any adjudicative findings. To be sure, had reopening occurred, RSR would have had a chance to persuade the Commission to modify the order. But the pre-reopening phase itself was only a prelude to a resumption of the adjudicative process \u2014 which possibly could have taken place, but never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">It would be a mistake to assume automatically, as RSR apparently does, that Commission consideration of the petition to reopen was itself adjudicative, and thus forbade assistance by the prosecutive staff, simply because that had been the nature of the administrative activity preceding the petition, and would have been the nature of the activity that would have followed had the petition been successful. As Professor Davis points out, \u201cany proceeding . . . may involve a plurality of tasks, . . . and the proper procedure has to reflect each of those tasks, not the whole proceeding[;] . . . [ljetting the choice of procedure depend upon characterization of a whole proceeding as ... \u2018adjudication,\u2019 .. . involves crude thinking that fails even to begin to reach the true reasons that should control the selection of the appropriate procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The Commission, we think, was at liberty to regard the pre-reopening phase of the proceeding according to what <em>it </em>demanded or permitted procedurally, and not to ascribe to it a character based upon what some other phase may have called for.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>have said, we do not find the elements of adjudication present in the phase drawn into inquiry here.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">If, then, there is any ban on communications between the agency\u2019s prosecutive and adjudicative arms relative to a motion to reopen, it clearly must exist by operation of something other than the Administrative Procedure Act. RSR also asserts that, even if the pre-reopening phase is deemed nonadjudicative, prior decisions of this court compel the finding of a denial of due process on the facts here. We deem this argument totally misplaced. True it is that, as we recently acknowledged, this court twice now <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> has gone \u201cbeyond the strict terms of the [Administrative Procedure Act] and the substantive agency statute to impose a ban on <em>ex parte </em>contacts ... [in holding] that off-the-record communications between members of the agency and interested outside parties violated the due process rights of parties not privy to the communications.\u201d <footnotemark>48</footnotemark> But, as we hastened to add, \u201cneither of these cases involves improper influence of staff on agency decisionmakers, nor does the reasoning of either case lead us to apply the ban on ex parte contacts to agency staff.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> It bears repeating that RSR makes no claim of any improper communication between the Commission and outsiders.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The judgment appealed from is <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-23\">. <em>RSR Corp. v.

Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 10:5 at 321-322 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b785-16\">. This court already has ruled consistently with Professor Davis\u2019 observation. We recently found cancellation and suspension proceedings under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act to be separate proceedings in the sense that decisions in the two are made under different standards. <em>EDF v. EPA, </em>167 U.S.App.D.C. 71, 84, 510 F.2d 1292, 1305 (1975). Thus we found no impropriety in ex parte communications from members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s enforcement staff \u2014 which then was involved in a continuing cancellation hearing \u2014 to the agency\u2019s administrator favoring issuance of a suspension notice to the same party. <em>Id. </em>at 84, 510 F.2d at 1305. \u201cThere is no allegation,\u201d we noted, \u201cof communication between \u2018prosecutor\u2019 and agency head regarding the final decision in either the cancellation proceeding or the suspension proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). See also <em>Alaska S.S. Co. v. FMC, </em>356 F.2d 59, 61 (9th Cir. 1966). The situation before us is a close parallel. When the challenged communication between staff and Commission occurred, the latter was not undertaking to alter its preexisting order in any wise; it was simply determining whether the record of the old proceeding should be reopened to present the occasion for such an undertaking, one way or the other. This was a judgment the Commission had to make, and one to which considerations of administrative policy and practicality would contribute heavily. This particular step involved no adjudication of the type that would bring the proscription against contacts between an agency and its staff into play.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b786-16\">.
