RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1223-12\">The defendant was convicted of a crime for which life imprisonment was mandatory. The term of a sentence, however, is not the only decision to be made in sentencing a person convicted of crime. Because the trial judge sentenced the defendant to a term of life imprisonment without, as Fed.R. Crim.P. 32 requires, either obtaining a pre-sentence report or finding that there was sufficient information in the record to enable the meaningful exercise of sentencing discretion, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-18\">After a three-day trial, a jury found James Long guilty of first degree murder committed on the Keesler Air Force Base, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111, but without capital punishment. Upon receiving the verdict, the district judge adjudged the defendant to be guilty and said: \u201cI will defer sentence to await receipt of a pre-sentence report . . . . \u201d After a colloquy about bond, the judge asked when he might expect a presentence report; the probation officer requested three weeks. The Assistant United States Attorney then advised the court that life imprisonment was mandatory and that, therefore, no presentence investigation was \u201cnecessary.\u201d The district judge then called upon Long for a statement before sentence was imposed, and, after giving Long an opportunity for allocution, sentenced him to life imprisonment. Long\u2019s conviction was affirmed by us, 608 F.2d 1372 (5th Cir. 1979) (mem.), and a writ of certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court, 445 U.S. 930, 100 S.Ct. 1319, 63 L.Ed.2d 763 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-19\">Long then filed a motion for correction of sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 because he had been sentenced by the judge acting without the presentence report required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c), and sought a reduction of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-20\">The life sentence that is mandatory for first degree murder may be coupled with a recommendation that the defendant shall be eligible for parole after serving some lesser term.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Busic, </em>592 F.2d 13, 25, 26-27 (2d Cir. 1978). Whether or not such a recommendation for possible future clemency should be made was critical to the defendant, for it might be decisive in requiring him to be actually confined for a minimum period of ten years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>or in determining whether he would be eligible for earlier parole. In addition, the sentencing judge may recommend the type of institution to which the defendant shall be confined and the location where he shall serve his sentence. <em>See, e. g., </em>Fed.R. Crim.P. app., form 25; <em>Greathouse v. United States, </em>548 F.2d 225, 227 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 838, 98 S.Ct. 130, 54 L.Ed.2d 100 (1977). Although not a part of the sentence, the decision of prison authorities <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on these matters is obviously of great importance to the person confined for they determine the ability of his family and friends to visit him and the physical environment in which he will serve his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">The information provided by the report of a trained probation officer, together with the evidence presented at the trial itself, give the sentencing judge the only reliable bases for exercise of his sentencing discretion. The sentencing decision, repeatedly referred to by trial judges as the most difficult they face,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> certainly cannot be based on the visage of the defendant, and should not be founded only on his apparent contrition or lack of remorse or on his lawyer\u2019s eloquence at allocution. . Therefore, if the judge imposes sentence without complying with rule 32, the sentence must be vacated; the probation service must make a presentence investigation and report to the judge; upon request, the defendant may be allowed to inspect it,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and then the judge must, after a new allocution,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> impose a new sentence. <em>United States v. Dinapoli, </em>519 F.2d 104, 107-08 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>see United States v. Chiantese, </em>582 F.2d 974, 981 &amp; n.17 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 922, 99 S.Ct. 2030, 60 L.Ed.2d 395 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">A presentence report is not required if the court finds \u201cthat there is in the record information sufficient to enable the meaningful exercise of the sentencing discretion, and the court explains this finding on the record.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1). The rule patently contemplates that this determination shall be made before sentence is imposed. <em>See United States v. Chi-antese, </em>582 F.2d at 981 &amp; n.17. In this case the court made no such finding; however, when the deficiency was pointed out by the defendant in his motion for correction and change of sentence, the Assistant United States Attorney suggested a remedy to the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-13\">Thank you, Your Honor. For the record, if I understood the Court, the Court is finding that there is in the record information sufficient to enable you to make the meaningful exercise of sentencing discretion that you did, and you\u2019ve explained that and it\u2019s now on the record, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-14\">The judge responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-15\">Well, I haven\u2019t seen the record since we tried that case, but you\u2019ve refreshed my memory and I remember we tried that case a couple of days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-16\">This response later was supplemented by a judgment stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-17\">The Court finds that no useful purpose would be served by preparing a presen-tence report to be used as an aid to the Court in imposing sentence. This Court conducted the murder trial of this defendant, heard the evidence presented and observed defendant during the course of the trial. The Court at the time of sentencing and now has sufficient information available to meaningfully impose a proper sentence; that based upon that information, regardless of what may be. produced by a presentence report, the Court would not designate an early parole eligibility as provided by 18 U.S.C. 4205(b) in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-18\">Although the defendant had been convicted of first degree murder, he was, according to the representations made by defense counsel, a first offender, and a veter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>an of the Vietnam War; and a' military service record and numerous affidavits submitted on the defendant\u2019s behalf attested to his good character. Although the judge said at the outset of the hearing that he had not read but would later read these documents, he made his decision on the bench the same day without looking at them. His lack of memory of the case tried eighteen months before is shown by the excerpts from the record set forth in the appendix; so, too, is his prejudgment that he could meaningfully exercise the discretion given to him and that a presentence investigation could be of no assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">Although rule 32 requires that the presentence report be made prior to sentencing and contemplates that the decision to waive the presentence report must be made before sentencing, there may be times when the judge\u2019s failure to state in advance the reasons for not ordering the report might be harmless error. <em>See United States v. Chiantese, </em>582 F.2d at 981 &amp; n.17. When, however, eighteen months have elapsed since the time the decision should have been made, the sentencing judge fails even to consult the impartial, trained probation officer whose very appointment is largely for the purpose of assisting him,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and decides without even referring to the documents that might incline an impartial judge to clemency, we cannot condone the failure to comply with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">Rule 32 denies any judge the discretion to reduce the hearing on sentence to a meaningless formality. \u201cIf this rule has any purposes, the supplying of facts and insights into both the background[s] and the potentialities (for good or evil) of young, felony first offenders must be among the most important.\u201d <em>United States v. Dinapoli, </em>519 F.2d at 108. As the <em>Dinapoli </em>court then further observed: \u201cThose who have studied the sentencing problem in depth are unanimous in recommending that presentence reports be secured in all felony cases, particularly those involving first offenders. NCCD Model Sentencing Act, Art. I, \u00a7 2 (1963); ALI Model Penal Code \u00a7 7.07(1) (Prelim. Official Draft 1962); ABA Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures \u00a7 4.1(b) (1968).\u201d <em>Id.; see United States v. Frazier, </em>479 F.2d 983, 986-87 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Manuella, </em>478 F.2d 440 (2d Cir. 1973). <em>But see United States v. Kane, </em>450 F.2d 77, 83 (5th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 934, 92 S.Ct. 954, 30 L.Ed.2d 810 (1972); <em>United States v. Teague, </em>445 F.2d 114, 121-22 (7th Cir. 1971); <em>Cassidy v. United States, </em>428 F.2d 585, 588 (8th Cir. 1970); <em>King v. United States, </em>410 F.2d 1127 (9th Cir. 1969) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-9\">Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment denying the motion to vacate the sentence and set the sentence aside. We remand for the ordering of a presentenee investigation and report, and resentencing of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">The trial judge who initially imposed the sentence has stated twice on the record that no presentence report could change his mind. He has foreclosed meaningful consideration of the report that he is required to receive and to weigh. He has demonstrated that he cannot make a decision in regard to this defendant with the impartiality required of all who sit in judgment. <em>See Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>403 U.S. 212, 216, 91 S.Ct. 1778, 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 423, 427 (1971) (per curiam) (\u201cTrial before \u2018an unbiased judge\u2019 is essential to due process.\u201d); <em>Brown v. Vance, </em>637 F.2d 272, 281 (5th Cir. 1981) (\u201c[D]ue process guarantee[s] <em>a </em>fair trial before an impartial judge . . . .\u201d); ABA Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2(A) (1972) (\u201cA judge should respect and comply with the law and should conduct himself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d); <em>id. </em>Canon 3 (1972) (\u201cA Judge Should Perform the Duties of His Office Impartially and Diligently\u201d). He has left himself no room for the exercise of that discretion given to him by Congress. <em>Cf. United States v. Denson, </em>603 F.2d 1143, 1148 (5th Cir. 1979) (en banc) (\u201cWhile the sentencing judge has great discretion in imposing a sentence, that latitude is permis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>sible only within the bounds set by statute.\u201d). Accordingly, without in any way impugning the integrity of the trial judge, we are constrained to order that the case on remand be allotted to another judge. <em>Calvaresi v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 961, 75 S.Ct. 522, 99 L.Ed. 749 (1955) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc., </em>497 F.2d 107, 109-10 (5th Cir. 1974);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>see </em>7th Cir. R. 18 (requiring that particular criminal cases be assigned to a new trial judge on remand); <em>cf. Phillips v. Joint Legislative Comm. on Performance &amp; Expenditure Review, </em>637 F.2d 1014, 1032 (5th Cir. 1981) (remanding case with specific instructions concerning hearing judge on remand, \u201cin light of later developments and all the circumstances presented\u201d). <em>See generally </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">Judgment REVERSED. The case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">MR. PEGRAM [counsel for defendant]: I have a memorandum prepared if Your Hon- or would like it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">THE COURT: Need all I can get.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-9\">MR. PEGRAM: Yes, sir. The reason I\u2019m down here is to request that the Court correct and reduce a sentence which was given to him at the end of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-10\">THE COURT: Who is that? What\u2019s that fellow\u2019s name?</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-11\">MR. PEGRAM: The person I\u2019m representing?</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-12\">THE COURT: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-13\">MR. PEGRAM: James Long.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-14\">THE COURT: James Long?</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-15\">MR. PEGRAM: Long, yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-17\">THE COURT: What was he tried for?</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-18\">MR. PEGRAM: He was tried for murder, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-19\">THE COURT: You think he ought to be given a chance to kill somebody else?</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-20\">MR. PEGRAM: No, sir. Mr. Long is not the type of individual who kills people intentionally. At the end of the trial Your Honor asked how long would be needed for a pre-trial investigation. At that time [Assistant U.S. Attorney] Dan Lynn, who was associated with the trial, stated that this would not be necessary because the sentence was mandatory life and that Your Honor had no discretion in the matter, and with that the Court dispensed with the pre-sentence investigation and did impose a mandatory life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-21\">Now under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure the Court has the discretion to review a sentence, and under Rule 32 of the same set of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure it specifically states in paragraph (c)(1) that the probation service of the court shall make a pre-sentence investigation and report to the court before imposition of a sentence unless \u2014 there are two exceptions \u2014 with the permission of the court the defendant waives such a pre-sen-tence investigation, or if the court finds there is in the record information sufficient enough to enable the meaningful exercise of the sentence without such an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-22\">In this case Your Honor had asked for one and as I stated declined under advice from the U.S. attorney\u2019s office. Now this matter came up in a case entitled <em>United States v. Busic, </em>B-U-S-I-C, 592 F.2d 13, 1978 case involving highjackers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-23\">THE COURT: Where do you live, Counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>MR. PEGRAM: I live in Oxford, Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">THE COURT: Oxford?</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">MR. PEGRAM: Yes. In that case the sentence was again mandatory life because of a death involving a highjacker. The district court judge in that case imposed that sentence but used his discretion to reduce the time under which parole might be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">THE COURT: Was this case tried before a jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">MR. PEGRAM: Yes, Your Honor, and the sentence was imposed. The circuit court\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-10\">THE COURT: It was tried where? See, I don\u2019t remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-11\">MR. PEGRAM: No, sir. This is a case \u2014 I didn\u2019t write down which circuit this was in. It\u2019s not in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-12\">THE COURT: I\u2019m talking about the case you\u2019re representing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-13\">MR. PEGRAM: Oh, excuse me, Your Honor. Yes, sir, it was tried before a jury and it was tried in Jackson, Mississippi, I believe. Is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-14\">MR. LYNN [Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Lynn]: No, sir. This is the Long case that was tried on the Gulf Coast.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-15\">MR. PEGRAM: Excuse me. Gulf Coast.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-16\">MR. LYNN: This is the case, Your Hon- or, where the ex-airman went on Keesler Air Force Base where they were playing poker and shot\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-17\">THE COURT: Oh, yes, I remember that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-18\">MR. LYNN: \u2014the guy who his wife was then dating. You remember the occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-19\">THE COURT: Sure do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-20\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-21\">THE COURT: Dan [Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Lynn], you got an apology to make?</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-22\">MR. LYNN: Well, Your Honor, I\u2019m certainly moved by Counsel\u2019s devotion to his friend. But I also remember how the evidence showed that this man was friends with Fred Currie.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-23\">THE COURT: Who is Fred Currie?</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-24\">MR. LYNN: The guy he shot and killed, Your Honor. The unfortunate incident that Counsel alludes to. Currie Fred Glen was the man\u2019s name he shot and killed.</p>\n<p id=\"AT5\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-25\">THE COURT: Well, you certainly make a very impressive appeal here. If I were a juror I would turn you loose. But I don\u2019t think that this is the place to try a criminal case, not in my hearing room over here in Jackson when we had this trial down in the Southern Division of the Southern District at Biloxi. A jury heard the same case I heard, and if I\u2019d been sitting on the jury, frankly, I would have joined in that same judgment because like Mr. Lynn reminded me, this fellow shot his victim across a little round table \u2014 I don\u2019t know enough about gambling to know what kind of table it was \u2014 but it was a round table, and I reckon that table must have had a diameter of twelve or fifteen feet, and the victim fell out of a chair, was knocked out of the chair and went to the floor, and he held his gun right close to this fellow\u2019s body \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what part of his body, but he certainly made sure that he had killed him. There is no doubt in the world about that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-26\">I don\u2019t think that we are called on to pass on such a momentous thing when the statute says he has ten years to serve a life sentence, and you\u2019re asking me to reduce it to eight years. I don\u2019t have the capacity to make that kind of decision. I seriously question the qualifications of Congress to reduce a life sentence to ten years. That\u2019s just arbitrary and capricious in and of itself. And for me to sit here and arbitrarily and capriciously reduce it to eight years, I just don\u2019t have that kind of ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-27\"># # # * * #</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-28\">THE COURT: Counsel is here in all earnestness and all sincerity representing a friend and he\u2019s trying to do everything in the world he possibly can to help his friend, but I just wonder if we had some of the dead man\u2019s people here what they would say about this, but we don\u2019t have a one in this room. We just hear one side of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-29\">Well, I heard both sides of it down at Biloxi and I\u2019ve just heard one side of it here. And I think that Congress has al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>ready given this man as much as he\u2019s entitled to, arbitrarily and capriciously, to say that a cold-blooded murderer shall serve only ten years. That\u2019s putting a pretty cheap score on a human life. To say that you can bodaciously'walk out and take your gun and shoot a fellow out of his chair and then when he gets on the floor, get closer to him and be absolutely sure you have killed him, and then ask for mercy, which he didn\u2019t accord his victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">I don\u2019t even know these people; have no idea who they were. I practiced at this bar for a long time before coming here, but as a civil lawyer. Didn\u2019t know anything about criminal law. But I know something about common, ordinary decency, and I don\u2019t do or say anything knowingly or intentionally to give anybody the impression that I have a real cheap appraisal of human life. These people were in a family feud of some kind. I don\u2019t know who was right or wrong. I never try to get at the bottom of stuff like that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">But I say this to you, Counsel: I don\u2019t think that the probation officer could put anything in a probationary report that would cause me to change my position or my attitude or my thinking or my feelings and conclusions about a case of this kind. You\u2019ve made a real impressive jury argument, but I\u2019m the sorriest juror that you ever looked at in your life. I believe you realize that. We didn\u2019t have a trial at Biloxi preliminarily. We had a sure enough trial. I don\u2019t have any idea how many witnesses Mr. Long had; don\u2019t know how many the government had. I payed no attention at all to that. Just try to give both of them a fair and impartial trial, and I think that Mr. Long got a fair and impartial trial under all the facts and under all the circumstances, regardless of his disappointment in the state court in another case. I don\u2019t think that enters into it at all. It didn\u2019t authorize him to do anything that he did on the day of this tragedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">So I realize that I could straddle the fence, but I\u2019m not a fence straddler. And I have no desire, in all sincerity, to request the probation department to make a report to me because I can\u2019t think of anything that they could put in their report which would have the slightest influence on me. Counsel here has had some very delightful and very moving experiences with Mr. Long, but we\u2019re not trying him on that score at all. That has nothing whatsoever to do with this except to try to move your emotions into the place of the law. And a jury in Biloxi, properly called, properly instructed, hearing all of the evidence, they said he was guilty as charged with first degree murder, and my recollection, we said without capital punishment. That was stated in the instructions, without capital punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-8\">So your motion, Counsel, with all deference to you, is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">MR. LYNN: Thank you, Your Honor. For the record, if I understand the Court, the Court is finding that there is in the record information sufficient to enable you to make the meaningful exercise of sentencing discretion that you did, and you\u2019ve explained that and it\u2019s now on the record, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-11\">THE COURT: Well, I haven\u2019t seen the record since we tried the case, of course, but you\u2019ve refreshed my memory and I remember we tried that case a couple of days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-12\">MR. LYNN: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-13\">THE COURT: Down at Biloxi. And I don\u2019t think anybody, not even eloquent counsel here, could make me change my mind about that, with all deference to you, Counsel. You can tell Mr. Long that you certainly did a masterful job, but, you know, I\u2019m just not easily moved when it comes down to a question of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s material and what\u2019s immaterial, because although I am never, have never been a criminal lawyer, that is a lawyer who handles criminal cases, to my experience, coming entirely from my experience on this federal bench. I think I handled one criminal case. I got into that in a wheel-deal, but I don\u2019t see any use in wishy-washying around and giving you some false hope by saddling onto the probation department the necessity for going forward with a probationary report which I don\u2019t require and I don\u2019t have any use for. I don\u2019t have any need for it. It wouldn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>help me the least bit in the world to see what I saw, and not what somebody told me I saw, but what I saw myself in the courtroom at Biloxi. Saw the whole tragedy enacted right before me, and saw Mr. Long. He handled himself real well in court, but he didn\u2019t convince me any more than he convinced the jury.
