Defendants petition in the alternative for a writ of mandamus ordering recusal of the trial judge. We hold that an interlocutory appeal does not lie from either of the rulings by the district court, and that defendants fail to show the exceptional circumstances necessary to support a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-29\">The appealability of the district court\u2019s denial of the two motions is governed by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291. That statute adopts a rule of finality, by which Congress has provided the courts of appeals with jurisdiction to review only \u201cfinal decisions of the district courts.\u201d <em>See generally Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978); <em>Catlin v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>324 U.S. 229, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">Consistent with the congressional intent expressed in section 1291, a firm judicial policy exists against interlocutory or \u201cpiecemeal\u201d appeals. As the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-5\">This rule, that a party must ordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal following final judgment on the merits, serves a number of important purposes. It emphasizes the deference that appellate courts owe to the trial judge as the individual initially called upon to decide the many questions of law and fact that occur in the course of a trial. Permitting piecemeal appeals would undermine the independence of the District Judge, as well as the special role that individual plays in our judicial system. In addition, the rule is in accordance with the sensible policy of \u201cavoidpng] the obstruction to just claims that would come from permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from the various rulings to which a litigation may give rise, from its initiation to entry of judgment.\u201d [citation omitted]. The rule also serves the important purpose of promoting efficient judicial administration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"anu-dedup-0\"><em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 374, 101 S.Ct. 669, 673, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981). <em>See also Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, </em>417 U.S. 156, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974); <em>DiBella v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 121, 82 S.Ct. 654, 7 L.Ed.2d 614 (1962). This rule of finality is particularly in force in criminal prosecutions because \u201cencouragement of delay is fatal to the vindication of the criminal law.\u201d <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>435 U.S. 850, 854, 98 S.Ct. 1547, 1549, 56 L.Ed.2d 18 (1978) (quoting <em>Cobbledick v. United States, </em>309 U.S. 323, 325, 60 S.Ct. 540, 541, 84 L.Ed. 783 (1940)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">The Supreme Court, however, has recognized a narrow exception to the rule of finality, which it first articulated in the oft-cited case of <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The <em>Cohen </em>exception was designed to permit the immediate appeal of collateral matters that could not be reviewed effectively on appeal from the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-8\">The Court has held a pretrial order denying a motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds is appealable within the <em>Cohen </em>collateral-order exception. <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977). It reasoned the right against double jeopardy was not only to be free from subsequent <em>convictions </em>but also from successive <em>prosecutions, </em>and this right would be irreparably lost if the appeal from the order denying the claim awaited final judgment. The Court, however, expressly held its ruling did not extend to other claims presented in a motion to dismiss an indictment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-9\">In determining that the courts of appeals may exercise jurisdiction over an appeal from a pretrial order denying a motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds, we, of course, do not hold that other claims contained in the motion to dismiss are immediately appealable as well. Our conclusion that a defendant may seek immediate appellate review of a district court\u2019s rejection of his double jeopardy claim is based on the special considerations permeating claims of that nature which justify a departure from the normal rule of finality. Quite obviously, such considerations do not extend beyond the claim of former jeopardy and encompass other claims presented to, and rejected by, the district court in passing on the accused\u2019s motion to dismiss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_I\">431 U.S. at 662-63, 97 S.Ct. at 2042 (citation omitted). To be appealable, then, the denial must infringe upon a right which, because of its unique nature, can only be protected by immediate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-10\">The Supreme Court has considered the issue of immediate review in two later criminal cases. In <em>Helstoski v. Meanor, </em>442 U.S. 500, 99 S.Ct. 2445, 61 L.Ed.2d 30 (1979), the Court held a Congressman was entitled to an interlocutory appeal of the refusal to dismiss an indictment on the ground it violated the Speech or Debate Clause, because that clause protected the right to be free from litigation arising out of conduct on the floor of Congress. In <em>United States v. Mac</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number><em>Donald, </em>435 U.S. 850, 98 S.Ct. 1547, 56 L.Ed.2d 18 (1978), on the other hand, the Court held that where the motion to dismiss the indictment rests on a speedy trial claim, there is no right to an immediate appeal. The Court reasoned that unlike the double jeopardy claim in <em>Abney, </em>the speedy trial claim was not a right \u201cthe legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 860, 98 S.Ct. at 1552.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">With these Supreme Court principles in mind, we turn to the particular claims presented in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">1. <em>Motion to Dismiss the Indictment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">Defendants, G. W. Atkinson, Robert Spurlock, E. A. Gregory and his wife, Von-na Jo, were indicted in May 1980 by a federal grand jury for conspiracy, wire fraud and willful misapplication of bank funds. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 656, 1343. The charges arose out of the 1978 financial collapse of the Wilcox County Bank of Camden, Alabama, of which defendants were officers and directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">In a motion to dismiss the indictment, defendants claimed \u201cprosecutorial vindictiveness,\u201d indicated by comments the prosecutor allegedly made to them to the effect he was \u201cafter\u201d them, by the continuing efforts of agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to obtain state and federal indictments against them, and by various pretrial legal maneuvers taken by the prosecutor. The district court denied their motion to dismiss without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-9\">Defendants\u2019 claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness does not seek to protect a right the special nature of which presents a compelling need for immediate review, and therefore does not fall within the <em>Cohen </em>exception. Defendants fail to establish how \u201cthe legal and practical value\u201d of their rights would be destroyed if their challenge to the denial of the motion must await final appeal. Such claims can be and are often heard on appeal from a conviction. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Hanna, </em>639 F.2d 192 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>617 F.2d 436 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 841, 101 S.Ct. 120, 66 L.Ed.2d 48 (1980); <em>United States v. Lichenstein, </em>610 F.2d 1272 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 907, 100 S.Ct. 2991, 64 L.Ed.2d 856 (1980); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>577 F.2d 1304 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>523 F.2d 771 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 59, 50 L.Ed.2d 76 (1976). <em>Cf. United States v. Wright, </em>622 F.2d 792 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 961, 101 S.Ct. 376, 66 L.Ed.2d 229 (1980) (none of defendant\u2019s specific claims of prosecutorial misconduct fall within the <em>Cohen </em>exception because they may be cured at retrial or effectively reviewed on appeal). Moreover, to the extent defendants focus their objection on the court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on their claims, there is even less basis for appellate intrusion at this point. It is well established a district court has discretion to deny a hearing where defendants present mere conclusory allegations of prosecutorial vindictiveness. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Duncan, </em>598 F.2d 839, 869 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 871, 100 S.Ct. 148, 62 L.Ed.2d 96 (1979); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>591 F.2d 307, 311-12 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 913, 99 S.Ct. 2831, 61 L.Ed.2d 280 (1979); <em>United States v. Bourque, </em>541 F.2d 290, 292-93 (1st Cir. 1976). <em>Cf. In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>632 F.2d 1033, 1038\u201440 (3d Cir. 1980) (district court order denying evidentiary hearing on unauthorized grand jury disclosures is not immediately appealable).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-15\">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia recently considered the identical issue of appealability in <em>United States v. Brizendine, </em>659 F.2d 215 (D.C.Cir.1981). In that case defendants, who were corporate officers, moved for the dismissal of their indictments on the ground of prosecutorial vindictiveness. They alleged the prosecutor improperly sought the indictments in retaliation for their rejection of a plea bargaining arrangement for the corporation, which was also indicted. After a lengthy analysis, the court of appeals concluded the denial of the motions to dismiss was not immediately appealable. The court held that in light of the availability of effective relief upon appeal from a conviction, it was not prepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>to accept the \u201cdisruptive consequences\u201d to the criminal justice system that would result from interlocutory appeals on the ground of prosecutorial vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">The Ninth Circuit reached an opposite result in <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>617 F.2d 1342 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 863, 101 S.Ct. 167, 66 L.Ed.2d 80 (1980). In discussing the irreparable loss to defendants if appellate review had to await the outcome of the trial, the court emphasized the \u201cpersonal strain, public embarrassment, and expense\u201d that inevitably results from a trial. <em>Id. </em>at 1346. We agree with the District of Columbia Circuit, however, that such reasoning is faulty because it could apply to virtually every pretrial claim which, if successful, would result in the dismissal of the indictment. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>MacDonald, supra, </em>in rejecting this argument with respect to a speedy trial claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af3\">Admittedly, there is value \u2014 to all but the most unusual litigant \u2014 in triumphing before trial, rather than after it, regardless of the substance of the winning claim. But this truism is not to be confused with the quite distinct proposition that [only] certain claims . . . should be resolved before trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">435 U.S. at 860 n.7, 98 S.Ct. at 1552 n.7. In view of the substantial policy in avoiding delay in criminal prosecutions and the availability of an effective review upon appeal from a final judgment, we decline to adopt a rule which would permit as a matter of course immediate appeals from the denial of prosecutorial vindictiveness claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">There may be vindictiveness claims, of .course, which by their very nature would be destroyed if an appeal was delayed. An example would be if defendants presented substantial evidence that the prosecutor intended to try them for reasons unrelated to the enforcement of the laws and for the sole purpose of having them go through the psychological and financial burdens of trial, without any reasonable prospect of conviction. In this situation, the malicious purpose would be accomplished regardless of the outcome of the trial, and could not be rectified by any future appeal. In the present case, however, defendants\u2019 allegations, if true, establish only that the Government has been aggressively pursuing its case against them for the purpose of seeking convictions. There is no indication the Government\u2019s claims are groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-8\">We conclude an interlocutory appeal does not lie from the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground of prosecutorial vindictiveness. We therefore dismiss the appeal without expressing an opinion on the merits of defendants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-9\">2. <em>Motion for Disqualification and Writ of Mandamus</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-10\">The second question, whether an interlocutory appeal lies from the denial of a motion to disqualify the trial judge, has already been answered in the negative in a prior panel decision of this Court, by which we of course are bound. <em>In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation, </em>614 F.2d 958 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, Mead Corporation </em>v. <em>Adams Extract, </em>449 U.S. 888, 101 S.Ct. 244, 69 L.Ed.2d 114 (1980). This type of claim was considered to be fully reviewable on appeal from a final judgment. <em>Accord, United States v. Washington, </em>573 F.2d 1121 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Vuono v. United States, </em>441 F.2d 271 (4th Cir. 1971); <em>Robinson v. Largent, </em>419 F.2d 1327 (3d Cir. 1970); <em>Dubnoff v. Goldstein, </em>385 F.2d 717 (2d Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-11\"> The question of disqualification is reviewable on mandamus, however, although a writ will not lie in the absence of \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Corrugated Container, </em>614 F.2d at 961 n.4. The parties seeking the writ must carry the burden of proving a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to it, and its issuance remains within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 962. <em>See also Kerr v. United States District Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 2124, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>In re International Business Machines Corp., </em>618 F.2d 923, 926 (2d Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-12\">Anticipating our decision on appealability, defendants have petitioned in the alternative for a writ of mandamus ordering the trial judge\u2019s recusal. In support of their claim of personal bias, defendants first note a comment made by the judge when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>agreed to defense counsel\u2019s request to furnish a copy of the financial disclosure statement he prepared pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act. After handing the statement over to counsel, the judge remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s going to give you a world of information about my background and I hope you choke on it.\u201d Defendants next offer a statement made by the judge in one of six earlier civil suits brought by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation against the Gregorys in connection with certain loan transactions. The judge had presided over all six suits. In one of his opinions, the judge characterized the loan involved as \u201cvirtually a self-dealing transaction.\u201d Defendants contend this statement was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and prejudices the judge with respect to the factual issues in the present case. Defendants finally direct our attention to two temporary \u201cgag orders\u201d which restricted defendants\u2019 access to the media and to discovery materials. They contend these orders were made in \u201cblatant disregard\u201d of statutory and constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">In his opinion denying the motion to disqualify, the trial judge explained his \u201cchoke on it\u201d comment was due to a strong dislike for disclosing his personal finances as well as part of the interplay between judge and counsel which normally accompanies lengthy trial proceedings. He concluded that while the comment was \u201csharp,\u201d it was not as \u201cinsidious\u201d as defendants alleged and ' did not reflect on his impartiality. With respect to defendants\u2019 other contentions, the judge held they also were not indicative of any bias or hostility towards defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">The general rule is that bias sufficient to disqualify a judge must stem from personal, extrajudicial sources, although there is an exception where pervasive bias and prejudice is shown by otherwise judicial conduct. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Serrano, </em>607 F.2d 1145, 1150-51 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 965, 100 S.Ct. 1655, 64 L.Ed.2d 241 (1980); <em>Whitehurst v. Wright, </em>592 F.2d 834, 838 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Davis v. Board of School Commissioners, </em>517 F.2d 1044, 1051 (5th Cir. 1975). Upon review of the record in this case, it does not appear a basis for disqualification has been established. The judge\u2019s comment with respect to the financial disclosure statement, while perhaps intemperate, does not reflect personal bias towards defendants, particularly in light of the judge\u2019s explanation. The remaining conduct complained of took place within a judicial context and, in the absence of a showing of pervasive bias, cannot serve as the basis for disqualification. <em>See, e. g., Phillips v. Joint Legislative Committee, </em>637 F.2d 1014, 1020 (5th Cir. 1981) (\u201ca motion for disqualification ordinarily may not be predicated on the judge\u2019s rulings in the instant case or in related cases\u201d). No showing of pervasive bias has been made. The trial judge acted within his discretion in refusing to disqualify himself, <em>see, e. g., Phillips, supra, </em>637 F.2d at 1021, and the petition for a writ of mandamus is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">No. 80-7644 \u2014 APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">No. 80-7642 \u2014 APPEAL DISMISSED AND WRIT OF MANDAMUS DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
