Cone Memorial Hospital (hereafter Hospital),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under a construction contract between Mercury and the Hospital. Federal jurisdiction was properly premised on diversity. The district court denied arbitration, pending disposition of a state action by the Hospital against Mercury and J.N. Pease Associates, (hereafter Architect),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for declaratory judgment denying arbitration. Mercury seeks relief both by way of a petition for mandamus and by appeal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">A summary of the facts leading up to the two actions is necessary to an understanding of the issues. In stating these facts, we have followed the allegations of the parties in their respective pleadings or presentations to the Court. On July 15, 1975, Mercury and the Hospital entered into a construction contract for Hospital additions. The agreed contract price was several million dollars. The contract, concededly drafted by the attorneys, or agents for the Hospital, includes a very broad arbitration clause covering \u201c[a]ll claims, disputes and other matters in question arising out of, or relating to, this Contract or the breach thereof,\u201d subject to the requirement that any such claim shall first be submitted to the \u201cArchitect,\u201d as defined in the contract, and that no demand for arbitration shall be made \u201cuntil the earlier\u201d of the Architect\u2019s written decision on the claim or \u201cthe tenth day after the parties have presented their evidence to the Architect or have been given a reasonable opportunity to do so, if the Architect has not rendered his written decision by that date.\u201d The time for filing any claim is declared to be \u201cwithin a reasonable time after the claim, dispute or other matter in question has arisen, and in no event shall be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claim, dispute or other matter in question would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">The Architect for the project is designated and identified in the contract. He was selected by the Hospital and was declared in the contract to be \u201cthe Owner\u2019s representative during construction and until final payment,\u201d to whom, as the \u201cinterpreter of the contract\u201d \u201c[a]ll papers required to be delivered to the Owner\u201d should be delivered, to whom \u201c[a]ny notice to or demand upon the Owner [should] be . . . given,\u201d and to whom any \u201c[c]laims, disputes and other matters in question [should] be referred initially . .. for decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-16\">Construction under the contract began in July, 1975 and was to be completed within 1200 consecutive calendar days (or approximately 40 months). Because of change orders and other problems work time extension of 334 days was agreed upon. This meant that the contract time for completion was fixed at October 14, 1979. In October, 1977, as work under the contract was pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>ceeding, Mercury asserts in an affidavit of its Senior Construction Manager, not contested in the record by the Hospital, that \u201cat a meeting with the Architect and the Owner, Mercury was requested to hold its claim for delay and impact costs until after the work was completed. Mercury agreed to do this.\u201d There was substantial completion of the project on February 12,1979 and final inspections were had on June 12,1979. Various \u201cpunch list items,\u201d however, continued to be worked on thereafter. The record does not indicate when these \u201cpunch list items\u201d were finally completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">At any rate, in January, 1980, Mercury submitted to the Architect its claim for additional payment on account of \u201cdelays and impact inefficiencies,\u201d etc., which Mercury contends under the agreement of October, 1977 with the Architect, was to be submitted only after the work had been completed. According to the Hospital\u2019s claims, the Architect reviewed this claim with Mercury over a period of several months and apparently succeeded in inducing Mercury to reduce its claim substantially. The Hospital claims it was completely ignorant of all this, however, until April 17, 1980, at which time, according to its allegations, its Architect \u201cfurnished to Cone Hospital various written materials by way of information, including a copy of a narrative statement of the Mercury claims.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the Hospital avers that its counsel took over the discussions of the claims with Mercury in May, 1980. Hospital\u2019s counsel stated to Mercury\u2019s representative, according to Mercury\u2019s affidavits, that the businessmen who ran the Hospital \u201cwould need additional information regarding the claim before undertaking negotiations in earnest.\u201d In order to provide this information, a meeting was held in Birmingham, Alabama, on August 12, 1980. Present were counsel for the Hospital, one of its trustees, representatives of the Architect, and representatives of Mercury, including its counsel. At that conference, Mercury went over its claim in detail with the parties and offered the Hospital access to its files. The Hospital asked that copies of the files be mailed to its expert who had been employed to assist it in assessing the claim but who was unable to attend that meeting because of a schedule conflict. It was further agreed at this meeting that, provided the Hospital\u2019s expert had completed his review of the claims, another meeting on the claim would be held on October 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">On October 6, Mercury\u2019s counsel telephoned the Hospital\u2019s counsel to inquire whether the Hospital\u2019s expert had completed his review of the claims and thus would be prepared to meet as tentatively agreed on October 13. The Hospital\u2019s counsel advised Mercury\u2019s counsel that he would advise Mercury\u2019s counsel on October 7 if the meeting date would be satisfactory. On the afternoon of October 7, Hospital counsel advised Mercury\u2019s counsel by telephone that the Hospital intended to offer no money to settle Mercury\u2019s claim and was filing immediately in state court a complaint for a declaratory judgment \u201cthat it did not have to arbitrate and that it owed Mercury nothing (but that if it did owe Mercury money, the Architect in turn owed that money to the Hospital).\u201d Mercury\u2019s counsel advised Mercury of this conversation and Mercury instructed its counsel to file an arbitration demand. Counsel mailed such demand on the morning of October 9, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">The Hospital did file its action in the state court on the morning of October 8, 1980, naming as defendants Mercury and the Hospital\u2019s Architect. Service of the action was made on Mercury on October 9, 1980. In its complaint, the Hospital alleges essentially, so far as Mercury is concerned, that there is no \u201cfactual or legal basis\u201d for Mercury\u2019s claim and that such claim is barred \u201cby the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d It also alleges that \u201cMercury has not demanded arbitration and has no right under the contract to have these claims or disputes submitted to arbitration,\u201d adding that Mercury has lost its right to arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>tion by \u201cfailure to make timely demand for arbitration\u201d and has \u201cwaived its right to arbitrate and is barred from submitting these claims to arbitration by laches and estoppel,\u201d all resulting \u201cin substantial prejudice to Cone Hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">In its charges against the Architect as defendant in its state court action, the Hospital asserted various delinquencies in the performance of its duties, including premature acceptance of parts of the structure before such parts were properly usable and delays in making decisions and in \u201cpreparing and forwarding requests for proposals, revised drawings, instructions and other information to the contractor.\u201d With particular reference to the claim of Mercury, the Hospital charged in its complaint that the Architect had been negligent in connection therewith in not \u201crequiring disposition of claims and disputes during the course of the work as required by the contract provisions,\u201d by procrastinating and failing \u201cto rule on matters in dispute during the course of the work; by failing adequately to represent the interests of Cone Hospital; by not advising Cone Hospital promptly of the claims being asserted by Mercury; by breaching the fiduciary duty which Pease [the Architect] owed to Cone Hospital; and by other ways not specifically set forth hereinabove.\u201d Significantly, there is no charge of any conspiracy, or illegal combination on the part of Mercury and the Architect. By way of relief it sought judgment \u201cthat there is no right to arbitration, and that arbitration be stayed; .. ., that there is no liability on the part of Cone Hospital to Mercury . . .; \u201d and \u201cthat should it be determined that any amount [if there is any] as owed by Cone Hospital to Mercury, that it be determined and declared that Cone Hospital is entitled to be fully indemnified and reimbursed. .. . \u201d It demanded a jury trial on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">After filing its complaint, the Hospital secured on October 15, 1980, <em>ex parte, </em>without any notice to Mercury, an injunction from the state court barring Mercury \u201cfrom taking any action or actions directed toward arbitration of disputes between The Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital and Mercury Construction Corporation until the trial provided for by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 l-567.3(b) has occurred, and until the Superior Court has issued its Order as contemplated by this statute; . . . . \u201d Mercury objected to this stay and, by order dated October 27, 1980, the stay was dissolved. In the meantime Mercury had filed this action, alleging diversity between the plaintiff and the defendant, and seeking relief by way of an order of arbitration and stay of judicial proceedings pending such arbitration pursuant to the terms of the United States Arbitration Act. Mercury, also, petitioned for the removal of the state action filed by the Hospital to the federal court. Following removal of that state action, the Hospital moved for the remand of its action to the state court and for a stay of the federal action begun by Mercury pending resolution of the state court action. The district court granted remand, finding that the action between Mercury and the Hospital \u201cwas not separate and independent from the claim or cause of action against Pease [the Architect],\u201d and that there was accordingly not diversity between the parties. It, also, stayed the action before it \u201cpending resolution of <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp. and J. N. Pease Associates, </em>80 CvS. 6787, in the North Carolina General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division (Greensboro).\u201d In reaching this decision, it said that the state action \u201cinvolve[d] the identical issue of arbitrability of the claims of Mercury Construction Corp. against the Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital which is involved in this action.\u201d In finding a stay appropriate in such a situation, the district court cited and relied on <em>E. C. Ernst, Inc. v. Potlatch Corp., </em>462 F.Supp. 694, 699-701 (S.D.N.Y.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">Mercury has sought review of that decision of the district court to stay the federal action by both mandamus and by direct appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1292(a). It seems agreed, however, that under the prevailing rule in this Circuit, Mercury was entitled to a direct appeal from the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>court decision and we shall review the decision below as an appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The real issue in this case, determinative of this appeal, is the right of the plaintiff to an order of arbitration by the district court of its dispute with the Hospital pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, and whether that right, if it exists, may be frustrated by the \u201creactive\u201d filing of a state declaratory action by the Hospital asserting the non-ar-bitrability of the dispute before Mercury had any real opportunity to seek arbitration. The resolution of this issue involves primarily the construction and application of the Federal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\"> By its express language the Federal Act applies where there is \u201c[a] written provision in ... a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract . .. . \u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The constitutional validity of such an Act is found in the incontestable federal control over interstate commerce. <em>Prima Paint v. Flood &amp; Conklin, </em>388 U.S. 395, 405, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 1806, 18 L.Ed.2d 127 (1967). The determination whether the contract is one \u201c \u2018evidencing a transaction invoking [interstate] commerce,\u2019 \u201d is a question on which \u201cfederal rules of contract construction and interpretation govern.\u201d <em>Janmort Leas., Inc. v. Econo-Car Intern., </em>475 F.Supp. 1282, 1286 (E.D.N.Y.1979). The Act, however, does not include language conferring independent federal jurisdiction over an action thereunder. In order for a plaintiff to assert rights under it in a federal forum, he must establish an independent jurisdictional basis, such as diversity. <em>Kallen v. Dist. 1199, Nat. U. of Hospital &amp; Health, </em>574 F.2d 723, 726 n. 6 (2d Cir. 1978); <em>Robert Lawrence Co. </em>v. <em>Devonshire Fabrics, Inc., </em>271 F.2d 402, 408 (2d Cir. 1959), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>364 U.S. 801, 81 S.Ct. 27, 5 L.Ed.2d 37; <em>Paul Allison, Inc. v. Minikin Storage of Omaha, </em>452 F.Supp. 573, 574 (D.Neb.1978); Warren <em>Bros. Co. v. Community Bldg. of Atl., Inc., </em>386 F.Supp. 656, 663 (M.D.N.C. 1974); <em>Litton RCS, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, </em>376 F.Supp. 579, 585 (with citation of all the authorities) (E.D. Pa.1974), <em>aff\u2019d., </em>3 Cir., 511 F.2d 1394. But if, assuming diversity of the parties, an action meets the jurisdictional requirements of the Act, that action is enforceable in the state courts as well as in federal courts but <em>in either event it is governed by the federal substantive law developed in connection with the federal Act and not by state law. E.C. Ernst, Inc. v. Manhattan Const. Co., </em>551 F.2d 1026, 1040 (5th Cir. 1977) (any questions under the Act are matters of \u201cfederal law\u201d); <em>Robert Lawrence Co. v. Devonshire Fabrics, Inc., supra, </em>271 F.2d at 406; <em>Pathman Const. Co. v. Knox County Hospital Ass\u2019n., </em>164 Ind.App. 121, 326 N.E.2d 844, 851 (1975); <em>Episcopal Housing Corp. v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>269 S.C. 631, 636, 239 S.E.2d 647 (1977).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">In determining these principles of \u201csubstantive federal law,\u201d which govern the application of the Federal Act, the courts have begun by looking first at the purposes of the Act itself. As declared in <em>Prima, </em>388 U.S. at 403-04, 87 S.Ct. at 1805-66, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>purpose of the Act was explicitly declared to be to provide an \u201carbitration procedure, when selected by the parties to a contract, [that would] be speedy and not subject to delay and obstruction ... . \u201d And the \u201cfederal substantive law\u201d which has been developed to accomplish this purpose has been found in the specific language in the Act itself or has been deduced in judicial decisions from the purposes and language of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Section 4 of the Act, after establishing the specific issue to be resolved in an action under the Act, directs the court to order arbitration once it is \u201csatisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue,\u201d and Section 3 requires a stay of all proceedings \u201cuntil such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">It is obvious from these statutes that in a case such as this, there are but two facts which a plaintiff seeking arbitration must establish: (1) The making of the agreement and (2) the breach of the agreement to arbitrate. This was recognized by the district court which decided this case. In <em>C. P. Robinson Const. Co. v. National Corp. for Hous. Part., </em>375 F.Supp. at 446, 451, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-7\">\u201cThe district court [in an action under the Arbitration Act] must hear the parties and on being satisfied that (1) the making of the agreement for arbitration is not in issue and (2) the failure to comply with the agreement is not in issue, the court must order the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">Section 3, it is true, would deny the right to a stay of proceedings in favor of arbitration if it can be said that the applicant for the stay is \u201cin default in proceeding with such arbitration.\u201d It is often likened to waiver or laches or estoppel, but these terms are used not in their traditional sense but are to be given a definition and application in line with the statutory purposes and preferences reflected in the Act. But \u201cdefault\u201d in this sense is not to be lightly inferred in view of the statutory favor for arbitration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, mere \u201cdelay in making an arbitration demand is not a default within the meaning of Section 3.\u201d <em>Halcon International, Inc. v. Monsanto Australia, Ltd., </em>446 F.2d 156, 161 (7th Cir. 1971);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it is only when this delay results in actual prejudice that it may amount to \u201cdefault\u201d within the Act. <em>Batson Y. &amp; F.M. Gr., Inc. v. Saurer-Allma, etc., </em>311 F.Supp. 68, 72 (D.S.C. 1970). These are two situations and only two situations in which such prejudice, under the federal decisions, may rise to the level of \u201cdefault\u201d <em>under the Act </em>and these situations are generally described under the general classification of \u201cwaiver.\u201d These two types of \u201cwaiver\u201d are correctly identified in <em>N&amp;D Fashions, Inc. v. DHJ Industries, Inc., </em>548 F.2d 722, 728 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">The first type of waiver identified in <em>N&amp;D Fashions </em>and qualifying as a \u201cdefault\u201d occurs \u201cwhen a party \u2018actively participates in a lawsuit or takes other action inconsistent with\u2019 the right to arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728. In <em>Chatham Shipping Co. v. Fertex Steamship Corp., </em>352 F.2d 291, 293 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>(2d Cir. 1965), Judge Friendly stated that \u201cthe earliest point at which such preclusion [i. e., waiver as used in this sense] may be found [in an arbitration case] is when the other party files an answer on the merits.\u201d This does not mean, though, that the filing of such an answer will always amount to a waiver. In <em>Carolina Throwing Co. v. S &amp; E Novelty Corp., </em>442 F.2d 329, 330 (4th Cir. 1971), we said that \u201ca default [within the Act] does not automatically result from a delay or from the filing of responsive pleadings.\u201d And it is clear that the removal of a state action is not to be deemed a \u201cdefault\u201d or \u201cwaiver\u201d in this sense. <em>Garner Lumber Co. v. Randolph E. Valensi, Lange, Inc., </em>393 F.Supp. 161, 162 (W.D.N.C.1974), <em>aff\u2019d., </em>513 F.2d 1171 (4 Cir. 1975). It is only the \u201c[substantially invoking the litigation machinery [which will] qualif[y] as the kind of prejudice . . . that is the essence of waiver\u201d in this context. <em>E. C. Ernst, Inc. v. Manhattan Const. Co., </em>559 F.2d 268, 269 (5th Cir. 1977). And whether there is \u201cdefault\u201d or \u201cwaiver\u201d in this sense is a question solely for the court itself to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">The second type of \u201cdefault\u201d or \u201cwaiver\u201d identified in <em>N&amp;D Fashions, supra, </em>\u201capplies to bar arbitration when the process would be inequitable to one party because relevant evidence has been lost due to the delay of the other.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This type of \u201cwaiver\u201d which may bar arbitration was earlier described in <em>Trafalgar Shipping Co. v. International Milling Co., </em>401 F.2d 568, 571 (2d Cir. 1968) thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-5\">\u201cThe purpose of laches is simply to relieve a decision-making body of the duty to resolve, and to prevent one party from having to prove, issues as to which the relevant evidence has been lost due to the delay of the other party. The only issues which the court is authorized to consider on a motion to compel arbitration are ones which pertain to \u2018the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or refusal to perform the same,\u2019 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4; <em>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin, </em>supra, 388 U.S. at 403-404, 87 S.Ct. 1801 [at 1805-1806]. If one of these issues is disputed before the court, and if one party claims that its ability to present proof in relation thereto has been prejudiced through the delay of the other, the court may consider whether it is fair to permit the dilatory party even to invoke its processes under the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">But \u201cwaiver\u201d or \u201cestoppel\u201d in this sense as constituting \u201cdefault\u201d under the Act presents a question to be resolved by the arbitrator and not by the court. <em>Halcon International, Inc. v. Monsanto Australia Ltd., supra, </em>446 F.2d at 160-163 (\u201c. . . laches is to be determined by the arbitrators\u201d); <em>N&amp;D Fashions, supra, </em>548 F.2d at 728; <em>Janmort Leas., Inc. v. Econo-Car Intern., supra, </em>475 F.Supp. at 1290. As the Court in <em>Trafalgar </em>stated (401 F.2d at 572):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-10\">\u201claches is not a technical legal issue which only a judge is competent to decide. Rather in the often esoteric field of commercial dealings, and in admiralty, it would seem that the severity of prejudice suffered through delay, and the reasonableness of excuses offered by the dilatory party, the elements of laches, might be resolved better where resort is had to the expertise of the arbitrators.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">Apart from \u201claches,\u201d there are two other grounds which are occasionally asserted as barring arbitration but which the federal courts have consistently ruled, as a matter of \u201cfederal law,\u201d are not valid bars to arbitration. One of these grounds concerns the situation where a non-arbitrable claim is joined in the action with an arbitrable claim. The courts have uniformly held that the arbitrability of the arbitrable claim is not to be defeated or delayed because it is joined in the litigation with other issues not subject to arbitration. This principle is illustrated in <em>Janmort Leas., supra, </em>475 F.Supp. at 1290, where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>\u201cThat a controversy involves some claims which are not subject to arbitration will not preclude a court from directing arbitration of those claims which are.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Perhaps more analogous to the case under review here is <em>Acevedo Maldonado v. PPG Industries, Inc., </em>514 F.2d 614, 616-17 (1st Cir. 1975). In this case the plaintiff sued the operator of a chlorine plant in negligence for injuries suffered from gas escaping from the chlorine plant. The operator of the plant filed a third-party complaint against the designer of and contractor constructing the plant seeking \u201cthe right of contribution from a joint tort-feasor, proportionate to its negligence in designing and building the plant, for damages that might be awarded against third-party plaintiffs.\u201d The third-party defendants (i. e., the designer and builder) \u201cmoved for a stay . . . pending arbitration.\u201d The district court denied the motion and the third-party defendants appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed, ordering arbitration of the arbitrable issue. <em>See also to the same effect, Sam Reisfeld &amp; Son Import Co. v. S. A.

Potlatch Corp., </em>462 F.Supp. 694, 699-701 (S.D.N.Y. 1978). In commenting on the cases from the Southern District of New York on this point, the Court in <em>Commonwealth Edison </em>said (400 F.Supp. at 890):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-11\">\u201cThose courts would not allow one party to circumvent an arbitration clause through the utilization of state court litigation and neither will I; to do so defeats the basic purposes of arbitration itself.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">Particularly may not the parties burden the arbitration process under the Federal Act \u201cby adopting state law which shifts the determination of disputes from arbitrators to courts. To allow [that] . . . would undermine the provisions of the Federal Act.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">Measured by the above settled canons for the application of the Federal Arbitration Act, this case plainly qualified for relief under Section 4. Concededly, there was an independent basis for federal jurisdiction (/. e., diversity). Under standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>established by the very district court in which the action was filed, as well as by all other federal and state courts (with a single exception to be noted later) which have considered the issue, the relevant contract clearly involved interstate commerce. <em>C. P. Robinson Cons. Co. v. National Corp. for Hous. Part., supra, </em>375 F.Supp. at 451; Warren <em>Bros. Co. v. Community Building, supra, </em>386 F.Supp. at 664; <em>J. S. &amp; H. Construction Co. v. Richmond County Hosp. Auth., </em>473 F.2d 212, 214 n. 6 (5th Cir. 1973). There is no question of the existence of a written contract which included a broad and comprehensive provision for arbitration of any dispute arising out of the performance of the contract. Nor can the Hospital contest the fact that it has refused to arbitrate the dispute with Mercury over a matter clearly within the arbitration clause of the contract. In these circumstances, the right of Mercury to a stay of proceedings and an order of arbitration under Section 4 is beyond dispute. And the district court, in a similar case, has, as we have seen, recognized this right. <em>C. P. Robinson Cons. Co. v. National Corp. for Hous. Part., supra, </em>375 F.Supp. 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Actually as we understand its position, the Hospital does not contest the right normally of Mercury to an order to proceed with arbitration \u201cin accordance with\u201d the principle stated in <em>C. P. Robinson Construction. </em>Its basic contention is simply that because it has filed a state action for declaratory judgment that Mercury is not entitled to arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act, the federal court is obligated to stand aside in favor of the state action. This position was adopted by the district court as the basis for its decision. Before reaching the propriety of that ruling, it is important to note the theories on which the Hospital predicates its state claim of non-arbitrability as set forth in its state complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">First, the Hospital asserts that the contract in this case does not involve interstate commerce and is thus not within the coverage of the Federal Arbitration Act. It has admittedly North Carolina authority to support this view. <em>Burke Cty. Pub. Sch. Bd. of Ed. v. Shaver Partner., </em>265 S.E.2d 481, 483 (N.C.App. 1980); <em>Bryant-Durham Elec. v. Durham County Hospital, </em>256 S.E.2d 529, 532, 42 N.C.App. 351 (1979). However, the district courts of North Carolina, as well as other courts, are to the contrary, and federal rules are controlling. <em>C. P. Robinson Const. Co. v. National Corp. for Hous. Part., supra, </em>375 F.Supp. 446; <em>Warren Bros. Co. v. Community Building, supra, </em>386 F.Supp. 656; <em>E. C. Ernst, Inc. v. Manhattan Const. Co., supra, </em>551 F.2d 1040, n 36 (hospital construction); <em>Pathman Const. Co. v. Knox County Hospital Ass\u2019n., supra, </em>326 N.E.2d at 852-53.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Beyond this jurisdictional claim, the Hospital\u2019s basic argument is that its own Architect had been negligent in handling this dispute, giving rise to a cause of action in its favor against the Architect for any liability herein and that this controversy between the Hospital and the Architect is, like the controversy in <em>Sibley v. Tandy Corp., </em>547 F.2d 286, 287 (5th Cir. 1977), \u201cinextricably intertwined and incapable of severance\u201d from the controversy between the Hospital and Mercury. However, as we have seen, the federal authorities are clear that this is not a ground for denial of arbitration of a dispute embraced within the arbitration clause of the contract. The addition of the Architect as a party defendant might prevent removal of the state action as the district court ruled (though, on this, we express no opinion) but it certainly could not frustrate Mercury\u2019s plain, indisputable right to an arbitration of <em>its </em>dispute with the Hospital. <em>See Sibley v. Tandy Corp., supra, </em>547 F.2d at 287, and other cases cited <em>supra </em>on this point. Moreover, any claim of untimeliness, waiver or laches (as distinguished from inconsistent legal action of which there is no claim in this case and which, under the rule stated in <em>N&amp;D Fashions, </em>is for the court) is for the arbitrator and may not be an excuse for non-arbitrability. <em>See Halcon Interna</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number><em>tional, supra, </em>and <em>N&amp;D Fashions, supra. </em>Actually, the Hospital\u2019s claim of waiver, as we have already pointed out, rests on what it asserts was the delinquencies or negligence of the Architect, whom it selected and designated in the contract as its agent to handle all disputes under the contract. To say the least, this is a novel theory for avoiding arbitration. However, the crucial point is that, in its state action, the Hospital does not set forth one fact that would, under controlling federal substantive law governing arbitration, defeat the right of Mercury to what the Federal Arbitration Act was intended to assure it, <em>i. e., </em>an \u201carbitration procedure . . . [that would] be speedy and not subject to delay and obstruction . . . . \u201d <em>Prima, supra, </em>388 U.S. at 403-04, 87 S.Ct. at 1805-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">As we have said, the Hospital\u2019s objection to the exercise of jurisdiction in this ease to afford Mercury its clear right to arbitrate was that there is a state court proceeding involving the same issues and that, in the interest of judicial economy and convenience, the federal court should stay its hand and defer to the state court, since the state court is as able as the federal court \u201cto determine whether federal law with regard to arbitration applies in the instant situation.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For this position the Hospital places its principal reliance on <em>Will v. Calvert Fire Ins. Co., </em>437 U.S. 655, 98 S.Ct. 2552, 57 L.Ed.2d 504 (1978). We think the reliance misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">In <em>Will v. Calvert, </em>the plurality opinion was written by Justice Rehnquist, who emphasized that the Court was dealing with the appeal as one in mandamus and not on direct appeal and that the right to relief in mandamus required a clearer showing than a showing on direct appeal. Under established rules, Justice Rehnquist declared that mandamus could issue only if the party seeking it had a \u201cclear and indisputable right\u201d to have its claims adjudicated in a federal forum, and the right to such relief was one within the court\u2019s discretion. He extended the holding in <em>Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co., </em>316 U.S. 491, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942), which would deny deference to a concurrent state proceeding if the issue was one \u201cof substantive federal law,\u201d to cover deference in favor of concurrent state proceedings which involved federal law and he dismissed <em>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976) with its dictum that reminded federal courts of their \u201cunflagging obligation\u201d to exercise their jurisdiction because there had been no final decision in that case. He concluded by finding that since the issuance of a writ of mandamus is discretionary \u201cit cannot be said that a litigant\u2019s right to a particular result [in the exercise of that discretion] is \u2018clear and indisputable.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">The critical opinion in this case, however, was that of Justice Blackmun. He was the \u201cswing-man\u201d between Justice Rehnquist\u2019s opinion and that of Justice Brennan. Justice Blackmun voted with Justice Rehnquist only to the extent of vacating the writ of mandamus but, unlike Justice Rehnquist, he did so solely in order to permit Judge Will to reconsider his order its the light of <em>Colorado River. </em>He questioned the plurality opinion\u2019s treatment of <em>Brilihart </em>and of <em>Colorado River, </em>as authorizing the broad discretion of the district court to defer found by the plurality, for whom Justice Rehnquist spoke. In essence, he agreed largely with the result reached by Justice Brennan in his dissenting opinion except that he would have left the decision to Judge Will to determine whether there were such \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d as would, under <em>Colorado River, </em>permit the district court to depart from its \u201cunflagging obligation\u201d to exercise its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the real decision in <em>Will </em>was that a federal court being seized of jurisdiction of a case, was not to stay its proceedings in deference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>to a state action involving the same issues unless there were \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d justifying such stay, and <em>Will </em>was remanded in order that the district court could consider whether there were such \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d And that is exactly the construction given the decision on remand to the Court of Appeals and to Judge Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Thus, in <em>Calvert Fire Ins. Co. v. Will, </em>586 F.2d 12 (7th Cir. 1978), the Court of Appeals, on remand, summarized its construction of the several opinions of the Supreme Court in <em>Will </em>thus (586 F.2d 14):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-5\">\u201cJustice Blackmun\u2019s view is that, in the context of a petition for a writ of mandamus, we should have merely required the district court to reconsider its action in light of <em>Colorado River </em>rather than ourselves determining whether <em>Colorado River </em>compelled the district court to immediately adjudicate Calvert\u2019s federal claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-6\">\u201cSince the four Justices who joined Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion believed that under <em>Colorado River </em>the district court now has a clear obligation to immediately adjudicate Calvert\u2019s federal claims, it follows logically that these four Justices would favor going at least as far as Justice Blackmun and require the district court to determine whether its earlier deferral to concurrent state proceedings is now correct. Calvert is therefore arguably entitled to an order requiring the district court to reconsider its actions in this case in light of <em>Colorado River.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-7\">\u201cThe district court, however, in its statement filed with this court on remand, has indicated that it intends to follow such a course on its own motion. There is therefore no need for this court to take any further action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">In <em>Calvert Fire Insurance Co. v. American Mut. Reins. Co., </em>459 F.Supp. 859 (N.D. Ill., E.D. 1978), which was the decision of Judge Will on remand, Judge Will construed the decisions in <em>Will </em>exactly as had the Court of Appeals in 586 F.2d at 14, and he proceeded to apply the rule that limited deference to a concurrent state action to situations presenting very \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d He found that there were \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d in the case under review justifying the stay. In reaching that conclusion he said that the state action, involving a matter <em>controlled by state law, </em>was filed six months before the federal action and he found that, later when filed the federal action was no more than a \u201creactive defensive maneuver,\u201d simply \u201ca tactical maneuver to delay the determination of whether or not Calvert owes the pool its share of the 1974 losses,\u201d and a mere \u201ctactical defensive action in which the only exclusive federal claim is a contrived one.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It was on that basis and on that basis alone that Judge Will determined to stay the federal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">It is manifest that Mercury\u2019s action was not a \u201ccontrived\u201d federal claim asserted only in order to delay the resolution of the controversy nor was it a \u201creactive\u201d or \u201ctactical maneuver\u201d for such purpose. The charge of a \u201ccontrived\u201d action is more appropriately applied to the Hospital\u2019s state action. After negotiating for months both through its Architect and later its attorneys with respect to the claim and, though giving the clear impression that it earnestly desired to settle amicably the controversy without arbitration, the Hospital suddenly, without any forewarning, advised Mercury on October 8 that it was filing immediately a suit in the state court in order to enjoin arbitration. It is only fair to assume that this was to take advantage of the decisions of the North Carolina Court of Appeals which would deny interstate commerce character to the contract in question. It joined as a codefendant its own agent, the Architect, and again it seems fair to assume that this was to avoid removal of the action to the federal court. But, even assuming there is some controversy between the Hospital and the Architect, to which Mercury is not a party, why should Mercury be delayed in its right to a prompt resolution by arbitration, without the expense of long and protracted litigation, as the parties had sol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>emnly agreed, because of some controversy between the Hospital and its Architect? Such a maneuver plainly prejudiced Mercury in its right to arbitration under the Federal Act. This is the very kind of prejudice noted in <em>E. C. Ernst, Inc. v. Manhattan Const. Co., supra, </em>559 F.2d at 269, where the objection to arbitration was the reverse of that here but where the principle was the same:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-5\">\u201cWhen one party reveals a disinclination to resort to arbitration or any phase of suit involving all parties, those parties are prejudiced by being forced to bear the expenses of a trial, which in this case is quite lengthy. Arbitration is designed to avoid this very expense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">There are no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d justifying the action of the district court in deferring in favor of the state court and certainly the district court stated none. Nor could it do so, on the basis of the conceded record here.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The only apparent reason for the Hospital\u2019s precipitate resort to its state action was an attempt to foreclose any resort by Mercury to arbitration in the federal court under federal law, and to litigate the right to arbitrate under state law, all on the premise that the contract in question did not involve \u201cinterstate commerce.\u201d This view of the nature of the contract has been declared by the Court of Appeals of North Carolina in two recent cases.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In these cases the Court of Appeals of North Carolina held that under facts similar to those here the pertinent construction contract was not \u201cin interstate commerce.\u201d If this construction of the contract of the parties in this case were adopted, the rights of the parties would not be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, but by state law, which is the Hospital\u2019s basic position. Such a construction of the contract is, as we have seen, contrary to all relevant federal decisions, including decisions of the very court which stayed the federal proceedings in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">The Hospital seeks to answer this argument by arguing that, if the contract is held to be in interstate commerce, the North Carolina arbitration statute would apply and it is similar to the Federal Act. Thus, whether in the state court or in the federal court, the proceedings, according to the Hospital, would be the same. North Carolina it is true has adopted the Uniform Arbitration Act, Article 45A, \u00a7 1-567.1, <em>et seq. </em>G.S.N.C., which has considerable similarity to the Federal Act. However, that Act and its provisions have not been given judicial construction by the North Carolina courts as has the Federal Act by the federal courts and the rights of the parties thereunder have not thus been clearly delineated. Until a statute has been given an authoritative judicial construction by the enacting state\u2019s own courts, its application and reach are uncertain. Specifically, we do know what the rights of the parties are on any claim of untimeliness, laches or waiver under the Federal Act. We do not know whether the North Carolina courts will treat these issues as issues for the arbitrators, or as issues to be the subject of long jury trials. The Hospital assumes apparently that the North Carolina courts would treat them as issues for jury determination in a judicial proceeding and not for the arbitrators for it attaches to its state complaint a demand for a jury trial, a right it would not have in federal court, where all these issues would be committed to the determination of the arbitrators. Moreover, if these issues are triable to the court rather than by the arbitrators, Mercury will be denied the right to a \u201cspeedy [remedy] not subject to delay and obstruction\u201d by the delays inherent in a jury trial. This was the right the Federal Act was particularly intended to assure. In addition, federal procedure under the Act, as established in the decisions, would not permit the Hospital, by the addition of the Architect as a codefendant, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>frustrate and defeat arbitration; the federal court would simply sever the arbitrable claim and order the parties to proceed to arbitration of that claim. All these rights are rights guaranteed Mercury by the Federal Arbitration Act, which governs if the contract which provides the basis for the claim is \u201cin commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">This is a case where it can be fairly said to be doubtful whether the rights of Mercury as fixed by \u201cfederal substantive law\u201d will be recognized in the state court. Certainly, if the North Carolina court adheres to its view that contracts such as the one here are not \u201cin commerce,\u201d or construes the terms of the Uniform Arbitration Act with the severe rigidity it has in arbitration cases prior to the State\u2019s adoption of the Uniform Arbitration Act, Mercury will not be accorded the benefit of the \u201csubstantive federal law\u201d developed in the federal court for the application of the Federal Arbitration Act. The loss of its rights as established by federal \u201csubstantive law\u201d in arbitration demands that the district court not defer here. Even the plurality opinion in <em>Will </em>would not suggest deference where it was not clear that the state courts would apply controlling federal law as mandated under the Supremacy Clause. We do not think the mere fact that North Carolina has recently enacted the Uniform Arbitration Act constitutes such an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d as would preclude Mercury\u2019s right to a federal forum for the exercise of a federal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">It should be added that refusal by the district court to defer to the state action could not prejudice either party. There has been no action taken in the state action. It is in exactly the same posture as the federal action. The real point of difference is that the federal courts have a body of precedent governing the actions; the North Carolina courts have none. Both actions are controlled by federal, not state, law. If expedition of the resolution is the desideratum, then plainly every consideration favors federal jurisdiction over state jurisdiction, particularly since federal law is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Unlike Judge Will in <em>Calvert, </em>the district court found no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d justifying a departure from the <em>Colorado River </em>rule of \u201cunflagging obligation\u201d of the federal court to maintain federal jurisdiction, despite the pendency in state court of a similar action between the parties. Without such finding of \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d the district court had no right to stay the federal proceedings in this case. This is the teaching of <em>Will v. Calvert </em>as construed by Judge Will and by the Seventh Circuit. That right is not to be defeated by \u201cforum-shopping,\u201d which operates, whether intentional or not, to defeat Mercury\u2019s plain federal right to arbitration and to deny it a right to a federal forum for the redress of a federal right by a farfetched claim in a cause of action in the state court by the Hospital against its own agent for alleged delinquencies for which Mercury had no responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause is remanded to the district court with directions to proceed in conformity herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-9\">.

And it was, in answer to that argument which is the same as that made by the Hospital here, that the Court in that case stated that it \u201cwould not allow one party to circumvent an arbitration clause through the utilization of state court litigation.\u201d 400 F.Supp. at 890. This was the opinion of the district court that was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in 541 F.2d 1263.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">. <em>Commonwealth Edison Co. v.

Balfour, Guthrie &amp; Co., Ltd., </em>577 F.2d 264 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Robert Lawrence Co. v. Devonshire Fabrics, Inc., </em>271 F.2d 402 (2d Cir. 1959), cert. dismissed, 364 U.S. 801, 81 S.Ct. 27, 5 L.Ed.2d 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">As the opinion of the majority does not emphasize, this is not, and may not be, a case of federal question jurisdiction. We have so held only recently in <em>Sine, et al v. Local No. 992, etc., </em>644 F.2d 997 (4 Cir., 1981), and the statute specifically so provides, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4. Thus, the case before us must be based on diversity jurisdiction, as it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>In each diversity case where one party prefers a federal forum and the other a State forum, there is apt to be a race to the courthouse. There is nothing iniquitous about it, and to hold as the majority does that preferring a State forum somehow offends does not give effect, I think, either to Article VI of the Constitution or of the latest statement of the Supreme Court on that subject. Article VI, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-5\">\u201cThe Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; . . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">As it has said before, in <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 549, 101 S.Ct. 764, 770, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-7\">\u201cState judges as well as federal judges swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States, and there is no reason to think that because of their frequent differences of opinion as to how that document should be interpreted that all are not doing their mortal best to discharge their oath of office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">That statement applies, of course, to the construction of federal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">The mere fact that one of the parties here does not desire arbitration, while the other does, does not mean that the party who desires arbitration is necessarily right and the party who opposes it is necessarily wrong. It is simply that, as in every law suit, there is a difference of opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">Indeed, if there is any forum shopping in this case and if such is somehow or another iniquitous, which I doubt, it is equally on the part of the federal plaintiff. The federal plaintiff (Mercury) was a State court defendant. Even assuming that the North Carolina Supreme Court would find that the contract involved here was not in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act would not apply because of the two intermediate court decisions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there is no reason given nor is any speculation possible that the North Carolina courts would not have enforced the North Carolina Arbitration Act had the federal plaintiff (Mercury) only requested it in that proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the federal plaintiff would have already achieved the arbitration it now so zealously asks us to impose on the other party. Because it did not take the simple and direct route of previously getting the arbitration that it now says it wants, the only logical conclusion is that it wished a federal forum to decide the question of whether or not to arbitrate as well as to review the decision of the arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">In line with these thoughts, I note that the owner, the contractor, and the architect, each of whom blames the others for the difficulties at hand, were all parties in the State court proceeding and thus complete relief could have been given. All are not parties to the federal proceeding and thus complete relief may not be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-16\">When I add these reasons to those given by Judge Hall, I am more firmly of opinion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awaiting action on the part of the State court, which is all that it did. The action of the district court is nothing more nor less than the exercising of control of its own docket, in which matter it should be allowed rather wide latitude instead of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>being strictly circumscribed as the majority would have it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">I am authorized to say that Judge HALL joins in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">. Since <em>Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch, </em>387 U.S. 456, 87 S.Ct. 1776, 18 L.Ed.2d 886 (1967), intermediate State court decisions are not bind- ' ing, but should receive proper regard.

K. HALL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A3t\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">I am at a loss to understand how the majority could have strayed so far afield in its resolution of this case. We have been called upon to determine whether the district court properly exercised its discretion by deferring to the state court. Rather than addressing this question, the majority concentrates on tangential matters which are not ripe for adjudication and which serve only to divert attention from the true controversy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">This controversy is a product of the parallel legal proceedings instituted by the parties. Initially, the Hospital filed a declaratory judgment action in state court seeking a declaration of its rights and liabilities under the construction contract. The Hospital alleged, among other things, that Mercury was not entitled to invoke the arbitration clause of the contract because it had <em>waived </em>arbitration, and was otherwise prohibited by laches and estoppel. In response, Mercury asserted its right to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">Although North Carolina provides by statute a means for compelling arbitration,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mercury nevertheless filed in federal court a petition to compel arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and a petition to remove the state action to federal court. The district court judge denied removal and declined to rule on the petition to compel because the identical issues were already before the state court. Mercury now asks us to decide whether the district court properly stayed its consideration of the petition to compel arbitration pending the outcome of the parallel state proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-13\">When analyzing this question, we must remember the nature of the case and its procedural posture. The identical issues of arbitration and waiver have been presented to both a state and federal court. The parties to the arbitration agreement are before both courts, and each court has statutory authority to compel arbitration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Therefore, both courts are capable of providing the appropriate relief to the parties, Further, both lawsuits are still in the pleading stage, so neither party has had an opportunity to present its arguments for or against arbitration. Thus, the next step in these proceedings is for a trial court to hear the parties and determine whether the issues are arbitrable. Against this background, we must decide whether the district court is obligated to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">The Federal Arbitration Act does not specify the obligations of the district judge when confronted with a parallel state proceeding. Of the various provisions of the Act, Section 4 comes the closest to governing this situation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That section requires the court to consider a petition to compel and then to either order arbitration or, if necessary, to entertain certain specified challenges to the agreement. The clear Congressional purpose behind these directives is to expedite the arbitration process by requiring prompt action by the court. <em>See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 404, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 1806, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">In this case, however, the purpose of Section 4 will be competently and authoritatively implemented by the state court. It would serve no purpose to read into Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>4 the requirement that the federal court must also rule upon the petition, thereby duplicating the efforts of the state court and possibly contradicting its result. Under such circumstances, Section 4 does not require the federal court to rule upon the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">We next turn to the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in <em>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976), in which the Court developed several principles and standards for gauging the propriety of a federal court\u2019s deferral to a state court. The Court stated that, as a general rule, \u201cthe pendency of an action in the state court is no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter in the Federal court having jurisdiction . . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817, 96 S.Ct. at 1246, <em>quoting McClellan v. Carland, </em>217 U.S. 268, 282, 30 S.Ct. 501, 504, 54 L.Ed. 762 (1910). The Court further observed that the federal district courts have a \u201cvirtually unflagging obligation\u201d to exercise the jurisdiction given them. 424 U.S. at 817, 96 S.Ct. at 1246. However, the Court also recognized the importance of wise judicial administration, conservation of judicial resources and the comprehensive disposition of litigation, and found that exceptional circumstances would justify deferral by the federal court. Those circumstances include: (1) the prior assumption of jurisdiction over the <em>res </em>by state court; (2) the inconvenience of the federal forum; (3) the desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation; and (4) the order in which jurisdiction was obtained by the concurrent forums. <em>Id. </em>at 818, 96 S.Ct. at 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">Such exceptional circumstances are present here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As discussed earlier, the waiver issue was first presented to the state court, which has the authority and competence to provide appropriate relief. A stay of the federal action gives proper deference to the prior jurisdiction of the state court and elimin\u00e1tes the possibility of duplicative effort and conflicting results. Further, the state court, having jurisdiction over both the arbitration issue and the substantive action on the merits, is in a better position to bring the entire litigation to a prompt conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Despite these strong considerations, the majority concludes that the federal court must rule upon Mercury\u2019s petition because \u201cfederal substantive law\u201d gives Mercury the right to arbitrate the Hospital\u2019s waiver defenses. The majority overlooks the fact that we do not know the basis for these defenses because this case is still in the pleading stage, and therefore we cannot know whether the defenses are of an arbi-trable nature. Nevertheless, the majority jumps to the conclusion that arbitration would immediately ensue, and in the process forgets that we are supposed to be deciding which court will make that very determination. In other words, with a near total ignorance of the surrounding circumstances, the majority has ruled upon Mercury\u2019s petition to compel arbitration and has used that ruling to admonish the district court for not acting in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">I suspect the majority\u2019s primary fear is that the Hospital has attempted to deprive Mercury of its access to a federal forum. The majority refers ominously to the filing of the state action as intended \u201cto defeat arbitration,\u201d and labels the joinder of the architect-agent as a ploy to avoid diversity. These inferences ultimately compel the majority to accuse the Hospital of filing \u201ca contrived action\u201d and forum-shopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">The more reasonable explanation for these acts is that after months of negotiations, and having discovered the possible misfeasance of its architect, the Hospital decided it had better litigate its cause. The Hospital did so in state court so that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>could bring all the parties before one forum. The treacherous motives attributed to these acts is more likely a conjecture stemming from the majority\u2019s hindsight than the reasoned product of the Hospital\u2019s foresight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">In the final analysis, the majority has combined a form of bootstrap logic with misconceptions of bad faith to reach a conclusion which is supported neither by law nor fact. For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">. The majority opinion, which in effect directs arbitration, will come as a surprise to all parties. No one argued that this court should decide that issue. The bone of contention concerned which trial court should decide, in accordance with the plain provisions of the statutes, whether arbitration should be compelled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">.

In the two decisions cited by the majority, the North Carolina Court of Appeals ruled that the Federal Arbitration Act did not apply to the contracts in question because those contracts did not involve interstate commerce. <em>Burke County Public Schools Bd. of Ed. v. The Shaver Partnership, </em>46 N.C.App. 573, 265 S.E.2d 481 (N.C.App. 1980); <em>Bryant-Durham Electric Co. v.

North Carolina has adopted the Uniform Arbitration Act, N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-567.1 <em>et seq. </em>The Uniform Act requires the state court to compel arbitration in virtually the identical manner and circumstances set forth in the Federal Act. <em>See </em>note 3, <em>infra. </em>Therefore, the same result should be obtained regardless of the law applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-17\">The North Carolina act provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-18\">\u00a7 1-567.2. <em>Arbitration agreements made valid, irrevocable and enforceable; </em>scope.\u2014 (a) Two or more parties may agree in writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>to submit to arbitration any controversy existing between them at the time of the agreement, or they may include in a written contract a provision for the settlement by arbitration of any controversy thereafter arising between them relating to such contract or the failure or refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof.
