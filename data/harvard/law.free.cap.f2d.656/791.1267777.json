SKELLY WRIGHT.</p>\n<author id=\"b855-13\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT,-Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">The issue presented in this petition for review is whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has offered sufficient justification for failing to hold an evidentiary hearing, upon the request of General Motors Corporation (GM), prior to granting Michigan Wisconsin Pipe Line Company (Michigan Wisconsin) a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing Michigan Wisconsin to construct additional pipeline facilities and to deliver increased amounts of natural gas to some of its customers on \u201cpeak\u201d demand days. We conclude that the Commission did not adequately explain its denial of GM\u2019s hearing request. Accordingly, we remand the case to the Commission for reconsideration and the opportunity to provide further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b855-17\">Michigan Wisconsin is a natural gas company regulated by FERC. The company sells natural gas to various wholesale distribution customers (distributors), which in turn sell natural gas to end users. The volume of natural gas that distributors may purchase from Michigan Wisconsin, under contract, is subject to two important limitations approved by FERC. First, the amount of natural gas a distributor may purchase in the course of a year is limited to the distributor\u2019s \u201cannual entitlement.\u201d Second, the amount of gas that may be purchased on any one day cannot exceed the \u201cpeak day entitlement\u201d for the distributor.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-18\">This case involves an increase in peak day entitlements. On April 30, 1979 Michigan Wisconsin filed an application with FERC, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(c) (1976), for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing Michigan Wisconsin to increase peak day entitlements for 20 of its distribution customers and also to construct additional pipeline facilities necessary for increased deliveries. In explaining its request Michigan Wisconsin noted that \u201c[bjeeause of conservation efforts * * * and the shifting of some industrial loads to alternate fuels,\u201d some of its distribution customers were \u201cunable to utilize fully the annual gas supplies available to them under their service agreements with Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Wisconsin.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such underutilization of annual entitlements would be rectified, Michigan Wisconsin suggested, if the distributors were permitted to purchase increased volumes of gas on peak demand days. A 1.1 percent increase in peak day entitlements for these distributors, without any concomitant increase in annual entitlements, would allow them \u201cto serve new residential hookups and other high priority consumers desiring to switch from fuel oil to gas.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3Z\">In response to Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s application GM, which purchases gas from several distribution customers of Michigan Wisconsin for which no increases in peak day entitlements were sought, moved to intervene in the proceedings and requested a formal evidentiary hearing on several issues. On November 1,1979 the Commission issued an order in which it allowed GM to intervene, but denied the company\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing and granted Michigan Wisconsin the certificate of public convenience and necessity it sought.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> GM then petitioned for rehearing, arguing again that the Commission must hold an evidentiary hearing. On May 14, 1980 the Commission issued an \u201cOrder Denying Rehearing,\u201d in which it attempted to clarify further its decision to dispense with an evi-dentiary hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter GM filed this petition for review of the Commission\u2019s two orders, in which it challenges the Commission\u2019s refusal to conduct an eviden-tiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">The principal claim GM makes in this petition for review is that the Commission, in violation of the Natural Gas Act and its governing regulations,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> failed to hold a formal evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s \u201csupply situation over both the short and long terms is adequate to permit the proposed increase in peak day service.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> GM concedes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>FERC need not hold an evidentiary hearing when no issue of material fact is in dispute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But in GM\u2019s view, the issue of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s supply situation over the short term and long term presents an issue of material fact that requires an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">As we read the Commission\u2019s orders, FERC offered two reasons<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s supply situation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> First, the Commission suggested that where, as here, the gas company\u2019s application involves only an increase in peak day entitlements, and no change in annual entitlements, FERC need not conduct an evi-dentiary hearing concerning the applicant\u2019s supply situation. In such circumstances the necessary showing concerning the applicant\u2019s supply situation was made when the Commission previously approved the annual entitlements.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, FERC indicated that an evidentiary hearing on Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s supply situation was unnecessary because Michigan Wisconsin had not recently curtailed any of its customers and did not expect curtailment during the coming year.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In our view, the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>reasons, as presently stated, fail to justify a denial of an evidentiary hearing concerning the adequacy of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s <em>long-term </em>supply situation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The Commission\u2019s first ground for denying GM\u2019s hearing request \u2014 that Michigan Wisconsin did not seek an increase in annual entitlements \u2014 not only trivializes the Commission\u2019s decision to increase peak day entitlements; it attributes continuing validity to earlier adequacy-of-supply showings. The Commission, in holding that adequacy-of-supply hearings are unnecessary where annual entitlements remain unaltered, seems to assume that the validity of the previous adequacy-of-supply showings continues uneroded by the passage of time. But in this case all of the current annual entitlements for Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s distribution customers were certificated by FERC no later than 1975.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s supply situation may have been adequate then to support the Commission\u2019s approval of the annual entitlements, it is not clear that if the Commission were to reconsider those annual entitlements today, based on Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s present and future supply situation as <em>currently </em>perceived, it would necessarily find them to be reasonable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">What makes the Commission\u2019s justification even more troubling is that in 1977 the Commission\u2019s predecessor, the Federal Power Commission, denied, <em>after evidentiary hearing, </em>Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s application seeking an increase in peak day entitlements but no increase in annual entitlements. As the Federal Power Commission then noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">We agree with the Staff, the Judge, and General Motors that this application should be denied. As the Administrative Law Judge points out, <em>the gas supplies of Michigan Wisconsin are declining sharply. </em>In this time of gas shortages it is inappropriate and contrary to the public interest to allow the attachment of new high priority customers where there are alterna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>tive means available to those new customers and where the Commission may feasibly take action to limit the growth of these distributors through its transportation jurisdiction. The Commission would not be pursuing its mandate under the Natural Gas Act were it to continue to permit the addition of new customers on this record. There is simply no rational basis to encourage new consumers. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnH\"><em>Michigan Wisconsin Pipe Line Co., </em>Federal Power Commission Opinion No. 810 (July 7, 1977), at 23-24 (emphasis added). In other words, despite the previous adequacy-of-supply showings that demonstrated Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s ability to supply the volumes of natural gas specified in its annual ceilings, the Commission refused to approve an increase in peak day entitlements not exceeding those annual ceilings, on the ground that Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s supply situation was inadequate. Without further explication the Commission\u2019s action in Opinion 810 must be read as casting doubt on the continuing validity of the prior adequacy-of-supply showings that supported the annual ceilings.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">It is true that the Commission, in the orders under review, attempted to distinguish Opinion 810 on the ground that Michigan Wisconsin was in curtailment in 1977, and even overruled Opinion 810 to the extent it is inconsistent with the orders.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But the Commission\u2019s attempt to distinguish Opinion 810 does not persuade us that Opinion 810 should not be read as a repudiation of the earlier adequacy-of-supply showings which the Commission here relies on. Indeed, the fact that Michigan Wisconsin was in curtailment in 1977 leads one to question the validity of the pre 1977 adequacy-of-supply showings. And it is not obvious why the Commission should think that, by overruling Opinion 810 in the instant case, in the year 1980, it could breathe new life into those earlier adequacy-of-supply showings.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">FERC\u2019s second ground for denying GM\u2019s hearing request was that at the time each of the orders was issued the record <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> demonstrated that Michigan Wisconsin had not recently been in curtailment and would not be in curtailment during the following <em>year</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>in the short term. In our view, this ground only permitted FERC to dispense with an evidentiary hearing concerning Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s <em>short-term </em>supply situation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Insofar as GM sought an evidentiary hearing on the adequacy of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s <em>long-term </em>supply situation, however, it seems entirely irrelevant that the Commission was able to conclude on the basis of the existing record that Michigan Wisconsin would not be in curtailment in the short term. Surely the Commission could not have meant to suggest that, since Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s supply situation is adequate in the short term, it must necessarily be adequate in the long term.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">We cannot accept the reasons FERC offered in its orders for denying GM an evidentiary hearing on the issue of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s long-term supply situation. We therefore remand this case to the Commission so that it may reconsider its decision not to conduct an evidentiary hearing on that issue. We remind the Commission, however, that it bears a weighty burden in justifying a denial of an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In the event the Commission does conclude, upon reconsideration, that an evi-dentiary hearing on the issue of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s long-term supply situation is unnecessary, it must articulate more clearly the reasons supporting that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-4\">.

Since FERC concedes that GM would be entitled to a formal evidentiary hearing on any disputed material issues of fact, <em>see </em>brief for respondent FERC at 14-18, we need not decide whether the requirement of a formal evidentiary hearing is one imposed by the Natural Gas Act or the Commission\u2019s regulations, or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b856-14\">. Petition for Leave to Intervene and Request for Formal Hearings of General Motors Corporation, <em>In the Matter of Michigan Wisconsin Pipe Line Co., </em>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (June 4, 1979), at 2, <em>reprinted in JA </em>at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-15\">General Motors does raise three other issues, which it conceded at oral argument are \u201csubsidiary\" to the principal one discussed in text: (1) what impact will the increased entitlements have on existing end users?; (2) is natural gas economically preferable to alternative fuels for high-priority end users?; and (3) what impact will the increased entitlements have on oil imports? Issue (1) is, in our view, subsumed in the principal issue concerning Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s supply situation, which we address in text. <em>See also </em>note 11 <em>infra. </em>As to issue (2), we agree with the Commission that no eviden-tiary hearing was required. The issue, presenting a matter of local public interest, is one that FERC, not improperly, has in the past left for resolution to state commissions. <em>See, e. g., Blue Ridge Gas Co., </em>19 F.P.C. 1120 (1958). An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>evidentiary hearing was also unnecessary with respect to issue (3). As the Commission noted, the only material issue of fact raised by issue (3) is whether Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s supply of natural gas is sufficient for it to perform the proposed services. Since the adequacy-of-supply issue is separately raised, as GM\u2019s principal basis for a hearing, issue (3) did not require an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b857-6\">. The proposition is indeed well established law in this circuit. See <em>Public Service Co. of New Hampshire </em>v. <em>FERC, </em>600 F.2d 944, 955 (D.C. Cir. 1979); <em>Citizens for Allegan County, Inc. </em>v. <em>FPC, </em>414 F.2d 1125, 1128 (D.C.Cir.1969). <em>See also Independent Bankers Ass\u2019n of Georgia v. Board of Gov. of Federal Reserve System, </em>516 F.2d 1206, 1270 (D.C.Cir.1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b857-7\">. We note that in its first order FERC also suggested, as a basis for denying GM\u2019s hearing request, that the increase in peak day entitlements was <em>de minimis. </em>FERC did not, however, rely on this argument in its \u201cOrder Denying Rehearing,\u201d in its appellate brief, or in oral argument before this court. We therefore decline to reach it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b857-8\">. FERC and the various intervenors also make the argument that GM lacks standing to challenge the Commission\u2019s orders since the petitioner has not demonstrated the likelihood of aggrievement. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(b) (1976) (conferring standing to seek judicial review of FERC orders on parties \u201caggrieved\u201d by the orders). In particular, they argue that any curtailment by Michigan Wisconsin of its customers would be based on annual entitlements, which remain unchanged by the Commission\u2019s orders, and that therefore the amount of natural gas GM would obtain under curtailment remains unaffected by the increase in peak day entitlements. In our view, however, GM has standing to challenge the Commission\u2019s orders. We do not accept the contention of FERC and the intervenors that GM\u2019s supply of natural gas during curtailment will necessarily be unaffected by the Commission\u2019s increase in peak day entitlements. See note 12 <em>infra. </em>Moreover, even if we assume that curtailment would be based solely on annual entitlements, it is nonetheless conceivable that the increased peak day entitlements, by permitting a faster depletion of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s supply of natural gas, may result in curtailment at an earlier date than would otherwise occur, thereby injuring GM. The arguments of FERC and the interve-nors simply do not demonstrate that GM\u2019s claims of adverse impact \u2014 reduced gas supplies and increased prices \u2014 are untenable. And while GM has not demonstrated that the adverse impact is reasonably likely to occur, the claimed injuries \u201cmust be taken as proven,\u201d insofar as the standing issue is concerned, \u201cbecause proof was forestalled\u201d through FERC\u2019s refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>City of Pittsburgh v. FPC, </em>237 F.2d 741, 749 (D.C.Cir. 1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b857-13\">. The Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-14\">Contract demand standing alone has never been the focus for a gas supply determination in a certificate proceeding. Estimated annual gas requirements have been the pivotal factor. Insofar as annual gas requirements are concerned, if service under the existing certificates, with annual delivery limitations, is supported by the Commission\u2019s outstanding certificate authorizations and the policies and determinations reflected in Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s curtailment plan, then service under amended certificates, with the same annual delivery limitations, is supported by these authorizations and determinations. <em>In short, no new gas supply showing is required in a certificate proceeding where, as here, annual deliveries are similarly limited both under the existing certificates and the amended certificates.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">Order Denying Rehearing, <em>supra </em>note 4, at 5, JA at 17 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b857-16\">. <em>See </em>Order, <em>supra </em>note 3, at 4, JA 6 (\u201cMichigan] Wisconsin] did not curtail any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>its customers during the winter of 1978-79 and does not anticipate any curtailments for the winter of 1979-80.\u201d); Order Denying Rehearing, <em>supra </em>note 4, at 4, JA at 16 (\u201cMichigan Wisconsin has not been curtailing on a daily or seasonal basis and will not be curtailing on a daily or seasonal basis through March 31, 1981.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b858-7\">. As previously noted, <em>see </em>note 6 <em>supra, </em>subsumed in the broad question concerning the adequacy of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s supply situation over the short and long terms is a subsidiary issue separately raised by GM, namely, the impact of the increased entitlements on existing end users. With respect to this sub-issue, FERC offered two additional reasons for denying GM an evidentiary hearing. First, the Commission stated that it may ignore whatever end-use impact may result from increased peak day entitlements. Second, it suggested that, in the event of curtailment, existing end users of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s natural gas would not be affected since curtailment of natural gas among Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s distribution customers is based on annual entitlements, which remain unchanged by the Commission\u2019s orders. Neither of these additional reasons is necessarily persuasive. Contrary to what the Commission suggests, it is not clear that it can ignore the impact of its decision on existing end users. <em>See State of North Carolina v. FERC, </em>584 F.2d 1003 (D.C.Cir.1978). Nor is it clear that curtailment of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s distributors wouid be based solely on annual entitlements. Rather, it is the policy of the Commission to require natural gas companies to curtail on the basis of end-use priorities rather than contract entitlements. Order 467-B, Utilization and Conservation of Natural Resources\u2014Natural Gas Act, 49 F.P.C. 583 (March 2, 1973). <em>See also State of North Carolina v. FERC, supra. </em>And even if curtailment were based solely on annual entitlements, the existing end users of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s natural gas might nevertheless be injured by the Commission\u2019s action in the instant case. Increased peak day entitlements may result in a faster depletion of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s natural gas supplies, thereby necessitating institution of curtailment at a date earlier than would be required in the absence of increased peak day entitlements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b858-12\">.

Indeed, in 1977 the Commission itself noted that its earlier approval of Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s annual entitlements \u201cdid not imply unfettered peak day or annual increases and that the Commission would continue to look closely at Michigan Wisconsin\u2019s supply in relation to its future proposals.\u201d <em>Michigan Wisconsin Pipe Line Co., </em>Federal Power Commission Opinion No. 810 (July 7, 1977), at 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b859-5\">. <em>See </em>Order, <em>supra </em>note 3, at 4, JA at 6; Order Denying Rehearing, <em>supra </em>note 4, at 2, JA at 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b859-6\">.
