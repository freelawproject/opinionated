Sherman Christensen, Senior Judge, United States District Court for the District of Utah, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b492-23\">BROWNING, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b492-24\">Three questions involving application of Section 8 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 19, are raised on this appeal. The principal issue is whether Section 8 prohibits the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>same person from serving at the same time as a director of a bank and as a director of an insurance company with which the bank competes, when the competition is such that an agreement between the companies would violate the antitrust laws. A closely related issue is whether the statute prohibits interlocking directorates between a bank holding company and an insurance company, when the only competition is between the holding company\u2019s bank subsidiary and the insurance company. Finally, we are asked to decide whether, if otherwise within the reach of Section 8, such interlocking directorates are nonetheless excluded from coverage by the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1011-1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The district court held Section 8 does not apply to interlocking directorates between a bank and a non-bank or between a bank holding company and non-banks. However, assuming coverage, the court held that the McCarran-Ferguson Act would not exempt bank/insurance company interlocks from the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We agree with the district court that the McCarran-Ferguson Act is inapplicable, but hold that Section 8 of the Clayton Act prohibits the bank and bank holding interlocks involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Section 8 contains five unnumbered paragraphs. The first three relate to interlocking personnel of member banks of the Federal Reserve System. No director, officer or employee of such a bank may serve as a director, officer, or employee of another, subject to six exceptions. The bar applies whether or not the banks compete, although banks not in adjacent cities or engaged in the same class of business are excluded. Power to enforce the prohibitions of these banking paragraphs is vested in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">The fourth paragraph contains the provision invoked here. This \u201ccompeting corporations\u201d paragraph prohibits any person from serving as a director of any two or more corporations \u201cother than banks, banking associations, trust companies, and common carrier\u201d provided any one of the corporations has capital exceeding $1,000,000 and is engaged in commerce, and the corporations are or have been in such competition that an agreement between them would violate the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">This proceeding was initiated by the filing of two complaints by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>challenging interlocking directorates held by five individuals linking three of the nation\u2019s largest banks with four of its largest insurance companies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The parties stipulated that each of the appellee banks \u201cby virtue of its business and location of operations, has been and is now a competitor\u201d of the life insurance company or companies with which it is interlocked \u201cin the extension of mortgage and real estate loans[,] and that such competition is not insubstantial.\u201d The companies waived any defense that the elimination of this competition by agreement among them would not violate the antitrust laws. The substantial nature of the competition potentially affected is indicated by stipulations</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">that at the beginning of 1975, outstanding real estate loans of the three banks totaled $6.5 billion and those of the four insurance companies totaled $32 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">As the district court noted, interlocking directorates of this kind are common \u2014 approximately 40% of the insurance company directors in the United States are also bank directors. <em>United States v. Crocker National Corp., </em>422 F.Supp. 686, 691 (N.D.Cal. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">Both sides moved for summary judgment. The district court granted judgment for appellees on the ground that interlocking directorates between banking and non-banking corporations were not covered by the fourth paragraph of Section 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>We conclude that the language of the statute does not exempt interlocking directorates between competing banks and non-banks where the competition between them is such that an agreement would violate the antitrust laws, that there is no indication that Congress intended to exempt such interlocking directorates, and that to exempt them would be contrary to Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the Clayton Act as a whole and Section 8 in particular.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Appellees\u2019 primary argument, and the principal ground of decision below, is that the language of Section 8 clearly and unambiguously exempts from the bar of the statute all interlocking directorates between banks and non-banks regardless of the competition between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Appellees interpret the language of the exclusionary clause (\u201cin any two or more corporations . . . other than banks, banking associations, trust companies, and common carriers\u201d) to mean \u201ctwo or more corporations . . . <em>[none of which </em>is] a bank, banking association, trust company or common carrier.\u201d On its face, however, the language may be read with equal plausibility as meaning \u201ctwo or more corporations . . . [not <em>all of which </em>are] banks, banking associations, trust companies and common carriers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">The meaning remains equivocal if the context of the clause is considered. Parsing the paragraph, the district court identified four limiting clauses and concluded that a parallel construction of three of them would support the inference that the \u201cother than\u201d clause applies to both interlocked corporations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This construction would exclude interlocking directorates between competing banks and non-banks from Section 8 entirely. As others have observed,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> however, when the section is read as a whole the exemption of \u201cbanks, banking associations, trust companies\u201d in the competing corporations paragraph appears to relate back to the immediately preceding paragraphs regulating interlocking personnel between a bank and \u201cany other bank, banking association, savings bank, or trust company.\u201d Since the banking paragraphs apply only to interlocking personnel between two or more banks, a normal reading would attribute the same meaning to the phrase in the competing corporations paragraph. This construction would exclude from the competing corporations paragraph only interlocking directorates between banks governed by the banking paragraphs. Section 8 as a whole would then cover all horizontal interlocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">As will be seen, the latter interpretation is supported by the circumstances in which the \u201cother than banks\u201d clause was added to the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At this point, however, it is sufficient to conclude that the exclusionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>clause in the competing corporations paragraph of Section 8 is not so clear and unequivocal, either alone or in context, as to make resort to the legislative history unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Before turning to the history of Section 8, reference should be made to Section 10, dealing with common carriers. Section 10 replaced a provision originally found in Section 8. Section 10 regulates transactions between a common carrier and another business entity relating to supplies, construction, and maintenance or to the distribution of the carrier\u2019s securities. It does not bar personnel interlocks between the carrier and the other party to the transaction, but provides that if such interlocks exist the transaction must be based upon the competitive bid most favorable to the carrier.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The applicability of the competing corporations paragraph of Section 8 to interlocking directorates between competing banks and non-banks was not clearly addressed by Congress. Possible references to the subject, discovered by the parties in an exhaustive examination of the legislative materials, are in themselves ambiguous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The scope of the statute must be determined from less direct evidence; \u201c[statutory language should be construed in accordance with its underlying purpose.\u201d <em>TRW, Inc. v. F.T.C., </em>647 F.2d 942, at 946 (9th Cir. 1981). Therefore, we must \u201clook to the \u2018object and policy of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stafford v. Briggs, </em>444 U.S. 527, 536, 100 S.Ct. 774, 780, 63 L.Ed.2d 1 (1980) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">After two decades of experience under the Sherman Act it was widely felt among persons interested in such matters that the Act had failed to accomplish its objectives.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Clayton Act was proposed to supplement the Sherman Act and remedy its per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ceived deficiencies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Act condemned certain practices not clearly barred by the Sherman Act that were believed to threaten free competition and lead to monopoly.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Interlocking directorates were of particular concern. The Democratic platform of 1908 called for abolition of interlocking directorates between competing corporations; the 1912 platform urged prohibition of all interlocking directorates.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Woodrow Wilson emphasized the issue in his successful campaign for the Presidency.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Shortly before Mr.( Wilson\u2019s inauguration, a congressional report recommended that \u201cinterlocking directorates in potentially competing financial institutions be abolished and prohibited.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In his Inaugural Address President Wilson asserted that \u201call agreed that \u2018private monopoly is indefensible and intolerable,\u2019 \u201d and called</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">for laws which will effectually prohibit and prevent such interlockings of the <em>personnel </em>of the directorates of great corporations \u2014 banks and railroads, industrial, commercial, and public-service bodies \u2014 as in effect result in making those who borrow and those who lend practically one and the same, those who sell and those who buy but the same persons trading with one another under different names and in different combinations, <em>and those who affect to compete in fact partners and masters of some whole field of business.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Representative Clayton, Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, embodied the President\u2019s requests in proposed legislation dealing with interlocking directorates in three overlapping categories. The first dealt with carrier and public service corporations, their suppliers, and banks. The second dealt with banks, prohibiting service as a director of two or more federal reserve banks. The third dealt with competing corporations. Common directors were \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d that there was no competi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>tion between the corporations having common directors, and if such corporations were or have been \u201cnatural competitors,\u201d a violation of the Sherman Act was \u201cconclusively presumed.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> No class of corporation was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">After extensive hearings before the Judiciary Committee, Rep. Clayton introduced a revised bill, H.R.15657. Section 8 contained the provisions regarding interlocking directorates. As the bill emerged from the Committee, the prohibition against interlocks between carriers and their suppliers and banks remained essentially as in the tentative bill. The prohibition against interlocks between banks was also essentially unchanged, but was made applicable only when one of the interlocked banks had deposits, capital, surplus, or undisclosed profits of more than $2,500,000 or when both banks were located in the same city. The prohibition against competitor interlocks took its present form (including the limitation of corporations having capital, surplus, or undisclosed profits of $1,000,000) except that the exclusionary clause was confined to \u201cother than common carriers.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In reporting the bill the House Judiciary Committee quoted President Wilson\u2019s condemnation of interlocking directorates and stated that the Committee had \u201cendeavored to carry out the recommendation of the President.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Committee\u2019s Report spelled out the purposes behind the bill\u2019s three substantive prohibitions. The provisions of the first were designed to \u201cprevent absolutely common directors or interlocking directors between corporations occupying relations to each other described therein,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that is, vertical relations between a carrier and its suppliers, and between a carrier and banks dealing in its securities. The purpose of the second prohibition, barring interlocking personnel between banks with more than $2,500,000 capital, \u201cis to prevent as far as possible control of great aggregations of money and capital ... to prevent the concentration of money or its distribution through a system of interlocking directorates.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The purpose of the paragraph barring interlocking directorates between competing corporations was strongly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">The concentration of wealth, money, and property in the United States under the control and in the hands of a few individuals or great corporations has grown to such an enormous extent that unless checked it will ultimately threaten the perpetuity of our institutions. . . . The truth is that the only real service the same director in a great number of corporations renders is in maintaining uniform policies throughout the entire system for which he acts, which usually results to the advantage of the greater corporations and to the disadvantage of the smaller corporations which he dominates by reason of his prestige as a director and to the detriment of the public generally.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">The emphasis upon the importance of the prohibition against the sharing of common directors by large competing corporations is understandable. The central purpose of the Clayton Act was to supplement the Sherman Act.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The central purpose of the Sherman Act was \u201cpreserving free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade.\u201d <em>Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 1, 4, 78 S.Ct. 514, 517, 2 L.Ed.2d 545 (1958). As the Judiciary Committee pointed out, common directors perform the function of \u201cmaintaining uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>form policies\u201d among the corporations they serve. The initial formulation of the bar against interlocking directorates between competing corporations rested on the premise that elimination of the competition between the corporations was to be presumed from the very existence of common directors. This remained the essence of the prohibition. Interlocking arrangements between competing corporations threaten the basic purpose of the Sherman Act and are therefore treated as illegal <em>per se.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHW\">Even the minority of the Judiciary Committee recognized that the prohibition of interlocking directorates between competing corporations \u201ccomes measurably closer to the principle of the Sherman Act than any of the preceding provisions relating to interlocking directorates.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Recent analysis supports the assumption upon which this provision of the Clayton Act rests: a direct interlock between competitors \u201cseems intended solely to suppress competition. No legitimate reason for the sharing of directors by competitors appears.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">There was little debate in the House on the provisions relating to interlocking directorates. The need for regulation was widely accepted and the proposed prohibitions relatively non-controversial. What comments there were referred mainly in broad terms to the evils arising from such arrangements \u2014 \u201cso well known as to be commonly understood\u201d \u2014 <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and the desirability of abolishing them.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The accepted principle was that \u201c[t]here can be no real competition between companies engaged in commerce where the same persons control the policies of the different companies.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">Substantial changes were made in the Senate. None of them, however, were attributable to any difference in view with the House as to the evil of interlocking directorates among large competing corporations and the purpose of Congress to bar them. What the Senate said and did reflected its concurrence in the view of the House on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">The Report of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary stated that the theory and scope of the bill as it passed the House was unchanged \u2014 that its purpose was to supplement the Sherman Antitrust Act and, by prohibiting certain trade practices, \u201cto arrest the creation of trusts, conspiracies, and monopolies in their incipency and before consummation.\u201d Among the trade practices \u201cdenounced and made unlawful\u201d were \u201cinterlocking directorates.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Senate Committee adopted verbatim the analysis of the House Judiciary Committee in recommending passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The Senate Committee did propose significant changes in the treatment of vertical interlocks among carriers, their suppliers, and the banks that handled their security issues; and in the treatment of horizontal interlocks between banks. With respect to the former, the Committee stated, \u201cespecially in the case of railroads, emergencies may arise when absolutely prohibitory law against such dealings would be most injurious to the public\u201d.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The Committee recommended substitution of a provision allowing interlocks but requiring competitive bidding under the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Committee also recommended that the paragraph in the House bill relating to interlocks between banks be stricken, and that \u201csuch additional regulation of bank directorates as may be wise and just should be made by amendments to the national bank acts, and the enforcement of it given to the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The Committee report recommended no tempering of the bar against interlocks between large competing corporations. Such interlocks were strongly condemned during floor debate. Speaking for the Committee, Senator Shields stated that \u201c[t]he object of this whole section, Mr. President, is to prevent the common and well-known evil of interlocking directorates, and thus a practical combination of different corporations engaged in commerce, which inevitably results in restraint of trade and monopoly.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Arguing that the prohibition was too weak, Senator Cummins described the interlocking directorates between competing corporations as a practice \u201cwe all recognize as a vicious one, as one which insidiously destroys the reasonable rivalry and independence that ought to exist . .. \u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The provisions relating to interlocking directorates recommended by the Committee were adopted by the Senate.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">To resolve differences between House and Senate, a Conference Committee agreed upon three changes in the Senate provisions. The bar against interlocking directorates between banks was restored, but the minimum population of cities in which bank interlocks were barred without regard to size was raised from 100,000 to 200,000, and the minimum capital required before the prohibition applied elsewhere was raised from $2,500,000 to $5,000,000. The exclusionary clause in the provision barring interlocks between competing corporations was changed from \u201cother than common carriers\u201d to \u201cother than banks, banking associations, trust companies and common carriers.\u201d Finally, the provision requiring competitive bidding in transactions between common carriers and their suppliers was removed from Section 8 and placed in a separate section.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">The report of the Conference Committee gave no reason for the changes. However, nothing in the debate leading to the adoption of the Committee report suggests any retreat by Congress from the view that interlocking directorates between large competing corporations were contrary to the public interest and should be condemned.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">In sum, the legislative materials establish that the Clayton Act was intended to supplement and strengthen the Sherman Act in preserving a free competitive economy; that interlocking directorates between large competing corporations were regarded as a precursor to restraint and monopoly and thus as a most serious threat to free competition; and that such interlocking directorates were strongly condemned. As Judge Weinfeld has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>[T]he broad purposes of Congress are unmistakably clear. Section 8 was ... intended to strengthen the Sherman Act, which, through the years, had not proved entirely effective. . . . Interlocking directorships on rival corporations had been the instrumentality of defeating the purpose of the antitrust laws. They had tended to suppress competition or to foster joint action against third party competitors. The continued potential threat to the competitive system resulting from these conflicting directorships was the evil aimed at. Viewed against this background, a fair reading of the legislative debates leaves little room for doubt that, in its efforts to strengthen the antitrust laws, what Congress intended by \u00a7 8 was to nip in the bud incipient violations of the antitrust laws by removing the opportunity or temptation to such violations through interlocking directorates.... <footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1F\">The Federal Trade Commission has arrived at the same conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">Section 8 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 19, clearly enunciates a strong Congressional policy disfavoring interlocking directorates. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">Congress enacted the Clayton Act . . . in response to the perceived shortcomings of the Sherman Act, as interpreted by the courts, in abating what were seen as unhealthy concentrations of economic and political power. One of the practices which was singled out for particular concern was the interlocking directorate....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">That Congress, in enacting Section 8, intended to outlaw interlocks between substantial competitors is unmistakable. . . ,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Interpreting the ban of the competing corporations paragraph of Section 8 to apply to interlocking directorates between large competing banks and insurance companies would thus further the unmistakable general purpose of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">This interpretation is also favored by the \u201cgoverning statutory presumptions.\u201d <em>Federal Maritime Commission v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 726, 732, 93 S.Ct. 1773, 1778, 36 L.Ed.2d 620 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">Section 8 is a remedial provision. It must be liberally construed to accomplish its prophylactic purpose.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The interpretive standard the Supreme Court applied to the Robinson-Patman amendments in <em>FTC v. Fred Meyer, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 341, 349, 88 S.Ct. 904, 908, 19 L.Ed.2d 1222 (1968), is equally applicable here: conceding the language of the statute to be unclear, \u201cwe cannot, in the absence of an unmistakable directive, construe the Act in a manner which runs counter to the broad goals which Congress intended it to effectuate.\u201d Removing bank/non-bank interlocks from the scope of the competing corporations paragraph would run counter to Congress\u2019 broad goal of maintaining a free competitive economy by barring interlocking directorates between large competing corporations. Such a result would also run counter to Congress\u2019 purpose of inhibiting the concentration of control over money and capital by enacting the banking paragraphs prohibiting interlocking directorates between financial institutions.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Interlocking directorates between banks and interlocking directorates between competing non-banks would be barred, but interlocking directorates between competing banks and non-banks would not be, even though they would offend the Congressional purpose underlying not only one of the prohibitions, but the purpose underlying both.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">Such an interpretation would also be inconsistent with the settled canon of construction that \u201c \u2018(Tjmmunity from the antitrust laws is not lightly implied,\u2019 \u201d a principle \u201cwhich reflects the felt indispensable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>role of antitrust policy in the maintenance of a free economy.\u201d <em>United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, </em>374 U.S. 321, 348, 83 S.Ct. 1715,1733,10 L.Ed.2d 915 (1963) (citations omitted). We must apply the doctrine that \u201cthe antitrust laws . . . are to be construed liberally and . . . the exceptions from their applications are to be construed strictly.\u201d <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Portland Retail Druggists Ass\u2019n., Inc., </em>425 U.S. 1, 11, 96 S.Ct. 1305, 1313, 47 L.Ed.2d 537 (1976). \u201cThis doctrine is not limited to implicit exemptions from the antitrust laws, but applies with equal foree to express statutory exemptions.\u201d <em>Group Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., </em>440 U.S. 205, 231, 99 S.Ct. 1067, 1083, 59 L.Ed.2d 261 (1979). A liberal construction of the competing corporations paragraph includes interlocking directorates between competing banks and non-banking corporations within its bar; a strict construction of the exception confines the \u201cother than banks\u201d exclusionary language to directorates between banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">To avoid this conclusion appellees argue that the exclusionary clause is not an exception to a general antitrust prohibition embodied in the competing corporations paragraph. Instead, they contend, Sections 8 and 10 together reflect a \u201chighly selective\u201d regulatory scheme to prohibit some interlocking directorates and permit others. As has been seen, however, the language of the competing corporations paragraph, the climate of opinion out of which it grew, and the legislative history of the provisions, all reflect a purpose, based upon specific and clearly articulated policy considerations, to condemn interlocking directorates among large competing corporations generally subject only to the specific exemptions stated in the statute.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> As the Federal Trade Commission has said, \u201c[Njowhere ... is there any indication that Congress carefully considered interlocks between banks and <em>competing </em>non-banks, and made a conscious decision to immunize such arrangements while generally condemning other horizontal interlocks.\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> There is no statement in the legislative history of a specific intention to exclude such interlocks; there is no expression of any purpose such an exclusion might have served. It is therefore appropriate to regard Section 8\u2019s prohibition against interlocking directorates between large competing corporations as a legislative embodiment of the fundamental national policy favoring a free competitive economy, and the \u201cother than banks . . . and common carriers\u201d clause as an express exception to that policy, which, narrowly construed, does not immunize the interlocks in this case from the general bar.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">As noted at the outset, this construction is supported by the statute\u2019s language and structure.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> A normal reading of Section 8 leads to the conclusion that the exclusionary clause was intended to coordinate the provisions of Section 8 relating to horizontal interlocking directorates by removing interlocks between banks from the competing corporations paragraph because such interlocks were regulated by the preceding paragraphs. The legislative history, supports this conclusion as to the function of the exclusionary clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">As we have noted, the Senate struck the provision relating to bank interlocks. It was restored by the Conference Committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>which at the same time added banks to the exclusionary clause in the competing corporations paragraph.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The district court concluded that these changes reflected a compromise agreement to restore the bar to interlocks between banks in return for the complete exemption of banks from the bar against interlocks between competing corporations.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> There is nothing other than an inference from the changes themselves to support the court\u2019s theory, and the result, as we have seen, is contrary to Congress\u2019 objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">There is an alternative explanation that is fully consistent both with the changes made and with Congress\u2019 basic purpose. It will be remembered that in addition to the changes mentioned, the Conference Committee made two changes in the bank provisions designed to limit the applicability of the bar against bank interlocks: the minimum capital was raised from $2,500,000 to $5,000,000; the size of cities in which interlocks were barred without respect to the size of the banks was raised from 100,000 to 200,000. The obvious inference is that it was this restriction of the applicability of the bar against inter-bank interlocks, and not the total exclusion of banks from the competing corporations paragraph, that induced the Senate to agree to a restoration of that bar against inter-bank interlocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">There was also a clear reason other than total exemption for adding banks to the exclusionary clause. A proposal to raise the threshold for applicability of the competing corporations provision from a minimum capital of $1,000,000 to a minimum of $5,000,000 was not adopted.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Thus the competing corporations paragraph was applicable to corporations of much less substantial size ($1,000,000) than the restored bank interlock prohibitions ($5,000,000), and contained no population requirement at all. Moreover, the restored provision barring inter-bank interlocks contained a series of exceptions not applicable to the bar against interlocks between competing corporations. Thus interlocks between competing banks that were not barred by the banking paragraphs might nonetheless have been barred by the competing corporations paragraph unless specifically excluded from the latter. As the House Conferees informed the House, the addition of banks to the exclusionary clause accomplished this purpose and thus protected the compromise agreement between the House and the Senate.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Under this construction of the reference to banks in the exclusionary clause, banks are exempt from the competing corporations paragraph\u2019s bar against interlocks between large competing corporations only to the extent necessary to permit the provision regarding interlocks between banks in the banking paragraphs to be fully effective. To go farther, and wholly exclude banks from the general prohibition of the competing corporations paragraph, would be both unnecessary and contrary to Congress\u2019 general purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Appellees resist this interpretation on the ground that the reference in the exclusionary clause to banks must be given the same effect as the reference to common carriers, and that the effect of the reference to common carriers is to exclude carriers from the competing corporations paragraph entirely. But the references in the exclusionary clause to banks and common carriers do not have a common origin. There is no basis for the assumption that they are to be read in the same way. They entered the exclusionary clause at different times and involve different considerations; there is no reason they should not have different effects. The reference to banks was inserted in the exclusionary clause late in the legislative process. The circumstances suggest a purpose to avoid inconsistent regulation of interlocks between banks. This specific purpose is entirely satisfied, and Congress\u2019 general purpose to maintain competition and limit the concentration of capital is equally served, by an interpretation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>restricts the effect of the bank reference to exclusion from the competing corporations paragraph of inter-bank interlocks only.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">An exclusionary clause applicable to carriers, on the other hand, was included in H.R. 15657 as this bill was filed. The substantive provisions of the bill relating to carriers had a different purpose and took a different form than the substantive provisions relating to banks and competing corporations. The purpose of Section 10, the carrier provision, was to protect carriers from overreaching and conflicts of interest.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The statute does not seek to accomplish this purpose by barring interlocking directorates between carriers and corporations engaged in furnishing them with supplies or in distributing their securities, but by requiring competitive bidding when such interlocks exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Appellees argue that this provision implicitly approves interlocks that might be barred by the competing corporations paragraph, and that to avoid possible inconsistency between Section 10 and the competing corporations paragraph of Section 8, exclusion of carrier interlocks from the competing corporations paragraph must be total. We need not decide that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">It is evident, in any event, that Congress chose to deal with banks and carriers differently, that the reference to the two types of corporations in the exclusionary clause have different purposes and different histories, and that each must be interpreted in light of the different considerations applicable to it. It is alone sufficient to justify different interpretation of the two references that the principal consideration requiring a restrictive reading of the bank exemption does not apply to the exclusion of carriers: Congress did not evidence a general antipathy toward interlocks between carriers and those with whom they did business that would be furthered by confining the common carrier exception within narrow limits. With respect to interlocks with banks, as has been seen, such antipathy was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Appellees contend that a number of circumstances reflect a Congressional intention to exclude interlocking directorates between competing banks and non-banks from the bar of the statute. None of the circumstances relied upon points directly to that construction; some more strongly support the contrary interpretation; most are simply ambiguous. Cumulatively they fall far short of the \u201cunmistakable directive\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> required to justify a construction of the competing corporations paragraph in a manner so inconsistent with the broad goals Congress intended to achieve. A brief consideration of these circumstances follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">Appellees argue that the testimony of two notable witnesses before the House Judiciary Committee, Louis Brand\u00e9is and Samuel Untermyer, reflect the opinion that interlocking directorates between competing banks and insurance companies are not within the statute. The testimony was directed to the statute\u2019s role in eliminating conflicts of interest<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and to the question of coverage of insurance companies by the banking provisions.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> It implies no view as to the scope of the competing corporations provision and therefore no view as to interlocks between banks and insurance companies that compete with one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">Appellees argue that the structure of the statute reflects a \u201ctight compartmentalization\u201d of mutually exclusive provisions relating to common carriers, banks, and industrial corporations, and therefore banks and insurance companies would not be covered under the same provision. They rely upon a statement in the House Judiciary Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>mittee\u2019s report that \u201c[t]his section is divided into three paragraphs, each of which relates to the particular corporations described, and the provisions of each paragraph are limited in their application to the corporations belonging to the class named therein.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> They also rely on references in this report and elsewhere identifying the competing corporations provision as a provision relating to \u201cindustrial corporations.\u201d <footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The bill to which the Committee report referred was not \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d in the rigid sense appellees suggest. The \u201ccommon carrier\u201d paragraph did not apply to common carriers alone. It barred interlocks between a carrier and \u201cany other corporations\u201d selling or leasing supplies to the carrier, and to any \u201cpartnership, or bank, or trust company\u201d involved in underwriting, selling, or disposing of issues of the carrier\u2019s securities.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> It thus expressly applied to banks, although the paragraphs barring interlocking directors between banks obviously applied to banks as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The use by some Congressmen of the term \u201cindustrial corporations provision\u201d was simply a short-hand means of identifying the provision relating to competing corporations. It is not a key to the provision\u2019s scope. Appellees would not contend that large corporations competing in retail distribution, for example, would not be within the competing corporations paragraph. The term \u201cindustrial corporations\u201d does not appear at all in the statute \u2014 the paragraph in question applies to \u201cany two or more corporations\u201d which are or have been \u201ccompetitors, so that an elimination of competition by agreement between them would constitute a violation of any of the antitrust laws.\u201d No doubt the primary impact of the provision was expected to be upon corporations competing with each other in industrial activity. Examples of interlocks among such corporations were prominent in discussions of the evils sought to be remedied.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Banks, on the other hand, were not generally thought of as competing with businesses other than banks. Indeed, some may have believed the competing corporations provision would not apply to banks for jurisdictional reasons \u2014 it applied only to corporations \u201cengaged in [interstate or foreign] commerce,\u201d and it was not settled that banking could be regulated by Congress under the Commerce Clause.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Even if such assumptions were generally entertained, however, they would not evidence an affirmative intention that banks should be exempt from the general prohibition of interlocking directorates between large competing corporations even if, in fact, they did compete with non-bank corporations and if, in law, they were considered to be engaged in \u201ccommerce.\u201d <footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-16\">Appellees point to a statement by Representative Cullop during floor debate that the concluding sentence of the competing corporations paragraph \u201cdoes not relate to banking. That relates to industrial and commercial corporations, or institutions of that kind, but has no reference whatever to the banking business.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> However, the subject under debate was not the bar against interlocks between competing corporations, but the bar against inter-bank interlocks. Representative Cullop was making the point that the concluding sentence of the paragraph relating to competing corporations did not provide an escape from the provisions relating to inter-bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>interlocks. The reference to the scope of the provisions relating to competing corporations is thus both incidental and ambiguous, and affords an unreliable guide to the provision\u2019s meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Similarly, a statement by Representative., Carlin that \u201cwe apply an entirely different rule to the industrial corporations\u201d was made in response to a question as to whether the banking provisions\u2019 exception for small banks applied as well to industrial corporations.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The irrelevance of the banking exceptions to industrial competitors has no bearing on whether the \u201centirely different rule\u201d of the competing corporations provision applies to banks that qualify under its competition clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Appellees attach great significance to an exchange on the House floor during the debate on the report of the Conference Committee. This appears to be the only occasion during the legislative proceedings in which the question of whether the exclusionary clause exempts interlocks between competing banks and non-banking corporations from the scope of the competing corporations paragraph was clearly raised. Representative Mann stated that the inclusion of banks in the exclusionary clause had this effect. Representative Mann, however, was an opponent of the result he read into the statute, and the proponents of the statute had no opportunity to respond.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>these circumstances the comment has little weight.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Appellees also rely on a number of congressional staff reports published after the enactment of the Clayton Act in support of the view that Section 8 does not reach interlocks between banks and non-banking corporations. These materials are unpersuasive for a variety of reasons. The congressional staff reports are merely assertions without analysis or support, are ambiguous, or refer to vertical interlocks or interlocks between banks and not to interlocks between competing corporations.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Appellees argue that subsequent introduction of legislative proposals that would have barred bank/non-bank interlocks <footnotemark>61</footnotemark> indicates that Congress thought Section 8 did not do so, and that the failure of these proposals indicate Congress did not wish to prohibit such interlocks. No relevant inference can be drawn from these proposals. None expressly prohibited interlocks between competing banks and non-banking corporations. Even if they had, an amendment proposed to close an apparent loophole may be defeated because \u201cthe existing legislation already incorporated the offered change.\u201d <em>United States v. Wise, </em>370 U.S. 405, 411, 82 S.Ct. 1354, 1358, 8 L.Ed.2d 590 (1962).<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Moreover, all of the proposals were broadly stated. Since Congress\u2019 failure to enact them may have reflected disagreement with any of their comprehensive provisions, it is not evidence that Congress believed interlocks between banks and competing non-banking corporations should not be prohibited. Moreover, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>an inference as to the views of a subsequent Congress could be drawn from these proposals, only the views of the Congress that enacted the Clayton Act are relevant. \u201c[T]he views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\u201d <em>United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, </em>374 U.S. 321, 348-49, 83 S.Ct. 1715, 1733, 10 L.Ed.2d 915 (1963).<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The enactment and later repeal of Section 8A of the Clayton Act is also irrelevant. Section 8A was adopted in 1933 as part of a comprehensive scheme to restore public confidence in banking by curbing bank involvement in securities speculation,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> and was repealed two years later. It barred interlocking relationships between banks and business entities making loans secured by stocks or bonds. It had nothing to do with fostering competition; it applied whether or not the interlocked entities competed. It applied only to interlocks between banks and companies making loans secured by securities, and had no bearing on other interlocks between banks and non-banking corporations. Conversely, the competing corporations provision of Section 8 did not prevent interlocks between banks and corporations making loans secured by stocks or bonds if they did not compete. In view of the dissimilarity in both purpose and effect, enactment and repeal of Section 8A throws no light on whether the Congress that adopted 8A in 1933 or the Congress that repealed it in 1935 thought the competing corporations paragraph of Section 8 was applicable to bank/non-bank interlocks.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">Nothing in the plethora of materials relied upon by appellees or by the government resolves the ambiguity as to whether the competing corporations provision covers interlocking directories between large competing banks and non-banking corporations. The factor that compels resolution of the ambiguity in favor of coverage is the purpose of Congress. We have seen that coverage is consistent with Congress\u2019 overall purpose to strengthen the Sherman Act by prohibiting interlocking directorates that threaten competition. Non-coverage is inconsistent with that purpose.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Nowhere in the legislative history is there any suggestion that exclusion of interlocking directorates between large competing banks and non-banking corporations would serve any countervailing Congressional policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">The district court accepted appellees\u2019 policy argument that banning interlocks between banks and insurance companies \u201ccould clearly reduce the number of qualified directors, possibly to the detriment of the public at large.\u201d 422 F.Supp. at 702. The primary support for this proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>came not from the legislative history but from a 1971 statement by Arthur Burns, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that because of the \u201cexperience and expertise\u201d of bankers, their service on boards of directors of other corporations \u201cmay be good for the corporations involved and the public they serve.\u201d <footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Five years after the statement quoted by the district court, however, Mr. Burns explained that his statement that interlocking directorates involving bankers \u201care not necessarily harmful\u201d did not apply to interlocking directorates between corporations competing for funds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">[Interlocking relationships between institutions that compete for the funds of the public involve a risk of abuse that the Board believes outweighs the reasonable expectation of benefits that might flow from such relationships.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWY\">Moreover, in testimony before the House Committee on Banking and Currency, Mr. Burns repeated his view that interlocks between competing financial institutions should be prohibited, and advocated an amendment to Section 8 to make it \u201centirely clear that [the competing corporations paragraph of Section 8] applies to interlocks between banks and non-bank businesses.\u201d <footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ax-dedup-0\">In any event, Mr. Burns\u2019 view, however perceptive, is nonetheless irrelevant. At issue is the policy judgment of the Congress that enacted the Clayton Act. The legislative history leaves no doubt that the Congress viewed interlocking directorates between large competing corporations as contrary to the public interest because they potentially eliminate competition and lead to the concentration of capital,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> and specifically rejected \u201c[t]he idea that there are only a few men in any of our great corporations and industries who are capable of handling the affairs of the same\u201d as \u201ccontrary to the spirit of our institutions.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">The inapplicability of the competing corporations provision to interlocks between competing banks and non-banking corporations is assertedly supported by \u201c[mjore than 60 years of administrative interpretation ... of Section 8.\u201d <footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">The evidence of the views of the Federal Trade Commission relied upon by the district court is equivocal<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> and in any event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>of little force in light of the opinion filed by the Commission in <em>In re Perpetual Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n., </em>90 F.T.C. 608 (1977), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>94 F.T.C. 401 (1979), after the decision below. The Commission held that interlocks between a savings and loan company and competing banks violate the policy of Section 8 of the Clayton Act and are therefore an unfair trade practice violating Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45. Technically it was unnecessary for the Commission to decide whether such interlocks also violated Section 8, but the Commission\u2019s review of the legislative history leaves no doubt of the Commission\u2019s view. The Commission rejected essentially all of the arguments advanced by appellees in this case. The Commission found it \u201cunmistakable\u201d \u201c[t]hat Congress, in enacting Section 8, intended to outlaw interlocks between substantial competitors,\u201d 90 F.T.C. at 654, and found that \u201cdirector interlocks between competitors are the evil at which Section 8 of the Clayton Act is directed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 655. The Commission could identify no policy consideration that excludes bank/non-bank interlocks from Congress\u2019 \u201cclear antipathy toward interlocking directorates,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 656, and concluded that is no \u201cindication that Congress carefully considered interlocks between banks and <em>competing </em>non-banks, and made a conscious de-cisi\u00f3n to immunize such arrangements while generally condemning other horizontal interlocks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The Department of Justice\u2019s interpretation is said to be reflected in a statement of a former Assistant Attorney General, and in the paucity of enforcement activity. The Assistant Attorney General\u2019s statement in fact recognizes the ambiguity of the statute,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> and the failure of enforcement officials to act is not a binding administrative determination of Congress\u2019 intent as to the statute\u2019s scope.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Because the purpose of strengthening the Sherman Act by eliminating interlocking directorates between large competing corporations is obviously best served by reading the ambiguous language of the exclusionary clause in the competing corporations paragraph of Section 8 as limited to interlocking directorates between banks; and because no purpose reflected in the legislative history of the Clayton Act would be served by excluding from the coverage of the statute interlocks between banks and non-banking corporations that are in such competition with each other that an agreement between them would violate the Sherman Act, we conclude that the statute should be interpreted to bar such interlocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Appellees contend that even if the interlocks between the insurance companies and the banks in this case violate Section 8\u2019s prohibition against interlocks between competing corporations, the interlocks between the insurance companies and the bank holding companies do not because the insurance companies and the bank holding companies are not \u201ccompetitors\u201d as required before the competing corporations provision of Section 8 is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The parties stipulated that each bank is the wholly-owned subsidiary of its parent company and that each parent company is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1841 <em>et seq. </em>It is also stipulated that the bank holding companies are not in and of themselves or through any subsidiaries, other than their bank subsidiaries, competitors of any of the insurance companies, but that each bank holding company controls its subsidiary bank by and through its ownership of stock and its election of all the subsidiary\u2019s directors who in turn manage the bank and select the officers that control the bank\u2019s operations and activities.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">A parent corporation is not a competitor of another corporation merely because its subsidiary is.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> On the other hand, to interpret Section 8 as meaning that the business activity of the subsidiary can never be considered in determining whether the parent is a \u201ccompetitor\u201d within the meaning of Section 8 would assume that Congress intended to permit such a simple and obvious means of avoidance as to render the statute meaningless, and would ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that the antitrust laws are \u201caimed at substance rather than form.\u201d <em>United States v. Yellow Cab Co., </em>332 U.S. 218, 227, 67 S.Ct. 1560, 1565, 91 L.Ed. 2010 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Whether for the purposes of Section 8 the business of a subsidiary is to be attributed to a parent in determining if the parent competes with another corporation with which it is interlocked, turns upon the extent of the control exercised by the parent over the subsidiary\u2019s business. \u201c[W]here the major policies of the subsidiaries are directed by the parents, it would seem that there is a strong case for holding the directorships unlawful.\u201d <em>United States v. Cleveland Trust Co., </em>392 F.Supp. 699, 712 (N.D.Ohio 1974), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>513 F.2d 633 (6th Cir. 1975), <em>quoting </em>Kramer, <em>Interlocking Directorships and the Clayton Act after 35 Years, </em>59 Yale L.J. 1266, 1268 n.ll (1950). If the parent substantially controls the policies of its subsidiary, it may fairly be said, in the language of the competing corporations provision of Section 8, that the \u201cbusiness and location\u201d of the parent include the business and location of the subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">The stipulations establish that in this case the parent bank holding companies control their bank subsidiaries in fact. The federal banking statutes establish such control as a matter of law. By definition, the business of a bank holding company is controlling subsidiary banks. The Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1841(a)(1), defines \u201cbank holding company\u201d as \u201cany company which has control over any bank or over any company that is or becomes a bank holding company.\u201d Section 1841(a)(2) provides that a company controls a bank if the company has voting power over 25 percent of any class of the voting securities of the bank and controls the election of a majority of its directors. The statute establishes a conclusive presumption of control on the facts stipulated in this case.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">The banking provision of Section 8 prohibits only interlocks between one \u201cbank, banking association, savings bank or trust company\u201d and another, and does not refer to bank holding companies. Nonetheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>the Federal Reserve Board interpreted these provisions as prohibiting an interlock between a bank and a bank holding company if an interlock between the bank and any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company would be prohibited. The Board based this interpretation upon the fact that the affairs of bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries are so closely identified and functionally related that the possibility of the abuse the banking provision of Section 8 was designed to guard against would be equally present whether the bank holding company or its bank subsidiary were involved. It would therefore frustrate the purpose of Congress to give cognizance to the separate corporate entities. The Board held that in order to effectuate the purpose of Congress, \u201c[a] holding company whose principal activity is the ownership and control of banks, and each of its bank subsidiaries, should be considered as constituting together a single entity for the purposes [of the banking provisions] of Section 8.\u201d <footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">For the same reason, the competing corporations provision of Section 8 should be read to bar interlocks between a bank holding company whose principal activity is the ownership and control of banks and a nonbanking corporation with which the subsidiary bank of the bank holding company competes. Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are indistinguishable in terms of the purpose Congress sought to achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">The staff and agency reports relied upon by appellees are not to the contrary.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> In addition to expressing concern about vertical interlocks, they question whether the statute covers \u201cindirect interlocks\u201d \u2014 as, for example, when a director of corporation X serves as a director of corporation A and another director of X serves on the board of A\u2019s competitor B, creating an indirect interlock between A and B. The interlocks at issue here are not \u201cindirect\u201d in that sense. The competing corporations provision prohibits a person from serving as \u201ca director in any two or more corporations\u201d at the same time; here one person serves simultaneously as a director of both a bank holding company and an insurance company, and the question is merely whether the two corporations are, within the meaning of the statute, competitors. The cases relied upon by appellees are also unpersuasive.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The district court held that if Section 8 of the Clayton Act did prohibit interlocking directorates between competing banks and non-banks contrary to the district court\u2019s view, the interlocks involved in this case would not be excluded from Section 8 by Section 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 59 Stat. 34 (1945), as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012(b) (1976), which provides a limited exemption from the antitrust laws for the business of insurance.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Appellees filed a cross-appeal to preserve this issue. We agree with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The McCarran-Ferguson Act was adopted in response to the holding in <em>United States v. South-Eastern Underwriter\u2019s Association, </em>322 U.S. 533, 64 S.Ct. 1162, 88 L.Ed. 1440 (1944), \u201cthat insurance transactions were subject to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause, and that the antitrust laws, in particular, were applicable to them.\u201d <em>SEC v. National Securities, Inc., </em>393 U.S. 453, 458, 89 S.Ct. 564, 567, 21 L.Ed.2d 668 (1969). The purpose of the McCarran-Ferguson Act \u201cwas stated quite clearly in its first section; Congress declared that \u2018the continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest.\u2019 59 Stat. 33 (1945), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">Section 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act provides that \u201c[n]o Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance . . . unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance: <em>Provided, </em>That after June 30, 1948, [the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act] shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">Section 2(b) provides a limited antitrust exemption for conduct that is (1) \u201cthe business of insurance,\u201d and (2) \u201cregulated by state law.\u201d <em>Group Life &amp; Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., </em>440 U.S. 205, 219, 99 S.Ct. 1067, 1077, 59 L.Ed.2d 261 (1979).<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">The most obvious reason for rejecting a claim of immunity in this case is the absence of any state law regulating the challenged activity that might be impaired by application of Section 8 of the Clayton Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">The courts have had some difficulty developing standards for determining whether activity is \u201cregulated by State law\u201d for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>purposes of Section 2(b).<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Whatever the test, however, the New York and New Jersey statutes upon which appellees rely clearly do not regulate the interlocking directorates challenged in this case. Nor would application of Section 8 of the Clayton Act to these interlocks \u201cinvalidate, impair, or supersede\u201d these state statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The New York Statute prohibits interlocking directorates between \u201ctwo or more insurers .. . engaged in writing directly the same lines of commerce in insurance\u201d unless such interlocks do not lessen competition or create a monopoly \u201cin the business of insurance.\u201d <footnotemark>86</footnotemark> The New Jersey statute prohibits interlocks between \u201ccompeting insurers\u201d which substantially lessen competition or create a monopoly \u201cin the business of insurance ....\u201d <footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">These statutes are part of the insurance codes of the two states; both deal exclusively with the insurance industry. They purport to regulate interlocking directorates between insurance companies affecting competition in the insurance business. They do not apply to interlocks between insurance companies and banks affecting competition in the extension of mortgage and real estate loans. No action against such interlocks would lie under these state statutes; application of the Clayton Act to such interlocks would in no way impair them. For these reasons alone, the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not bar application of Section 8 of the Clayton Act to the bank and insurance company interlocks involved in this case.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>This conclusion is supported by the general principle that coordinate federal and state authority should be accommodated when possible and the inferior law should be preempted only to the extent necessary to accomplish the purpose of the law that is supreme.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6D\">It also is consistent with the purpose of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The language and legislative history show clearly that Congress intended to create a partial antitrust immunity limited to the insuranee industry.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> To extend immunity under the Act to conduct \u201cinvolvpng] parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>wholly outside the insurance industry,\u201d <em>Group Life &amp; Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., </em>440 U.S. at 231, 99 S.Ct. at 1083, would be contrary to this purpose and inconsistent with the canon requiring strict construction of antitrust exemptions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">This is enough to dispose of appellees\u2019 McCarran-Ferguson claim. We note, however, though we do not decide, that McCarran-Ferguson immunity also may be unavailable for the independent reason that creation of interlocking directorates between banks and insurance companies may not be part of \u201cthe business of insurance\u201d to which alone the statutory exemption applies.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has emphasized that the McCarran-Ferguson exemption is invoked by state regulation of the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d not the \u201cbusiness of insurance companies.\u201d <em>Group Life &amp; Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., </em>440 U.S. at 211, 99 S.Ct. at 1073; <em>SEC v. National Securities, Inc., </em>393 U.S. at 459-60, 89 S.Ct. at 568. \u201cMany aspects of insurance companies are regulated by state law, but are not the \u2018business of insurance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Group Life &amp; Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., </em>440 U.S. at 230 n.38, 99 S.Ct. at 1082 n.38. State statutes trigger antitrust immunity only to the extent they concern \u201cthe contract between the insurer and the insured,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 215, 99 S.Ct. at 1075, or involve \u201cspreading and underwriting of a policyholder\u2019s risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 99 S.Ct. at 1073, <em>see id. </em>at 220-22, 99 S.Ct. at 1077-78. Appellees argue that selection of directors affects the status of insurance companies \u201cas reliable insurers\u201d which ultimately affects the relationship between the insurer and the insured, and is thus the \u201cbusiness of insurance.\u201d <em>See SEC v. National Securities, Inc., </em>393 U.S. at 460, 89 S.Ct. at 568. A similar contention was rejected in <em>Group Life, </em>440 U.S. at 216-17, 99 S.Ct. at 1075-76. But even if the argument were persuasive as applied to interlocking directorates between insurance companies, it would not follow that interlocks between banks and insurance companies, affecting competition in the credit market rather than the market for insurance and the relationship between insurance companies and borrowers rather than their policyholders, would qualify as the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d within the meaning of the statute.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\">.

Representative Mann raised a point of order against the Conference Report arguing that because the House and Senate had not disagreed as to the competing corporations paragraph of Section 8, the conferees were without authority to make substantive changes in the text and therefore had exceeded their authority by agreeing to amend the exclusionary clause to include banks. 31 Cong.Rec. 16270-72. The conferees responded by explaining that the purpose of the insertion was to make it clear that the competing corporations paragraph did not apply to the bank interlocks expressly dealt with in the preceding paragraphs. They argued that the amendment was only technical and worked no substantive change because the statute would have been interpreted in the same way without the insertion. Representative Webb, a House conferee, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">The conference did put in \u201cbanks and banking associations,\u201d in order to make perfectly clear what in my opinion is already clear; because in the preceding paragraph we had passed a section with reference to interlocking directorates of banks, and there we made the limitation $5,000,000. Now, it would be idiotic to say that we included also banks and banking associations in the paragraph referring to industrial corporations; and in order to make the paragraph perfectly plain, we inserted \u201cother than banks and banks [sic] associations,\u201d and common carriers, which had no effect upon the meaning of that section .... [I]f you will read the section preceding [paragraph four], in which we take care of banks and make the limitation $5,000,000, [you] can never conclude, even though the words which [Mr. Mann] excepts to are stricken out, that the interlocking directorates provision with reference to indus-trials was also intended to cover banks, because we have already taken care of banks in a former section or a former paragraph, and we simply put into this section which my friend objects to that which is necessarily implied and expressed in the bill itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 16271.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">Representative Mann was not satisfied. In the only clear reference in the legislative proceedings to the problem presented in this case, he argued that addition of banks to the exclusionary clause was substantive because before the amendment the competing corporations provisions prohibited interlocks between banks and non-banks, and after the amendment it did not. <em>Id. </em>at 16272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">Before the proponents of the bill could respond the Speaker ruled against Representative Mann\u2019s point of order. There was therefore no concession by proponents that the amendment of the exclusionary clause went any further than to exclude from the competing corporations provision the bank interlocks that were the subject matter of the restored provision prohibiting bank interlocks \u2014 that is, interlocks between banks. The Speaker\u2019s ruling appears to have been based upon the premise that this was the amendment\u2019s effect. <em>Id. </em>at 16273.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">In the course of the exchange Representative Sherley indicated that banks might not be within the competing corporations provision because they \u201care not such corporations as \u2018are or shall have been theretofore, by virtue of their business and location of operation, competitors\u2019 with industrial corporations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16271. As noted earlier, however, failure to anticipate that banks might sometimes compete with non-banking corporations does not suggest an affirmative intention to exempt interlocking directorships from a generally phrased prohibition. <em>Cf.

In related context the Federal Trade Commission disposed of the argument based on Section 8A as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">Nor do we ascribe any significance to the brief existence of Section 8A of the Clayton Act, which was added by the Banking Act of 1933, ch. 89, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 33, 48 Stat. 194-95, and then repealed by the Banking Act of 1935, ch. 614, \u00a7 329, 48 Stat. 717-18. Section 8A prohibited director, officer or employee interlocks between banks and corporations (other than mutual savings banks) which made loans \u201csecured by stock or bond collateral.\u201d Although Perpetual contends that the enactment and repeal of Section 8A lead to the conclusion that Congress recognized that the original Section 8 never reached bank/non-bank interlocks, that it enacted Section 8A to bridge that statutory gap, and that the repeal of Section 8A restored the prior situation, again legalizing such interlocks, these conclusions are unwarranted. The enactment and repeal of Section 8A took place against the backdrop of Congressional concern about the diversion of bank funds into speculative securities, reasons wholly removed from the competitive concerns embodied in the policy of Section 8. Since neither the passage nor the repeal of Section 8A expressed any Congressional intent to authorize the type of interlocks presented in this case, they do not affect our holding that such interlocks violate Section 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-15\"><em>In re Perpetual Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, supra, 90 </em>F.T.C. at 656 n.15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b509-17\">. <em>See </em>Parts II &amp; III <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\">. 422 F.Supp. at 702.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\">.

The district court (422 F.Supp. at 690-91) relied upon an introductory paragraph quoted from the Report of the Federal Trade Commission on Interlocking Directorates, H.R. Doc. No. 652, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1950). If the paragraph is considered in the context of the more specific material it introduces, it is not clear whether the authors were stating that interlocks between banks and non-banking corporations are not barred or that vertical interlocks between banks and the corporations with which they do business are not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">The emphasis in the report on vertical bank/non-bank interlocks and the lack of discussion of horizontal interlocks suggests that the reference is only to vertical interlocks. For example, the report states that the \u201cloophole\u201d for vertical interlocks raises problems such as \u201cpreferential access to credit for the industrial corporation,\u201d and a concomitant substantial handicap to other concerns dependent upon that bank for service. <em>Id. </em>at 15; <em>see id. </em>at 25, 27, 36. Although the report documents vertical interlocks between commercial and financial companies in a number of industries, nowhere does it directly address interlocks between . banks and their non-bank competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-18\">The testimony of former FTC Chairman Eng-man reported in <em>Hearings on Corporate Disclosure Before the Subcommittee on Budgeting, Management, and Expenditures and the Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations, Senate Committee on Government Operations, </em>93d Cong., 2d Sess. pt. 2 (1974), also cited by the district court, clearly applies only to vertical interlocks. Mr. Engman addresses the subject of interlocks between \u201cfinancial institutions, particularly commercial banks, [and] commercial corporations\u201d but his testimony on this subject is limited to \u201cvertical interlock[s] between borrower and lender\u201d which might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>establish \u201cpreferential access to credit\u201d and when multiplied, might lead to the \u201crepresentation of competitors on the same bank boards ... [which] may lead to exchanges of information between competitors, collusive activity, and possible communities of interest strong enough to provide a substantial handicap to nonrepresented companies dependent upon those banks for essential services.\" <em>Id. </em>at 901. This testimony has no bearing upon the direct bank/non-bank interlocks between competitors at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">A speech by James Halverson, Director of the Bureau of Competition, cited by appellees, is irrelevant for the same reason. <em>See </em>Halver-son, \u201cInterlocking Directorates \u2014 a Government View,\u201d BNA A.T.R.R.

It might be interpreted, however, as exempting an interlocking directorate between a bank and a competing financial institution even though the latter type of interlocking relationship is not covered by the first part of section 8.

Legislation to exempt the insurance industry completely from the antitrust laws passed the House, but died in the Senate. <em>Group Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., </em>440 U.S. at 218-19, 99 S.Ct. at 1076-77. The legislation that became the McCarran-Ferguson Act was introduced a year later. It rejected total exemption and instead required only that the antitrust laws not be construed to \u201cinvalidate, impair, or supersede\u201d any state law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance. 91 Cong.Rec. 478 (1945); <em>cf. </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012(b) (1976). To the extent that a state regulatory scheme would not be \u201cimpaired,\u201d the federal antitrust laws were to apply. Several Senators thought even this limited exemption too broad, questioning the advisability of permitting states to preempt the antitrust laws. <em>See, e. g., </em>91 Cong. Rec. 481 (1945) (remarks of Sen. Murdock); <em>id. </em>at 483 (remarks of Sen. O\u2019Mahoney). The Senate adopted an amendment proposed by Senator Ferguson excluding the Sherman and Clayton Acts from this section of the Act. As amended, this section provided that \u201cNo Act of Congress, <em>except ... the Sherman Act, and/or ... the Clayton Act, </em>shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede\u201d state law. <em>Id. </em>at 488 (emphasis added). The House rejected the Ferguson Amendment, however, and passed the bill with the original language intact. <em>Id. </em>at 1085, 1093-94. The antitrust proviso was added in Conference as a compromise. As such, it was understood in the Senate, the only house to debate it, as an improvement on the House version of the Act. <em>See id. </em>at 1480-81, 1484 (remarks of Sen. Murdock); <em>id. </em>at 1478, 1485 (remarks of Sen. McCarran); <em>id. </em>at 1488 (remarks of Sen. Barkley). At a minimum, therefore, the federal antitrust laws apply to the extent they do not \u201cinvalidate, impair, or supersede\u201d state law. <em>See </em>Weller, <em>supra </em>note 85, 1978 Duke L.J. 587, 602-07. Senator White stated that \u201cthe force and effect of these Federal statutes may be applicable and shall be applicable to whatever extent the State law fails to occupy the ground and engage in regulation!.]\u201d 91 Cong.Rec. 1444 (1945). He asserted \u2014 and Senator McCarran, one of the Senate Conferees, agreed \u2014 that the antitrust laws would apply \u201cthroughout the whole field beyond the scope of the State\u2019s activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"90\">\n<p id=\"b516-12\">. The statute refers only to the \u201cbusiness of insurance,\u201d thus excluding on its face those activities of insurance companies that are not part of such business. <em>Group Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., </em>440 U.S. at 211, 99 S.Ct. at 1073; <em>SEC v. National Securities, Inc., </em>393 U.S. at 453, 459-60, 89 S.Ct. at 564, 568, 21 L.Ed.2d 668. The Committee reports read solely in these terms. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.No.213, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945); H.R.Rep.No.143, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>[1945] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 670; S.Rep.No.20, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945). There is no suggestion in the legislative debates that Congress intended to protect parties or activities outside this industry; some activities technically part of the \u201cinsurance industry\u201d may not be exempt. <em>See Group Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., </em>440 U.S. at 232 n.39, 99 S.Ct. at 1083 n.39. The bills drafted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and adopted in some states in response to the McCarran-Ferguson Act dealt only with intra-industry problems. <em>See </em>1946 <em>Proceedings of the N. A. I. C. </em>397-421. The \u201clittle Clayton Acts\u201d adopted in many states, including New York and New Jersey, are similarly limited to intra-industry interlocks. <em>See, e.g., </em>notes 86 &amp; 87, <em>supra. </em>That Congress should limit the exemption to the insurance industry is not surprising:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV0\">[T]here is a real danger that state insurance departments not only lack the authority and expertise to regulate other businesses, but that they are also apt to favor their industry at the expense of others. Trade restraints affecting other businesses, for example, might be viewed favorably if they add to the stability and financial security of insurance companies. Nor did Congress at any time intimate that the special needs of insurance transcended the insurance business and must include the ability to restrain trade in other sectors of the economy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">Weller, <em>supra </em>note 85, 1978 Duke L.J. 587, 632.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"91\">\n<p id=\"b517-6\">. There is language in <em>Group Life </em>from which one might infer that a state statute regulating the composition of boards of directors of insurance companies would not relate to the \u201cbusiness of insurance.\u201d 440 U.S. at 230 n.38, 99 S.Ct. at 1082 n.38.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Appellees point to statements in the Senate debate regarding Section 3(a), the moratorium provision <em>(supra </em>note 83), to the effect that the interlocking directorate provision of the Clayton Act would be stayed during the moratorium period to make it possible \u201cto change the interlocking directorate laws of the states.\u201d 91 Cong.Rec. 484 (1945) (remarks of Sen. Ferguson); <em>id. </em>at 483 (remarks of Sen. O\u2019Mahoney). It does not follow from these comments that Congress intended to include interlocking directorates in the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d which states by regulating could exempt from the antitrust acts. The moratorium had several purposes, only one of which was to give states time to regulate activities which otherwise would be regulated by the federal antitrust laws. The moratorium was also intended to afford the states time in which to change those laws that might conflict with federal law in the areas where federal law would still be paramount, and to afford insurance companies time to adjust their activities to conform with federal regulation. <em>See id </em>at 481, 486 (remarks of Sen. Murdock); <em>id </em>at 483, 488 (remarks of Sen. O\u2019Mahoney); <em>id </em>at 1086 (remarks of Rep. Walter). Indeed it was concern for the latter two problems that provided the sole basis for including a moratorium provision in the Senate\u2019s version of the Act, which provided that the Clayton Act would apply to the business of insurance at the end of the moratorium period notwithstanding any inconsistent state regulation. <em>See </em>note 89, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"92\">\n<p id=\"b517-11\">. <em>Cf. SEC v.

This view was rejected in <em>National Securities, </em>where the Supreme Court held that state regulation of aspects of insurance company mergers that effect policyholders is regulation of the business of insurance, though concurrent state regulation of aspects of mergers affecting stockholders is not. <em>Id</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>KENNEDY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A2D\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">I respectfully dissent from that portion of the opinion which holds that section 8 of the Clayton Act does not exempt interlocking directorates between banks and non-banks which are competing entities. The principal reasons for my dissent are well-stated by Chief Judge Peckham in his thorough and persuasive opinion below, 422 F.Supp. 686 (N.D.Cal.1976), and I have little to add to that careful explanation of the statute, an explanation which in my view is entirely correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Chief Judge Browning\u2019s meticulous examination of both the statute and its history demonstrates that the question is a difficult one. My principal objection to the rhetoric of the majority opinion is that the reasonable and plausible arguments of the district court are for the most part labeled bare assertions, while, viewed against the legislative history of this statute, the same epithet could be applied to most of what the majority opinion contains. No doubt, the purpose of the statute is of principal importance in ascertaining the scope of ambiguous terms, but the broad and simple formulation of a purpose to promote competition is insufficient to resolve a case which turns upon words and concepts that are much more precise. The purpose of the statutory exemption obviously was to narrow the range of its coverage. In my view, had Congress intended the exemption to cover only pure bank interlocks, it would have used much different language to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">If, measured by the legislative purpose to promote competition, my interpretation of the exemption can be characterized as a loophole, so be it. The lapse has been well-known to the business community, and there has been widespread reliance on the assumption that the statute does not cover these interlocks. Congress has not changed the statute, although it has considered the problem expressly. Legislative lacunae do not demand judicial correction, even if that correction invokes the broad doctrinal scheme that prompted the legislature to act initially. The judiciary is not a repair shop to streamline statutory structures, especially when what is perceived as an imperfection in the design is in fact the result of compromises which are the very essence of the legislative process. Errors absolutely unforeseen or wholly contrary to the legislative purpose might give the judiciary somewhat freer reign, <em>but cf. TVA v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978), but a question over which there has been as much speculation and warning as this one neither requires nor permits judicial intervention to patch it up. The majority\u2019s strained efforts in its comprehensive opinion serve only to highlight and underscore the existence of a legislative intent to compromise and to narrow the statutory coverage, the very opposite of the premise ascribed to the Congress, a premise which is the sole basis for the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">With these few observations, I file this dissent to parts 1 through 8 of the majority\u2019s opinion. I concur in the reasoning and conclusions of the court in its interpretation of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
