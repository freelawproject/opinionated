In denying Nettles\u2019s petition, the district court accepted a United States Magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation finding Nettle\u2019s claims to be without merit. Because Nettles did not object to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations before they were accepted by the district court, we hold that Nettles waived the right to appeal from the judgment based on the report and recommendations. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-23\">In 1976, a Florida jury convicted Nettles of robbery, aggravated assault, and aggravated battery. The state trial judge sentenced him to seventy-five years imprisonment. A state appeals court affirmed the conviction. <em>Nettles v. State, </em>336 So.2d 614 (Fla.App.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-24\">Nettles then brought a federal habeas corpus petition claiming:</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-25\">(1) Since his arrest was illegal, the pretrial identification should have been suppressed, and</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-26\">(2) He was denied due process of law by the admission at his state trial of inflammatory photographs, and denied due process of law by both pre-trial and in-court identification evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-27\">On April 4, 1980, a United States Magistrate, without holding a hearing, filed his report and recommendations finding Nettles\u2019s contentions to be without merit. Nettles did not object to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations. On April 22, 1980, the district court accepted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations and dismissed Nettles\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-28\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Magistrates Act,</p>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">a judge may ... designate a magistrate to conduct hearings ... and to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition, by a judge of the court, of [motions to suppress evidence in a criminal case]</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-29\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-30\">Within ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. A judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. The judge may also receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">This court, in a direct criminal appeal, has interpreted 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 686(b)(1)(B) to mean that failure to object to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations prior to the district court\u2019s acceptance of such constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal the recommendations \u201ccontained in the report.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>621 F.2d 1382 (5th Cir. 1980). There, following the lead of the Second Circuit, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-6\">Jackson did not object to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations on the suppression motions. His failure to object is a waiver of his right to appeal the recommendations contained in the report. The Second Circuit recently reached the same conclusion. <em>John B. Hull, Inc. v. Waterbury Petroleum Prod., Inc., </em>588 F.2d 24 (2nd Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 960, 99 S.Ct. 1502, 59 L.Ed.2d 773 (1979). Jackson\u2019s appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\"><em>Lewis </em>at 1386.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">We read <em>Lewis </em>to mean that where a party does not object to a recommendation contained in a magistrate\u2019s report within the time allowed, and the recommendation is accepted by the district court, the party will be held to have waived the right to appeal that ruling. This is true even where the ruling is only implicitly reflected in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">The Sixth Circuit has also reached a similar conclusion. In <em>United States v. Walters, </em>638 F.2d 947 (6th Cir. 1981), the court established a prospective rule that failure to object timely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) to a magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations constitutes a waiver of a right to appeal the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation. In so doing, the Sixth Circuit reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-10\">The permissive language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 suggests that a party\u2019s failure to file objections is not a waiver of appellate review. However, the fundamental congressional policy underlying the Magistrate\u2019s Act \u2014 to improve access to the federal courts and aid the efficient administration of justice \u2014 is best served by our holding that a party shall file objections with the district court or else waive right to appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\"><em>Walters </em>at 949-50 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Magistrate\u2019s Act, the parties to an action are expected to \u201cserve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations\u201d with which there is disagreement \u201cas provided by rules of court.\u201d It is reasonable to place upon the parties the duty to pinpoint those portions of the magistrate\u2019s report that the court must specially consider. Although the statute calls for \u201ca de novo determination\u201d by the judge, such a determination need only be made as to the \u201cportions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations <em>to which objection is made.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-13\">Our holding in no way diminishes the duty of the judge to review the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations carefully and completely to determine whether to accept, reject, or modify them. Our holding of waiver applies only where the judge accepts the report and recommendations without objection from a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-14\">Even if we were inclined to hold that failure to object to a magistrate\u2019s report did not constitute a waiver, the <em>Lewis </em>case, by a prior panel, forecloses such a holding. Any further consideration of this issue must be by the en banc court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-15\">Accordingly, Nettles\u2019s failure to object to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations serves as a waiver of his right to appeal the recommendations accepted by the judge. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Nettles\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-18\">Before GODBOLD, Chief Judge, RO-NEY, TJOFLAT, HILL, FAY, VANCE, KRAVITCH, FRANK M.
