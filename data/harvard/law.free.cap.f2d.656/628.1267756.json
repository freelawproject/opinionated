There is no genuine issue of material fact. We hold in defendant\u2019s favor after hearing oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">Prior to November 1974, the plaintiffs, Michael L. Garbacz, Earl W. Glahn, and Jules Lehmann, were all serving in the grade of GS-16 in the competitive Civil Service with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). By separate letters dated October 29, 1974, plaintiffs were informed that certain NASA executive-level positions, including theirs, had been reviewed. The letters also indicated the consequences of that review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-14\">* * * As a result of this review, it has been determined that the position you occupy * * * will be converted with no change in title or salary to a NASA excepted position under section 203(b)(2) of the NASA Act of 1958 as Amended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-15\">You are serving in a position in the Competitive Service and acceptance of the above conversion will not result in your leaving the Competitive Service. This means that the Civil Service Act and other laws applying to Competitive Service positions will apply to you during your service in this excepted position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1R\">Section 203(b)(2) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2473(b)(2) (1970), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-16\">(b) In the performance of its functions the Administration is authorized\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-i\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-18\">(2) to appoint and fix the compensation of such officers and employees as may be necessary to carry out such functions. Such officers and employees shall be appointed in accordance with the civil-service laws and their compensation fixed in accordance with chapter 51 and subchap-ter III of chapter 53 of Title 5, <em>except that (A) to the extent the Administrator deems such action necessary to the discharge of his responsibilities, he may appoint not more than four hundred and twenty-five of the scientific, engineering, and administrative personnel of the Administration without regard to such laws, and may fix the compensation of such personnel not in excess of the highest </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number><em>rate of grade 18 of the General Schedule, </em>and (B) to the extent the Administrator deems such action necessary to recruit specially qualified scientific and engineering talent, he may establish the entrance grade for scientific and engineering personnel without previous service in the Federal Government at a level up to two grades higher than the grade provided for such personnel under the General Schedule, and fix their compensation accordingly[.] [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">By Standard Form 50, Notification of Personnel Action, plaintiffs received confirmation shortly thereafter of the action. The Notification of Personnel Action indicated the nature of the action was a \u201cPay System Change.\u201d That change removed plaintiffs from the General Schedule (GS), a standard salary schedule under which jobs of comparable responsibility throughout the Government are paid an identical rate, and placed the plaintiffs instead in the NASA excepted pay category, in which salaries are determined administratively by the agency after a job-by-job analysis. The Notification of Personnel Action also indicated as had the earlier letters that each plaintiff would \u201cremain in the competitive service as long as [he occupied the] position\u201d and that the authority for the system change was 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2473(b)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Thus, under the letters and notices sent to the plaintiffs, NASA informed each of them that the only action which was being taken was to remove each of the plaintiffs from the General Schedule and, instead, place the employees in a system where NASA determined the salaries administratively. The maximum salary which the Administrator could so determine was limited to the pay ceiling applicable to GS employees. Nothing in the 1974 letters or notices apprising plaintiffs of the pay system change (or anything else in this record) purports to remove plaintiffs from the competitive Civil Service. The letters and notices in fact disclaim such a result. We thus take the 1974 action to have only the limited effect of altering the manner in which plaintiffs\u2019 salaries were determined. Indeed, we do not understand plaintiffs to argue the contrary, <em>i. e., </em>that the 1974 personnel action removed them from the competitive service.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Subsequent to, and independent of this 1974 change in the method by which plaintiffs\u2019 pay was determined, the NASA Administrator in February 1977 increased plaintiffs\u2019 salaries. Previously, following October 1975 and October 1976 determinations, plaintiffs\u2019 pay had also been increased. The 1975 and 1976 determinations maintained plaintiffs\u2019 salaries at a rate equal to the pay ceiling for GS employees. The 1977 determination, while increasing plaintiffs\u2019 salaries, did not raise plaintiffs\u2019 pay to the then applicable GS pay ceiling. It is this failure to pay plaintiffs the highest salary within the Administrator\u2019s discretion of which plaintiffs complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Thereafter, plaintiffs filed appeals with the Federal Employees Appeals Authority (FEAA), alleging the 1977 pay raises in fact constituted a demotion when considered with plaintiffs\u2019 salaries prior to the 1974 pay system change. The FEAA dismissed each appeal in October 1977 as untimely and alternatively concluded that the 1977 salary determinations were not subject to FEAA review. Further discretionary review was declined in 1979 by a successor of the Appeals Review Board. Eventually, the action in this court was filed. In it, plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>tiffs seek back pay from the date they first were not paid the highest salary within the Administrator\u2019s discretion. These cross motions followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"> As an initial matter, the Government seeks to bar this action for an alleged failure by plaintiffs to timely pursue their administrative remedy, appeal to the FEAA. It is well settled, of course, that such remedies must be exhausted before approaching the court with a civilian pay claim. <em>E. g., Bur v. United States, </em>224 Ct.Cl. -, -, 621 F.2d 415, 417 (1980); <em>Adler v. United States, </em>134 Ct.Cl. 200, 203, 146 F.Supp. 956, 958, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Baker v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 894, 77 S.Ct. 131, 1 L.Ed.2d 87 (1956). We have recognized, however, an exception to this rule when a case presents \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d which excuse the non-resort to administrative relief. <em>E. g., Gentry v. United States, </em>212 Ct.Cl. 1, 11, 546 F.2d 343, 348 (1976); <em>Shubinsky v. United States, </em>203 Ct.Cl. 199, 203-204, 488 F.2d 1003, 1006 (1973). In <em>Shubinsky, </em>for example, the employing agency had told the employee, Shu-binsky, that the agency was to be \u201cliquidated\u201d and that accordingly he would be terminated without an opportunity to displace or \u201cbump\u201d fellow employees with a lower preference who were transferred to other agencies. In fact, the agency had been \u201creorganized\u201d and plaintiff should have been accorded bumping rights. Shubinsky learned of the agency\u2019s mischaracterization after the period expired for appeal to the Civil Service Commission. When presented with the controversy, the Commission dismissed the matter as time barred. In an action here, the Government contended Shubinsky\u2019s suit could not lie as administrative remedies had not been properly sought. This court rejected that argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">Plaintiff reasonably relied on the administrative misrepresentation that NASL had been \u201cliquidated\u201d and, consequently, that plaintiff\u2019s VPA rights were lost to him. He acted with adequate promptness to perfect his appeal upon learning that the agency had instead been \u201creorganized\u201d and VPA rights might still be available to him. Under such \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d he cannot be kept out of court for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Ainsworth v. United States, supra </em>[180 Ct.Cl. 166]. [203 Ct.Cl. at 204, 488 F.2d at 1006.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aez-dedup-0\">We think similar logic is applicable here. The present plaintiffs were told by the agency that the 1974 personnel action was of a certain character, <em>i. e., </em>a pay system change. From that agency representation, plaintiffs concluded that no appeal would lie so that whatever appeal rights plaintiffs might have had in 1974 (an issue we discuss <em>infra) </em>were lost. Thus, the NASA representations involved herein are little different in effect from the agency representations in <em>Shubinsky. </em>As in <em>Shubinsky, </em>we today conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 action should not be dismissed for a failure to timely exhaust any administrative relief these plaintiffs might have had in 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">On the merits, plaintiffs allege the 1974 pay system change constitutes, under applicable regulations, an adverse action when viewed in light of the 1977 pay determination. As plaintiffs were not informed in detail of the adverse action or otherwise afforded the procedures specified in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.202 (1974)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for adverse actions, the argument goes, the 1974 personnel action was improper and gives rise to a suit for back pay under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596 (1976 and Supp. Ill 1979). Of the personnel actions specified as adverse in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.201(b), only 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.-201(b)(4), \u201cReduction in rank or pay,\u201d is arguably applicable. Plaintiffs point to both 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.102(b)(4)(ii) and Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supplement Part 752-1 \u00a7 Sl-5(b)(5) (February 4, 1972) in support of their analysis that a pay system change is a reduction in either rank or pay. Neither provision, however, supports plaintiffs\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The first of those sections, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.102(b)(4), defines demotion. Plaintiffs apparently allege that term is equivalent to a \u201creduction in rank,\u201d and we assume for purposes of argument the terms\u2019 equivalence. The relevant portion of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.102(b)(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">(4) \u201cDemotion\u201d means a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">j{; sfc is * Jfc *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">(ii) <em>To </em>a <em>position with </em>a <em>lower rate of pay when both the old and the new positions </em>are under the same type ungraded wage schedule, or <em>are in different pay method categories. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8d\">The critical language requires an employee be changed to a position <em>with a lower rate of pay </em>in a different pay method category. Thus, for a personnel action to constitute a demotion, an employee must show not only that the method of pay determination has been altered but also that the new position <em>at the time of personnel action and without reference to anticipated future developments </em>has a lower rate of pay than the employee\u2019s former position. To read this regulation otherwise is to ignore the phrase \u201cwith a lower rate of pay\u201d which modifies \u201c[t]o a [new] position.\u201d Thus, and not surprisingly, FPM Supplement Part 752-1 \u00a7 Sl-4c(ll) (February 4, 1972), provides that a \u201cchange in pay method only\u201d is not a reduction in rank. As we recently wrote in <em>Triponi v. United States, </em>224 Ct.Cl. -, -n.1, 633 F.2d 933, 935 n.1 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">Plaintiff raised this issue of reduction in rank in his petition, but has not pressed it in his argument. We agree with defendant that there was no reduction in rank as a result of plaintiff\u2019s reassignment. Plaintiff\u2019s salary and grade remained the same before and after the reassignment, and this is the overriding criterion in determining comparability of positions in a reassignment. <em>Comberiate v. United States, </em>203 Ct.Cl. 285, 289 (1973). * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">Reading 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.102(b)(4) in this manner comports with more general notions that an employee is <em>entitled </em>only to the pay of the position to which he has actually been appointed and not that based on a hypothetical or anticipated appointment.. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 402, 406, 96 S.Ct. 948, 955, 957, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976); <em>United States v. McLean, </em>95 U.S. 750, 753, 24 L.Ed. 579 (1877); <em>Ganse v. United States, </em>180 Ct.Cl. 183, 186, 376 F.2d 900, 902 (1967); <em>Bielec v. United States, </em>197 Ct.Cl. 550, 456 F.2d 690, 696 (1972). The 1974 pay system change did not reduce plaintiff in rank within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.201(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">Plaintiffs also argue that under FPM Supplement Part 752-1 \u00a7 Sl-5(b)(5), <em>supra, </em>the 1974 pay system change was a reduction in pay, even though the rate of pay fixed for plaintiffs\u2019 positions was not then altered. That regulation provides examples of reduction in pay, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-14\">(5) Reassignment of a wage system employee to a new locality with a lower regular wage schedule. When the employee is entitled to salary retention, there may be no immediate loss of pay. However, the action which places him in a new locality with a lower regular wage schedule is a reduction in pay under part 752.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">Plaintiffs seek to draw an analogy between the reassignment described in FPM Supplement Part 752-1 \u00a7 Sl-5(b)(5), <em>supra, </em>and the 1974 pay system change in that both concern situations where no immediate loss of pay occurs subsequent to the personnel action. As defendant points out, however, there is a fundamental distinction between a personnel action which is <em>certain </em>to accomplish a reduction in pay, as where an employee becomes subject to a lower regular wage scale even though the effect of the reduction is postponed through a temporary wage retention, and the situation here, where no such certain reduction was to occur in 1974 or at any other time. Plaintiffs were to be paid at the same rate before and after the system change, and absent a further independent personnel action, that rate would continue and could not be lowered. The plaintiffs can simply not show their rate of pay was altered down<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>ward as the natural and direct consequence of the 1974 pay system change itself. At best, plaintiffs can only argue the 1974 action reduced their <em>potential </em>for future salary increases. Equating that loss of potential, however, with a reduction in pay hardly squares with our <em>Triponi </em>comments, <em>supra, </em>or the more general notion we have already discussed, <em>i. e., </em>entitlement only to the pay of the position actually held. Nor does it square with the definition for a related term, \u201crate of basic pay,\u201d provided elsewhere in the regulations. That term, when used in Part 531 of the C.F.R., title \u201cPay Under the General Schedule,\u201d refers to \u201cthe rate of pay <em>fixed </em>by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee * * *\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 531.202(i), 531.302(b), and 531.-402(f). It does not, presumably, extend to rates of pay which might be fixed in the future. In light of these considerations and our discussion, <em>supra, </em>regarding reductions in rank, it follows, we think, that a reduction in pay occurs only when there is an ascertainable lowering, at the time of the personnel action, of the employee\u2019s present or future pay. A reduction in pay does not occur where, as here, a pay system change alters only the method for setting the employee\u2019s salary and the employee will be paid (barring a further and unrelated personnel action) at the same rate after the system change as before. We so hold. The 1974 pay system change was neither a reduction in rank nor a reduction in pay and thus was not an adverse action. Accordingly, defendant was not required to effect the system change under the adverse action procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Plaintiffs suggest a further argument, however, as to why they are entitled to back pay. Regardless of whether the 1974 pay system change was an adverse action, plaintiffs say, NASA did not provide detailed notices or obtain plaintiffs\u2019 written consents prior to the change. Detailed notice and written consent are purportedly required by FPM 302(2-10) (June 22, 1965) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-10\">2-10. CHANGE FROM COMPETITIVE TO EXCEPTED APPOINTMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">When an employee proposed for appointment to a position in the excepted service or for noncareer executive assignment is serving under a nontemporary appointment in the competitive service, the agency may not make the excepted appointment or noncareer executive assignment or conversions thereto until the employee has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-12\">(1) Been informed that because the position is in the excepted service it may not be filled by competitive appointment, and that his acceptance of the proposed appointment will take him out of the competitive service while he occupies the position; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-13\">(2) Submitted a written statement to the effect that he understands he is leaving the competitive service voluntarily to accept an appointment in the excepted service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">Plaintiffs cite <em>Bridges v. Wixon, </em>326 U.S. 135, 153, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 1452, 89 L.Ed. 2103 (1945), <em>Chapman v. Sheridan-Wyoming Co., </em>338 U.S. 621, 629, 70 S.Ct. 392, 396, 94 L.Ed. 393 (1950), and <em>Bilokumsky v. Tod, </em>263 U.S. 149, 155, 44 S.Ct. 54, 56, 68 L.Ed. 221 (1923), to show properly issued regulations bind the defendant and might well have cited what appears to be a leading case for that proposition as applied to employment regulations, <em>Service </em>v. <em>Dulles, </em>354 U.S. 363, 382-389, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1162-1165,1 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1957). Plaintiffs, however, cite no authority which holds the FPM provisions, as issued by the Office of Personnel Management or its predecessors, to be binding upon other agencies in the same manner formal regulations duly published in the Federal Register or informal regulations properly issued by the individual agencies would be. As we have remarked before, this question remains open to the most serious doubt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>Jankowitz v. United States, </em>209 Ct.Cl. 489, 496-497 &amp; n.3, 533 F.2d 538, 542-543 &amp; n.3 (1976); <em>Piccone v. United States, </em>186 Ct.Cl. 752, 762 n.12, 407 F.2d 866, 871-872 n.12 (1969). We need not, however, decide whether FPM 302(2-10), <em>supra, </em>is a regulation binding upon NASA in the sense understood by the Supreme Court in <em>Service v. Dulles, supra. </em>As we read FPM 302(2-10), <em>supra, </em>that provision applies to situations in which an employee in the competitive service is appointed to a position in the excepted service so that \u201chis acceptance of the proposed appointment will take him out of the competitive service while he occupies the position.\u201d FPM 302(2-10), <em>supra, </em>does not purport to reach the situation here, where the employee is to remain in the competitive service. Whatever else may be said of the inartful language used to apprise plaintiffs of the then impending 1974 pay system change, the notices are clear that plaintiffs would remain in the competitive service. That the continuation of plaintiffs in the competitive service was the correct result notwithstanding the NASA Administrator\u2019s use of the discretionary authority provided by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2743(b)(2) to alter the method by which plaintiffs\u2019 pay was determined is confirmed by FPM 302(l-l)a(2)(b) (August 12, 1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">(b) When a personnel action continues an employee who is in the competitive service and has competitive status in substantially the same assignment but with a change in grade or series of the job occasioned by reorganization or classification action, a <em>vacancy </em>does not exist for all practical purposes, and both the employee and the successor position are retained in the competitive service during the employee\u2019s incumbency. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Of similar ilk are FPM 212(4-2)a(l) and (4) (1963). Those sections provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">4-2. EFFECT OF INCUMBENT ON POSITION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-12\">a. A position listed under Schedule A, B, or C is in the excepted service when held by an employee with competitive status except that under the following circumstances positions listed in the schedules remain in the competitive service as long as they are held by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-13\">(1) Employees with competitive status under nontemporary appointments at the time their positions are first listed under Schedule A, B, or C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-14\">(4) Employees with competitive status under nontemporary appointments in positions which are successors to positions in which the employees served with competitive status under nontemporary appointments, although the grade or classification series of the positions may have been changed by classification or reorganization. (In these cases, there have been no vacancies to iill by excepted appointments, and the employees remain in practically the same positions. Thus, the employees and the successor positions are in the competitive service.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">Although we leave to another day the exact scope of FPM 302(2-10), <em>supra, </em>we hold that provision has no application to personnel actions such as the 1974 pay system change which do not move an employee from the competitive service to the excepted service. Thus, irrespective of whether provisions of the Federal Personnel Manual alone create entitlement in civilian pay cases, these plaintiffs have no claim based on FPM 302(2-10), <em>supra, </em>for back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-16\">Plaintiffs further contend the 1977 pay determination was beyond the Administrator\u2019s discretion and hence subject to our review. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that the Administrator, by \u201cpromising\u201d in the notices of the 1974 pay system change that plaintiffs\u2019 salaries would not be reduced, waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>any future discretion to set plaintiffs\u2019 salaries at other than the maximum GS level. Leaving aside the dearth of literal language in the notices to support this result, and assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the NASA Administrator could so limit his own and his successors\u2019 discretion, plaintiffs\u2019 argument must nonetheless fail. Subsequent to the 1974 pay system change, plaintiffs clearly remained in the competitive Civil Service and thus remained entitled to the protections that status affords, such as required adverse action procedures and the so-called \u201cbumping rights\u201d in case of a reduction in force. <em>Compare </em>this status with the holding in <em>Batchelor v. United States, </em>169 Ct.Cl. 180, 182-184, <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 870, 86 S.Ct. 147, 15 L.Ed.2d 109 (1965) (dismissals of excepted service employees generally are unreviewable). If these employees retained the right, as their reading supposes, to a GS-set salary as well, the 1974 personnel action becomes meaningless for plaintiffs would be in exactly the same position before and after that action. While plaintiffs might now wish that result, we decline to reduce <em>ad absurdum </em>the 1974 action. As we conclude the NASA Administrator retained the discretion to set these plaintiffs\u2019 salaries, it follows that we are without jurisdiction to review the 1977 salary determination. Salary determinations wholly within an agency\u2019s discretion are beyond the scope of the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (1976). <em>See Adair v. United States, </em>648 F.2d 1318 (at page 1322-1323). <em>See generally Shull v. United States, </em>Ct.Cl. No. 16-78 (order entered July 10, 1981, at 7-8), and cases cited thereat.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the 1974 pay system change was not an adverse action and that these plaintiffs were therefore not entitled to the procedures required by 5 CFR \u00a7 752.202. We also conclude that FPM 302(2-10), <em>supra, </em>is inapplicable to personnel actions which retain an employee in the competitive Civil Service. Thus, the NASA Administrator was not required to secure prior written approval from plaintiffs or to provide them the detailed notice specified in that FPM provision. Further, we conclude that as the NASA Administrator had full discretion under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2743(b)(2) to set plaintiffs\u2019 salaries after the 1974 pay system change, plaintiffs have no claim in this court based on the 1977 pay determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment should be and is hereby granted.

The administrative record suggests that NASA and the Civil Service Commission have consistently interpreted 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2473(b)(2)(A) as allowing that agency to exempt employees, up to the numerical limits specified in the statute, from either the benefits of the Civil Service Act, formerly 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101 <em>et seq. </em>(relating to benefits of the competitive service) or the Classification Act of 1949, formerly 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5105 <em>et seq. </em>(relating to classification of positions for pay purposes) or both. These interpretations, of course, are entitled to considerable deference. <em>E. g., Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, </em>395 U.S. 367, 381 &amp; n.9, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1801 &amp; n.9, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969), and cases cited thereat.
