PECK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">The issue on appeal is whether the trial court correctly ruled that no reasonable settlement offer had been made to appellee Allstate. Having so ruled, the trial judge entered a judgment notwithstanding a jury verdict finding Allstate pable for bad faith in refusing to settle a claim against one of Allstate\u2019s insureds. Barbara Allen appeals from this JNOV. Diverse citizenship is the basis of federal jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332; California substantive law controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">The following facts are not materially disputed. On April 14, 1970, Gregg Allen, the appellant\u2019s husband, suffered grave injuries in an auto accident while a passenger in a car driven by Calvert Taylor, Allstate\u2019s insured. Six months after this accident, Gregg Allen died as the result of his injuries, and Barbara Allen brought a wrongful death action in state court. Plaintiff Allen named as a codefendant Everett Taylor, Calvert Taylor\u2019s father and employer; Allen alleged that Calvert Taylor was acting in the course and scope of his employment, and that Everett Taylor was thus vicariously liable for his employee\u2019s negligence. During the trial of the wrongful death action, Everett Taylor\u2019s insurer, Great American, settled the suit against Everett for $100,000. The action against Calvert Taylor proceeded to a judgment of $550,000 against Calvert Taylor personally. Allstate then paid its policy limit of $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-17\">Prior to this state trial, Allstate had not responded to a letter from Allen\u2019s attorney offering to settle Allen\u2019s wrongful death action against Calvert Taylor for $100,000. After Calvert\u2019s personal liability had been established, he assigned to Barbara Allen his rights against Allstate, and Allen filed the present action alleging bad faith in Allstate\u2019s handling of her claim against Calvert Taylor. Trial of this action, as noted, culminated in the grant of a JNOV to Allstate, from which Allen now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-18\">Appellate review of a JNOV is, of course, severe. The present JNOV may stand only if the evidence and its inferences, viewed in the light most favorable to Allen, can support only the conclusion that Allstate was legally entitled to a favorable judgment. <em>See, e. g., Davison v. Pacific Inland Navigation Co., Inc., </em>569 F.2d 507, 509 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b550-20\">Under California law, an insurer\u2019s \u201cbad faith\u201d in the handling of a claim against an insured is actionable as a breach of an \u201cimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing\u201d between insurer and insured. <em>Crisci </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>66 Cal.2d 425, 430, 58 Cal.Rptr. 13, 16-17, 426 P.2d 173, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>176-177 (1967). What is \u201cgood faith\u201d or \u201cbad faith\u201d on an insurer\u2019s part has not yet proved susceptible to pat legal definition. An insurer\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d is essentially a matter of fact. <em>See Kinder v. Western Pioneer Ins. Co., </em>231 Cal.App.2d 894, 900, 42 Cal.Rptr. 394, 397 (1965), and cases cited there. Thus, due deference must be granted to the trier-of-fact in this case \u2014 the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The legal background of the \u201cbad faith\u201d picture in California is broadly painted. When there is considerable risk of substantial recovery beyond an insured\u2019s policy limits, a conflict of interest arises between insurer and insured: although settlement within policy limits will always be in the insured\u2019s interest, the insurer, whose potential liability is fixed by the policy, may have little to lose by going to trial on the issue of liability, even if an opportunity to settle within policy limits exists. <em>Crisci, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d at 432-433, 58 Cal.Rptr. at 17-18, 426 P.2d at 177-178. Therefore, when an insurer undertakes its insured\u2019s defense, a \u201cduty to settle is implied in law to protect the insured from exposure to liability in excess of coverage as a result of the insurer\u2019s gamble \u2014 on which only the insured might lose.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>17 Cal.3d 937, 941, 132 Cal.Rptr. 424, 426, 553 P.2d 584, 586 (1976). This duty is breached when an insurer, in trying to resolve a conflict of interest, gives less consideration to its insured\u2019s financial interests than to its own. <em>Crisci, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d at 432-433, 58 Cal.Rptr. at 18, 426 P.2d at 178; <em>Merritt v. Reserve Ins. Co., </em>34 Cal.App.3d 858, 873, 110 Cal.Rptr. 511, 521 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">California courts look to the following criteria in deciding whether an insurer has struck an improper balance of its own and its insured\u2019s interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">the strength of the injured claimant\u2019s case on the issues of liability and damages; attempts by the insurer to induce the insured to contribute to a settlement; failure of the insured to properly investigate the circumstances so as to ascertain the evidence against the insured; the insurer\u2019s rejection of advice of its own attorney or agent; failure of the insurer to inform the insured of a compromise offer; the amount of financial risk to which each party is exposed in the event of a refusal to settle; the fault of the insured in inducing the insurer\u2019s rejection of the compromise offer by misleading it as to the facts; and any other factors tending to establish or negate bad faith on the part of the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\"><em>Merritt, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.3d at 876, 110 Cal.Rptr. at 523 (quoting <em>Brown v. Guarantee Ins. Co., </em>155 Cal.App.2d 679, 689, 319 P.2d 69 (1957) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">In the present case, trial testimony showed that Allstate\u2019s district manager had estimated that Allstate\u2019s chances of losing a trial of Allen\u2019s wrongful death action were between 40% and 60%, and that a judgment of $500,000, or five times Allstate\u2019s policy limit, might be entered against Calvert Taylor if Allen won in court. Allstate nevertheless chose to rely on its attorney\u2019s assertion that Allstate\u2019s case was a \u201c100% winner.\u201d The attorney\u2019s prediction was based on his belief that Gregg Allen had assumed the risk of injury by riding with an intoxicated driver \u2014 Calvert Taylor. Calvert Taylor had, however, denied being intoxicated, and his wife had told Allstate that Calvert did not look or act drunk on the night of the accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In these circumstances, a jury would be permitted to find that Allstate\u2019s reliance on the advice of its attorney was the result of wishful thinking rather than a good faith balancing of its own and its insured\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">Correspondence between Allstate and its attorney showed the attorney believed that because Allen\u2019s wrongful death action had been bifurcated into separate liability and damage stages, Allstate could postpone any settlement until its insured\u2019s personal liability had been established and could still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>evade liability for bad faith in handling Allen\u2019s claim. The belief could only rest on the assumption that Allen, as a victorious plaintiff, would be as willing to settle within Allstate\u2019s policy limits as she was when but a hopeful one. Given Allen\u2019s obvious and extensive losses, only slight reflection on Allstate\u2019s part would have been needed for Allstate to realize that its own (and its insured\u2019s) negotiating strength would be weakened if not destroyed if the liability stage of the wrongful death action were lost. There was a sufficient basis for the jury to conclude that Allstate had been far more solicitous of its own financial interests than of its insured\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The trial judge, in granting the JNOV, relied on two opinions of the California Court of Appeals. The first, <em>Merritt, supra, </em>was cited for the proposition that \u201can unconditional offer to settle is required in order to find bad faith liability.\u201d <em>Merritt, </em>however, does not mention \u201cunconditional\u201d settlement offers but rather states that no occasion for an insurer\u2019s bad faith arises until a conflict of interests develops between insurer and insured. No such conflict arose in <em>Merritt </em>because no party \u201cever advance[d] any suggestion that settlement could be profitably discussed.\u201d 34 Cal. App.3d at 877, 110 Cal.Rptr. at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The trial judge apparently believed that Allen\u2019s offer of settlement, contained in a letter of July 8, 1971, did not meet the supposed requirements of <em>Merritt </em>because no mention was made of resolution of a possible workers\u2019 compensation claim by Allen\u2019s employer. The district court supported this conclusion by citation of <em>Coe v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>66 Cal. App.3d 981, 136 Cal.Rptr. 331 (1977). <em>Coe </em>noted that under the California Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 3859, 3860 (West 1971), if workers\u2019 compensation benefits have been paid, no settlement of an injured employee\u2019s claim is valid without notice to, and the consent of, the claimant\u2019s employer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Coe </em>reversed a judgment holding an insurer liable for bad faith in failing to accept a settlement offer that contained no mention of disposition of workers\u2019 compensation claims. The settlement offer made by Allen\u2019s attorney in this case likewise contained no such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">There is, however, a significant factual distinction between <em>Coe </em>and Allen\u2019s case: in <em>Coe, </em>the insurer\u2019s response to a settlement offer noted that the offer was silent concerning release of workers\u2019 compensation claims. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not offer any assurance on the subject. See 66 Cal.App.3d at 993, 136 Cal.Rptr. at 337. Here, Allstate did not respond to Allen\u2019s offer by pointing out any deficiency in the offer\u2019s scope; rather, Allstate ignored the offer, and the evidence supports the conclusion that Allstate chose to do so as a calculated gamble on which only its insured could lose.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">As we read it, <em>Coe </em>does not require claimants against insureds to begin settlement overtures with letter-perfect offers to which insurers need only respond \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d An insurer\u2019s duty of good faith would be trifling if it did not require an insurer to explore the details of a settlement offer that could prove extremely beneficial to its insured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">None of the other arguments raised by Allstate \u2014 arguments not addressed by the trial judge in his memorandum opinion\u2014 supports a JNOY for Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>The judgment is reversed. The cause is remanded and the district court is directed to enter judgment on the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Costs to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">ON REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Upon consideration of appellant Allen\u2019s petition for rehearing, it is ordered that this court\u2019s mandate be amended to require post-judgment interest from February 16, 1978. Such interest is allowable under California law. <em>See Big Bear Properties, Inc. v. Gherman, </em>95 Cal.App.3d 908, 157 Cal.Rptr. 443, 446-47 (1979).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">. A test of Calvert Taylor\u2019s blood alcohol level after the accident yielded a figure of .12. This was the basis for a police estimate of a blood alcohol level of .18 at the time of the accident. Allen produced evidence at trial to show that the extrapolation technique used by the police was flawed, and yielded an exaggerated level for the time of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\">. In 1971, these sections were amended to allow a separate settlement by the injured employee, subject to the employer\u2019s compensation rights. See Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7\u00a7 3859, 3860 (West Supp. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\">. On this point, the testimony of Allstate\u2019s attorney is revealing: he stated that he didn\u2019t ask Allen\u2019s attorney about reimbursement of the workers\u2019 compensation carrier after Allen\u2019s offer was made because he didn\u2019t want \u201cto stir up another claim\u201d against Allstate\u2019s insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">After Allstate lost the liability half of the wrongful death action, Allstate\u2019s attorney offered Allen $100,000. in settlement of the action. No mention was made of the workers\u2019 compensation claim, which, in Allstate\u2019s attorney\u2019s words, was a matter of \u201cdetail\u201d that was not discussed because of Allen\u2019s refusal of Allstate\u2019s offer.
