CLARK, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1229-29\">The appellant, Eliza M. Woodson, sought survivors insurance benefit payments as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>widow of Rushell Woodson pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 402 <em>et seq. </em>The Secretary of Health and Human Services denied the application, and the district court, 455 F.Supp. 457, affirmed that decision. Because of a mistake made by the Secretary in a determination in another proceeding that a stepchild of Rushell Woodson was entitled to benefits, and because of a misinterpretation of the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Plaintiff is seeking widow\u2019s benefits by virtue of her marriage to Rushell Woodson, who had three ceremonial marriages in his lifetime. His first marriage, to Mary Lou Woodson, ended with her death on November 17, 1955. Rushell Woodson then married Ethel Hurd in 1957. The couple apparently separated sometime before 1960, but the marriage never was terminated by divorce. Rushell Woodson began living with plaintiff Eliza Woodson in 1962, and they were married on March 30, 1966. Rushell Woodson died on May 25, 1970. As his widow, Eliza Woodson applied in June 1970 for a lump sum death payment on his wage earner\u2019s Social Security account, and that payment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">In January 1971, Ethel Hurd, the second wife, applied for mother\u2019s insurance benefits on Rushell Woodson\u2019s Social Security account as the mother of a child named Diane Woodson, who was born on November 16, 1954, approximately two and one-half years before Ethel and Woodson were married and at a time when Ethel was married to Clarence Hurd and Rushell was married to Mary Lou. The mother\u2019s insurance benefits for the child were paid for five months retroactively and then were terminated because Ethel had remarried. But for the payment of the benefits for the child for five months to Ethel, Eliza, the plaintiff, unquestionably would be entitled to a widow\u2019s benefit as the \u201cdeemed\u201d widow of Rushell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment turned on this payment of mother\u2019s benefits. The following excerpts from the court\u2019s memorandum opinion reflect that court\u2019s thinking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-7\">Ethel Hurd had applied for and received mother\u2019s benefits (although the child was not Woodson\u2019s) for five months on Wood-son\u2019s Social Security account. The applicable Social Security statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B), provides that a putative spouse may receive benefits unless the legal wife \u201cis or has been entitled\u201d to benefits. Here, Ethel Hurd was entitled to and received benefits on Woodson\u2019s account for five months, until her remarriage to another man ended her eligibility. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(g)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-8\">He * * # * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-9\">It is true that in this case there will be no \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d into Woodson\u2019s account by a legal and putative spouse simultaneously. In fact, there will be no dipping at all, as neither the plaintiff nor Ethel Hurd will be entitled to benefits. Nevertheless, Ethel Hurd received benefits on Woodson\u2019s account for five months. Her remarriage cut her off from such benefits. If she had not remarried, Ethel Hurd could still be receiving benefits on Woodson\u2019s account, and plaintiff would have no basis for her claim. Although the equities seem to favor the plaintiff, in that Ethel Hurd only received five months of benefits for a child that was not Woodson\u2019s, and plaintiff was Wood-son\u2019s companion for his last eight years, the law expressly provides that a putative spouse will be cut off from benefits if the legal spouse \u201cis or has been\u201d entitled to benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">The imbroglio in which we find ourselves had its inception when the parties throughout this proceeding considered Diane Wood-son to be the stepchild of Rushell Woodson. The government\u2019s brief refers to the child as a stepchild. The district court in its opinion does not use the word \u201cstepchild,\u201d but it comments that the child is not Wood-son\u2019s. At oral argument the attorney for the appellant/claimant, Eliza Woodson, contended, for the first time, that in order for a stepchild to be eligible for children\u2019s benefits, a prerequisite to a widow\u2019s entitlement to mother\u2019s benefits for her child, the stepchild must be dependent upon the stepfather and must have been living with the stepfather or receiving at least one-half of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>his or her support from the stepfather at the time of the latter\u2019s death. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(4). There is no evidence that Diane met these conditions. Under this newly introduced theory, Eliza Woodson would be entitled to widow\u2019s benefits because the Secretary erred in making payments to Ethel Hurd as the mother of Diane for the five months as previously described.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">Given the set of facts developed by the Administrative Law Judge, considered by the Secretary, and then reviewed by the district court, we reverse the judgment and the decision of the Secretary denying benefits to Eliza Woodson. The decision to do so is complicated by the fact that since oral argument the Secretary, through counsel, furnished us with documentary evidence not heretofore presented which might be construed as demonstrating that Diane Woodson was the legitimated child of Ru-shell Woodson instead of his stepchild. Counsel submitted a copy of Diane\u2019s birth certificate reflecting the father to be Rushed Woodson. However, at the time of Diane\u2019s birth, Ethel was not married to Rushell Woodson, but rather to Clarence Hurd. The Secretary also submitted a statement signed by Clarence Hurd that he was not living with Ethel in 1954 and that the child born November 16, 1954, was not his. Further, the Secretary included a document, an internal form, on one line of which, in describing the relationship of Diane to Rushed, are the letters \u201cSC,\u201d standing for stepchild. The \u201cSC\u201d is crossed out, however, and below it are handprinted the letters \u201cLC,\u201d standing for legitimated child. The Secretary argues that the case should not be remanded because that would serve no useful purpose. Counsel for the Secretary contends in his transmittal letter that the appellant should not be permitted to raise new issues or to introduce new evidence for the first time on appeal. The appellant did not attempt to offer further evidence, but merely belatedly called attention to the law governing the payment of benefits to children. While we might be critical of the tardy research of the statutes, we cannot say this is a new issue; it is merely recognition of the law governing an existing issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">Before advancing the argument that the stepchild was not entitled to benefits in the first instance, counsel for appellant presented an equitable argument that Eliza Wood-son should be entitled to widow\u2019s benefits because of her marriage to Rushell Wood-son, their living the last years of his life with each other, the acquisition of a joint home together, and the fact that only five months worth of mother\u2019s benefits had been paid from the account of the deceased wage earner. Without those payments Eliza Woodson would be entitled to payment as a \u201cdeemed\u201d widow. That entitlement arises from Congressional recognition that many marriages in this country entail the legal impediment of a prior undissolved marriage of one of the parties. Provision for permitting entitlement notwithstanding such defective marriages is contained in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B). Subparagraph (A) of this section defines an eligible widow or widower as one who was validly married to the wage earner at the time of the wage earner\u2019s death or, alternatively, would inherit as a common-law widow under the intestacy statutes of the state in which the couple resided. Subparagraph (B) provides that a widow or widower is eligible for survivor benefits notwithstanding a prior undissolved marriage if the parties had gone through a marriage ceremony, the applicant entered the marriage in good faith, and the applicant and insured individual were living in the same household at the time of the death of the insured individual. Subpara-graph (B) contains the following limitation upon the right of such a \u201cdeemed\u201d widow or widower to qualify for benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-7\">The provisions of the preceding sentence shall not apply (i) if another person is or has been entitled to a benefit under subsection (b), (c), (e), (f), or (g) of section 402 of this title on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such insured individual and such other person is (or is deemed to be) a wife, widow, husband, or widower of such insured individual under subsection (A) at the time such applicant files the application. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B). This limitation obviously was intended by Congress (a) to prevent withdrawals from the insured wage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>earner\u2019s account by both a \u201clegal\u201d widow and a \u201cdeemed\u201d widow at the same time, and (b) to give a \u201clegal\u201d widow a prior right to benefits over those of a \u201cdeemed\u201d widow. A troubling clause in subparagraph (B) is \u201cif another person is <em>or has been entitled </em>to a benefit\u201d (emphasis supplied). Reading the sentence literally, one can posit that not only is double-dipping prevented, but a widow eligible under subparagraph (B) loses that eligibility for benefits if a \u201clegal\u201d widow \u201chas been entitled\u201d to a mother\u2019s insurance benefit (under \u00a7 402(g)). To disqualify Eliza Woodson from receiving widow\u2019s benefits, we would have to conclude that Diane was the daughter of Rushell Wood-son or that he supported her as a stepchild. Neither of these factual findings are established by this record. The district court found or held that Diane was not Rushell\u2019s child but did not find that Rushell was contributing to the support of the stepchild as required for eligibility for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">We hold that Ethel Stephens was not entitled to be paid mother\u2019s benefits for the child, that payments to her were by virtue of a mistake, and that those payments do not render Eliza Woodson ineligible to receive benefits as a \u201cdeemed\u201d widow. The attorney for the Secretary developed the case at all levels, including his brief in this court, on the theory that Diane was the stepchild of Rushell. Nevertheless, the Secretary did not see fit to prove the dependency of the stepchild upon the stepfather as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(4) in order to establish Ethel Stephens\u2019 entitlement to mother\u2019s benefits for her child. The claimant, Eliza Woodson, established sufficient evidence to prove that she was a \u201cdeemed\u201d widow under subparagraph (B) of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(1). There has never been any question but that this status was established at all levels of the litigation. The Secretary had the burden of establishing that Ethel Stephens was entitled to mother\u2019s benefits, which proof would render Eliza Woodson ineligible because of the asserted limitation contained in subparagraph (B), <em>supra. </em>The Secretary\u2019s attorney should have known that the statute required proof that the stepfather contributed to the stepchild to the extent of making her a dependent. Either the Secretary\u2019s attorney was not fully familiar with the statute or did not have the evidence to establish the dependency. We refuse to penalize the claimant in this case because her attorney failed to point out the error of the Secretary\u2019s attorney until the proceeding reached this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">For still another reason, we deem it unnecessary to remand this ease for further proceedings. We hold that under the limited facts of this case, Eliza Woodson would be entitled to benefits even if Diane had been the legitimated child of Rushell or, as a stepchild, had been dependent upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-7\">We must again discuss 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B). Another troubling clause in the sentence previously quoted from the statute is <em>\u201cand </em>such other person is ... a wife [or] widow ... of such insured individual ... <em>at the time such applicant files the application. </em>...\u201d (emphasis supplied). In this case, Eliza Woodson is the \u201capplicant\u201d and \u201csuch other person\u201d is Ethel Stephens.\u2019 Eliza Woodson filed her application for widow\u2019s benefits on June 3, 1975. Rushell Woodson died May 25, 1970. Ethel married Frank Stephens on October 2, 1970. She applied for mother\u2019s benefits for Diane retroactively on January 15, 1971. Clearly, Ethel was not the wife of Rushell on June 3, 1975, almost five years after she married Stephens. While technically she may be said to be the widow of Rushell on June 3, 1975, she nevertheless was not entitled to benefits because she was married to Stephens. The language in this clause and a subsequent sentence in \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B) requires us to review the Congressional policy that permits two widows to be paid widow\u2019s benefits so long as such payments are not concurrent and the \u201clegal\u201d widow is given priority over the \u201cdeemed\u201d widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-8\">The statute permits a \u201cdeemed\u201d widow to receive survivor benefits even though the Secretary is on notice that a \u201clegal\u201d widow survived the \u201cdeemed\u201d widow. As pointed out by Judge McKay in his dissent in <em>Martin v. Harris, </em>653 F.2d 428, 433-36 (10th Cir. 1981), in practically every instance the \u201cdeemed\u201d widow is considered a \u201clegal\u201d widow under subparagraph (A) because in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>most instances she does not know about a previous, undissolved marriage and neither would the Secretary be under notice of such fact. Thus, all widows are treated as \u201clegal,\u201d or subparagraph (A), widows unless and until a second \u201clegal\u201d widow applies for benefits and a determination must be made as to who has priority. If the second applicant is the \u201clegal\u201d widow, the payment to the \u201cdeemed\u201d widow is stopped. Interestingly, even if the Secretary should know that a \u201clegal\u201d widow exists, the \u201cdeemed\u201d widow nevertheless is entitled to benefits unless and until the \u201clegal\u201d widow applies for widow\u2019s payments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-5\">The entitlement to a monthly benefit . .. based on the wages ... of [an] insured individual, of a person who would not be deemed to be a ... widow ... of such insured individual but for this subpara- . graph, <em>shall end with the month before the month </em>... <em>in which the Secretary certifies . . . that another person is entitled to a benefit under [\u00a7 402(e)] if such other person is </em>... <em>[the] widow ... under subparagraph (A)....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Thus, a \u201cdeemed\u201d widow may be paid and then a \u201clegal\u201d widow sequentially, but not concurrently. This presents the question whether Congress meant to permit payment when the reverse situation occurs as here. The Secretary urges that the \u201clegal\u201d widow was paid benefits and that, although her marriage terminated those benefits, the \u201cdeemed\u201d widow is not permitted sequentially to receive survivor benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">We conclude that Congress did not intend to reach this inconsistent result. It is obvious that Congress intended that there be no double-dipping and that a \u201clegal\u201d widow have precedence in the payment of survivor benefits over a \u201cdeemed\u201d widow. Congress made it clear that notwithstanding the existence of a \u201clegal\u201d widow, a \u201cdeemed\u201d widow nevertheless could be entitled to survivor benefits. Subparagraph (B), as written, presupposes the existence of a \u201clegal\u201d widow. Here, Eliza Woodson was married to Rushell when he died, they had lived together a number of years, and they had acquired a home together. Ethel Stephens has remarried. Only $563 has been paid from the wage earner\u2019s Social Security account. Rushell Woodson applied for a Social Security account number in July 1937, he was in the military service from March 1943 to December 1946, and he had taxable Social Security earnings from 1951 through 1970, the date of his death. Social Security payments do not come from government largess. It would be totally inequitable to deny Eliza Woodson survivor benefits in the face of this record and reading the statute as we do. Further, it would fail to pay heed to our decisions that require a liberal interpretation of the Social Security Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-9\">That requirement would conflict with the remedial purposes of the Social Security Act, and the requirement for liberal construction in favor of coverage if such a construction is reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-13\"><em>Broussard v. Weinberger, </em>499 F.2d 969, 970 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-14\">We recognize that in the second holding contained in this opinion, we have only the company of the Second Circuit in <em>Rosenberg v. Richardson, </em>538 F.2d 487 (2d Cir. 1976). Three circuits under similar but different facts have come to a different conclusion than we do in this interpretation of the statute. <em>Martin v. Harris, </em>653 F.2d 428 (10th Cir. 1981); <em>Dwyer v. Califano, </em>636 F.2d 908 (3d Cir. 1980); <em>Davis v. Califano, </em>603 F.2d 618 (7th Cir. 1979). In deciding as we do in this case, we do not go as far as the holding of <em>Rosenberg, supra. </em>There, the court held that two widows could receive benefits concurrently. Our facts do not require us to reach that point and we do not intimate our thinking until faced with those facts. However, given the facts presented here and the Congressional intent, as we perceive it, to permit widows to receive survivor benefits sequentially, we believe that it is illogical to think that Congress intended such sequential payments only if the \u201cdeemed\u201d widow is the first to receive benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-15\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for disposition in accordance with the holding herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>THORNBERRY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ayd-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">I would affirm. Appellant challenged Ethel Stephens\u2019 legal entitlement to mother\u2019s insurance benefits for the first time at oral argument. The argument that Ethel Stephens was not Rushell\u2019s widow at the time Eliza Woodson filed her application was not made at the administrative level. Neither the administrative law judge nor the district court had the opportunity to consider these issues. Nor did the appellee have the opportunity to adduce evidence or offer argument in support of its position. Appellant\u2019s failure to present these theories of recovery at the administrative level or even to the district court prevents this court from considering them for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">Exhaustion of administrative remedies is a general prerequisite to judicial review of any administrative action. <em>Hedley v. United States, </em>594 F.2d 1043, 1044 (5th Cir. 1979). The Supreme Court stated long ago that a reviewing court usurps an agency\u2019s function when it sets aside an administrative determination upon a ground not theretofore presented and deprives the agency of an opportunity to consider the matter, make its ruling, and state the reasons for its action. <em>Unemployment Compensation Commission v. Aragon, </em>329 U.S. 143, 155, 67 S.Ct. 245, 251, 91 L.Ed. 136 (1946). As the Court subsequently explained, the basic purpose of the exhaustion doctrine is to allow an administrative agency to perform functions within its special competence: to make a factual record, to apply its expertise, and to correct its own errors. <em>Parisi v. Davidson, </em>405 U.S. 34, 37, 92 S.Ct. 815, 818, 31 L.Ed.2d 17 (1974); <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 1363, 1370 (5th Cir. 1980). As a general rule, then, a plaintiff who fails to raise an issue before the administrative agency will be precluded from raising it for the first time on appeal from the agency decision. <em>Beale v. Blount, </em>461 F.2d 1133, 1140 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Board of Public Instruction v. Finch, </em>414 F.2d 1068, 1072 (5th Cir. 1969). <em>See generally </em>3 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 20.06 (1958, 1976 Supp. &amp; 1980 Supp.) &amp; cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-7\">The rule is flexible, however, and exceptional circumstances might prompt us, where injustice might otherwise result, to consider questions of law that were neither pressed nor passed upon by the court or agency below. <em>Finch, supra, </em>at 1072. In <em>Finch, </em>we dealt with agency action that was in excess of statutory authority, likely to result in individual injustice, disruptive of the legislative scheme, and contrary to an important public policy extending beyond the rights of the individual litigants. <em>Id. </em>at 1073. In stark contrast, we here deal with a plaintiff who, after hearings at the administrative and district court level, presents us with a completely new theory of recovery. Neither the law nor the evidence available to plaintiff has changed since the administrative hearings. Rather, plaintiff simply has done some additional homework and now presses a claim that she could have pressed below. In this regard, the case before us is rather unexceptional. Finally, I note that the theory premised on Ethel Stephens\u2019 status at the time Eliza Woodson filed her application was not offered at any level in this case, but was developed and considered by this court with neither guidance from the litigants nor the benefit of agency expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-8\">Because I find the agency\u2019s action to be supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, I would affirm the judgment of the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
