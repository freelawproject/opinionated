HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">This case was consolidated for trial with <em>Williams v. General Motors Corporation, </em>656 F.2d 120 (5th Cir. 1981), which we also decide today. Plaintiff Ford originally sought to be added as a party plaintiff in <em>Williams, </em>but the district court denied the motion because of factual dissimilarities in the two cases. As the following discussion will reveal, plaintiff Ford\u2019s case is a straightforward \u201cfailure to promote\u201d age discrimination case related only tangentially to the \u201creduction of force\u201d scenario present in <em>Williams, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-19\">Plaintiff Ford served as a \u201cGeneral Supervisor\u201d at defendant General Motors Corporation\u2019s [GM] Lakewood Avenue, Atlanta, Ga. plant from June 1, 1971 through April 1, 1974. At that time, Ford was reduced to the position of \u201cSupervisor.\u201d When the massive reduction-in-force, chronicled in <em>Williams, supra, </em>656 F.2d at 122, befell the Lakewood Plant in February 1975, Ford was scheduled to be laid off. Because he was on sick leave at that time, however, Ford\u2019s lay-off was postponed until April 1, 1975. Eight months later, on January 12, 1976, Ford was restored to the salaried position of \u201cSupervisor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-21\">Ford complained in United States District Court, Northern District of Georgia, that GM unlawfully discriminated against him on the basis of his age.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jurisdiction was conferred upon the court by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(c) (1976). Specifically, Ford alleged that his recall on January 12, 1976 to the position of supervisor, rather than general supervisor, was illegal because he had been specifically instructed that he would be recalled as a general supervisor, but was not because of his age. At trial, the district court directed a verdict against Ford because of the lack of \u201cevidence in the record from which the jury could infer that he was as well or better qualified than the person who took the job.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From that verdict, Ford now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">In <em>Boeing Company v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (5th Cir. 1969) (en banc), we illuminated the path for district courts in their consideration of motions for directed verdicts. Such motions should be denied, we wrote, when \u201cthere is substantial evidence opposed to the motions, that is, evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions . ... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374. While the party opposing such a motion properly receives the benefit of \u201call reasonable inferences\u201d flowing from the evidence, as we cautioned in <em>Boeing </em>and have since applied on numerous occasions, <em>e. g., Wansor v. George Hantscho Company, Inc., </em>570 F.2d 1202, 1207 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Zarzaur v. United States, </em>493 F.2d 447, 452 (5th Cir. 1974), \u201c[a] mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to present a question for the jury,\u201d 411 F.2d at 374. With this standard in mind, then, we study the evidence introduced by Ford in a light most favorable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Ford has gleaned the record and points to the 1976 promotion of 35-year old Edward W. Cary to the position of general supervisor to support his claim of age discrimination. Cary, Ford asserts, received a lower personnel rating than Ford on \u201cpromotability,\u201d one of the three rating factors used by GM in evaluating its employees, yet was promoted to a general supervisory position within the \u201cQuality Control Department,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> where Ford had \u201cextensive experience\u201d and Cary had none. Ford further directs our attention to his trial testimony establishing that plant manager Victor Sutt had, in 1974, indicated that following reduction Ford would return to GM in a general supervisory position. This evidence, combined with Ford\u2019s testimony of his capacity to handle any \u201cQuality Control Department\u201d position, and viewed in a light most favorable to Ford, is said by plaintiff Ford to create a jury issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">We disagree. Ford has misunderstood his burden under <em>Price. </em>He must adduce evidence to show he is qualified for the position at issue, not evidence that another employee is not. Thus, his evidence as to the \u201cpromotability\u201d rating does not advance his case for he has failed to explain how the rating <em>he received </em>rendered him qualified to discharge the specific tasks of a general supervisor. Ford, in fact, declined to introduce evidence of the duties of a supervisor in the \u201cQuality Control Department,\u201d which would have been simple when he called GM\u2019s \u201cmanaging agents\u201d to testify on cross-examination. <em>See Williams, supra, </em>656 F.2d at 122. All we are left with, then, is Ford\u2019s experience in the \u201cQuality Control Department,\u201d his own testimony that he could handle any position, and Ford\u2019s hearsay testimony that plant manager Sutt declared in 1974 that Ford would return to GM after reduction in a glorious, supervisory blaze. This evidence is weak and insubstantial. Mindful not to allow our view and speculation of a \u201ccorrect\u201d jury result in Ford\u2019s case influence our decision as to the quantum of evidence necessary to reach the jury, we hold nonetheless that the district court correctly directed the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">Plaintiff Ford further asks us to reconsider our explicit position that punitive damages and damages for pain and suffering are not recoverable in ADEA actions. <em>See Murphy v. American Motor Sales Corporation, </em>570 F.2d 1226 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Dean v. American Security Insurance Company, </em>559 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir. 1977). Although we need not reach this issue of damages in light of our determination that the district court properly directed a verdict against Ford, we note that the task of reexamining and overruling panel decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>is left to the full Court, sitting en banc. <em>Ford v. United States, </em>618 F.2d 357, 361 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Truckline Gas Company v. Fed\u2019l Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>608 F.2d 582, 583 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>see </em>Fed.R.App.P. 35(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Our conclusion, in brief, is that Ford did not introduce evidence \u2014 sufficient to create a jury issue \u2014 of his qualification for the promotion sought. The district court, thus, correctly directed the verdict against Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"Ays\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-15\">. Ford was 42 years old when he filed his complaint, and thus within the ADEA-protect-ed age category.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-16\">. While we approve the use of a flexible and \u201cfluid\u201d standard for a prima facie age discrimination case, <em>see Williams v. Gen\u2019l Motors Corp., </em>656 F.2d 120, 128 (5th Cir. 1981), we note that the elements of <em>Price v. Maryland Casualty </em>Co., 561 F.2d 609, 612 (5th Cir. 1977), are adaptable to this \u201cfailure to promote\u201d case. Thus, the district court properly required Ford to introduce evidence: (1) that he was a member of the protected age group; (2) that he was not promoted to a given position; (3) that an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>other person, generally outside the protected age category, was placed in the position at issue; and (4) that Ford was qualified to fill the position sought. GM does not dispute that Ford has shown elements 1, 2, and 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b181-12\">.
