As a result of the inspection, the Secretary of Labor issued four citations against Daniel, alleging violations of OSHA construction safety standards, with a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>posed penalty of $13,760.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After conducting an evidentiary hearing, an administrative law judge affirmed some of the citations, vacated others, and reduced the penalty to $1,195.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">Daniel now appeals several findings of the administrative law judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First,, Daniel argues that all findings of violations against it must be dismissed, because the construction safety standards, published at 29 C.F.R. Part 1926, were invalidly promulgated. Second, Daniel argues that the finding that it violated the temporary flooring standard, 29 C.F.R. 1926.750(b)(2)(i) must be dismissed, because the standard was improperly amended. Daniel also argues that, even if the standard was properly amended, there was insufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that Daniel violated the standard. Third, Daniel argues that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that Daniel violated the safety training standard, 29 C.F.R. 1926.21(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">1. <em>Promulgation of 29 C.F.R. Part 1926.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 authorized the Secretary of Labor to promulgate safety and health standards in either of two ways. Section 6(b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b), authorized the Secretary to promulgate standards through general notice and comment rulemaking, designed to extend due process safeguards to persons potentially affected by the standards. Section 6(a) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(a), however, provided an interim shortcut to the notice and comment procedures of \u00a7 6(b): during the first two years following OSHA\u2019s effective date, the Secretary could adopt as an OSHA standard any national consensus standard <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or any Federal standard promulgated under another statute and in effect on OSHA\u2019s effective date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> OSHA\u2019s legislative history indicates that Congress provided the summary procedure because of the severity of the industrial safety problem; the purpose of the procedure was to enable the Secretary of Labor to establish as rapidly as possible national occupational health and safety standards with which industry was familiar. Because national consensus standards or established Federal standards would have been promulgated through procedures which gave the holders of diverse views an opportunity to comment, Congress concluded that it would be appropriate to permit the Secretary to adopt such standards without regard to the formal requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No.91-1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 6, <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5177, 5182.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-14\">The standards challenged here, published at 29 C.F.R. Part 1926, originally were promulgated under \u00a7 107 of the Construction Safety Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 333 (1969), and adopted as OSHA standards through the summary procedures of \u00a7 6(a). Daniel argues that the adoption of the standards as OSHA standards was invalid, because the original promulgation of the standards under the Construction Safety Act failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>comply with the procedural requirements of \u00a7 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Section 553 requires (1) general notice of proposed rulemaking, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b); (2) an opportunity for interested persons to comment on the proposed rule, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(c); and (3) publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register 30 days before its effective date, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(d). Notice of proposed promulgation of Construction Safety Act standards was published in the Federal Register on February 1, 1971, with a list of the proposed standards. Interested persons were invited to submit written views, data, and arguments. <em>See </em>36 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>1802 (1971). Interested persons also were given an opportunity to comment at six regional hearings. Final publication of the adopted standards in the Federal Register occurred on April 17, 1971. The publication stated, however, that the standards would become effective on April 27, 1971, only ten days after publication, instead of on a date 30 days after publication, as required by \u00a7 553. <em>See </em>36 Fed.Reg. 7430 (1971). The shortened publication period enabled the standards to take effect one day before the effective date of OSHA, April 28, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">The explanation accompanying final publication of the standards stated that acceleration of the effective date was justified either by the \u201cgood cause\u201d or the \u201cpublic contracts\u201d exceptions to \u00a7 553 rulemaking procedures. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 553(a)(2), (d)(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The essence of Daniel\u2019s challenge is that neither the \u201cgood cause\u201d nor the \u201cpublic contracts\u201d exception justified acceleration of the effective date. Daniel argues that the standards should not have become effective until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. The standards, the argument continues, were not properly in effect on the date OSHA took effect, and therefore could not be adopted as OSHA standards through the summary procedures of \u00a7 6(a). The Secretary was required to promulgate the standards through the more formal procedures of \u00a7 6(b). Because the Secretary has never complied with \u00a7 6(b), the argument concludes, the standards are void and the citations issued against Daniel must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">As a preliminary matter, the court must consider whether Daniel can challenge promulgation of the standards in an enforcement proceeding. Relying on <em>National Industrial Constructors v. OSHRC, </em>583 F.2d 1048 (8th Cir. 1978), the Secretary argues that a party cannot raise procedural challenges to OSHA standards in an enforcement proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">The Eighth Circuit held in <em>NIC </em>that all procedural challenges to OSHA standards must be brought in proceedings within 60 days after the effective date of the standard. The court reached this conclusion through an interpretation of \u00a7 6(f) of OSHA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(f). Section 6(f) states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-11\">Any person who may be adversely affected by a standard issued under this section may at any time prior to the sixtieth day after such standard is promulgated file a petition challenging the validity of such standard with the United States court of appeals for the circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, for a judicial review of such standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">By its terms, \u00a7 6(f) appears to restrict all judicial review of OSHA standards \u2014 both substantive and procedural \u2014 to pre-enforcement proceedings, or at least to a proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>ing no more than 60 days delayed beyond the date of promulgation of the standard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Quoting from OSHA\u2019s legislative history, however, the court in <em>NIC </em>noted that Congress could not have intended preenforcement proceedings to provide the exclusive forum for judicial review: \u201cWhile [Section 6(f)] would be the exclusive method for obtaining pre-enforcement judicial review of a standard, the provision does not foreclose an employer from challenging the validity of a standard during an enforcement proceeding.\u201d 583 F.2d at 1052, quoting S.Rep.No.91-1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5177, 5184.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">The court concluded that, at a minimum, Congress must have intended that substantive challenges, which the court defined as claims that a standard is arbitrary or unreasonable, could be raised in enforcement proceedings. The court noted that the economic or technical unreasonableness of a standard may become discernible only after an employer has made a good faith effort to comply, long after the standard takes effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">The court found, however, that the same considerations did not apply to procedural challenges. The court said that an argument that the Secretary failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the APA need not await the test of time, would be immediately discernible and can and should be raised within 60 days of promulgation. Further, the \u201cagency\u2019s interest in finality, coupled with the burden of continuous procedural challenges raised whenever an agency attempts to enforce a regulation, dictates against providing a perpetual forum in which the Secretary\u2019s procedural irregularities may be raised. Were there no limitation upon the time within which procedural attacks could be made, the resulting uncertainty might inhibit employers, otherwise able and willing, from complying with a regulation.\u201d 583 F.2d at 1052. Therefore, the court held that procedural challenges must be raised in a proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 6(f) initiated within 60 days of promulgation.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Although the analysis of \u00a7 6(f) in <em>NIC </em>has appeal, both the Ninth Circuit and the Fifth Circuit subsequently have rejected it. In <em>Marshall v. Union Oil Co., </em>616 F.2d 1113 (9th Cir. 1980), and in <em>Deering Milliken, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>630 F.2d 1094 (5th Cir. 1980), both courts held that a petitioner may raise procedural as well as substantive challenges in an enforcement proceeding. The reasoning of the two decisions is very similar. Each court described the Eighth Circuit\u2019s analysis as grounded in policy rather than the terms or the legislative history of the Act. Neither court could find in the legislative history any intent to preclude judicial review in an enforcement proceeding, or any support for a distinction between substantive and procedural challenges. Each court read the language from the Senate Report quoted above to allow challenges to the validity of a standard \u2014 substantive or procedural \u2014 in an enforcement proceeding. Relying on Supreme Court statements that in the absence of explicit language judicial review of agency action should not be restricted, each court refused to hold that \u00a7 6(f) bars procedural challenges to a standard in an enforcement proceeding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Finally, each court noted a practical consideration in reaching its conclusion: To interpret \u00a7 6(f) to restrict procedural challenges would require regulated employers in many situations to comb through a myriad of standards within 60 days of their adoption to determine which, if any, were procedurally defective. Although Congress could have placed that burden on employers, each court was reluctant to do so in the absence of express authorization. <em>See Deering Milliken, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>630 F.2d 1094, 1098-99 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Marshall v. Union Oil Co., </em>616 F.2d 1113, 1116-18 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Despite the sharp disagreement between <em>Deering Milliken </em>and <em>Union Oil </em>on the one hand, and <em>NIC </em>on the other, the differences are less significant than the opinions themselves suggest. Even if an employer may raise a procedural challenge in an enforcement proceeding, the employer still must demonstrate that it has suffered prejudice because of the administrative action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In both <em>Deering Milliken </em>and <em>Union Oil, </em>the employer challenged specific standards which the Secretary modified when adopting the standards as OSHA standards. The employers suffered prejudice because the modification of the standards effectively denied them an opportunity to comment on the standards.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>No similar prejudice occurred here, or in <em>NIC.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The purpose of the 30-day notice requirement in \u00a7 553(d) is to \u201cafford persons affected a reasonable time to prepare for the effective date of a rule or rules or to take any other action which the issuance of rules may prompt.\u201d Administrative Procedure Act Legislative History, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 201 (1946). The Construction Safety Act standards became effective in April, 1971, and became effective as OSHA standards in May, 1971.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The inspections of Daniel\u2019s construction site occurred in August and September, 1977. Daniel can hardly claim that it was denied a sufficient and reasonable opportunity to prepare for any attack it might, over six years after their promulgation, care to make whether we speak in terms of an April 1971 or a May 1971 effective date.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because Daniel can make no showing that the acceleration of the effective date caused it prejudice, we hold that Daniel\u2019s challenge is without merit. We, therefore, find it unnecessary to consider whether the acceleration was justified by either the \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cpublic contracts\u201d exceptions to \u00a7 553.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">2. <em>Amendment of the Temporary Flooring Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">Daniel next challenges amendment of the temporary flooring standard, 29 C.F.R. 1926.750(b)(2)(i). As originally promulgated, the standard required a substantial floor to be maintained two stories or 25 feet, whichever was less, below each tier of beams \u201con which bolting, riveting, welding, or painting [was] being done.\u201d The notice published in the Federal Register requested comment on a proposal to lower the distance at which a floor must be maintained from 25 to 30 feet below a beam. The purpose of the proposal was to allow \u201cnew methods of steel erection which have resulted in the use of greater depth of floor framing members.\u201d 39 Fed.Reg. 2015 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">As amended, however, the standard not only lowered the distance requirement from 25 to 30 feet, but also expanded application of the standard from beams \u201con which bolting, riveting, welding, or painting\u201d is per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>formed to beams on which \u201cany work\u201d is performed. The explanation accompanying publication of the amended standard indicated that the additional change was made in response to comments that the original standard unnecessarily excluded from protection other operations or work activities. The \u201ccomments appear to agree that employees engaged in skeletal steel erection should be protected by the standard regardless of the . . . work activity involved.\u201d 39 Fed.Reg. 24360 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Daniel argues that the final amendment differed so substantially from the proposed amendment that Daniel effectively had no notice of the issues involved. The argument is without merit. Although the APA requires that notice contain \u201ceither the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3), the Act \u201cdoes not require an agency to publish in advance every precise proposal which it may ultimately adopt as a rule.\u201d <em>Spartan Radiocasting Co. </em>v. <em>F.C.C., </em>619 F.2d 314, 321 (4th Cir. 1980), quoting <em>California Citizens Band Association v. United States, </em>375 F.2d 43, 48 (9th Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 844, 88 S.Ct. 96, 19 L.Ed.2d 112 (1967). This is particularly true when proposals are adopted in response to comments from participants in the rulemaking proceeding. The \u201crequirement of submission of a proposed rule for comment does not automatically generate a new opportunity for comment merely because the rule promulgated differs from the rule proposed, partly at least in response to submission.\u201d <em>International Harvester Co. v. Ruckelshaus, </em>478 F.2d 615, 632 (D.C. Cir. 1974). A contrary rule would lead to the absurdity that an agency could learn from comments on its proposals only at the peril of starting a new procedural round of commentary. <em>Id. </em>at 632, n.51. Here the additional change in the standard was made in response to comments; although the notice did not indicate that a change in application of the standard was contemplated, the fact that numerous comments were submitted on the issue suggests that notice was adequate. To hold otherwise would penalize the agency for benefitting from comments received and further bureaucratize the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">Daniel also argues that, even if amendment of the standard was valid, there was insufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that Daniel violated the standard. Daniel argues that the beams in question merely provided walkways to work areas; consequently no work was performed on them. The Commission, however, has defined \u201cwork\u201d to include presence in areas of access to and from work areas. <em>See Gelco Builders, Inc., </em>1977-78 Occupational Safety &amp; Health Decisions 122,353 p. 26,941 (Rev.Com.1977). Because the interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the remedial purpose of the Act, we affirm the finding of the administrative law judge that Daniel violated the temporary flooring standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">3. <em>Violation of the Safety Training Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Finally, Daniel argues there was insufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that Daniel violated 29 C.F.R. 1926.-21(b)(2), the safety training standard. Because the Secretary conceded at oral argument that the evidence was insufficient, the finding of a violation of the standard is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-8\">. The citations alleged one serious violation, two willful violations, two repeat violations, and 21 nonserious violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b989-9\">. Daniel also petitioned for discretionary review with the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The sole issue raised before the Commission was whether the inspection violated Daniel\u2019s Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Commission found no Fourth Amendment violation, and affirmed the decision of the administrative law judge. Daniel does not appeal any aspect of the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b989-15\">.

At issue in <em>Union Oil </em>was 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.-28(a)(3). As formulated by the American National Standards Institute, the standard stated \u201c[g]uardrails and toeholds <em>should </em>be installed\u201d [emphasis added]. In adopting the standard, the Secretary changed the wording to <em>\"shall </em>be installed\u201d [emphasis added], making the standard mandatory rather than advisory. <em>See </em>616 F.2d at 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">At issue in <em>Deering Milliken </em>were standards originally promulgated under the Walsh-Healy Public Contracts Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 35 <em>et seq. </em>(1976), and published as OSHA standards at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1000. On the merits, the court concluded that modifications to these standards were not substantial. <em>See </em>630 F.2d at 1099-1103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b993-5\">. The challenge raised in N/C was precisely the challenge raised here. <em>See </em>583 F.2d at 1051-52.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b993-6\">. Although the Construction Safety Act standards were adopted as OSHA standards on May 29, 1971, the Secretary delayed for 90 days application of the standards to employers who were not already subject to established Federal standards. The standards did not become effective with regard to the majority of employers until August 27, 1971. <em>See </em>36 Fed. Reg. 10466 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b993-7\">. Daniel argues that it suffered prejudice because it lost an opportunity to comment that it would have had if the Secretary had adopted the Construction Safety Act standards through \u00a7 6(b) rather than \u00a7 6(a). The loss of such an opportunity, however, does not constitute prejudice, because the opportunity was not one to which Daniel or other affected persons was or were entitled. As discussed earlier, Congress concluded that the summary procedure in \u00a7 6(a) was appropriate because the standards adopted would already have been developed through procedures that allowed diverse views to be presented. <em>See </em>text following n.4, <em>supra. </em>Therefore, it was unnecessary, indeed superfluous, to require yet another opportunity to comment before such standards became OSHA standards. The Construction Safety Act standards, in fact, were promulgated according to the notice and comment requirements of \u00a7 553. The proposed standards were published in the Federal Register, interested persons were invited to comment, hearings were held, and the standards were published in final form. The acceleration of the effective date of the OSHA standard in no way deprived interested persons of the opportunity to comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">Daniel points to the consideration that it never had an original opportunity to comment, because it was not affected by the Construction Safety Act standards, and the notice gave no indication that the standards would be adopted as OSHA standards, applicable to all employers (the Construction Safety Act applied only to construction employers entering contracts with the federal government or participating in federally assisted projects). But the fact that Daniel did not participate in the original hearings did not entitle it to an additional opportunity to comment. Congress determined that the views of employers such as Daniel would be adequately represented in the original hearings. Daniel\u2019s argument essentially is an argument that the summary adoption procedure in \u00a7 6(a) is altogether invalid. The overkill inherent in the contention condemns it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b993-14\">. See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
