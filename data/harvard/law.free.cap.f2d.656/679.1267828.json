(\u201cHogan\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Field \u2019647,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or Field \u2019452; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 132 for containing new matter; and claims 7 and 8 on the ground of interference estop-pel. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">\n<em>Subject Matter of the Application</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ace-dedup-0\">The appealed claims relate to interpolym-ers of ethylene and propylene formed by the use of catalysts formed by mixing certain organometal compounds with certain other metal compounds such as titanium salts. All claims remaining in the application are reproduced below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">1. Normally solid ethylene-propylene interpolymer characterized by consisting essentially of linear macromolecules and in that it is a crystalline thermoplastic, has an inherent viscosity of at least one, as measured in decahydronaphthalene and a methyl content in the range of 0.7 to 3 methyls per 100 carbon atoms, as determined by infrared, said interpolymer being obtained by polymerization of propylene and ethylene in the presence of a catalyst comprising divalent titanium, said catalyst comprising the mixture obtained by reducing a titanium compound having titanium at a valence greater than two with a reducing agent in which there is a hydrocarbon radical directly attached to metal atom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-13\">6. Interpolymers of propylene and ethylene which consist essentially of linear copolymers of propylene and ethylene which are partially crystalline at the X-rays, contain from about 0.7 to 3 methyl groups per 100 carbon atoms in the copo-lymer molecules as shown by their infrared spectra and have a molecular weight in the range of 50,000-100,000 as determined by inherent viscosity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-14\">7. A process which comprises interpo-lymerizing monomers comprising ethylene and propylene in the presence of a polymerization catalyst formed by mixing an organometal compound consisting of a metal alkyl or metal aryl of a metal selected from the group consisting of metals of Groups II and III of the Periodic System, zinc metal and metals above zinc in the electromotive series with a compound, other than the oxide, of a metal selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium, vanadium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten, and recovering the solid polymer formed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-15\">8. Process according to Claim 7 in which said organometal compound is an organo-aluminum compound.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-16\">\n<em>The Prior Art</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b742-17\">The board, in its opinion, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-18\">Hogan is relevant only as to those portions of the disclosure of the patent which are carried forward from its parent application, Serial No. 33,576 [s/c 333,576], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>filed January 27, 1953, as recognized by both the Examiner and appellants!<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The 1953 application discloses preparation of monoalkylethylene polymer products utilizing certain chromium oxide catalysts to achieve a range of tacky, semi-solid, and solid polymers. Its specification, with 20 working examples, discloses a range of preparations of polymeric materials including polyethylene and polypropylene. In the discussion of unsaturation in polymer samples studied by infrared spectroscopy, it is stated that \u201c[t]he same type of unsaturation is found in all of our polymers including copolymers such as ethylene-propylene copolymer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Both Field references disclose the production of high molecular weight, normally solid polymers. Field \u2019647 specifically contemplates the copolymerization of ethylene with propylene, the conversion process comprising contacting the olefins with an oxide of chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, or uranium and an alkali metal at certain reaction temperatures. Field \u2019452 employs as a catalyst for copolymerization a modification of that of Field \u2019647, replacing the alkali metal activator with a hydride of certain metals.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Appellants\u2019 application Serial No. 708,718, filed January 22, 1968, is a divisional application of Serial No. 556,548, filed December 30, 1955. The latter is involved in Interference No. 90,833 (\u201c \u2019833\u201d), declared January 22, 1960, among appellants Baxter et al. (\u201cBaxter\u201d) and three other parties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The civil action that evolved from that interference is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia under an order to stay pending the outcome of Interference No. 89,634 involving the subject matter of crystalline polypropylene as a composition of matter. The appeal from the civil action that evolved from Interference No. 89,634 is pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">During the period for motions before the primary examiner in Interference No. 90,-833, Baxter filed a motion to add count A,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> drawn to a process for polymerizing propylene. After consideration of the motions, the examiner denied Baxter\u2019s motion to add count A and on his own motion substituted a new count drawn to a process for homopo-lymerizing propylene.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>In his request for reconsideration<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> *filed October 22, 1962, Baxter, with respect to the new count substituted <em>sua sponte </em>by the examiner, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">BAXTER\u2019S principal concern is that at least one count of this interference be sufficiently broad to permit BAXTER to introduce his best evidence, and secondarily, that the count be sufficiently broad to permit a complete resolution of all the potential issues which can be considered as arising from the disclosures of the parties here involved. In this connection therefore it is respectfully urged that if the Examiner disagrees, on reconsideration, with any of the particulars discussed in the preceding paragraphs relating to the proposed broader BAXTER count and for these reasons feels impelled to deny again the addition of this count to the existing issue, it is respectfully urged that in his discretion he consider the addition of a count sufficiently broadened in comparison to the existing count to permit BAXTER to present his best evidence and secondly to resolve as far as possible all the fundamental issues here involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANb\">In a reconsideration of decision on motions dated July 15, 1964, the examiner reviewed Baxter\u2019s contention that the count should be broadened to include trivalent titanium and organometallic reducing agents (count A) but said\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AeU\">that at the time the invention was made due to the unpredictability of catalytic activity trivalent and tetravalent titanium and all of the organometallic reducing agents do not constitute one invention. Since the compounds encompassed by the broadened count do not constitute one invention <em>all </em>of the parties must support the count. As noted in the Decision on Motions all of the parties do not support this broadened count.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">Just prior to filing his request for reconsideration, Baxter had also filed motions to amend the issue, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-12\">In the decision on motions having an effective date of October 5, 1962,[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] the Examiner has, by his own motion, substituted a new count for the sole pre-existing issue of this interference \u201cso as to distinguish over the count of companion interference 90,835.\u201d The Examiner has thus found the existing count unpatentable over the count of interference 90,835, dissolved the existing interference, and proposed to declare a new interference, in accordance with Rule 237(a). The present motions to amend the issue are accordingly filed under the provisions of Rule 233(b), second sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">In his motions to amend, Baxter offered several counts of varying scope including counts B\u00ed_4 and counts Cj_4 drawn to processes for polymerizing propylene to form polymers that are solid at normal temperatures, counts DH drawn to homo-polymerizing propylene, and counts Ei_s<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>drawn to copolymerizing propylene with ethylene.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">With respect to counts Bi^, Ci_4, and Di^ Baxter moved in the alternative to add each count, or to declare a separate interference with each count as the issue, or to declare a separate interference with such of the parties as were deemed to show adequate support for allowability for each count offered. Baxter further moved that, should none of the counts preceding the \u201cD\u201d series (i. e., counts Bi_4 and C1-4 drawn to polymerizing propylene) be deemed proper as an issue among all or some of the parties, a separate interference be declared between Baxter and Ziegler et al.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> on the basis of one of counts Ei_5.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">These motions to amend were not transmitted to the primary examiner for his consideration. They were considered by the patent interference examiner and dismissed on the ground that they had been made outside the period for motions and were, therefore, untimely. In a letter dated December 3, 1964, the patent interference examiner ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">The dissolution contemplated by Rule 237 is one which terminates the interference. Action by the Primary Examiner refining the issue by substituting a count does not permit the subsequent filing of motions to amend in the same manner that the practice does not permit the filing of motions to amend outside of the motion period subsequent to the bringing of motions to substitute by party opponents. Timely objections to the count proposed by the Examiner should have been made by way of request for reconsideration. To the extent that such requests were made, they have already been determined on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">On request for reconsideration, in a letter from the patent interference examiner dated January 8, 1965, it was repeated that \u201cany objections to the count proposed by the Examiner should have been made by way of request for reconsideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Baxter petitioned the Commissioner \u201cto exercise his supervisory authority and instruct the Examiner of Patent Interference to reconsider his decisions . . . and to transmit to the Primary Examiner the Baxter et al motions to amend filed October 22,1962.\u201d In denying the petition, the Commissioner stated, in a decision on petition dated February 26, 1965:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">While petitioner considers the redec-lared interference as a new interference, the present proceeding is a <em>reformed </em>interference, wherein the count has been amended by the Examiner to better define the invention. Closely related circumstances, involving different, but analogous, facts are discussed by Rivise and Caesar in their treatise, <em>Interference Law and Practice </em>at Volume Two, Section 363, pages 1414-1420. The ruling ease law, as interpreted in said treatise, is to the effect that there is no necessity for setting a new motion period, if the questions could have been disposed of during the original motion period. This is believed to be the proper rule to follow here. In the present case, not only could all of the present motions have been presented, but for all practical purposes, as noted above the Examiner\u2019s criticism of the original Baxter et al motion is applicable to each of counts Bi_4, Cj_4 and Di_4. With regard to counts Ei_6, it is to be observed that the party Bailey t<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>l requested a separate interference during the motion period and petitioner could have done the same. Therefore, there is no good reason why the subsequently proposed motions were not proposed and disposed of during the original motion period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">\n<em>Board Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">The board sustained the examiner\u2019s rejections of claims 1 and 6 under 35 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>\u00a7 103 as unpatentable over either Hogan, Field '452, or Field '647. It also sustained the rejection of claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 132 for containing new matter,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> reasoning that the term \u201ccrystalline copolymers . . . are not within the scope of appellants\u2019 teaching [of <em>partially </em>crystalline copolym-ers] and for which no preparative technique has been taught.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The board sustained the rejection of claims 7 and 8 on the ground of interference estoppel,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">The motion to amend under Rule 233(b) in Interference No. 90,833 involving appellants\u2019 parent case, Serial No. 556,548, filed December 30, 1955, in which claims to the invention at bar were first presented was filed belatedly and thus refused consideration. This refusal by the Interference Examiner to submit the motion to the Primary Examiner for consideration was confirmed upon petition to the Assistant Commissioner. Appellants, consequently, are now estopped from again asserting the same invention which they had an opportunity and obligation to contest in the Interference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">The original motion denied by the Primary Examiner by its proposed addition of Count A clearly did not propose to make the presently claimed invention an issue of the interference. Said Count A may possibly be construed as being inclusive of or generic to the presently claimed invention, but manifestly it does not specifically point out and delineate the invention at bar which cannot be said to be an obvious variation within the scope of proposed Count A. Appellants thus having failed to bring into issue all commonly disclosed inventions are now equitably estopped from again presenting claims to an invention whose priority should have been contested in the Interference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"AJl\">\n<em>The Product Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">With respect to claims 1 and 6, the Hogan reference discloses the polymerization of certain olefins in the presence of a chromium oxide catalyst to yield solid polymers including polypropylene, polyethylene, and ethylene-propylene copolymers. Relevant portions of the parent 1953 application disclose polymerization of olefins, including propylene and ethylene, \u201cin the presence of chromium oxide deposited on or intimately admixed with silica, alumina, or silica-alumina supports.\u201d Discussion in the 1953 application of unsaturation \u201cfound in all of our polymers including copolymers such as ethylene propylene copolymer\u201d is ample suggestion to one of ordinary skill in the art to copolymerize propylene with ethylene in the presence of the disclosed chromium oxide catalysts, even though there is no specific example in the 1953 application directed to preparation of ethylene-propylene copolymer. Accordingly, we hold that there is sufficient disclosure in the 1953 application carried forward to the Hogan patent to have rendered obvious a range of tacky, semi-solid, and solid ethylene-propylene co-polymers prepared in the presence of the chromium oxide catalysts, as set forth in claims 1 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">Baxter includes as a limitation in his claims that the copolymers be at least partially crystalline and specifies a particular ethylene-to-propylene ratio. Hogan does not specifically state that his copolymers are partially crystalline, but a specific objective disclosed in the 1953 application was to provide high molecular weight solid polymers. The board found it reasonable to infer that such solid polymers are at least partially crystalline. Baxter presents no factual evidence to the contrary, merely arguing that Hogan\u2019s disclosure shows the production of liquid, syrupy, tacky, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>waxy polymers which, according to Baxter, were certainly not crystalline. However, this argument ignores the solid polymers produced by Hogan. We are persuaded that, in the absence of any significance attributed to the ethylene-to-propylene ratio, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the ratio could be varied depending on the type of copo-lymer desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\">Baxter argues that the Hogan catalysts differ greatly from the catalysts of his invention. However, the claims are directed to the products produced utilizing those catalysts. Baxter takes the position that there is insufficient disclosure in Hogan to make a solid, partially crystalline, essentially linear ethylene-propylene copolymer, but fails to provide any objective evidence to support this assertion. The PTO is not equipped to make the physical comparisons and evaluations urged by Baxter, and it is Baxter\u2019s burden to establish that the processes of the cited reference fail to produce the claimed copolymer. <em>In re Brown, </em>59 CCPA 1036, 459 F.2d 531, 173 USPQ 685 (1972). <em>In re Jacobs, </em>50 CCPA 1316, 318 F.2d 743, 137 USPQ 888 (1963).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">\n<em>The Process Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Process claims 7 and 8, <em>supra, </em>were rejected on the ground of interference estop-Baxter does not attack the doctrine of interference estoppel or the reasonableness of the PTO rules regarding motion period practice per se. His arguments are directed solely to the reasonableness of the application of the doctrine under the facts of this case. We are asked only to decide whether the doctrine of interference estoppel properly applies. pel.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">A. Claim Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">The doctrine of interference estoppel applies against a party who \u201chas neglected or refused to contest priority of patentable subject matter which is <em>clearly </em>common to his application and the application of his opponent in interference,\u201d <em>In re Yale, 52 </em>CCPA 1668, 1674, 347 F.2d 995, 1001, 146 USPQ 400, 404 (1965).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, the question is whether Baxter neglected or refused to contest priority on the copolymerization of propylene.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Of necessity, the answer depends upon the interpretation to be given the original count in '833.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Baxter argues that the original count was broad enough to embrace either homopolymerization of propylene or copolymerization of propylene with other monomers such as ethylene and was, therefore, broad enough to embrace the process of claims 7 and 8. During the peri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>od for motions Baxter moved to add count A <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> which, he asserts, would have covered polymerization of ethylene and propylene because, in pertinent part, it recites: \u201cA process for polymerizing propylene to a solid linear polymer which process comprises contacting propylene with a catalyst . . . . \u201d Baxter asserts that only when the examiner, in his decision on motions which followed the motion period, substituted a new count drawn to a \u201cprocess for homopolym-erizing propylene,\u201d was the count in interference limited to <em>exclude </em>copolymerization.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">To determine the scope of the counts, we rely on well-settled rules of count interpretation. In the absence of ambiguity, it is fundamental that the language of a count should be given the broadest reasonable interpretation it will support and should not be given a contrived, artificial, or narrow interpretation which fails to apply the language of the count in its most obvious sense. <em>Fontijn v. Okamoto, </em>518 F.2d 610, 617, 186 USPQ 97, 102-03 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1975). Only when counts are ambiguous may resort be had to the application where the counts originated, and this court does not look to the specification to determine whether there is an ambiguity. <em>Kroekel v. Shah, </em>558 F.2d 29, 32, 194 USPQ 544, 547 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1977); <em>Stansbury v. Bond, </em>482 F.2d 968, 974-75, 179 USPQ 88, 92-94 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1973). Baxter, in his brief, asserts that there is no ambiguity in the language of the count, either patent or latent, arguing that the language of the original count and of count A was broad enough to embrace copolymerization of propylene with other monomers.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Bearing in mind the above considerations and recognizing that Baxter\u2019s proposed count A is a comprising-type count,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we are satisfied that the scope of the proposed count includes polymerizing propylene with any other monomer (copolymerization), such as ethylene, as well as homopolymerization.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As long as one of the monomers in the reaction is propylene, any other monomer may be present, because the term \u201ccomprises\u201d permits the <em>inclusion </em>of other steps, elements, or materials. If a claim containing the language of proposed count A had been prosecuted and if the examiner had been aware of a prior art reference disclosing the polymerization of propylene with ethylene or any other monomer, it is most unlikely that the examiner would have failed to make a prior art rejection against the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">The dissenting opinion treats the original count and proposed count A as though neither were ambiguous. However, its only support, <em>Robie v. Carlton, </em>36 CCPA 739, 171 F.2d 310, 80 USPQ 102 (1948), involved a count that was ambiguous.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In <em>Robie, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>court analyzed a product count in which the term \u201ccomprising\u201d was used twice to define certain classes of materials within other classes of materials, the precise question being whether the class \u201cresin size coating\u201d contained nearly all resin (/. e., consisted essentially of resin) or could also contain a lesser amount. In reaching its decision, the court resorted to the rule that \u201cthe language of the count, if it is to be considered ambiguous, must be given a construction which is reasonable in light of the application in which the count originated.\u201d <em>Robie, </em>36 CCPA at 741, 171 F.2d at 311-12, 80 USPQ at 103. The court noted, in several specific references to Robie\u2019s joint applications, that the applications <em>limited </em>the term to essentially all resin, which was the narrow interpretation. In the case before us, as pointed out <em>supra </em>note 21, Baxter asserted that his example 1 expressly discloses polymerization of ethylene with propylene and, thus, supports the <em>broader </em>interpretation of the count. Apparently the dissenting opinion would interpret Baxter\u2019s original count and proposed count A narrowly to mean \u201cpolymerizing propylene only with itself\u201d or \u201ccontacting only propylene and no other monomer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The dissenting opinion refers to, but does not follow, <em>In re Fenton, </em>59 CCPA 708, 451 F.2d 640, 171 USPQ 693 (1971), a case in which the claims, like Baxter\u2019s counts, were not ambiguous and the term \u201ccomprising\u201d was used only once. In <em>Fenton, </em>the court held that claims reciting an \u201coxidation process\u201d were open to the interpretation that oxygen supplied by the atmosphere was the oxidant, although they did not recite the presence of oxygen as a reactant. Under <em>Fenton, </em>the original count 1 and Baxter\u2019s proposed count A in '833, reciting a \u201cprocess for polymerizing propylene,\u201d are clearly open to the interpretation that another monomer, such as ethylene, may be a reactant, although not expressly recited as a reactant.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">B. Due Process Considerations</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The second error of the PTO is in totally ignoring the clear infringement of Baxter\u2019s procedural due process rights. As the Supreme Court has repeatedly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-9\">\u201cAn elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-10\"><em>Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division v. Craft, </em>436 U.S. 1, 13, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 1562, 56 L.Ed.2d 30 (1978). This court has recently affirmed the \u201ccontinuing vitality of the doctrine of interference estoppel ... in appropriate factual settings.\u201d <em>In re Ogiue, </em>517 F.2d 1382, 1390, 186 USPQ 227, 234 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1975). Such factual settings necessarily include notice and opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">The examiner\u2019s Decision on Motions of September 20, 1962, first put Baxter on notice that the interference would exclude copolymerization. Then, for the first time, Baxter had a meaningful right to contest the examiner\u2019s interpretation of the count. Neither the PTO nor the dissenting opinion cites any facts of record from which one could infer that <em>during the motion period </em>Baxter was on notice that copolymerization was excluded from the interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">As related in the BACKGROUND section, <em>supra, </em>Baxter\u2019s numerous motions to reconsider, to amend, and to declare a separate interference on the copolymerization subject matter were all denied by the PTO. As the court pointed out in <em>Avery, </em>26 CCPA at 832, 101 F.2d at 212, 40 USPQ at 349-50, it has been the practice of the PTO to admit late filed motions to amend interferences \u201cupon a showing of cause for delay in making the motion.\u201d Under this practice, it appears that Baxter\u2019s Motions to Amend, filed October 22, 1962, <em>supra, </em>should have been ruled on so that a separate interference could have been declared between Ziegler and Baxter on the copolymerization subject matter. The fact that the examiner <em>first </em>set forth his interpretation of the count in his decision on motions and, then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>unilaterally <em>changed </em>the scope of the count was good cause for Baxter\u2019s late filing of motions to amend. These motions were in prompt response to the examiner\u2019s Decision on Motions of September 20,1962. The sole reason given by the examiner for excluding copolymerization is his statement that this \u201cclarifies the issue.\u201d However, there is no basis in law for denial of patent rights merely because the denial \u201cclarifies the issue.\u201d Also, denial of Baxter\u2019s subsequent petition and motions on the basis that they could have been made earlier (/. e., during the period for motions) cannot be given effect because Baxter had not been on notice that a motion to include copolymerization was needed until <em>after </em>the period for motions had ended.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">In view of the foregoing, the rejection of claims 1 and 6 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 as obvious from Hogan is affirmed. The rejection of claims 7 and 8 on the ground of interference estoppel is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">MODIFIED</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">BALDWIN, Judge, with whom NIES, J., joins, dissenting-in-part.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">I do not agree with the majority on the interpretation to be given the original count in the '833 interference.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The language of the count is specific to \u201cpolymerizing propylene\u201d and provides a process step \u201ccontacting propylene with a catalyst.\u201d The term \u201cpropylene\u201d is unambiguous and specific to a particular compound. Accordingly, I would interpret the language of the original count to include only the homopolymerization of propylene.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">The language of proposed count A<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> essentially differs from the original count only in limitations specifically directed to the catalyst. I would apply a similar analysis to count A and would interpret the language of count A, like that of the original count, to include only the polymerization of propylene.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">The original count utilizes the transitional phrase \u201ccomprises\u201d in connection with the recited process step, which would indicate that the claimed process is left open to the inclusion of additional process steps which are not recited in the count. <em>Ex parte Vollheim, </em>191 USPQ 407 (P.O.Bd.App. 1975). <em>Ex parte Schaefer, </em>171 USPQ 110 (P.O.Bd.App.1970). However, the recited process step must be given weight. The recited process step is \u201ccontacting propylene with a catalyst.\u201d There is no \u201ccomprising\u201d term used within that step in connection with the specific reactant \u201cpropylene.\u201d The use of the term \u201ccomprises\u201d in connection with the process step does not imply that every element or material that is listed thereafter must be construed to be open. The use of the term \u201ccomprises\u201d with the process step and the failure to use it thereafter with the reactant that is contacted with the catalyst would indicate that the reactant \u201cconsists essentially of\u201d propylene. <em>See Robie </em>v. <em>Carlton, </em>36 CCPA 739, 171 F.2d 310, 80 USPQ 102 (1948).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>But see In re Fenton, </em>59 CCPA 708, 451 F.2d 640, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>171 USPQ 693 (1971) where \u201ccomprising\u201d claims which did not recite the presence of oxygen in the reaction medium were held open to the interpretation that oxygen supplied by the atmosphere was the oxidant. There, however, the claim preamble did recite \u201can oxidation process.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In his brief, Baxter predicates his argument on his conclusion that the language of the original count, and of count A, \u201cwas obviously broad enough to embrace either homopolymerization of propylene or copo-lymerization of propylene with other monomers such as ethylene as described in both the Ziegler and Baxter applications and in claims 7 and 8.\u201d Under well-settled rules of count interpretation, it is the language of the count that we must interpret and only in the case where a count is ambiguous should resort be had to the application where the count originated. The court does not look to the specification to determine if there is an ambiguity, let alone to resolve the meaning of the count for purposes of an interference. To consult the specification where the count originated, there must be either an apparent ambiguity in the language of the count or the arguments of one or more of the parties must make it clear that the language of the count may have different meanings. <em>Kroekel v. Shah, </em>558 F.2d 29, 194 USPQ 544 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App. 1977); <em>Stansbury v. Bond, </em>482 F.2d 968, 179 USPQ 88 (CCPA 1973). Baxter, in his brief, asserts no ambiguity in the language of the count, either patent or latent, arguing only his conclusion that the language of the original count and of count A was broad enough to embrace copolymerization of propylene with other monomers.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">The majority asserts that the PTO erred \u201cin totally ignoring the clear infringement of Baxter\u2019s procedural due process rights.\u201d This argument is somewhat superfluous in view of the fact that whether or not there is such violation of due process flows from the interpretation to be given the counts in issue. If the counts are interpreted to include copolymerization, then Baxter has certainly suffered some loss of rights. If, however, the counts are interpreted to exclude copolymerization, then well-settled principles of the doctrine of interference estoppel come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">The rule of law set out by this court in <em>Avery v. Chase, </em>26 CCPA 823, 101 F.2d 205, 40 USPQ 343, <em>cert. denied, </em>307 U.S. 638, 59 S.Ct. 1036, 83 L.Ed. 1519 (1939), is that a party to an interference has a duty to present all claims involving common subject matter with any of the other parties in the proceeding, and that failure to timely present these claims estops him from presenting them at a later time before the PTO.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The development of this doctrine of interference estoppel has not been restricted to the application of res judicata. The opinion of this court in <em>Avery </em>gives weight to procedural considerations of the rules of the PTO which provide a motion period during which a party has the opportunity to put forward every claim he has to subject matter common to any of the involved applications.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The need for enforcement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>this rule is stressed to avoid excessive delays and continued litigation that can be troublesome, expensive, and sometimes vexatious.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court in <em>Avery </em>cites authority supporting this court\u2019s belief in the validity of the PTO rules regarding motions to put such claims in issue and the reasonableness of the application of interference estoppel under the facts which the cases then before us presented. <em>Accord, Meitzner </em>v. <em>Mindick, </em>549 F.2d 775, 193 USPQ 17 (CCPA 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The court in <em>Avery, </em>at 829, 101 F.2d at 210, 40 USPQ at 347-348, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">[T]his rule works no hardship to him who is diligent in pursuit of his rights. When an interference is declared, the files of his contestants are open to him. He has full cognizance of their disclosures and claims. So advised, it becomes his duty to put forward every claim he has. Rule 109 [<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] affords him this opportunity. If the rule be not enforced or enforceable, then delays and litigation are greatly increased. It is quite obvious that the doctrine of estoppel, as applied in these cases, results in the better conduct of the business of the Patent Office and in the public good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The majority wrongly relies on Baxter\u2019s \u201cnumerous motions to reconsider, to amend, and to declare a separate interference on the copolymerization subject matter,\u201d all actions taken <em>after </em>the expiration of the motion period. It is somewhat incongruous that this court in <em>Avery </em>and <em>Meitzner </em>provides support for the need for enforcement of the rules relating to motion periods, yet in this instance, upon consideration of actions taken <em>after </em>the expiration of the motion period, decides that enforcement of the rule violates procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Accordingly, I would affirm the rejection of claims 7 and 8 on the ground of interference estoppel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-19\">.

Although not argued by the parties, it appears that one prerequisite to application of the doctrine of interference estoppel (estoppels by dissolution, by judgment, by failure to file a motion to amend, and equitable estoppels) is the existence of a prior, final determination on which the estoppel is based. With one known exception, the doctrine has been applied only after a dissolution of or final judgment in a precursor interference. The exception is the case of <em>Avery v. Chase, </em>26 CCPA 823, 101 F.2d 205, 40 USPQ 343 (1939). Not only is Aveiy an exception, but it is factually distinguishable from the case before us. In <em>Avery </em>there was no dispute regarding interpretation of count language such as there is here. <em>See </em>Rivise and Caesar, <em>Interference Law and Practice, </em>988-89 (1943); Richardson, <em>Estoppels Arising out of Interference Proceedings in the Patent Office, </em>21 JPOS 411, 422-31 (1939). <em>See </em>McCrady, <em>The Legal Basis of the Interference Estoppel Doctrine, </em>26 JPOS 798 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">In the present case, an appeal involving '833 is pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. At oral argument the Solicitor stated that any issue over whether the Commissioner properly refused to add any of the counts proposed by Baxter in his October 22, 1962, motion to amend must await the decision in that interference. Therefore, a prerequisite for application of the doctrine, <em>viz., </em>a prior, final determination concerning the subject matter of the interference, is missing and, thus, estoppel is premature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b747-14\">. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b748-5\">. <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra. </em>If, indeed, there was no dispute regarding count interpretation and Baxter had attempted to introduce a count whose scope covered copolymerization, but was prevented from doing so by the PTO, then, under <em>Stoudt v. Guggenheim, </em>651 F.2d 760 (CCPA 1981) and <em>In re Frilette, </em>58 CCPA 799, 804, 436 F.2d 496, 500, 168 USPQ 368, 371 (1971), the doctrine of interference estoppel may not be applied to reject his claims drawn to that subject matter in this subsequent <em>ex parte </em>prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\">. The count does not exclude anything not recited in the count. P. Rosenberg, <em>Patent Law Fundamentals, </em>14-15 (1980); I. Kayton, <em>Patent Preparation &amp; Prosecution Practice, </em>3-2 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\">. This statement applies equally to original count 1 in '833, <em>supra </em>note 7. The dissenting view erroneously focuses on the interpretation of the word \u201cpropylene\u201d rather than on the interpretation of the entire comprising-type count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b748-8\">. Although we agree with the dissenting opinion that Baxter\u2019s count language was unambiguous, it is the majority\u2019s view that the counts include copolymerization, as discussed <em>supra. </em>Moreover, Baxter stated in his Motions to Amend of October 22, 1962, that his best evidence of priority is data concerning the polymerization of propylene with ethylene and that his example 1 (and Ziegler\u2019s examples 3 and 4) expressly discloses polymerization of ethylene with propylene. That statement was in response to the examiner\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>limiting of the interference count to exclude copolymerization because such action \u201cclarifies the issue.\u201d Apparently the examiner thought the count was ambiguous (otherwise there was no need to clarify it), and, if so, the proper course of action would have been for him to resort to \u201cthe specification of the patent or application from which the language originated to determine its meaning.\u201d <em>Fontijn v. Okamoto, </em>518 F.2d at 618, 186 USPQ at 103. Since the applications of both Baxter and Ziegler disclose co-polymerization, the examiner would have found copolymerization clearly within the scope of the count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\">. As pointed out by the dissenting opinion, the correctness of the PTO\u2019s failure to declare a separate interference between Baxter and Ziegler is not before the court. However, we point out that such a failure should not be elevated to a <em>sub silentio </em>excuse for denying Baxter patent rights to which he otherwise is entitled; nor does it excuse the PTO\u2019s failure to declare a separate interference under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 135 between Baxter and Ziegler. Had such interference been declared, the \u201ctroublesome, expensive, and sometimes vexatious\u201d delays (quoting from the dissenting opinion) by the PTO\u2019s activities would have been avoided or minimized. It appears that improper application of the rule here has <em>caused </em>rather than avoided such delays. Baxter has consistently maintained that an interference involving the copolymerization process of claims 7 and 8 is the proper remedy for the current status of the copolymerization subject matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-13\">.

The analysis of <em>Robie </em>provided by the majority is both irrelevant and incorrect. <em>Robie </em>is cited to support the proposition that attention must be paid to how the term \u201ccomprising\u201d is used in a count, i. e., to what it applies whether or not there is any ambiguity in the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the count. Contrary to the analysis of the majority, the court in <em>Robie </em>did not find that the count was ambiguous. The court based its conclusion on its interpretation of the clear language of the count. The dictum to which the majority refers, \u201cif it (the language of the count) be considered ambiguous,\u201d was in response to argument by counsel that the count must be broadly construed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\">. While it is reasonable to infer that \u201can oxidation process\u201d necessarily involves the combination of oxygen with some substance, it does not follow that a \u201cprocess for polymerizing propylene\u201d necessarily involves the inclusion of ethylene in the reactant mixture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b751-13\">. The majority cites <em>Avery </em>as an \u201cexception,\u201d supra n.16 of the majority opinion, and argues that a prerequisite to application of the doctrine of interference estoppel is a prior final determination. This ignores the precedential value of <em>Avery </em>where this court specifically assumed that a prior interference had not been terminated. Baxter does not raise this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b751-14\">. 37 CFR 1.231, revised as of January 1, 1960, provided for a motion period \u201cwithin which the various motions specified in \u00a7\u00a7 1.232 to 1.236 may be brought by the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">37 CFR 1.233(a) provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-16\">Motions may be brought to amend the interference to put in issue any claims which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>should be made the basis of interference between the moving party and any other party.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">. In line with these considerations, the decision denying the motion to add proposed count A was made more than 18 years ago on September 20, 1962, as noted in the majority opinion. Further, I note that Baxter has brought to our attention that the PTO issued U.S. Patent No. 3,833,551 ('551) to Ziegler et al. covering the subject matter of claims 7 and 8. The question of validity of that patent is not before us, but Baxter questions why the PTO could not have set up the separate interference on this invention between Ziegler and Baxter without the inequity of treating one of two parties preferentially and applying interference estoppel against the other. I would not attempt to answer this question on the record before this court. However, the portion of the term of the '551 patent subsequent to December 3, 1980, has been disclaimed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b752-22\">.
