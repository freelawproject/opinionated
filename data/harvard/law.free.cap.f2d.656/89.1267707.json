The District Court found the facts against the plaintiffs and dismissed their cases. The opinion is reported, 517 F.Supp. 710 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">We heard oral argument in New Orleans on the 21st day of April, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">Upon consideration of the record, briefs, findings of the District Court, and oral argument we affirm on the basis of the opinion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">We also agree with the refusal of the District Court to award attorneys\u2019 fees to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">The judgment of the District Court is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b152-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b152-19\">THORNBERRY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqR\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b152-20\">Although it is my view that most if not all of plaintiffs\u2019 assertions have merit, I wish to note in this dissent those portions of the district court\u2019s opinion that most clearly warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-21\">I. <em>Pregnancy Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-22\">The company\u2019s contract with the union specified that women in \u201cno case should ... be allowed to return sooner than three months following the birth . . . but all women must leave at least two months before the expected date of the birth.\u201d Absent some identifiable business necessity, such contractual burdens violate Title VII. <em>Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, </em>434 U.S. 136, 98 S.Ct. 347, 54 L.Ed.2d 356 (1977); <em>deLaurier v. San Diego School Dist., </em>588 F.2d 674 (9th Cir. 1978). But despite the clear and undeniable terms of the policy quoted above, the district court held that plaintiffs \u201chave failed to prove the existence of a policy.\u201d Plaintiffs accurately point out in their initial brief the patent flaw in the court\u2019s reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-23\">What, you may ask, was the evidence relied on by the district court to support its conclusion that the policy didn\u2019t exist? The plant nurse, Josephine Updegraff, determined by looking up the records that many employees worked beyond the seventh month of pregnancy and returned before the third month after birth. What this evidence proves, is unlike the situation in <em>deLaurier, </em>there is no business necessity for this policy. The fact that in many cases the policy was not enforced does not mean that the policy did not exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-24\">I agree and fail to perceive any reasoned basis for disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-25\">II. <em>Promotion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-26\">Until the middle of trial, when a woman was promoted to foreman in the Selecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Department, not one woman at the plant had ever been promoted from an hourly position to a supervisory position. Although the district court acknowledged that \u201csome of the procedures which O-I employs are similar to those which are criticized in <em>Parson </em>and <em>Rowe,\u201d </em>the court distinguished these controlling cases on the ground that in this case \u201cthe immediate foreman, while sometimes given input, does not make the promotion decision.\u201d But even if the foremen in this instance did not have the same degree of participation present in <em>Rowe v. General Motors Corp., </em>457 F.2d 348 (5th Cir. 1972) and <em>Parson v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp., </em>575 F.2d 1374 (5th Cir. 1978) these two cases do not elevate this factor to a <em>sine qua non </em>for recovery. <em>Rowe </em>(upon which <em>Parson </em>relied) clearly states that the promotion procedure at issue violated Title VII in \u201cseveral particulars.\u201d 457 F.2d at 358. Furthermore, given that upper management in this instance admittedly set discriminatory policies at their plant for years, it is indeed absurd to suggest that the concerns underpinning <em>Rowe </em>(and otherwise present in this case) are negated simply because upper management exercised ultimate decisionmaking authority-</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">ill. <em>Entry-Level Hiring</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Crucial to the district court\u2019s holding that the plaintiffs failed to establish discrimination in entry-level hiring is its conclusion that \u201cO-I has been willing to hire women as offbearers since 1972.\u201d Yet nothing in the court\u2019s opinion supports this assertion, and much goes to contradict it. For example, the court concedes (1) that no woman has ever been hired as an offbearer, (2) that prior to 1972 the company had an express policy of excluding women from this position, and (3) that valid statistical evidence strongly indicates that this former, explicit policy continues implicitly to inform the hiring decisions at the plant. Given this, and other probative evidence not mentioned by the district court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1 would conclude that the company policy of excluding women from the offbearer position continued well into the time frame covered by this class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">In this light, the district court\u2019s emphasis on the fact that \u201cthe plaintiffs failed to identify a single class member who was interested in the offbearer position\u201d becomes inapposite, since, as the district court states later in its opinion, all the plaintiffs were required to do \u201cat this stage of the litigation [was] prove the existence of a discriminatory policy, and . . . finding those persons who deserve relief because of the policy should be postponed until the relief stage.\u201d Furthermore, the district court\u2019s argument that the fact that no woman currently employed at the plant wants to become an offbearer constitutes \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that no member of the class would want the job of offbearer is simply wrong. Since the class was certified as including in part \u201call females who .. . applied for employment,\u201d it is apparent that some of those women who applied but were not fortunate enough to gain employment as selectors might well have taken a job as offbearer, if not precluded from doing so by a discriminatory hiring policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Thus, finding reversible errors in the district court\u2019s decision, I am unable to concur in the majority\u2019s unqualified endorsement of the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">. For example, Mr. Charles Politach, the personnel manager at the plant until 1975 in charge of initial job assignments, testified that he intentionally assigned all newly hired women to only the selector job. Transcript at 777-92.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\">. If it is true, as the district court and the majority assume, that no woman during the relevant time period was able and willing to perform the offbearer job, then there would be no victim to compensate. But a search for victims, given the bifurcated structure of this trial, should have been postponed, in the words of the district court, \u201cuntil the relief stage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
