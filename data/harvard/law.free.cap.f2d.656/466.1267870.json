The district court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss because appellants failed to exhaust administrative remedies and because the claims were moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-24\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-25\">HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b529-26\">In 1977, appellants Brady and Crawford filed virtually identical complaints for in-junctive relief, damages and petitions for writs of habeas corpus against the defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> challenging the conditions of their confinement at McNeil Island Penitentiary. Crawford\u2019s complaint was dismissed and he appealed. In <em>Crawford v. Bell, </em>599 F.2d 890 (9th Cir. 1979), this court affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Crawford\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus and those portions of Crawford\u2019s complaint which duplicated a pending class action. Thereafter, the class action suit brought on behalf of all McNeil prisoners was dismissed by the district court because the parties stipulated that the issue of unconstitutional overcrowding was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>On December 13, 1979 the district court consolidated the appellants\u2019 cases to consider the issues in their complaints which were not disposed of by the class action dismissal. These issues were whether: (1) the prison library was inadequate; (2) unsanitary conditions in the prison slaughterhouse caused food poisoning; (3) the prison had interfered with visitation rights; and (4) the appellants are entitled to $100,000 each as punitive damages for violations of their constitutional rights. The district court granted the respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss because the petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and because the claims were moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Appellants are no longer incarcerated at McNeil. That institution was converted from a United States penitentiary to a federal prison camp on September 26, 1979. The conditions at McNeil at the same time of dismissal by the District Judge were completely different from the conditions existing during the time of appellants\u2019 incarceration. Dismissal with respect to issues one, two and three was appropriate on the ground of mootness. The only issue that remains is appellants\u2019 claim for punitive damages for alleged violation of their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\n<em>Nature of Appellants\u2019 Claim for Damages.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Appellants allege that the overcrowded conditions at McNeil subjected them to:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">a. Cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">b. Denial of due process of law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">c. Denial of the right to privacy guaranteed in the First, Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">They neither allege nor seek compensatory damages but confine their claim to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">While the United States is not named as a defendant, each of the individual defendants is named in his official capacity. Each is charged with violation of statutory duties in the control and management of the institution. We must construe the pro se complaint liberally. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 107, 97 S.Ct. 285, 292-93, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-16\">\n<em>Defendants\u2019 Position.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">Defendants assert that appellants named the defendants in their official capacity and, thus, the action is against the United States. They argue that the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars the granting of monetary relief. Defendants further contend that appellants failed to exhaust their federal administrative remedy provided under the Federal Bureau of Prisons Program Statement 1330.1 dated October 18, 1974.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-18\">\n<em>Liability of the United States.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-19\"> A federal prisoner may maintain a claim for damages against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) &amp; 2671-2680, for injuries sustained as a result of fault on the part of a government employee. <em>United States v. Muniz, </em>374 U.S. 150, 83 S.Ct. 1850, 10 L.Ed.2d 805 (1963); <em>Williams v. United States, </em>405 F.2d 951, 954 (9th Cir. 1969). The government\u2019s duty to exercise care for the safety of its prisoners is affirmatively established by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4042. <em>Id. </em>The United States, however, has not waived its sovereign immunity so as to assume liability for punitive damages. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. Appellants did not file a claim as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401(b) &amp; 2675(a). Action against the United States is, therefore, barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\n<em>Bivens Type Complaint.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">While the government contends that the action is against individuals in their official capacity and therefore against the United States, liberal construction of the pro se complaint indicates a possible claim against the named individuals under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). <em>See Carlson v. Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 64 L.Ed.2d 15 (1980). Under a <em>Bivens </em>action, compensatory and punitive damages are available against the individuals. <em>Carlson, </em>446 U.S. at 21-22, 100 S.Ct. at 1473-74. Hence, the fact that appellants pray only for punitive damages would not bar a <em>Bivens </em>complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">While appellants make some general claims with respect to the slaughterhouse, the library, and visiting privileges, no compensatory damages are requested and the injunctive relief sought is inappropriate in light of the changed conditions mentioned before.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The thrust of appellants\u2019 complaint and the apparent basis for punitive damages is the alleged overcrowding. There are no allegations that the individual defendants are responsible for the number of inmates committed. Overcrowding is a function of appropriations from Congress, sentencing by federal judges, and releases by the parole board. Under these circumstances, the complaints do not state a cause of action under <em>Bivens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-17\">. Crawford has never filed a notice of appeal. Brady\u2019s notice on behalf of Crawford is not effective. <em>See U. S. v. Kelley, </em>539 F.2d 1199, 1201-03 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 963, 97 S.Ct. 393, 50 L.Ed.2d 332 (1976). However, because the two actions were consolidated, and the two complaints are identical, we refer to Brady\u2019s appeal in the plural.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-28\">. The named defendants are: (1) Griffin Bell, Attorney General of the United States; (2) Norman Carlson, Director of the Bureau of Prisons; and (3) L. R. Putman, Warden of McNeil.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b530-11\">. A substantial question is presented as to Brady\u2019s failure to exhaust federal administrative remedies. <em>See Brice v. Day, </em>604 F.2d 664 (10th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1086, 100 S.Ct. 1045, 62 L.Ed.2d 772 (1980). Because of our disposition of this appeal on other grounds, we find it unnecessary to address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
