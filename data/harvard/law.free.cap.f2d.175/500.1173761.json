These figures are clearly significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-31\">This appeal presents to us two questions: (1) whether we can sustain the findings of the Tax Court as to the deficiencies in taxpayer\u2019s income and the Tax Court\u2019s imposition of 50% fraud penalties for the years in question; and (2) whether it was reversible error for one judge of the Tax Court to hear this case and for another judge of the Tax Court to write the opinion. We think the first question must be answered in the affirmative and the second question in the negative, so that we must affirm the Tax Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-32\">Apposite federal statutes in this case are set out below:</p>\n<p id=\"b553-33\">Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791:</p>\n<p id=\"b553-36\">Sec. 22. Gross Income.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-37\">\u201c(a) General Definition. \u2018Gross income\u2019 includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service, of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Sec. 293. Additions to the Tax in Case of Deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u201c(b) Fraud. If any part of any deficiency is due to fraud with intent to evade tax, then 50 per centum of the total amount of the deficiency (in addition to such deficiency) shall be so assessed, collected, and paid, in lieu of the 50 per centum addition to the tax provided in section 3176 of the Revised Statutes, as amended.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Internal Revenue Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Sec. 1112. Burden of Proof in Fraud Cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">\u201cIn any proceeding involving the issue whether the petitioner has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax, the burden of proof in respect of such issue shall be upon the Commissioner.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Taxpayer, during the years in question, was a prosperous and successful lawyer in New York City. Particularly lucrative was his practice while the Volstead Act, 27 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1 et seq., was in effect. He kept bank accounts in his own name and a brokerage account, while his wife maintained a bank account and a pretty active brokerage account in her name. Practically all the funds in the bank and brokerage accounts of the wife were provided by taxpayer, with the exception of small sums representing income on, or gain from, her investments. And, apparently the money given to the wife came from taxpayer\u2019s earnings. Taxpayer himself gave a number of orders to buy and sell securities for the wife\u2019s brokerage account. There was evidence tending to show that during the year 1934, when taxpayer returned an income of $6,500.38, his actual living expenses exceeded $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">During the period beginning at some time in 1934, taxpayer kept a loose-leaf book, showing some of his receipts and disbursements, but this loose-leaf book neither clearly nor completely reflected taxpayer\u2019s income. He could produce no records showing receipts and disbursements prior to 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Up to 1934, he personally prepared his own tax returns. After that, his returns were prepared by an accountant who relied upon information furnished by the taxpayer. It seems that the accountant, in preparing these returns, did not examine any of taxpayer\u2019s books or records.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">Petitioner attacks the findings of the Tax Court as to deficiencies in taxpayer\u2019s income on the ground that these findings have no warrant in the record. We think this contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">Certain principles are helpful in this connection. The Commissioner\u2019s determination bears a presumption of correctness. Old Mission Portland Cement Co. v. Helvering, 293 U.S. 289, 55 S.Ct. 158, 79 L.Ed. 367; Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212; Greenfeld v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 165 F.2d 318. The federal income tax system is one of self-assessment by the taxpayer. Its efficiency must depend largely on the truth of facts set out by the taxpayer in his return. And, appropriately geared to the gravity of nondisclosure (or false disclosure), Congress has provided varied sanctions, both civil and criminal, to protect that system. Implicit in the working of the system is an obvious duty of keeping proper records imposed on the taxpayer. Nor must the fact be overlooked that the taxpayer here was no unlettered person, ignorant of the methods of business and the purlieus of the law, but, on the contrary, he was a successful lawyer, practicing under the keen competition that obtains in the largest city on this continent.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-15\">The Commissioner determined the taxpayer\u2019s income during the years here involved from the bankbooks and brokerage accounts of taxpayer and his wife, can-celled checks, check stubs and vouchers, and such other meager records and data as were available. In some instances, the Commissioner made adjustments in favor of the taxpayer (e. g., in the years 1931 and 1934) and these were taken into account by the Tax Court in its findings. No reasonable doubts were resolved against the taxpayer, while the audit and analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>made by the Commissioner seems to have been as accurate as the circumstances here permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Against this background, taxpayer and his wife introduced little or ,no genuine evidence to explain the large sums of money deposited in the bank and brokerage accounts. The answers of taxpayer and his wife as to items involving large sums of money were halting, inconclusive and evasive. Again and again, the wife\u2019s answers to questions here were simply: \u201cI do not remember,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t \u2022tell you.\u201d One striking example of this was the deposit, in the wife\u2019s name, of some .$70,000 with the brokerage firm of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company in the year 1930. Again, for 1936, taxpayer reported a loss -of $2,451.44, yet there was evidence to show \u00a1that during this year taxpayer deposited in two banks, to the account of his wife and himself, sums in excess of $80,000. Nor could taxpayer explain this (at least) .apparent discrepancy. Often, when called -on to explain important items involving substantial sums of money, taxpayer reported merely to a general statement that .his returns were true and correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The decided cases clearly show that we cannot here disturb the Tax Court\u2019s findings as to the deficiencies in the taxpayer\u2019s income tax. In Hague Estate v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 132 F.2d 775, 776, certiorari denied 318 U.S. 787, 63 S.Ct. 983, 87 L.Ed. 1154, Circuit Judge Chase said:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">\u201cWhen, in this setting, everything identifiable was excluded by the Tax Court from \u25a0-the decedent\u2019s gross income for each year, \u2022the residue of the bank deposits not previously reported and remaining unidentified \u2022-was properly redetermined to be income on -the ground that the petitioners had not -shown the action of the Commissioner to -have been wrong. That they may have .been unable so to do because Hague kept \u25a0inadequate records and was dead, is a possibility of course, but so is the contrary because no one can tell what complete and .correct records would have shown about -that * * *. However that may be, the \u2022petitioners are in the same position whether -their failure to show error was due to impossibility or to some other reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">In Harris v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 174 F.2d 70, 73, it was said:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">\u201cNotwithstanding the uncertainty and lack of precision which necessarily pervades the calculations on which the Tax Court\u2019s determinations are based, we do not feel justified in setting them aside. * * * Most important, of course, is the failure or refusal of the taxpayer to produce any records or to render such assistance to the court, although represented by able counsel, as would enable it to make its findings with accuracy and precision. Under such circumstances, approximation in the calculation of net income is justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">See, also, Stinnett v. United States, 4 Cir., 173 F.2d 129. And, see, Helvering v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., 316 U.S. 56, 66-67, 62 S.Ct. 925, 85 L.Ed. 1266, 139 A.L.R. 1513; Burnet v. Houston, 283 U.S. 223, 51 S.Ct. 413, 75 L.Ed. 991; Kenney v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 111 F.2d 374; Malone v. United States, 7 Cir., 94 F.2d 281, certiorari denied 304 U.S. 562, 58 S.Ct. 944, 82 L.Ed. 1529; United States v. Miro, 2 Cir., 60 F.2d 58; Oliver v. United States, 7 Cir., 54 F.2d 48, certiorari denied 285 U.S. 543, 52 S.Ct. 393, 76 L.Ed. 935; Cohan v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 39 F.2d 540, 543:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">Also, we must uphold the Tax Court\u2019s finding that taxpayer\u2019s returns were fraudulent and therefore subject to the 50% penalties under \u00a7 293(b) of the Revenue Act, which is set out, supra. Although the burden was on the Commissioner to prove the fraudulent nature of the returns, we think he has fully borne this burden and that the evidence amply supports the Tax Court\u2019s finding in this respect. The deficiencies here were too many, too varied, too continuous and too excessive to be plausibly attributed to inadvertanee or carelessness. The transactions here involved were such in magnitude and importance that they could hardly have been overlooked by a prosperous New York lawyer; for all the facts, set in their proper background, simply cry out against any such inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">We append a number of cases in which imposition of the 50% fraud penalty has been upheld. See, Mauch v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 113 F.2d 555 (understatement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>failure to report substantial sums of money received from unnamed clients) ; Wickham v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 65 F.2d 527, 531\u2014532 (only explanation for failure to report true income was that taxpayer - entrusted the preparation, of his returns to others); Humphreys v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 125 F.2d 340, certiorari denied 317 U.S. 637, 63 S.Ct. 28, 87 L.Ed. 513 (unexplained income items omitted from tax return) ; Rusman v. Commissioner, 1944 P-H T. C. Memorandum Decisions, par. 44288, 3 T. C. 1293, petition to review dismissed, 9 Cir., 150 F.2d 543 (unreported income concealed in savings bank accounts and account books' improperly reflecting receipts of taxpayer); Rogers v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 111 F.2d 987 (taxpayer reporting less than one-half of his income). See, also, Harris v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 174 F.2d 70 (taxpayer was unlettered and ignorant). And see (a criminal case) Stinnett v. United States, 4 Cir., 173 F.2d 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">There is no reversible error here because one judge of the Tax Court-(Sternhagen) heard the case and another judge (Murdock) wrote the opinion. Thus, in Seaside Improvement Co. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 105 F.2d 990, 992, certiorari denied 308 U.S. 618, 60 S.Ct. 263, 84 L.Ed. 516, Circuit Judge Swan, speaking for this Court, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u201cFindings of fact by the Board are conclusive upon the court if supported by substantial evidence. We regard this principle as applicable even- when the findings, because of the expiration of the term of office of the Board\u2019s member who heard the testimony, are made by \u2019 his \u2022 successor in office and, therefore, are based upon a stenographic record of the testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In like m\u00e1nner, in Davidson v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 91 F.2d 516, 518, Circuit Judge Foster stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u201cIt would unnecessarily, and to no good purpose, complicate and delay the disposition of business by the Board if proceedings before one who had ceased to be a member had to be abandoned and held for naught. It was within the sound discretion of the Board to enter judgment on the findings of fact and opinion'of Board member Murdock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">So, also, was the language of Circuit Judge Morton in Foss v. Commissioner, 1 Cir., 75 F.2d 326, 329:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">\u201cWe think there can be no doubt that the Board of Tax Appeals had the right, if it saw fit to do so, to consider the matter on the stenographic report of the testimony taken by Mr. Love and on the report and determination1 made by Mr. Murdock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Cf. Banister v. Solomon, 2 Cir., 126 F.2d 740, 741; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, Ct.Cl., 7 F.Supp. 301. We find nothing in the cases cited by petitioner that would shake the authorities which we have just quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">The decision of the Tax Court of the United States is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
