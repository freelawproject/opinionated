Pursuant to 58 Stal. 677, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 (i), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801 (i)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> enacted in 1944, appellees executed written renunciations of their United States citizenship. In this action, commenced under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 903, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, appellees seek a judgment declaring that these renunciations be cancelled and that they are citizens of the United States. Before the commencement of this action appellees were released from the internment above described.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">At the outset, we are met with the contention of appellants, raised here for the first time, that the court below was without jurisdiction to entertain such a suit against such government officials because there is no allegation of any facts showing any denied right.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-17\">The amended complaint, paragraph III, alleged in part that \u201cthe defendants deny that plaintiffs are nationals of the United States and have denied the plaintiffs\u2019 rights and privileges as nationals of the United States; and have announced that the plaintiffs do not possess United States nationality or citizenship.\u201d The answer denied that plaintiffs were nationals of the United States and admitted the other allegations of paragraph III.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-18\">The question is whether by thus admitting as true the allegation that appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>\u201chave denied the plaintiffs\u2019 rights and privileges as nationals,\u201d an issue of fact is raised in that respect. The government contends that the allegation of denials of rights and privileges is a mere conclusion of law which tenders no issue of fact and that by the admission of a conclusion of law no issue of fact is raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">In determining that question the appellate court shall consider facts proved in the course of the trial .showing a jurisdiction though it does not appear in the pleadings. Norton v. Larney, 8 Cir., 289 F. 395, affirmed 266 U.S. 511, 45 S.Ct. 145, 69 L.Ed. 413. Also, though the answer admit the jurisdictional facts, jurisdiction may be contested by a showing of its collusive acquisition. Deputron v. Young, 134 U.S. 241, 10 S.Ct. 539, 33 L.Ed. 923. Here no facts were proved showing a right or privilege and the sole question is the sufficiency of the complaint\u2019s allegation and the answer\u2019s admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We agree with appellants that an admission in the answer of conclusions of law stated in the complaint raises no issue of fact and the question here is whether or not the challenged allegation tenders an issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">We think it does not. Whether a right or privilege has been denied is a question of law to be determined upon facts showing the denial. That question of law can be raised only upon the allegations of fact constituting the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">In Little York Gold Washing &amp; Water Co. v. Keyes, 96 U.S. 199, 24 L.Ed. 656, the Supreme Court affirmed a remand to the state court of a removed suit, wherein the petition for removal alleged a title derived under the laws of the United States and that the determination of the suit, would necessarily involve and require the construction of laws of the United States, but no facts were stated to enable the court to see whether the determination of the suit necessarily depended upon the construction of the statute set out. The Court said, 96 U.S. at page 203, 24 L.Ed. 656 \u201cThe immunities of the statutes are, in effect, conclusions of law from the existence of particular facts. Protection is not afforded under all circumstances. In pleading the statute, therefore, the facts must be stated which call it into operation. The averment that it is in operation will not be enough; for that is the precise question the court is called upon to determine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">And 96 U.S. at page 202, 24 L.Ed. 656, the Court said: \u201cThe office of pleading is to state facts, not conclusions of law. It is the duty of the court to declare conclusions, and of the parties to state the premises.\u201d Cf. Hull v. Burr, 234 U.S. 712, 720, 34 S.Ct. 892, 58 L.Ed. 1557; Norton v. Whiteside, 239 U.S. 144, 147, 36 S.Ct. 97, 60 L.Ed. 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">In Woodhouse v. Budwesky, 4 Cir., 70 F.2d 61, certiorari denied 293 U.S. 573, 55 S.Ct. 84, 79 L.Ed. 671, the bill alleged that rights guaranteed to plaintiff by the Constitution of the United States had been violated by defendants, but the facts showing how the power of the state had been used to deprive plaintiff of such rights were not set out. In affirming the dismissal of \u2018the bill for want of jurisdiction the court said, 70 F.2d at page 62: \u201cAnd it is well settled, that it is not sufficient to sustain jurisdiction that the pleading merely assert that conduct complained of violates constitutional rights. It must set forth facts from which the court can see that such fights have been violated. There must be a \u2018federal question, not in mere form, but in substance, and not in mere assertion, but in essence and effect.\u2019 Cuyahoga River Power Co. v. Northern Ohio T. &amp; L. Co., 252 U.S. 388, 397, 40 S.Ct. 404, 408, 64 L.Ed. 626.\u201d Cf. McCartney v. State of West Virginia, 4 Cir., 156 F.2d 739, 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">Here, in the absence of any facts constituting such a denial either in the complaint or the proofs, the restricted jurisdiction of the district court has not been invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">The judgment is reversed and the district court instructed to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">STEPHENS, Circuit Judge, did not participate in the decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-11\"> \u201c\u00a7 801.
