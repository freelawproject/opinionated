Marshall, also known as Leverett H. Nugent, deceased, who left surviving him as his sole heir at law the plaintiff, Grace A. Olson, formerly Grace A. Marshall, his mother by adoption; \u201cthat this action is brought by the plaintiff for the benefit of the heirs at law\u201d of her decedent; and that her decedent was killed in August, 1946, at the Salt Lake Airport, Salt Lake City, Utah, by the negligent operation of an airplane owned by the United States then being piloted by navy pilot Commander Richard L. Fowler, the agent and servant of the United States, acting within the scope of his authority as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence the defendant rested and moved for judgment \u201con the ground there is no plaintiff in court capable of recovering under the death statute; no evidence of living heirs of the decedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">Counsel for plaintiff objected to the motion on the ground that it was clearly shown that plaintiff has the status of an adopted mother and is administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-17\">The court sustained defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the ground that the case is governed by the \u201cWrongful Death Statute\u201d of South Dakota, S.D.C. 37.2201 et seq., where the action was brought. The court denied plaintiff\u2019s request to reopen the case and to introduce further evidence, and found (1) that there is no competent evidence that plaintiff is the adoptive mother or the heir of the decedent, and (2) that there is no competent evidence before the court of the existence of any person for whose benefit this action can be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-18\">The plaintiff seeks reversal substantially on the grounds that the court erred (1) in holding that the laws of South Dakota governed her cause of action and not the laws of Utah where the act complained of occurred; (2) in holding that plaintiff was not shown to have the status of the adopted mother of the decedent; (3) in holding that plaintiff as administratrix of her decedent\u2019s estate was not entitled to maintain the action; and (4) in denying plaintiff\u2019s request to produce further evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-19\">Clearly the court erred in holding that the laws of South Dakota and not the laws of Utah governed plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. Section 410(a) of the Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 931(a), provides that \u201c * * * the United States district court for the district wherein the plaintiff is resident or wherein the act * * * complained of occurred, * * * sitting without a jury, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear, determine, and render judgment on any claim against the United States, for money only, * * * on account of damage * * * or on account of * * * death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>caused by ' the negligent * . * \u2022 * act * * * .of any employee of the Government * * * under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant for such damage * * * or death <em>in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d </em>.(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Since, therefore, the- negligent-act complained of occurred in Utah, the law of that state and not that of South D\u00e1kota was controlling. Under \u00a7 931(a) of the Act, supra, the district court for the district in which the plaintiff resided liad jurisdiction of the action but the standards and tests of the state where the accident occurred- controlled on questions of negligence and the nature and extent of recovery including the capacity and rights \u25a0 of the plaintiff arid the liability of the United States. State of Maryland, to use of Burkhardt v. United States, 4 Cir., 165 F.2d 869, 1 A.L.R.2d 213; Van Wie v. United States, D.C.N.D.Iowa, <em>77 </em>F.Supp. 22; Washabaugh v. United States, D.C.M.D.Penn., 83 F.Supp. 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\"> Notwithstanding such error it is our duty to affirm the 'judgment, if correct, regardless of the reason given by the trial court for its entry. Walling v. Friend, 8 Cir., 156 F.2d 429, 431; McGivern v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 8 Cir., 132 F.2d 213, 216; Iselin v. C. W. Hunter Co., 5 Cir., 173 F.2d 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">On the vital question of the right to maintain an action for damages for wrongful death the laws of Utah are somewhat broader than the laws of South Dakota.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Under the laws of South Dakota, Comp. Laws, \u00a7 5499, providing that \u201cif the life of any person * * * is lost or destroyed by the neglect * * * of another person * * * then the widow, heir, or personal representatives of the deceased shall have the right to sue * * * and recover damages for the loss * * * of the. life aforesaid\u201d, the word \u201cheir\u201d is construed to mean \u201cchild.\u201d Lintz v. Holy Terror Mining Co., 13 S.D. 489, 83 N.W. 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">Under the laws of Utah the right to take property by devise or descent is a right given and regulated by statute. In re Estate of Harrington, deceased, 96 Utah 252, 85 P.2d 630, 120 A.L.R. 830. Title 104, c. 3, \u00a7 11 of the Code of Utah, Annotated, 1943, provides: \u201cExcept as provided in Chapter I, of Title 42, when the death of a person not a minor is caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another, <em>his heirs or his personal representatives for the benefit of his heirs, may maintain an action for damages against the person causing the death * </em>* (Emphasis supplied.) And a deceased\u2019s heirs include (1) issue of the decedent; (2) his parents; (3) his brothers and sisters; and (4) next of kin, in the order named. Title 101, c. 4 of Code of Utah of 1943. The statute of Utah further provides : \u201cA child when adopted may take the family name of the person adopting. After adoption the two shall sustain the legal relation of parent and child, and have all the rights and be. subject to all the duties of that relation.\u201d Title 14, c. 4, \u00a7 10 of Code of Utah of 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\"> The burden was upon plaintiff affirmatively to prove the fact of adoption. 2 C.J.S., Adoption of Children, \u00a7 52. Such proof must show a legal adoption; and the validity and effect of adoption is governed by the law of the state creating it. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence showed only that the plaintiff thought that she had adopted the deceased in 1927 when he was four years of age, in a proceeding in a court of the state of Virginia. Neither the adoption statutes of Virginia nor the decree of adoption were introduced in evidence. Set out in the record, however, but not in evidence, is a certificate of the Judge of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of the County of James City and City of Williamsburg, Virginia, dated June 23, 1927, showing that Mrs. John P. Marshall had filed a petition in that court \u201calleging desertion and non-support by O. Nugent of his infant child Leverett H. Nugent, four years of age\u201d and that \u201csaid child was adjudged to be neglected and dependent * * *, and the custody of the said child was then and there awarded to Mrs. John P. Marshall of James City County, Virginia, until the further order of this court.\u201d We may take judicial no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tice that this is no more than an interlocutory order in an adoption proceeding under the laws of Virginia, and not a decree of adoption. See Michie\u2019s Code of Virginia, 1942, \u00a7 5333e et seq. It would not, if admitted in evidence, prove adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">The evidence shows that after such order was entered by the Virginia court plaintiff removed with the deceased to the state of South Dakota where she reared him as her own child. The contention that as such foster mother she is his lawful heir is without support either in the evidence or in law. The cases cited by plaintiff to support her contention in this regard are not in point here.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Plaintiff further contends that under Utah law she was entitled to maintain this action as the administratrix of her decedent\u2019s estate \u201cfor the benefit of his heirs.\u201d Section 104 \u2014 3\u201411, Code of Utah, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">At the time plaintiff rested and defendant moved for judgment no evidence had been introduced showing the existence of any heirs of the deceased other than the existence of the father whose whereabouts was unknown and the existence of the plaintiff who claimed to be his sole heir. The complaint alleges, however, that \u201cthis action is brought by the plaintiff for the benefit of the heirs at law of said Leverett H. Marshall, also known as Leverett li. Nugent, deceased.\u201d And when the court indicated that the motion for judgment would be sustained the following colloquy between court and counsel for plaintiff occurred :</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\u201cMr. Wall: I will ask if the Court will allow me to call a witness back ?</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">\u201cThe Court: No. I have heard all of the testimony I care to hear. If you can\u2019t show that she is the adopted mother of the deceased, or the mother of the deceased, you haven\u2019t any case, no matter what you can show. So there isn\u2019t any use in taking up any time in covering it.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">s}i ijc 5}c <em>% %</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">\u201cThe motion of the defendant will be sustained, and upon presentation of the proper order and findings the same will be entered of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">\u201cMr. Wall: We have an exception?</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">\u201cThe Court: Let the record show the plaintiff excepts to the ruling of the court and the exception is allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">Although plaintiff excepted to the ruling of the court refusing to permit her to call a witness back, we cannot say that the court erred or that there was an abuse of discretion in so ruling. In her brief plaintiff says that had she been permitted to call a witness as requested the testimony would have shown that at the time of the trial the deceased\u2019s paternal grandmother and a sister and two brothers of his deceased mother were living, all of whom were heirs of the deceased. Plaintiff, however, did not disclose to the court even the substance of the additional testimony she desired to introduce; neither did she move for a new trial nor for relief from the judgment on the ground of inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect under Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-15\">Having found no reversible error in the record the judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b565-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
