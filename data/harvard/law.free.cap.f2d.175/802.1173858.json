The appellant, a defendant below, is the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and En-ginemen, an unincorporated association, hereafter sometimes referred to as the Brotherhood. Other defendants were \u25a0subordinate Lodge No. <em>7 </em>(the \u201cPotomac\u201d Lodge) and Lodge No. 532 (the \u201cNational Capitol\u201d Lodge) of the Brotherhood \u25a0composed principally of members residing in the District of Columbia; Marvin M. McQuade, Recording Secretary and Financial Secretary of Lodge No. 7, and William E. Lacey, Recording Secretary of Lodge No. 532, residents of the District of Columbia; the Southern Railway Company, the Seaboard Air Line Railway Company, and t'he Atlantic Coast Line Railway Company, interstate carriers operating along the eastern seaboard, hereafter referred to as the carriers. Other railroad companies intervened. Neither they nor *\u00bbhe \u201cother defendants\u201d mentioned above are parties to this appeal. The appellees, plaintiffs below, are 21 Negro firemen -employees of the carriers. Their complaint in the District Court charged: that the Brotherhood by virtue of its constitution. and practices restricts its membership to white locomotive firemen and enginemen; that its members have constituted the majority of the craft or class of locomotive firemen on most of the interstate railroads \u25a0of the United States, including the defendant carriers, and that in consequence the Brotherhood has, pursuant to the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 151, et seq.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> continuously acted as \u25a0sole bargaining agent for the entire class \u25a0of locomotive firemen, including Negro firemen; that as such sole bargaining agent the Brotherhood has negotiated agreements and arrangements with the carriers, including an agreement of February 18, 1941, between the Southeastern Carriers\u2019 Conference Committee and the Brotherhood, discriminating against colored firemen and depriving them of rights and job assignments to which their seniority entitled them; that pursuant to these agreements and arrangements seniority rights to favored job assignments have \u25a0been denied the appellees and other Negro firemen. The appellees sued on their own \u25a0behalf and on behalf of all others similarly situated. Their complaint expressly founded the action upon the Railway Labor Act and the Constitution of the United States. The complaint sought: a determination of the appellees\u2019 rights and the \u25a0rights of others similarly situated; a permanent injunction against any further discriminatory practices; an order directing restoration of jobs from which appellees \u25a0and other Negro firemen had been unlawfully displaced; a permanent injunction restraining the Brotherhood from purporting to act as representative of the appellees or as representative of the class or \u25a0craft of locomotive firemen under the Railway Labor Act so long as it does not fairly \u25a0represent all members thereof, including \u25a0the Negro firemen; damages for loss of employment and wages by reason of the discriminatory practices; and a preliminary injunction pending final hearing and determination of the cause. The appellees supplemented their complaint by a motion for a preliminary injunction restraining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>further discrimination and loss of job assignments pending final determination of the action. The appellant Brotherhood moved to dismiss the action upon the grounds that venue was improperly <em>chosen, </em>that the Brotherhood was not properly served, and-that other actions in which the subject matter and parties were the same as in the instant case were pending in other district courts.- The trial court denied this motion and entered an order issuing the preliminary injunction prayed for.' The present, appeal'is from ,that or,-der. In addition to urging that the court erroneously -denied the motion-to dismiss, the Brotherhood asserts also on the appeal that the preliminary injunction, was issued in defiance of -the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101, et seq., and that it was erroneously issued also in that it altered rather than preserved the -status quo existing prior to the commencement of the suit. In the view we take it is necessary to rule only upon the question-of the -propriety of the venue of the action. Further facts relating to a determination of that question are stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The venue statute applicable to the United States courts generally, 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 112 (1946), provides that \u201cno civil suit shall be brought in' any' district court against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant . . . <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">An unincorporated association \u2014 the Brotherhood, as, above stated, is such \u2014 is an \u201cinhabitant\u201d only of the district in which is located its principal pl-ace of business. It was so ruled in Sperry Products v. Association of American Railroads, 2 Cir., 1942, 132 F.2d 408, 145 A.L.R. 694, where the meaning of the word inhabitant for determination of venue for the commencement of patent infringement suits under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 (1940), was in issue in respect of the' defendant American Association of Railroads, an unincorporated association.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Recognizing that inhabitancy should be attributed to such an association \u201cas though it were a single jural person and not an aggregate,\u201d the court in that case, speaking through Learned Hand, Circuit Judge, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-12\">. . . Whether an individual is an \u201cinhabitant'\u2019 of any place other than his home wo need not inquire; the word lias no better defined outlines than \u201cdomicile\u201d, or \u201cresidence\u201d; all we need say hero is that it was used to indicate some more permanent attachment than that of \u201ca regular and established place of business\u201d; and in the case of individuals other ties than occupational were certainly included. In the case of a corporation we may assume that it can be an \u201cinhabitant\u201d only of the state of its incorporation, Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, 308 U.S. 165, 60 S.Ct. 153, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>84 L.Ed. 167, 328 A.L.R. 1437; but even so, that will not serve as a test if there be several judicial districts in that state. Since a corporation can have no other activities than occupational, we are forced to choose among these; and it seems to us that we can only choose that place where its principal activities take place; its principal place of business. If so, the same test must apply to an unincorporated association with the added limitation that as to it no state or incorporation exists to disturb the test in application. . . . [132 F.2d at 411]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">An affidavit filed in support of the Brotherhood\u2019s motion to dismiss stated that the principal place of business of the Brotherhood is Cleveland, Ohio, and the constitution of the Brotherhood which was made a part of the record of the hearing on the motion to dismiss so provides. No counter-affidavit was filed. It may therefore be taken as established \u2014 it is indeed apparently not in dispute \u2014 that the principal place of business of the Brotherhood, and therefore its inhabitancy, is Cleveland, Ohio. It follows that if the Federal venue statute governs, the venue in the instant case was mischosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">There is, however, a local statute, that is, one enacted by Congress under Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 17, applicable to the District of Columbia alone, which provides that no action shall be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by original process against any person \u201cwho shall not be an inhabitant of, <em>or found within, </em>the District, except as otherwise specially provided.\u201d (Italics supplied) D.C.Code (1940) \u00a7 11 \u2014 308. It is contended by the appellees that that statute may be looked to for support of the venue in the instant case and that it is satisfied on the facts, that is to say, that the Brotherhood may properly be said to be \u201cfound\u201d within the District, by virtue of its having therein the office of its \u201cnational legislative representative.\u201d But we need not determine whether the Bfotherhood is thus \u201cfound\u201d within .the District since, for the reasons set forth below, we think the Federal venue statute governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\"> In O\u2019Donoghue v. United States, 1933, 289 U.S. 516, 53 S.Ct. 740, 77 L.Ed. 1356, the Supreme Court held that the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (now the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit) are constitutional courts of the United States ordained and established under Article III of the Constitution. This holding is predicated upon recognition that those courts are \u201ccourts of the United States, vested generally with the same jurisdiction as that possessed by the inferior federal courts located elsewhere in respect of the cases enumerated in \u00a7 2 of Art. Ill,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which provides that \u201cThe judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law a-nd equity, arising under this Constitution, [and] the laws of the United, States . . ..\u201d The holding is based upon a recognition 'further that \u201cthe judicial power thus conferred is not and cannot be affected by tbe additional congressional legislation enacted under Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 17, imposing upon such courts other duties, which, because that special power is limited to the District, Congress cannot impose upon inferior federal courts elsewhere. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It follows that legislation enacted by Congress applicable to the inferior Federal courts in the exercise of Article III power is not and cannot be affected by legislation enacted by Congress under Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 17, and therefore that the Federal venue statute enacted by Congress for the .guidance of the inferior Federal courts exercising judicial power under Article III is not and cannot be affected by a local venue statute enacted by Congress, applicable to the courts in the District of Columbia, under Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 17. If the local statute, requiring for venue only that a defendant be \u201cfound\u201d within the! District, is applied in support of venue in the instant case, which requires the exercise of Article III power, the local statute does affect, indeed it nullifies, the FederaL venue statute requiring inhabitancy for venue, the defendant Brotherhood not being an inhabitant of the District. Even in cases founded upon diversity jurisdiction, only, a local statute does not affect the operation of a Federal venue statute. Thus in Doyle v. Loring, 6 Cir., 1939, 107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>F.2d 337, it was held that, as to proceedings in a United States district court, a statutory provision of the state of Tennessee considered by the Court of Appeals to be in effect a venue statute, was ineffectual to render nugatory the specific venue requirements of the general Federal venue statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 (Supp. 1938). The court stated that \u201cvenue established by a Federal statute cannot be impaired or annulled by a State statute.\u201d (107 F.2d at 340) The local venue statute \u2014 enacted by Congress under Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 17\u2014 relied upon by the appellees in the instant case, is, in its relation to the Federal venue statute, comparable to a state statute. In short, as applied to all cases which require the exercise by an inferior Federal court of the judicial power conferred by Article III, a general Federal venue statute i'S exclusive in its operation. It is not to be thought that Congress intended that a defendant sued in a case requiring the exercise of such power should have less protection' in respect of venue when the suit is commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia than he would have if the suit had been commenced in any other United States district court also exercising Article III power.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">The appellees contend, 'however, that the instant suit may, as against the Brotherhood, be regarded as a class suit, brought against the two local lodges of the Brotherhood and McQuade and Lacey as representatives within Rule 23(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., providing that \u201cIf persons constituting a 'class are so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all before the court, such of them, one or more, as will 'fairly insure the adequate representation of all may, on behalf of all, sue or be sued, when the character of the right sought to be enforced for or against the class is (1) joint, or common, or secondary . . And the appellees assert that since the two local lodges and Mc-Quade and Lacey are inhabitants of the District, the inhabitancy requirement of the Federal venue statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 (1946), is satisfied. The appellees rely upon Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, 4 Cir., 1945, 148 F.2d 403. Therein an action against the same Brotherhood as was a defendant and is the appellant in the instant case, to restrain it and the Norfolk Southern Railway Company from enforcing, among others, the same allegedly discriminatory collective bargaining agreement as is involved in the instant case, was held to he sustainable as a class action by virtue of its having been brought against a local lodge of the Brotherhood and one Munden, the chairman of that lodge, who were sued as defendants and served. But the action\u2019was sustained as a class suit because the Court of Appeals was of the view that as a matter of fact the subordinate lodge and the individual sued and served were fairly, representative of the membership of the Brotherhood. It said: \u201cIt cannot be contended with any show of reason that Munden and the subordinate lodge, who were admittedly served, were not fairly representative of the membership of the brotherhood or that service upon, them would not give adequate notice to the class sued to come in and defend . . ..\u201d (148 F.2d at 406) This view of the Court of Appeals in the Tunstall -case was warranted because the record in that case discloses that members of the local lodge which was sued and served and the chairman sued and served were employees of the Norfolk Southern Railway Company which was itself a party to the allegedly discriminatory collective bargaining agreements. They, therefore, had an interest in the outcome of the suit coextensive with that of the Brotherhood itself. They were among the employees concerning whom the agreements were made.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But in the instant case, although it is alleged in the complaint that the two local lodges and McQuade and Lacey are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>truly representative of the Brotherhood and that they are sued as representatives, there is no finding to that effect, and on the record there is no basis for such a finding. It is not alleged in the complaint that the members of the local lodges were employees of the defendant carriers; and the testimony of Lacey, Recording Secretary of Lodge No. 532, shows that the members of that lodge were not such employees .but were on the contrary employees of the Washington Terminal Company and were therefore not affected by the allegedly discriminatory collective bargaining agreement which was the subject of the instant action. It therefore does not appear in the instant case that the two local lodges and McQuade and Lacey had an interest in the outcome of the suit which was co-extensive with that of the Brotherhood. This is an essential element of a true class suit under Rule 23(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Moore\u2019s Federal Practice (1938 ed.) \u00a7 23.03, pp. 2232-2233. The author there states that the \u201crepresentative must have an interest, which is co-extensive and wholly compatible with the -interests of those whom he would represent.\u201d The requirement of Rule 23(a) that the class representatives sued must be such \u201cas will fairly insure the adequate representation of all\u201d is but a reflection of the requirements of due process. Cf. Hansberry v. Lee, 1940, 311 U.S. 32, 61 S.Ct. 115, 85 L.Ed. 22, 132 A.L.R 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">It follows from the foregoing that, in view of the law as it stood at the time of the trial court\u2019s action, the motion of the appellant Brotherhood for dismissal of the instant suit for lack of proper venue should have been granted and therefore that the order issuing the preliminary injunction should not have been entered. But an addition to the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1406(a), effective September 1, 1948, provides that \u201cThe district -court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\u201d Except where vested interests have intervened an appellate court must decide a case according to the law as it exists, whether in statutory form or in -the form of judicial decision, at the time of its decision rather than according to the law as it existed at the time of the decision below. Ruppert v. Ruppert, 1942, 77 U.S.App.D.C. 65, 134 F.2d 497. Accordingly the ruling of the trial court that venue was properly laid in the District of Columbia is held erroneous and the order\u2019 issuing the preliminary injunction is reversed and the case remanded to- the trial court and that.court is directed to transfer the case to the northern district of Ohio in which is situated the city of Cleveland wherein, as above pointed out, the Brotherhood has its inhabitancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-11\"> It is provided in Section 152: \" . . .
