Appellant fully familiar with War Assets Administration sales, and with the necessity of veterans\u2019 priority certificates, was examining brochures or catalogs which disclosed the necessity of such priorities, when he asked Hildebrand to get him these trucks, offering to pay him $200 for each truck secured. Hildebrand told appellant that he was using veteran priorities of Czaki, another defendant, and executed the mail order request for the trucks, Exhibit 5, in order to carry out appellant\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-23\">Thus, the fact that Hildebrand, with Czaki\u2019s approval and appellant\u2019s knowledge, was making use of a veteran\u2019s \u201cpink slip\u201d, or certification for veteran\u2019s preference, issued some months before, does not alter the fact that neither Czaki nor Hildebrand had any real interest in the proposed purchases, that the trucks were being acquired for appellant, that this fact was fraudulently concealed, that the veterans never possessed or even saw the trucks, that appellant paid the government price for them, paying Hildebrand $400 for his part in the transaction, which was divided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>with Czaki; \u2014 in- short, that appellant succeeded in doing precisely what the law and the regulations prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">What we have said disposes of the claim that Hildebrand and Czaki were purchasing these trucks as veterans for resale. Appellant asserts that when he dealt with'Hildebrand he thought the latter w\u00e1s a dealer, from whom the trucks were to be purchased. The government\u2019s evidence was sufficient,'if believed by the jury, to disclose that De Bon was the real purchaser from the War Assets' Administration, that in accomplishing that object he asked Hildebrand to file the mail order request mentioned in the indictment, and that when this was done, all of the defendants participated in the misrepresentation and concealment charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We find no evidence that Hildebrand was introduced to appellant as a veteran dealer, and we perceive no reason why the jury should have been instructed on such theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
