By its terms the insured was required to make monthly reports of the value of stock on hand and the amount of non-provisional insurance carried on the stock. The coverage of the provisional policy, with certain qualifications noted later herein, was the difference between these two amounts. Premium adjustments were to be made annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-21\">The value of the stock destroyed by fire is admitted to be $121,410.31. During the period in question appellee was actually carrying non-provisional insurance in the sum of $33,333.00. Through mistake ap-pellee reported the amount of non-provisional insurance as $50,000. In settling for the fire loss appellant used $50,000, the amount of the reported non-provisional insurance, in arriving at its liability. Appel-lee contended, and the trial court found, that $33,333, the actual amount of non-provisional insurance carried by it, should have 'been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-22\">A solution of the problem presented requires recourse to the terms of the insurance contract. The contract must be construed so as to effect the intent of the parties. The policy, including the standard stock form attached thereto, sets forth in \u00a7\u00a7 5A, 5B, 5C and 5D, of paragraph 5, a specific formula to be followed in ascertaining the amount of insurance in force at a given time.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-23\">Section 5A reads: \u201cAs of the time at which insurance in force is to be determined, ascertain the value, as defined in paragraph 4, in such location.\u201d The value of the stock, as defined in paragraph 4, is admitted to be $121,410.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-24\">Section 5B reads: \u201cDeduct from this value the amount of any non-provisional insurance against the hazards covered hereunder on said stock.\u201d It is agreed that the actual amount of non-provisional insurance in effect at the time of the loss was $33,333. The sum of $88,076.96, obtained by deducting from the value of the goods the actual amount of non-provisional insurance, in accordance with \u00a7 5B, is less than the \u201climit of insurance\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5D <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>and is the amount, less salvage, to which appellee claims it was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Appellant, on the other hand,' contends that \u00a7 SC entitles it, appellant, to a further deduction in computing the amount of insurance, to the extent of appellee\u2019s overstatement of non-provisional insurance, to-wit, $16,667.00. The argument is that the words \u201cstatement of value last filed <em>by </em>insured in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3\u201d refer to the documentary report called for in paragraph 3, which includes both the value of the stock on hand and the amount of non-provisional insurance on such stock. By subtracting the latter from the former the result obtained is claimed by appellant to be an under-reporting of value of stock within the contemplation of \u00a7 SC.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Section 5C protects the insurer from under-reporting of value of stock by the insured. but in no manner does it concern the reports of non-provisional insurance. This remains true even though appellant\u2019s contention that the term \u201cstatement of value\u201d refers to the entire report rather than the value of insured stock, be accepted. The report contained one column for listing stock values and another for non-provisional insurance. Applying the provisions of \u00a7 SC, which operates only in the event the statement of value is \u201cless than the actual value\u201d, the statement of stock value, made by appellee, is admittedly correct and the statement of the amount non-provisional insurance was not <em>less </em>but <em>more </em>than the actual amount held.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">A sound construction of the phrase \u201cstatement of value\u201d as used in \u00a7 5C is to hold that it relates to reports of insured\u2019s stock values. Paragraph 4 reads in part \u201c * * * wherever the term \u2018value\u2019 is used in this form it shall apply in the manner set forth in sections (4a), (4b) and (4c) * * * \u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These sections limit the term \u201cvalue\u201d to the value of the stock and not an arithmetical sum of stock values and the amount of non-provisional insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">Again, in \u00a7 SA .the word \u201cvalue\u201d is used. There it obviously refers to the value of the stock; otherwise no necessity for \u00a7 5B to call for a deduction of the amount of non-provisional insurance would exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">In paragraph 7 of the policy it is stated that: \u201cThe premium earned * * * shall be determined * * * based on the average of values filed * * * but no premium shall be charged * * * on any value protected by non-provisional insurance against the hazards covered hereunder reported in accordance with paragraph 3.\u201d The term \u201caverage of values\u201d as used in the above context again must refer to the value of the stock; otherwise the ensuing qualification with respect to non-provisional insurance would be redundant. The word value, as used in various places in the policy, is thus seen to consistently require a reference to value of the stock without regard to deductions of non-provisional. insurance amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-14\">Appellant complains that it cannot collect a premium for the additional -coverage resulting from the overstatement of non-provisional insurance because paragraph 7 prohibits premiums on values protected by non-provisional insurance \u201creport<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ed in accordance with paragraph 3.\u201d It is sufficient to say that the $50,000 amount of non-provisional insurance was not reported in accordance with paragraph 3, since that paragraph requires a truthful statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Reduced to simple terms the contract of insurance in this case is not ambiguous. It was designed to meet a situation not covered by ordinary insurance. In the business conducted by appellee the value of the stock on hand fluctuated from week to week and month to month. This form of insurance gave a maximum of protection. It was the desire of appellee to have full protection at all times. Appellant undertook, for a fee, to furnish that protection. What did appellant agree to do? Simply to afford insurance on the value of the stock carried less the amount of insurance carried by appel-lee in other policies. Appellee agreed to pay a premium on that value. These parties, in entering into the contract, acted in good faith; hence, what did they intend? We think nothing more or less than coverage for actual values less a deduction of the actual amount of other insurance carried by appellee. An honest mistake was made by appellee in reporting. What did appellant stand to lose in the event the error was not discovered? Loss of premium payments. The error has been discovered and appellant can and will be placed in the same position it would have been had the error not been made. In fact the premium rate was adjusted on an annual basis and who can say that the error would not have been discovered before the date of adjustment arrived. Appellant was at all times in a position to protect itself by demanding proof of the amount of non-provisional insurance carried; quite a different situation from a report on values. The opportunity for fraud in the reporting of values exists to an extent where an insurer is unable to readily protect itself and it is to the prevention of such fraud the terms of the policy are primarily directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Appellant, while conceding that no fraud exists in the instant case, argues that unless the appellee he held to strict accountability for its honest mistake, fraud may be encouraged in other instances. We fail to understand how a recognition of the fact that an honest mistake has not violated the terms of a contract can in any manner encourage fraudulent dealings. Where transactions are tinged with fraud courts are quick to strike them down and that is what the courts did and why they did it in the cases cited by appellant. Wallace v. World Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., D.C., 70 F.Supp. 193, affirmed by this court without opinion in 166 F.2d 571, is not in point. While that case did involve a provisional stock form insurance policy, the insured there understated the values of his stocks, so that tlr\u00bb-* \u201chonesty clause\u201d, similar to \u00a7 5C in the instant case, directly applied. In this case the stock values were correctly reportea, and hence, \u00a7 5C has no application. Other cases cited by appellant, as we have said, involve fraudulent misrepresentations, and invoke an entirely different set of legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Appellant argues that failure of appellee to make correct reports of non-provisional insurance constituted a breach of a promissory warranty. There is no stipulation, provision or agreement in the insurance policy to the effect that appellee\u2019s failure to furnish true reports shall constitute a condition or warranty. Such a stipulation, provision or agreement is required \u2022under the laws of Oregon (which control here), in the absence of which, the provisions in the policy under consideration in this case must be construed as a simple covenant.
