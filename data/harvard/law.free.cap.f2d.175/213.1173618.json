This contract was one of private carriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-24\">The molasses w?s loaded upon the \u201cJean Sarazen,\u201d the \u201cBrewer,\u201d the \u201cMargaret M.,\u201d and the \u201cMary M.,\u201d four tank barges belonging to respondent, and these barges, in tandem tow of the tug \u201cGramercy,\u201d started upon the voyage. All went well until the flotilla reached Hav.erstraw, on the Hudson River, at about 5 P. M. on October 27, 1944. The tug captain, thinking navigation through the Tappan Zee inadvisable owing to unfavorable conditions of wind and weather, tied up the flotilla to a dolphin. But, around Midnight, the wind and waves had moderated somewhat so the voyage to New York City was resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-25\">When the flotilla left Buffalo, each of the four barges was manned by a barge captain. At Troy, however, the barge captain of the stern barge, the \u201cMary M.,\u201d left the flotilla, with an understanding that his wages were to be divided among the captains of the three other barges, including the captain of the barge \u201cSarazen,\u201d who was also flotilla captain. It seems that the captain of the tug \u201cGramercy\u201d was not familiar with this arrangement. Accordingly, when the flotilla left Plaver-straw, the heavily laden stern barge, the \u201cMary M.,\u201d was unmanned.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-26\">As the flotilla proceeded down the Hudson River, the wind freshened and about 7 A. M., October 28, the barges began to bump together. The space between the barges was increased from about 2 feet to between 4 feet and 5 feet by paying out the lines between the barges but no further effort seems to have been made to increast the distance between the barges.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Around 8 A. M., the lines parted between the \u201cSarazen\u201d (the leading barge) and the second barge, the \u201cBrewer.\u201d The tug \u201cGramercy,\u201d with the \u201cSarazen,\u201d proceeded to Yonkers, leaving the three other barges adrift, with the \u201cMary M.\u201d unmanned. Then, after mooring the \u201cSar-azen,\u201d the tug returned to pick up the other three barges.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">While the tug was absent from the flotilla, the port lug line between the \u201cMargaret M.\u201d and the \u201cMary M.\u201d parted. The \u201cMary M.\u201d then swung around on her starboard lug line and her starboard side brought up against the starboard side of the Margaret M.\u201d For a period of time the two barges pounded each other. Then the \u201cMary M.\u2019s\u201d starboard side overrode the starboard side of the \u201cMargaret M.\u201d This caused the \u201cMargaret M.\u201d to list heavily to starboard, her starboard rail was submerged, the viscous molasses in her tanks crept to starboard and the barge capsized. In overturning, the \u201cMargaret M.\u201d struck the \u201cMary M.,\u201d thus damaging the \u201cMary M.\u201d and causing the loss of some of the molasses on the \u201cMary M.\u201d The cargo of molasses on the \u201cMargaret M.\u201d was a total loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The District Judge filed no opinion. In a very brief memorandum decision, he stated: \u201cI do not think libellant has established either unseaworthiness or negligence proximately causing the loss.\u201d He filed findings of fact (six in number), which omitted any reference to the absence of the bargee from the \u201cMary M.,\u201d and three conclusions of law. These findings and conclusions were prepared' by proctors for respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">We cannot overturn the finding of the District Judge that the barges \u201cMargaret M.\u201d and \u201cMary M.\u201d were seaworthy. There was testimony to the contrary by libellant\u2019s surveyor, Bagger, who examined the barge \u201cMargaret M.\u201d in dry dock, after the accident; while respondent\u2019s surveyor, Wilkie, also the witness Haug, gave evidence that the barge was seaworthy. The resolution of such evidential conflicts is \u25a0primarily the function of the District Judge and we cannot say here that his finding of seaworthiness is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Nor are we concerned here chiefly with questions of presumptions, burden of proof and the duty of going forward with the evidence. These are discussed at some length in the well known case of Commercial Molasses Corporation v. New York Tank Barge Corporation, 2 Cir., 114 F.2d 248, 251, affirmed 314 U.S. 104, 62 S.Ct. 156, 86 L.Ed. 89. And, in the light of that case, these were treated (by the writer of this opinion) in Richmond Sand &amp; Gravel Corporation v. Tidewater Construction Corporation, 4 Cir., 170 F.2d 392. We prefer to rest our decision, reversing the decree below, upon the basis that the preponderance of the evidence here (coming practically all from employees of respondent) and the whole picture viewed in its entirety, lead clearly to the conclusion that the respondent was guilty of negligence which caused libellant\u2019s loss. We discuss briefly what appear to us as the more salient features in the picture which occasion our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">High up on this list is the absence, at the time of the accident, of a bargee on the \u201cMary M.,\u201d the rear barge in the flotilla. There was evidence that in a tow of this kind, it is customary to have a bargee on each loaded barge, while the witness Hamilton (whose experience in towing barges on the Hudson River was quite extensive) gave as his opinion: \u201cEach scow or each boat should have had a captain.\u201d And here there was a bargee on the \u201cMary M.\u201d when the flotilla left Buffalo. There was further testimony (by more than one witness) of the normal duties of a bargee as to his barge, such as watching the lines and paying them out when occasion demands, sounding the barge, seeing that the barge 'follows properly the barge ahead, reporting any situations offering peril to the barge and generally guarding the barge from harm. The \u201cMary M.,\u201d too, was the last barge in a tow, loaded with molasses in tanks. Obviously, there was much here that might have been done to avert the accident (but which was not done and could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>been done) had there been a bargee on the \u201cMary M.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">A not unimportant fact here is the parting of not one but two tow ropes between the barges \u2014 first the rope between the \u201cSarazen\u201d and the \u201cBrewer,\u201d then the rope between the \u201cMargaret M.\u201d and the \u201cMary M.\u201d We note, too, the failure to pay out further these ropes, which would have eased the strain on the ropes and might have prevented their parting.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Open to question at least was the conduct here of the captain of the tug \u201cGra-mercy.\u201d He started from Haverstraw before dawn in October through the Tappan Zee with adverse weather conditions \u2014 a northerly wind and an incoming tide. And, apparently, he neither secured, nor even .adequately attempted to secure, reports or indications of the probable situations of wind, wave or weather that he might have to face. We note, too, when the rope broke between the barges \u201cSarazen\u201d and \u201cBrewer,\u201d his decision to leave the scene, with the loaded barges adrift. Captains of tugs are not required to be either wizards or prophets yet it might well be asked whether under the circumstances here attendant, something at'least similar to what .actually happened did or did not belong in the realm of the probable or the expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The bargee of the \u201cBrewer,\u201d stationing himself at the stern of his barge with a large timber, was able to ward off the \u201cMargaret M.\u201d when she began to ride up on her line. There is no evidence that -the bargee of the \u201cMargaret M,\u201d took similar, or any effective, action to ward off the \u201cMary M.\u201d On the \u201cMary M.\u201d there -was no one to take any action whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The cargo here was molasses stored in \u25a0 deck tanks on the barges. When a barge listed, the molasses would creep slowly toward the side of the list; but when, after ..a list, the barge began to right itself, this \u2022 thick, viscous liquid (unlike a lighter, \u25a0thinner liquid) did not quickly flow back -to help in the righting of the barge. Here, at least, was an added and foreseeable 'hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Accordingly, the decree of the District \u00a1Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that Court with instructions to enter a decree in favor of the libellant and for such further action as such a decree might prompt.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
