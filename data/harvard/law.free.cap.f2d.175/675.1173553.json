It is true that the company did write a policy letter stating clearly that whether employees did or did not join the union was a matter for their own decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>and the company could not, and would not, interfere with that action. We think, though, that when the questions and statements complained of are taken not merely by themselves but in the connection in which they were made, it may not he said that the Board\u2019s findings, that there was interference with self-organization are without support in the evidence and the cease and desist provisions of the order are, therefore, contrary to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Upon respondent\u2019s other points, however, we are in full agreement with it. As to the Ethridge discharge, this court, before the amendment of the National Labor Relations Act, held<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> without varying that membership in a union is not a guarantee against discharge and that when real grounds for discharge exist, the management may not be prevented because o\u00ed union membership from discharging.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The amendment to the act was intended to, and did, give legislative approval to these views and corresponding disapproval to the practices of examiners and board to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The evidence leaves in no doubt that this is another case, though not quite as aggravated a one, as in National labor Relations Board v. Williamson-Dickie Mfg. Co., 5 Cir., 130 F.2d at page 265, of an employee feeling that with the union back of her and the board back of the union, she could not be discharged for cause. In view of the undisputed testimony as to the many defective bags which in the last three weeks she had continued to make, and that when bad work was brought to her and called to her attention she merely laughed, it is exceedingly difficult for us to understand how, in the light of the decisions and the act, examiner and board could, under this evidence, have reached the conclusion they did, that she could not be discharged. But understandable or not, the conclusion was certainly unwarranted, and enforcement of the order giving effect to it will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">As to Long, here again it is difficult to understand the reasoning processes which produced the finding of discrimination. It is quite clear that they derive no \u25a0support from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">Finally, as to the gratuitous, the volunteered findings of examiner and board, without charge or complaint to support them, that respondent discriminated in respect of Smith, Rose, Longmire, Kelley, and Guthrie, and the consequent condemnation of respondent for having done so, we find no warrant in the statute, none in the elementary conceptions of procedural justice for them. It is true that no consequences were visited upon respondent as a result of these findings, no doubt because it was clearly seen that to punish, as well as to condemn, without a charge and a \u25a0hearing on the charge would be shocking to fundamental conceptions of justice. It yet remains that the findings were made with the purpose and intent that they should have some weight against, and effect upon, respondent, and respondent is entitled to have them here reviewed and disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">Upon the case as a whole, we are of the opinion that the petition to the extent that it seeks enforcement of the cease and desist portions of the order should he granted, but that to the extent that it seeks enforcement of the remedial provisions by way of reinstatement and back pay, it should be denied and the order vacated and set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-15\">An appropriate decree granting in part and denying in part the enforcement prayed may be presented for entry.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\"> There are: (1) cease and desist from (a) discouraging membership in the Union by discharging or discriminating against any of its employees; and (b) interfering with its employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">(2) take the following affirmative action (a) offer Ruby Ethridge re-instatement; (b) make her whole for loss of pay; (c) make H. 0. Long whole for loss of pay resulting from discrimination; (d) post notices; (e) notify the director.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-12\"> Cf. National Labor Relations Board v.
