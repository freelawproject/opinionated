Co. v. Martin, 283 U.S. 209, 51 S.Ct. 453, 456, 75 L.Ed. 983. But there the Court was at pains to explain that the testimony of the witness' \u2014 not as to something he did, saw or heard on a specific occasion, but as to what, in ordinary circumstances, was a reasonable time for delivery of a shipment by a railroad company \u2014 was \u201cso completely corroborated by the undisputed facts * * * as to put it beyond the reach of a fair doubt.\u201d The rule, absent such qualifications, has been rejected in several states,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and has little to commend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>it rationally.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the \u25a0 demeanor of an orally-testifying witness is \u201calways assumed to be in <em>evidence.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is \u201cwordless language.\u201d The liar\u2019s story may seem uncontradicted to one who merely reads it, yet it may be \u201ccontradicted\u201d in the trial court by his manner, his intonations, his grimaces, his gestures, and the like \u2014 all matters which, \u201ccold print does not preserve\u201d and which constitute \u201clost evidence\u201d so far as an upper court is concerned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For such a court, it has been said, even if it were called a \u201crehearing court,\u201d is not a \u201creseeing court.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> only were we to have \u201ctalking movies\u201d of trials could it be otherwise. A \u201cstenographic transcript correct in every detail fails to reproduce tones of voice and hesitations of speech that often make a sentence mean the reverse of what the words signify. The best and most accurate record is like a dehydrated peach; it has neither the substance nor the flavor of the fruit before it was dried.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It resembles a pressed flower. Tfye witness\u2019 demeanor, not apparent in the record, may alone have \u201cimpeached\u201d him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The alleged \u201crule,\u201d if taken literally, would return us to the practice of \u201ctrial by deposition,\u201d which common-law procedure rejected and which, in recent years, has been rejected in federal noncommon law trials as well.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Without doubt, the result of our procedure is to vest the trial judge with immense power not subject to correction even if misused: His estimate of an orally testifying witness\u2019 credibility may stem from the trial judge\u2019s application of an absurd rule-of-thumb, such as that when a witness wipes his hands during his testimony, unquestionably he is lying;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but, unless the judge reveals of record that he used suc'h an irrational test of credibility, an upper court can do nothing to correct his error. We thus have what Tourtoulon called the \u201csovereignty\u201d of the trial judge. Demean- or, to be sure, is no infallible guide to reliability of testimony; yet, as matters now stand, it is one of the best guides available.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">We shall, however, assume, arguendo, that the rule prevails in the federal courts. Even so, it will not avail plaintiffs. For among the exceptions to the rule is this: It is inapposite if the witness has an \u201cinterest.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The mere fact that he is an ordinary employee may not be enough to show such an interest where,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as in the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio case, his testimony is \u201ccompletely corroborated by the undisputed facts.\u201d But here the witness was not only a general employee of the plaintiff, Peer International Corp., sole owner of the copyrights to seven of the songs, but he had been specifically requested \u25a0 by the plaintiff, Broadcast Music, Inc. (the exclusive licensee of the copyrights), to act as a sort of detective in obtaining the very evidence as to which he testified. The trial judge correctly said that such a witness is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u201cinterested.\u201d Hostetter v. Bower, C. C., <em>74 </em>F. 235; Hennessy v. Wine Growers\u2019 Association, D. C., 212 F. 308, 310. As Castro\u2019s testimony had no corroboration, this case comes within the \u201cinterest\u201d exception to the rule. We may not, then, disregard the trial judge\u2019s finding of fact based obviously on his disbelief of the testimony on which plaintiffs rely.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">It is suggested that the judge believed Castro but refused to accept his testimony solely because it was not corroborated. We do not so read the judge\u2019s opinion. We think he had the \u201cuncontradicted witness\u201d rule in mind, and, accordingly, pointed to the witness\u2019 interest and to the lack of corroboration in order to bring the case within the exception. Plaintiffs urge that some of the other reasons assigned by the judge are unsound. We need not consider whether or not that is true, for we think it enough that he gave a sound reason.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-6\"> See Quock Ting v.

' In the statement of these two rules the courts sometimes give preference to the power of the jury, and sometimes, on the other hand, require the jury to accept uncontradicted testimony unless there is some apparent reason against. it.\u201d 8 A.L.R. 796, 797.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\"> Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 949.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Ast\"> Morris Plan Industrial Bank v.

See Moore, Facts (1908) \u00a7\u00a7 1048-1050. They prefer more polite locutions, such as saying his testimony was \u201clatitudinous\u201d; see Mr. Justice Baldwin in Poole v. Nixon, 19 Fed. Cas. 992, at p. 998, No. 11,270.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">Moreover, as may well have been the case here, the judge may think the witness did not commit perjury but was honestly mistaken, because of bias or for other reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b133-17\"> Plaintiffs cite United States v.

It teaches that the findings of a trial judge may have somewhat less significance than that of a jury or that of some administrative agencies. It also teaches that a trial judge\u2019s finding may be \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d although apparently supported by oral testimony, where that testimony \u201cis in conflict with contemporaneous documents\u201d of such character that it would be unreasonable to believe what the wit- ' ness said.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
