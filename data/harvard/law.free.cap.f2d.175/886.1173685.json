Miles Raskoff and Gendel &amp; Chi-chester, Los Angeles, Cal., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b939-24\">Before: STEPHENS, BONE and ORR, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b939-25\">BONE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b939-26\">Appellee Kaye owned a house in Laguna Beach, California, which, on or about September 23, 1946, she rented to one Ann Mailo for $150 per month. This was the first rental of the premises and thus the law <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and applicable regulations thereunder <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>imposed upon appellee the duty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>filing a registration statement within 30 days disclosing the rent charged. Section 5(c) of the Rent Regulation's permits the Area Rent Director<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to' decrease that rent if it is higher than that which was generally prevailing in the area for comparable housing on March 1, 1942. Section 4(e) of the Rent Regulations provides that the rent decrease, if any, could be made retroactive to the commencement of the rental period if the Administrator found that the landlord was at fault in failing to register within the required time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These regulations are valid and thus have the force of statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The Area Rent Director found that ap-pellee had not filed the required statement within 30 days of renting the premises and that she was at fault. On May 19, 1947, the rental was ordered reduced to $75 per month effective from the first rental, and the excess ($600 for eight months of overcharges) refunded to the tenant within 30 days. ' Appellee does not question the rent reduction except in its retroactive aspect, i. e., the refund. This action was brought in the District Court by the Housing Expediter under Section 205(a) of the Act to compel restitution and he now appeals from an adverse judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Appellee states that within 30 days\u2019 of renting the premises she, by mail, requested and received from the Santa Ana, California, Office of Price Administration, forms for registering her house. . She asserts that she immediately filled out the forms sent to her and returned them by mail, making a copy for herself.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She states that she heard nothing more from the O. P. A. and in January of the following year she phoned the O. P. A. for information regarding the eviction of her tenant and was \u2022 informed that that office had no record of her having ever registered the premises. Forms were sent to appellee \u00e1nd she filled them in, allegedly copying the information from her copy of the first registration. She mailed this data to the proper office. Pursuant to&gt; an investigation based upon this registration, the rent reduction (and refund) order was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">The trial court found the order to be invalid, and that the appellee had properly-filed the registration within the 30 day-period.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">Section 204(d) of the Act provides that the validity of regulations or orders issued under section 2 shall be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Emergency Court of Appeals. However, section 205(a) provides that the Administrator may seek the ajppropriate court to enjoin violations of' section 204 or to compel compliance therewith. The issue thus presented is whether the refusal of a district court to enforce the order, in its retroactive aspect, is a determination that the order (in part) is invalid, a' determination jurisdictionally foreclosed to it and to ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">Congress intended to make inflation controls as effective as legislatively possible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Toward this goal, an expeditious, method of judicial review of administrative rent orders was adopted, and the Emergency Court of Appeals was invested with the-sole and exclusive jurisdiction of questions, involving the validity of such orders, subject only to the grant of certiorari by the-Supreme Court. The constitutional validity of this method is now beyond question.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A single method of review, although inconvenient does not offend against due process in this situation. Congress had in. mind two procedural objectives: one, a narrow but sufficient avenue of review of the regulations, and two, broad channels of enforcement. In the enforcement proced<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>ure, little more than the validity of the statutory provisions<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> plus the fact of violation of the regulation or order may be inquired into.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Two types of orders or regulations may be promulgated under section 2 of the Act, one general or legislative in nature, the other judicial in that it is directed against specific individuals.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is argued that the validity of the judicial type order is open to the court of enforcement. We do not agree. A method of protesting such orders has been provided and it must be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Section 4 of the Rent Regulation for Housing (10 F.R. 13528) provides that the landlord shall file a proper statement within the time specified and if he does not, the rent reduction, if any, shall be subject to refund to the tenant if the Administrator finds that the landlord was at fault in failing to timely file.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the Administrator finds the landlord not at fault, he \u201cmay relieve the landlord of the duty to refund.\u201d This is the language of discretion, permissive rather than mandatory. This is not inequitable; a person should not be permitted to retain that which is illegally acquired even through a mistake of legality.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">For the order to be retroactive, necessitating a refund, the landlord must be shown to not have timely registered. The administrative findings of fact underlying the retroactivity of the order are to be viewed in no different light<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> than those upon which the maximum rent figure of $75 per month was based, and we cannot conceive of the sufficiency of those facts being tested in the District Court. It would thus seem clear, in this situation, that the District Court is bound by these findings. The failure of the landlord to properly follow the procedure of review provided, results in a bar to contesting the enforcement action in the District Court. If this were not so, the purpose of Congress in providing the method of protest and in placing sole jurisdiction in the- Emergency Court in order to facilitate and expedite its rent policy, would be manifestly weakened. It is our conclusion that the District Court does not have jurisdiction to inquire into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>that which could have and should have been appealed to the Emergency Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">As a practical necessity, the enforcement procedure could not be other than in the hands of the local courts, but this situation does not relieve one who considers himself aggrieved from following the proper although narrow avenue of review. As stated by Mr. Justice Rutledge in Bowles v. Willingham,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cAccordingly, by declining to take the plain way opened to her, more inconvenient though that may have been, and taking her misconceived remedy by another route, she has arrived where she might well have expected, at the wrong end.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Appellee contends that she attacks not the validity but the \u201capplicability\u201d of the order. This obviously must fail since the order was explicit in itSi terms and specifically directed to the appellee.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">The judgment appealed from is accordingly reversed and the cause remanded with directions to enter judgment against appel-lee in the sum of $600, this being the amount of the overcharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">STEPHENS, Circuit Judge, did not participate in the decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-27\"> Emergency Price Control Act of 1.942, as amended, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 901 . et seq.
