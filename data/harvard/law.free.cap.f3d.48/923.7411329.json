We affirm. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-19\">Appellant Williams participated in the Plan which provides pension, disability, and death benefits to eligible participants. From 1978 until 1985, Williams earned 6.5 years of service credit. In 1986, when he was no longer earning service credits, Williams was injured in an automobile accident, but he did not claim Plan benefits. In 1987, the Trustees amended the Plan to increase the minimum service 'credits required to receive disability benefits from 5 to 10 years. Notice of the 1987 amendment was mailed to all participants, and it was attached to the Summary of Plan Descriptions (\u201cSPD\u201d) distributed to new participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-20\">Williams was injured in a second automobile accident in 1988. Thereafter, he applied for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) which determined that he was disabled in 1988. In 1990 Williams applied to the Plan for disability benefits.- The Plan .denied his application because^ although he was disabled in 1988, he did not have the required 10 years of service credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-21\">Williams sued the Plan contending that the terms of the SPD, which did not reflect the amendment, governed over the terms of the Plan. He also claims that his interest in the Plan vested in 1986, when he became disabled, and that the Trustees could not thereafter eliminate his interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Plan because: (1) The disability benefit provision of the Plan was an \u201cemployee <em>welfare </em>benefit plan\u201d rather than an \u201cemployee <em>pension </em>benefit plan\u201d and, consequently, it was not subject to the vesting, accrual, or nonforfeiture provisions of ERISA. (2) Regardless of the plan type, Williams\u2019 interest in the disability benefits could not accrue until 1988, the year that the Trustees determined Williams to be disabled. (3) The Trustees\u2019 disability determination was not an abuse of discretion. (4) The court rejected Williams\u2019 argument that the terms of the unmodified SPD controlled, and determined that the means employed by the Plan to notify its participants of the amendment comported with ERISA and its regulations. Williams appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">DISCUSSION:</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">Williams attacks the validity of the 1987 amendment increasing the minimum required service credits from 5 years to 10 years on several grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">\n<em>a. Does it violate ERISA\u2019s anti-cutback provision?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">Williams first argues that ERISA\u2019s \u00a7 204(g) prohibits the 1987 amendment because the amendment decreased his interest in a retirement-type subsidy. He, however, does not directly challenge the district court\u2019s finding that the disability plan was an employee welfare benefit plan. Because ERISA\u2019s vesting, accrual, and nonforfeiture provisions do not apply to an employee welfare benefit plan, \u00a7 204(g) is not applicable. <em>Harms v. Cavenham Forest Indus., </em>984 F.2d 686, 691 n. 6 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 382, 126 L.Ed.2d 331 (1993); <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">Even if \u00a7 204(g) applied, Williams\u2019 argument fails. Section 204(g) prohibits plan amendments that eliminate or reduce <em>inter alia, </em>retirement-type subsidies or early retirement benefits. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)-. Although the regulations do not define a \u201cretirement-type subsidy,\u201d the legislative history makes clear that the term does not include disability benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-11\">The committee intends that under these regulations, a subsidy that continues after retirement is generally to be considered a retirement-type subsidy. The committee expects, however, that <em>a qualified disability benefit, </em>a medical benefit, a social security supplement, a death benefit (including life insurance), or a plan shutdown benefit (that does not continue after retirement age) <em>will not be considered a retirement-type subsidy.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-12\">S.Rep. No. 575, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 30, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2547, 2576, <em>quoted in Ross v. Pension Plan for Hourly Employees of SKF Indus., Inc., </em>847 F.2d 329, 333-34 (6th Cir.1988) (emphasis added). <em>See also Harms, </em>984 F.2d at 692 (\u201cThe [legislative] history exempts qualified disability; medical, and death benefits ... from the definition of \u201cretirement-type\u201d subsidy_\u201d). Accordingly, the Plan\u2019s disability benefits cannot be considered a \u201cretirement-type subsidy\u201d protected by \u00a7 204(g) of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-15\">Williams nevertheless argues, relying on <em>Harms, </em>that these disability benefits' he seeks are retirement-type subsidies because they are payable for life and calculated in a manner similar to retirement subsidies in general. As the Sixth Circuit did in <em>Ross, </em>we rely upon the legislative history to conclude that the disability benefits Appellant seeks are not a \u201cretirement-type subsidy\u201d under \u00a7 204(g). <em>Ross, </em>847 F.2d at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-16\">Williams also contends that the benefits are \u201can early retirement benefit\u201d, and, thus, protected under \u00a7 204(g), and alternatively, that the Plan by its own terms views the disability benefits as a- pension benefit. Because Appellant raises these arguments for the first time on appeal, we do not address them. <em>Topalian v. Ehrman, </em>954 F.2d 1125, 1131-32 &amp; n. 10 (5th\u2019 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. , 113 S.Ct. 82, 121 L.Ed.2d 46 (1992) .(party challenging the grant of summary judgment may not advance new theories or raise new issues on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-18\"><em>b. </em>Was <em>the 1987 amendment properly noticed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-19\">Appellant argues that the Plan failed to comply with ERISA\u2019s notice provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>therefore the unmodified SPD should govern over the contradictory Plan provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">The SPD must be \u201csufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise\u201d plan participants of their rights and obligations under the Plan. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1022(a)(1); <em>see Hansen v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>940 F.2d 971, 981 (5th Cir.1991). A summary of material modifications (SMM) to the plan must be provided to all plan participants in a timely manner: 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1022(a)(1) and 1024(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">Williams contends that the Plan failed to indicate in its letter to plan participants that the notification \u201cshould be read and retained for future reference\u201d and that, it contains \u201cimportant information about rights under the plan.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2520.104b-1(b)(1). Williams misinterprets the regulation. Its requirements apply only when the notice of the modification is disseminated as a special insert in a periodical distributed to the employees, such, as a union newsletter. <em>Id</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">Williams also attacks the Plan\u2019s failure to prove that Williams received the letter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no requirement that the Plan prove actual notice of an amendment absent a. showing of active concealment or .some significant reliance upon, or prejudice resulting from the lack of notice. <em>Godwin v. Sun Life Assurance Co., </em>980 F.2d 323, 328 (5th Cir.1992). The plan administrator need only use.whatever means are \u201creasonably calculated to ensure actual receipt of the material.\u201d 29 p.F.R. \u00a7 2520.104b \u2014 1(b)(1). The plan administrator may send the SMM by mail. <em>Id. </em>The Plan advisor stated, by sworn affidavit, that he prepared and had mailed a letter to all Plan participants notifying them of' the amendment requirement and that a copy of the letter was attached to SPDs distributed to new Plan participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">Williams does not allege concealment or significant reliance. He attempts to distinguish <em>Godwin on </em>the basis that the plan administrator in <em>Godwin </em>distributed a revised SPD rather than a letter to update plan participants as was done here. This distinction is immaterial. Neither Godwin nor Williams contend that they received actual notice; because neither claims to have received the notice, the particular means used to inform plan participants is unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">Williams\u2019 reliance on <em>Hansen </em>is also misplaced. In <em>Hansen, </em>the court held that statements in a SPD are binding and will govern if the statements in the SPD conflict with the Plan. <em>Hansen, </em>940 F.2d at 981. The SPD in <em>Hansen </em>conflicted with the terms of the Plan. <em>Id. </em>at 980-81. In contest, the SPD in the instant case accurately summarized the Plan prior to the 1987 amendment. The \u201cconflict\u201d arose only after the Plan was amended and the SPD was not revised and reissued. But, because the SPD was properly supplemented by a SMM, there is no conflict between the supplemented SPD and the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">Appellant also cites the Plan\u2019s failure to file the SMM with the Department of Labor as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1024(a)(1)(D) and 1022(a)(2). Williams complains that as a result of the Plan\u2019s failure, he could not discover the 1987 amendment by examining the Department files. Williams does not allege that he examined the files and thereafter relied upon the absence of the SMM. Under the circumstances, the Plan\u2019s omission was not significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\"><em>c. </em>Was <em>the 1987 amendment formally adopted?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-15\">Appellant claims that the amendment was not effective because it was never formally adopted into the Plan. As the Third Circuit explained in <em>Confer v. Custom Eng\u2019g Co., </em>952 F.2d 41, 43 (3d Cir.1991), only an amendment executed in accordance with the Plan\u2019s own procedures and properly noticed could change the Plan. <em>Id. </em>at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-16\">The Plan, effective when the amendment was adopted, provided that the Trustees could amend the Plan at any time, subject to ERISA and IRS limitations not at issue-here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>The amendment was presented and approved during a meeting of the Trustees. A written notice of the change was mailed to Plan participants. Accordingly, Williams\u2019 assertion that the amendment was not formally adopted is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">Appellant also argues that he was disabled in 1986, and that, therefore, the district court erred when it upheld the Trustees\u2019 contrary determination because the Trustees abused their discretion by neglecting the only medical evidence offered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">We review <em>de novo. Sweatman v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>39 F.3d 594, 601 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">The 1987 Plan<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> required the Trustees to determine whether an employee is totally and permanently disabled and provided that the Trustees \u201cshall accept as evidence\u201d a SSA determination that the employee is disabled. Given the SSA determination of Williams disability, the weight afforded that determination under the Plan, and Williams\u2019 delay in filing his claim until- after the second auto accident, it was not unreasonable or an abuse of the Trustees\u2019 discretion to find the date of disability to be 1988.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">Williams also seeks prejudgment interest. Because the district court properly granted summary judgment against Williams this issue is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">. Williams complains for the first time on appeal that the Plan did not establish the address used to contact participants. We do not address this new issue. <em>Topalian, </em>954 F.2d at 1131-32 &amp; n. 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">. Williams also argues for the first time on appeal that the SSA determination that Williams\u2019 date of disability was 1988 did not preclude a finding that Williams was disabled before 1988. We do not address this claim. <em>Topalian, </em>'954 F.2d at 1131-32 <em>&amp; </em>n. 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">. The 1987 Plan governs because it was properly amended as discussed above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1037-30\">.Williams argues that the 1987 amendment was ineffective because amendments may only have a prospective effect. Because Williams was disabled in-1988, the Trustees did not apply the 1987 amendment retroactively.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
