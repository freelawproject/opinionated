No. 418, to November Term 1850. Subsequently, under an execution issued upon the last mentioned judgment, a sale was made of the real estate of the defendant and a return thereof was made by the sheriff of \u201cadvertized \u201c and sold September 10th to Wm.

H. Bates, </em>for the executors of Sarah A. Robinson, deceased :\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-5\">A preliminary question to be considered is, whether the final decree is to be entered upon the allegations of the bill, taken to be true, or whether the complainant is put to prove his case and produce the documents or records referred to in the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-6\">It would seem that the former practice is indicated by the language of rules 32, 33 and 34. The weight of authority appears to be ; when charges of the bill are distinct and certain, proof is dispensed with. 1 <em>Dan. Chr. Pr. </em>506, <em>and note </em>4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-7\">Three questions arise upon the case made by the bill and answer :\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-8\">1. Did Robert- Cleland take under his uncle\u2019s will, such an interest in the fund in question as to render it liable for his debts generally, after his death ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-9\">It cannot be so liable unless he is held to have taken an absolute interest in it. This could only be by the application to this bequest of the rule of law that the gift of the income or produce of personal property vests by implication the principal fund\" or property absolutely in the legatee. This rule is stated fairly, and as broadly as would be proper, as follows: <em>\u201cPrima facie, </em>a gift of \u201c the produce of a fund is a gift of that produce in perpetuity; and is consequently a gift of the fund itself, \u201cunless there is something on the face of the will to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u201c that such was not the intention.\u201d <em>Adamson vs. Armitage, </em>19 <em>Ves. </em>417; 2 <em>Rop. on Leg. </em>1478.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-4\">Thus, it appears to be a rule of intention. What then, may be gathered from the will, as the intention of the testator in making this legacy? Four considerations lead us to the conclusion that he did mean not to give Robert Cleland an absolute interest in the fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-5\">(1.) There are in the will, several legacies of $1000, each, (the same sum) to the other nephews (standing in the same relation) absolutely; therefore, in varying the terms of this legacy to another nephew of the same amount, the inference is a fair one that the testator intended. to make it something different from an absolute interest; it could not be more, it might be less. The testator evidently knew how to give an absolute interest, if he wished to do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-6\">(2.) It is a natural inference from this bequest, that the testator desired to give Robert Cleland the benefit of this $1000, and yet keep him from wasting the principal. If we construe this as an absolute interest, it would be a construction which would have made the fund liable for debts, and thus have defeated the intention. If that construction is abandoned, only one other is possible; that it was, as it purports to be, simply a life interest with a power of disposal, and this construction carries into effect the testator\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-7\">(3.) The terms of the bequest itself. The income is not even to be paid to Robert Cleland, but the executors are \u201cto receive the interest and income thereof and lay \u201c the same out from time to time at their discretion, or \u201cthe discretion of the survivor of them, for the use and \u201c benefit of my nephew Robert Cleland.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-8\">Robert Cleland does not even take an absolute in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>terest in the income, at least not so as to receive it\u2014far less in the fund itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-4\">(4 <em>) </em>The ultimate power of disposal was by will alone, to take effect after Robert Cleland\u2019s death. I shall refer to this hereafter to shew what meaning the law gives to this feature of the devise ; but it is noted here as evidence of intention apparent on the face of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-5\">Upon the whole will, it seems impossible to resist the conclusion that, under the rule, as broadly as it is above stated, it would be impossible not to find that the clearly apparent intent of the testator positively forbids the enlargement of this bequest to an absolute gift of the principal of the fund. But we are not forced to rest the case here. There is a well defined class of cases which may be said to be exceptions to the general rule, that a gift of the income of personalty carries by implication the principal ; and from this class of cases is derived a new rule of construction, which precisely govern the case in hand. This rule is thus stated :\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-6\">\u201c When a particular estate is limited in the instrument \u201c <em>followed </em>by a declaration that the legatees may dispose \u201cof the fund, he will not take a beneficial interest in the \u201c capital; he will have a mere power to dispose of it and \u201c no more ; because when a limited interest is expressly \u201cgiven, its enlargement by implication will not be per- \u201c mitted.\u201d 1 <em>Rop. on Leg., </em>644.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-7\">Out of very many cases on the general subject, there are some which appear to be in point. <em>Reid vs. Shergold, </em>10 <em>Ves., </em>370; <em>Robinson vs. </em>Cleator, 15 <em>Ves., </em>526; <em>Reith vs. Seymour, </em>4 <em>Russ., </em>263; <em>Soames vs. Martin, </em>10 <em>Sim. </em>288.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b535-8\">There is a distinction clearly drawn between gifts of income with an absolute power of disposal by deed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>lifetime of the legatee, or will, which are sometimes held to carry an absolute interest, because the power of disposal is at his option to be exercised in his lifetime ; and gift of the income, with a power of disposal by will alone, which are always construed to be merely interests for life. <em>Bull vs. Vardy, </em>1 <em>Ves. Jr., </em>272, <em>note </em>3; <em>Bradly vs. Westcott, </em>13 <em>Ves., Jr., </em>445; <em>Anderson vs. Dawson, </em>15 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>336; <em>Archibald vs. Wright, </em>9 <em>Sim., </em>161.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-4\">Two cases in which the Court held the bequest to carry the absolute property support this position and affirm the distinction. <em>Barford vs. Street, </em>16 <em>Ves., </em>135; <em>Irwin vs. Farrer, </em>19 <em>Ves. </em>86.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-5\">If it is considered that the authorities cited sustain the position taken, it need hardly be added that this case is within the rule, and that Robert Cleland took only a life interest, with power of disposal. It follows as a matter of course, that the fund cannot be reached by a judgment against him either before or after his death. A judgment against him could only reach his interest, which was only in the income, and terminated at his death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-6\">2. Even if these judgments were proper to be paid out of this fund, they are more than twenty years old ; and after twenty years non-demand, unexplained, the Court will presume a payment without the aid of a jury. <em>Bouv. Law Dict. Tit. \u201cPayment,\" P. </em>16.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-7\">Payment of a bond or other specialty, is presumed after a lapse of twenty years. <em>Best on Presumptions, </em>187-9; <em>Angell on Limitations, </em>95; <em>Oswald vs. Leigh, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>271.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-8\">A judgment seems to have the nature of a specialty, so far as to be subject to this presumption. <em>Angell on Lim. </em>82; <em>Pease vs. Howard </em>14 <em>Johns. </em>479.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-9\">This presumption has been applied to judgments. 1 <em>Gr. on Ev. </em>339; <em>Cape vs. </em>Humphreys, 14 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>It is undoubtedly true that this presumption of payment may be repelled by proof of insolvency and other evidence that the debtor had not means or opportunity of paying it; and it has been also held that evidence of other unsatisfied judgments is admissible as tending to prove the insolvency and rebut the presumption of payment. <em>Ins. Co. vs. </em>Covert, 29 <em>Barb., </em>435. And the presumption of payment, until rebutted or disposed of by evidence, has all the force and effect of plenary and effectual proof of payment, and the jury are bound so to regard it. <em>Thompson vs. Thompson, </em>2 <em>Head, Tenn., </em>405.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-4\">In this case there is no direct proof of insolvency. The undisputed facts of the existence of the judgments, and that Robert Cleland was sold out by the sheriff as far back as 1851, are the only circumstances tending to establish it. There are many reasons, however, why the evidence is insufficient. Robert Cleland directs the charges, for the nursing, boarding and caring for him in his last illness to be paid. The amount of such bills paid, indicates a very small amount due for board and the like \u25a0charges at the time of his death. The foundation of the presumption is, failure of the creditor to make a demand. In this case, he still makes no demand; and it does not appear that the presumption can be shaken until there is a demand ; that being made, all that is required by the creditor is, to show a reason for not making an earlier demand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-5\">In the present case, for nearly ten years, a demand could be made good ; and the entire absence of it since Robert Cleland\u2019s death, strengthens the presumption and repels the idea that the demand was abstained from on the ground of insolvency. The effect of a rebuttal of the presumption of payment by proof of insolvency is nothing more than an inference that because of the insolvency the creditor delayed his demand. If the debt could' be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>collected and the creditor fails to do it, his. delay to do so will destroy the inference that insolvency was a cause of non-demand and give rise to the natural presumption that payment was the reason of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-4\">A court of equity should not aid so extreme a want of diligence as is manifested here by mere inference. The grounds upon which the inference of insolvency is based are themselves insufficient. There is no direct proof of <em>it; </em>the sale of the property by the sheriff is not conclusive. It is a presumption of fact that a young man will recover from such failure. The facts of this case show that he did accumulate $3,000, as a very young man, and it is presumable that he could have paid these debts, amounting to only $300 or $400, in ten years ; and this inference is strengthened from the fact that no other judgments appear against him. The terms of his uncle\u2019s bequest constitute too trifling a circumstance to warrant an inference of insolvency. He may have been wasteful, but not insolvent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-5\">There is no case in which the presumption has been held rebutted, except at suit <em>i. e. </em>demand, of plaintiff; there is no case wherein insolvency is held rebutted or presumed, except where there has been direct proof of it. This seems to be a just rule, viz. that where the creditor, with due diligence, makes demand, even after twenty years, and shows insolvency of the debtor, or his inability to pay, as a reason for delaying his suit, then the presumption will be repelled ; and this reconciles the authorities. Circumstances merely rendering the collection of the debt improbable, as the poverty of the debtor, are not admissible to rebut the presumption of the payment. <em>Rogers vs. Judd </em>5 Vt.,236.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-6\">Nor will the fact that the debtor, at a certain time during the period relied on to make the presumption, was a bankrupt, rebut such presumption. <em>Daggett vs. Tallman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>8 <em>Conn., </em>168. The presumption is not rebutted by evidence that the defendants are in extremely imbarrassed circumstances, and, in the opinion of those who knew him, incapable of paying the debt. <em>Williaume vs. Gorges. </em>1 <em>Campb., </em>217.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-4\">3. It clearly appears upon the facts of this case, that funds came into the hands of the sheriff applicable to these judgments, and sufficient to pay them. This is in equity, if not in law, a legal satisfaction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b539-5\">\n<em>Lore,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AF7\">who appeared for the only one of the judgment creditors who was served with process, did not argue the case, and made no claim to the fund, being satisfied that the excutors were entitled to receive it. The other defendants, however, not beingserved or represented, a consent decree was not practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Having held the case for sometime under advisement, The Chancellor considered that more than twenty years having elapsed since the judgment was rendered, and there being no evidence in the case that within the said period of twenty years, there had been any demand for the payment of said judgments, or either of them, or that there had been any payment of interest thereon or acknowledgment of the sum remaining unpaid, nor evidence of any fact or facts serving to rebut the legal presumption arising during such lapse of time that the said demands had been paid ; that, both in consideration of the lapse of time and legal presumption of payment arising therefrom, and from the allegations of the answer of George C. Robinson and Albert N. Robinson, taken as confessed under the decree <em>pro confessa, </em>the said judgments must be held to have been paid and discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">A decree was therefore entered directing the payment to George C.

It was further ordered, pursuant to the statute,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that, before receiving the said sum, the said George C. Robinson and Albert N.

This case though un contested presented some very interesting questions which, while it was under consideration underwent a careful and somewhat elaborate examination by the Court. There having been argument only on one side as appears by the report, it is proper to add here a reference to some cases upon the general subjects .involved, which were examined by the Chancellor which do not appear in the written argument filed. It is known to have been the purpose of the Chancellor to write an opinion, but this was never done, and there appear among his papers only the rough memoranda of his examination of the legal questions involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">i. The authority was given to the solicitor of the complainant to appear for one or more defendants, upon the authority of a precedent referred to, when the like course had been adopted by Chancellor Harrington. In the case of <em>Webster vs. </em>McDaniel, <em>et al., </em>2 <em>Del. Ch. </em>297. the solicitor for the complainant, in a bill of interpleader, was permitted to appear for and argue the case for one of the defendants. The record of that case shows that the appearance was entered by special leave of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In a bill of interpleader the complainant being indifferent between the parties, the duty of his solicitor is ended, as such, when the bill is filed and he has no interest in the decree except that the bill shall be adjudged to be properly filed. Such an appearance for the defendant can, however, only be entered by special leave of the Court and upon consideration of the special facts of the case and the conclusion that the case is a proper one for granting the leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In <em>Houghton vs. </em>Kendall, <em>et </em>al., 7 <em>Allen </em>72, upon a bill, in the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>a bill of interpleader, filed by executors, and in which certain defendants were not represented, the following statement is made ;\u2014\u201c At the argument, the \u201c children of Edwin were not represented, and the counsel for the executors, \u201c after reading the papers, were going on to submit their views upon the \u2018\u2018questions involved: but the Court interposed, the Chief Justice saying that \u201c the whole duty of an executor, in a case like the present, is performed, \u201c when he has brought the parties in interest before the Court; and that, considering his relation to the parties and the fact that he cannot be allowed to \u201c charge the estate for the costs of an argument, he ought pot to take any part \u2018\u2018 in the discussion. Subsequently, however, objection being waived, and \u201c some peculiar reasons appearing to show that there was no danger of collu- \u201c sion, the Court allowed the argument to proceed, remarking that this case \u201c must not be drawn into a precedent , as the rule which had been announced \u201c had been adopted by the Court upon full consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">It is stated in a note to this report that \u201c subsequently, in March 1864, the \u201c Court passed a general rule that in bills by executors and trustees to obtain \u2018 \u2018 the instructions of the Court, and in bills of interpleader, or in the nature of \u2018 \u2018 interpleader, no solicitor or counsel for the plaintiff shall appear or be heard \u201c or act for and in behalf of any or either of the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">2. Upon the point that a general power of appointment, if executed, whether by deed or will, subjects the fund to the debts of the appointor, the following authorities may be referred to; 2 <em>Wms. on Ex'rs, (4th Am. Ed.) </em>(1435); 2 <em>Sugd. on Powers </em>(30). 2 <em>Rop. on Leg. </em>1476; <em>Bainton vs. Ward, </em>2 <em>Atk. </em>172; <em>Townshend vs. Wyndham, </em>2 <em>Ves. Sr. </em>1-9; <em>Harrington vs. Harte, </em>1 <em>Cox </em>131; <em>Jenny vs. Andrews, </em>6 <em>Madd. </em>164; <em>Elton vs. Sheppard, </em>1 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>532; <em>Phillips vs. Chamberlayne, </em>4 <em>Ves. </em>53; <em>Page vs. Leapingwell, </em>18 <em>Ves. </em>463; <em>Stretch vs. Watkins, l Madd. </em>252; <em>Clough vs. Wynne, </em>2 <em>Madd. </em>188; <em>Haig vs. Sweney, </em>1 <em>Sim. &amp; Stu. </em>490; <em>Earl vs. Givin. </em>1 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>494</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">This doctrin\u00e9is recognized though with a criticism in I <em>Sto. Eq. Jtir. </em>176, <em>note </em>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">3. Upon the question of the presumption of payment, the following cases are to the point that the presumption may be repelled generally by circumstances explaining the delay. <em>Bailey vs. Jackson, </em>16 <em>Johns. </em>210, 214; <em>Dunlop &amp; Co. vs. </em>Ball, 2 <em>Cranch. </em>180; <em>Jackson vs. Hotchkiss, </em>6 <em>Cow. </em>401. Note the language of 1 <em>Gr. on Ev. Sec. </em>39, and 2 <em>Bouv. Law Dict. </em>313.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">See as to the general nature of the presumption, <em>Durham vs. Greenly, </em>2 <em>Harring. </em>124, and <em>State vs. Lord's adm\u2019r, </em>3 <em>Harrring. </em>421.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">, The following authorities are directly on the point of insolvency. <em>Hillary vs. Waller, </em>12 <em>Ves. </em>266; <em>Fladong vs. Winter, </em>19 <em>Ves. </em>195; 1 <em>Cow. </em>&amp; <em>Hill's notesto Ph. on Ev. </em>506, also 512-13.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\"> Rev.
