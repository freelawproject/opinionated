Wilson,the defendant\u2019s intestate,together with Barkley Wilson, Josiah Marvel, James Wilson and Silas Reynolds, on the 2d of March 1852, executed their judgment bond to the Farmers\u2019 Bank at Georgetown for $670. Judgment was entered in the Superior Court, execution issued and levies made upon the goods of all the obligors and finally, under a <em>vend. exp. </em>returnable to the Oct. Term i860, the goods of William W. Wilson and James Wilson were sold, but the proceeds were applied to prior executions. On the 2d,of Sept, i860, three of the obligors in the original bond, viz. Barkley Townsend Wilson, Josiah Marvel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Silas Reynolds, gave to the Bank a new bond for the sum of $800.00 covering the original debt, and which bond the Bank accepted in satisfaction of the original one, the interest in arrear. In the bond last taken, William W. Wilson and James Wilson did not join. Judgment was entered upon the last mentioned bond and execution was issued and levied upon the goods of Barkley Wilson and Silas Reynolds, the other obligor, Josiah Marvel, having meanwhile died. Pending this execution, Barkley Wilson died, and thereupon, his administratrix, Louisa A. Wilson, on the 16th of August, 1864, paid the debt, amounting, with interest and costs, to $1046.46. The bill charges that in the original bond for $670.00, William W. Wilson, the defendant, was the principal debtor, and the other obligors were sureties ; and that the payment by the administratrix under the execution issued upon the last bond, was in discharge of William W. Wilson\u2019s indebtedness to the bank, that being the real consideration of both bonds. The prayer is that William W. Wilson may re-imburse to Barkley Wilson\u2019s estate the amount paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">The answer denies that William W. Wilson was principal in the original bond, and charges, on the contrary, that Barkley Wilson, James Wilson and Josiah Marvel were the principals in that bond, and that himself and Silas Reynolds were sureties. The answer alleges that Barkley Wilson, James Wilson and Marvel, had previously become sureties for Zachariah P. Wilson, as one of the collectors of Sussex County, and that Zachariah P. Wilson being found in default as collector for some $600 or $700, in order to meet this deficiency, a loan was procured from the Bank,' upon the bond of Zachariah P. Wilson and his sureties in the collector\u2019s bond in April, 1840\u2014that interest was paid on this bond up to March, 1852, when in lieu of it, the bond in controversy for $670 was taken in which last bond, as the answer alleges, William Wilson and Silas Reynolds joined as sureties for the other obligors in it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>That the bond for $800.00 taken by the Bank in 1850, executed by Barkley Wilson, Marvel and Reynolds, was given in order to release William Wilson and the estate of James Wilson who was then deceased. The answer further, in addition to taking issue upon the alleged liability of ths defendant as principal in the debt paid, insists upon the statute of limitations. Depositions and exhibits on both sides were read and the effect of the evidence is fully stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-5\">A demurrer had been first filed and was argued at the March Term, 1871. <em>Ante p. </em>108.

He intimated the opinion that a decree to refund the money was barred by lapse of time by analogy to the Statute of Limitations, and that the relief of the complainant, if any, was by subrogation to the original judgment. But whether the doctrine of subrogation applied to thjs case, and if so, whether such relief could be given without a special prayer which there was not in this bill, were points not argued, and the Chancellor deemed it proper to give counsel an opportunity to argue these points as, also, whether the equitable bar applied to this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\">On these points the case was re-heard March 14, 1873.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Layton, for the complainant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-5\">Equitable circumstances may be shewn against the bar of the Statute of Limitations, as carrying on a protracted litigation. 2 <em>Sto.

The evidence leaves no doubt that such was the fact. It is true, as alleged in the answer, that this bond was given for a loan effected in order to meet Zachariah P. Wilson\u2019s default upon his bond as County Collector; but it is sufficiently proved that, under a family arrangement between Zachariah P. Wilson and the defendant, who were brothers, and James Wilson, the father of both, William, in consideration of his receiving from the father that share of the latter\u2019s real estate before then devised by will to Zachariah, assumed the latter\u2019s indebtedness to the Bank on the bond for $670, which had been given by him and his sureties in the collectorship in April, 1840, and with that understanding, became principal to the Bank in the bond of March 1852. William Hancock was present at the execution of this latter bond, and states very positively his understanding, gathered from the conversation of William W. Wilson, Zachariah P. Wilson and James Wilson, that Whlliam \u201c should take upon himself the payment \u201cof the sum of $670 owed by said Zachariah P. Wilson to \u201cthe Bank, in consideration of having the interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\u201csaid Zachariah P. Wilson in the lands of their father, \u201cthe said James Wilson.\u201d There are collateral circumstances concurring with this statement. Zachariah P. Wilson did not join in the bond of March 1852, though that was taken by the Bank in lieu of his bond of 1840 ; and in June 1852, shortly after William became bound for Zachariah\u2019s debt, the father conveyed to William by deed, the very tract of land which had been, by a will previously executed, devised by Zachariah. Nevertheless, I should hesitate to rest upon the recollection of one witness as to the purport of a conversation so far back, even with the concurring circumstances referred to, were it not for the clear acknowledgments by William W. Wilson of his liability as principal for the debt in controversy\u2014an acknowledgment proved by two independent witnesses, Hancock and Welsh, to have been made on different occasions, and as recently as in the year 1864. They prove that, after Barkley Wilson\u2019s administratrix had paid the Bank debt, and while effort was being made to procure its reimbursement by William W. Wilson, he acknowledged his liability, but sought to have the debt first collected out of certain land owned by him when the judgment of the Bank was entered and still bound by it, but which he had subsequently sold to one Pettijohn ; and that he promised if that course were taken, to pay any deficiency out of his own lands. Welsh, as the agent of Barkley Wilson\u2019s administratrix, called on him in the fall of 1864 for a settlement of the debt, addressing him, the witness says, as the principal debtor. The defendant, in that interxdew, said, as Welsh states, \u201c he could not pay it <em>at that time ; </em>that he was under a \u201c contract to sell his lands with \u201c some parties he named, \u201c and if they complied, he <em>would be able </em>to settle it. He \u201c did not then make any objection to the paying of it, \u201cbut afterwards, in another interview, some months \u201c afterwards, he objected to our attempting to recover \u201c the debt out of his lands he then had in possession, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201c unless we would include, also, the tract of land which \u201c said Wilson had conveyed to Levin Pettijohn,\u201d &amp;c. Further, at several different times in 1864 and 1865, the defendant sought the influence of Hancock, who was his brother-in-law, to induce the administratrix of Barkley Wilson to put the claim in the hands of Mr. Saulsbury for collection, in order that the money might be got out of the land which he had sold to Pettijohn, but distinctly acknowledging, as the witness states, \u201c that he \u201c (Wilson) knew that he owed the money,\u201d and that, \u201cif \u201c it could not be got out of that land \u201d (the Pettijohn land) \u201che would pay it out of his other lands.\u201d The statements of these witnesses are unequivocally and positively made; both upon direct and cross-examination, they stand unimpeached, except by the suggestion, which is not of sufficient weight, that Hancock was surety for the administratrix of Barclay Wilson and Welsh, her agent; and their testimony is corroborated by all the collateral circumstances material to the question,\u2014such as the omission to join Zachariah P. Wilson in the bond of March, 1852, and the conveyance by the father to William of the land before devised to Zachariah. The taking by the Bank, of the bond of i860, in lieu of the original one, without joining William \u00e1s a party to it, may seem to be inconsistent with his having been the principal debtor ; but that transaction is explained otherwise by the attending circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The goods of both William W. Wilson and James Wilson, had been sold under the execution of the Bank and nothing realized to this debt. Considerable interest was in arrear raising the debt from $670 to $800. The Bank was pressing, and unless interest were paid, a new bond was necessary to convert it into principal. The remaining obligors, Barkley Wilson, Marvel and Reynolds, were obliged either to satisfy the Bank by some arrangement, or to submit to the sale of their own goods, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>levied on under the execution. Hence, the new bond. James Wilson did not join, because he was then dead. Why William Wilson did not join is unexplained. That he was omitted, as the answer alleges, in order that he might be released as a surety in the original bond, cannot be presumed, in the face of so much proof that he was the principal and not a surety in the original bond ; and it is a hypothesis excluded by the fact that Reynolds, whom the answer also alleges to have been a surety in the original bond, <em>was </em>joined in the substituted bond. Nothing appears in the case to explain why William Wilson was not a party to the substituted bond, except the fact that his goods having been already sold under execution, and his lands not being liable until the goods of his coobligors should have been sold, he was in a condition to resist the pressure of the Bank for a new bond while his co-obligors, whose goods were next liable, felt themselves obliged to satisfy the Bank and so gave the new bond without William Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">On the whole, I am clearly of opinion, upon the evidence, that the bond of March, 1852, was given for the debt of William Wilson, the obligors in it being his sureties. The question remains whether a court of equity will afford any, and what relief to the administratrix of Barkley Wilson, deceased, one of the sureties out of whose estate the debt has been paid ?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The special relief prayed by the bill is, that William Wilson, the principal, may be decreed to re-imburse the sum paid out of the sureties\u2019 estate. To this, the defendant, in addition to his defense upon the merits already disposed of, insists upon the Statute of Limitations, or rather upon the bar administered in this Court by analogy to the Statute. So far as concerns relief by a decree for the repayment of the money as so much money paid for the use of the defendant,\u2014a decree founded only upon his implied contract to repay it\u2014the plea must prevail. For more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>than three years elapsed between the date of the payment of the debt by Barkley Wilson\u2019s administratrix (Aug. 16, 1864) and the filing of this bill on May 21, 1869. This being the statutory period of limitation against simple contract liabilities, such as would bar an action at law, equity will apply the same limitation as against a decree for the direct repayment of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">But a decree for the repayment of the money is not the only equitable remedy of the surety. He is entitled additionally, to be subrogated to the security given for the debt paid by him, that is, the judgment of 1852, so as to enjoy all the benefit of the security which the creditor\u2014 that is the Bank in this case\u2014could have had under the judgment before its payment: and therefore, as there has not been a sufficient lapse of time to have barred the collection of the judgment by the creditor, it is not barred as against the equitable right of the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The general doctrine of the sureties\u2019 right of subrogation to all securities held by the creditor for the debt paid, and, in this country, as well to the original security paid- off as to collaterals, is not at all questionable ; but the application of the doctrine to this case, under its somewhat peculiar circumstances, I thought might admit of discussion ; and the question not having been raised at the argument upon the hearing, I directed a re-argument on that point. The re-argument has confirmed my first impression, that the surety in this case is entitled, in equity, to the benefit of the original judgment of 1852. The objection taken was, that the payment made by Barkley Wilson\u2019s administratrix to the Sheriff, was not a payment of <em>the original bond in which William Wilson was </em>principal, that judgment having been satisfied by the substituted bond ; that the payment made by the administratrix was a discharge only of the substituted bond, to which William Wilson was not a party ; that the only remedy of the administratrix was that under the substi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>tuted bond, for contribution from Barkley Wilson\u2019s coobligors.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Now to this argument there are two answers:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\"><em>First. </em>A court of equity <em>looks to the substance of the transaction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The substance and real effect of this transaction was, that the debt of William Wilson, for which the bond of 1852 was given, was paid out of the estate of Barkley Wilson, one of his sureties, for that debt. It was the same debt throughout, though represented by two successive securities. The second bond created no new debt, but was only a substituted security for the same debt, taken for the purpose, merely, of converting the accrued interest into principal. The payment by the administratrix, though made under process upon the substituted judgment, was, in substance and effect, a payment of the original debt; and equity will so treat it, precisely as if no second bond for .the debt had intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The argument of the complainant is in fault in assuming that the acceptance by the bank of the substituted bond, was an <em>absolute </em>extinguishment, <em>for all </em>purposes, of the original judgment. So it was, so far as concerned the remedy of the bank, under the judgment. That was gone, and William Wilson not being a party to the substituted bond, became released of all liability <em>to the\u00a1 bank. </em>But equity can hold the original judgment in force for the protection of any surety under it* although satisfied and extinguished as to the creditor. The correct view of the case in this Court, therefore, is, that the substituted bond was a discharge of the original judgment, only so far as concerned the creditor, leaving it, however, in force as against the principal for the protection of the sureties, or any of them, subsequently paying the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\"><em>Second. </em>The other answer to the objection against applying the doctrine of subrogation to this case is, that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>even were the direct and primary remedy of the surety, as is contended, under the substituted bond for contribution, by the co-obligors as for money paid on that bond only, still, the result of that proceeding would be to give to all the co-obligors under the second bond, a joint remedy by subrogation to the original judgment, as the debt of the, principal, which would have then been paid by them all as sureties ; and thus, in the end, the same result would be reached ; that is, the recovery of the debt from Wilson, though it would be by a circuity of proceeding. Now, a court of equity will always reach by a direct decree what, otherwise, would, be accomplished by a circuity of proceedings. It is less expensive and effects the same ends of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The only point of difficulty I have felt is, how to frame a decree so as to afford certain and full relief. In the ordinary course of such cases the creditor is made a party in equity, and relief is obtained by a decree compelling the creditor to collect, in his name, the security paid, but for the use of the surety, or to assign it to the surety ; equity treating the security as being, for this purpose, unsatisfied and in force, and restraining the principal debtor, if this were necessary, from setting up the payment by the surety as a defense at law. In the present case, the creditor was not made a party and needed not to have been a party, because he has already assigned the judgment to the surety\u2019s administratrix who can, therefore, proceed at law in her own name as assignee. But in the proceeding at law by <em>scire facias </em>on the judgment, the administratrix has already encountered this obstacle to her recovery ; that the defendant, in the <em>scire facias </em>(the principal) insisted upon the effect of the substituted bond as an absolute satisfaction and extinguishment of the original judgment, that is, the judgment on which the <em>scire facias </em>issued; that the payment by the administratrix must be treated as a payment made only upon the substi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>tuted bonds, giving her no remedy under the statute upon the original judgment. The Superior Court sustained this objection upon a motion for a non-suit, the giving of the substituted bond having been disclosed in the course of the evidence of the plaintiff in the <em>scire </em>facias. The ruling of the Superior Court was inevitable; for such was, at law, the technical effect of the substituted bond. A court of law must have treated it as an absolute satisfaction, that court taking no cognizance of the equitable rights of sureties. It requires, in such a case as this, the aid of a court of equity to enable the surety to obtain at law the benefit of the judgment by restraining the principal from setting up or insisting upon the effect at law of the substituted bond, as satisfaction of the original judgment. Thus, the payment by the administratrix may be treated as if it had been made to the original judgment, without the intervention of the second bond. A court of equity has full power, when necessary for the protection of the equitable rights of a party, to restrain his adversary as well from setting up an inequitable defense, as from prosecuting an inequitable action. This relief has been frequently given against an inequitable use of the plea of the statute of limitations. I can see no reason why the power may not as well be executed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The decree in this cause being a somewhat unusual one it is here appended in full:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">And now, to wit, this 20th day of May, this cause having been heard before the Chancellor on the 15th day of March, A. D. 1872, upon the bill, answer, exhibits and depositions, and the same having been debated by the solicitors of the respective parties at the said March Term 1872, and again on the 14th day of March, A. D. 1873 and having been held under advisement until this date and maturely considered by the Chancellor. It appearing to the Chancellor that the defendant William Wilson, Bark<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>lev Wilson, now deceased, and Silas Reynolds, did on the 19th day of February, A. D. 1852 execute and deliver to the Farmers Bank of the State of Delaware at Georgetown, their joint and several obligation bearing date the day and year last aforesaid, in the penal sum of one thousand three-hundred and forty dollars with condition for the payment of the real debt of six hundred and sev-enty dollars, on which said obligation judgment was entered in the Superior Court for Sussex County being No. 136 to October Term, 1851. And it appearing to the satisfaction of the Chancellor, from the proofs in the cause, that in the aforesaid obligation the said William Wilson was the principal debtor and that the other named obligors executed the same as sureties of the said William Wilson. And it further appearing to the Chancellor that afterwards, to wit, on the second day of September A. D. i860, three of the said obligors in the before-mentioned obligation executed and delivered, to the said Farmers Bank their joint and several obligation bearing date the day and year last aforesaid, in the penal sum of one thousand and six hundred dollars, with condition for the payment of the real debt of eight hundred dollars, which said last mentioned obligation was given to secure the same debt mentioned in the first mentioned obligation with its interest in arrear and unpaid up to the date of the said second obligation,\u2014which said second obligation was accepted by the said Farmers\u2019 Bank in lieu of the first mentioned obligation, and judgment was entered thereon in' the Superior Court for Sussex County being No. 6 to April Term i860. And it further appearing to the Chancellor that after the giving of the said second obligation the said Josiah Marvel one of the said obligors therein departed this life after which process of execution upon the judgment entered thereon, being the said judgment No. 6 April term, i860, was issued and the same was levied upon the goods and chattels of the said Barkley Wilson and Silas Reynolds the other obligors, therein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>pending which the execution and levy, the said Barkley Wilson departed this life, and thereupon his administratrix, Louisa N. Wilson, on the 16th day of August A. D. 1864, paid to the Sheriff of Sussex County to whom the said execution had been delivered tobe executed the sum of ($1,046.46,) that being the amount of the debt, interest and costs in the said execution. And it being considered by the Chancellor that the said second obligation for the debt of $800, bearing date the 2d day of September A.
