It does not appear at what date the debt was contracted.

The husband could not have set off his wife\u2019s legacy, in a suit, by the executor, against him for his debt. No wrong will be done by disallowing the set-off. The recovery of the legacy is but the exercise of a right given by the father. He might have made the legacy dependent on the payment of the debt, but did not choose to do so, but rather to leave the debt to the ordinary chances of collection without encumbering the legacy.

The cases of a wife\u2019s equity are all cases, either between husband and wife, or where the executor seeks a provision for the wife. Besides there are cases of trust, abandonment, &amp;c. <em>Kenny vs. Udall, </em>5 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>473.

Set-off is a subject of original equity jurisdiction, not depending upon the statute nor limited by it. It is more extensive in equity than at law. The former looks to the substance and result of the transaction,\u2014the fact in this case, that whatever be the form the husband will get the money. <em>Miller vs. Receiver of the Franklin </em>Bank, 1 <em>Paige </em>444; 2 <em>Sto.

Can this be done either by way of set-off under the statute ? or, if not under the statute, then can it be done under any equitable power of this Court independently of the statute ? These were the questions raised in the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">And first, is this a case of set-off within the statute ? I am clearly of the opinion that it is not. The statute (Rev. Code 380, Sec. 21) is expressly limited to \u201cmutual \u201cdebts\u201d between the parties to an action due \u201cin the \u201c same right. The plain meaning of this phrase \u201cdue in \u201cthe same right,\u201d is that a debt due from A alone shall discharge only a debt due to A alone ; or that a debt of one character <em>i. e., </em>whether several or joint, individual or representative, shall discharge a debt of the like character and no other. The object or policy of the provision is to save from the operation of the statute all cases in which there attaches to one of the claims, proposed to be set off, some right or interest which would be unjustly discharged or prejudiced by the set-off. Thus a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>joint debt cannot be set off against a several one, because the rights of the joint creditor on the one side would thereby be unjustly extinguished by setting off a claim partly belonging to him against a debt for which he is not liable. So a debt, due to an executor or administrator, he cannot set off against his individual debt, because this would be to pay his debt with assets belonging to the creditors and legatees or distributees whom he represents. So,upon <em>precisely </em>the same principle,it is against the terms and policy of the statute, to discharge the debt of the husband with the wife\u2019s legacy. For the wife, notwithstanding her marriage, does retain in a legacy, bequeathed to her and not yet reduced to her hnsband\u2019s possession, an interest, termed her right of survivorship. Now, as to the precise, nature of this right of survivorship, different views have been expressed, some judges considering that by marriage the <em>title </em>vests in the husband, but subject to a right or privilege of survivorship to. the wife, if not reduced to possession and she survive him, <em>Johnson vs. Fleet</em>wood, 1 <em>Harring. </em>442, and others considering that the title remains in the wife, subject, merely, to the husband\u2019s control and power to reduce it to his own possession. Gibson C. J. in <em>Timbers vs. Katz, 6 W. &amp; S. </em>290. The difference is not material to this case. It is quite sufficient that the wife\u2019s right of survivorship, whatever may be its nature, is treated by the law, as unquestionably it is, as an interest of substance and importance and entitled to protection as scrupulously as is the right of a joint creditor or of the creditors and legatees or distributees of an estate, in the case before put, in which set-off is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The favor with which the law regards the wife\u2019s interest in her <em>choses </em>in action is seen in the strictness of the rule as to what shall be sufficient to extinguish her right.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">First, we may observe, as a general principle, that the husband only can determine his wife\u2019s right of survivor-ship- at his free election. His creditors cannot-interfere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>with'- it .except under some special statutory provisi\u00f3n. Hence,-generally,\"it has been held'thkt the wife\u2019s <em>chose </em>in action cannot be attached by the husband\u2019s creditors. <em>Dennison vs. Nigh, </em>2 <em>Watts </em>90; <em>Marston vs. Carter, </em>12 <em>N. H. </em>159. In this State the wife\u2019s <em>chose </em>in action may be attached by'the'husband\u2019s creditors'. <em>Johnson vs. Fleetwood, 1 Harring. </em>442; That decision however rests upon the ground that , our attachment law, in defining the subjects which may be attached, uses the word \u201crights\u201d which, the Court held, includes- the right of the husband to reduce the <em>chose </em>in action to his'possession, to which, by force of. the statute, the creditor might succeed, but the same decision expressly holds the wife\u2019s interest to be unaffected by the attachment,, until an actual reduction to possession is effected by the attaching creditor, thus saving the rights of the wife as far as the phraseology of the statute would admit. The Court s\u00e1y \u201cif he\u201d (the attaching creditor) \u201ccan possess him- \" self of the debt before the husband dies, it is his ; if he \u201c does not.do this, then the wife if she survives would be en- \u201c titled to it.\u201d Of the same effect is an attachment in Massachusetts, 1 <em>Mete. </em>476. With respect to what acts of the. husband are sufficient to extinguish the .wife\u2019s right, the law is extremely rigorous. It is now a settled. principle that nothing short of <em>actual </em>and positive: reduction. into possession by the husband, or a release or an assignment for a valuable considesation, and that of <em>&amp; chose, in </em>action presently reducible to possession, is sufficient to bar the wife\u2019s right by survivorship to her <em>chases </em>in action. A voluntary assignment by the husband without consideration does not bind her. 2 <em>Kent </em>(137). It has been.a subject of long controversy whether an assignment, even for a consideration, should pass to his assignee more than .the husband\u2019s power to reduce the <em>chose </em>in action to possession, subject to the wife\u2019s right of survivorship, should the husband die meanwhile. It is at last settled, that an assignment for value does of itself bar the wife\u2019s right to a <em>chose </em>in action,-presently; reducible to ' posses- - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>sion, though not as to reversionary interests. 2 Kent, <em>(137) </em>(138) <em>note (a). \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Let us now note how far the regard of the courts, for the wife\u2019s interest, has gone in holding the husband to most positive and unequivocal acts of conversion, in order to alter the property and bar the wife. It has been held, that the appropriation, out of the estate of a testator, of a specific fund, as a mortgage, for payment of a legacy bequeathed to a wife, by an arrangement between the executor and the husband, and the making of some payments of interest to the husband, for which he receipted, was not a sufficient reduction to his possession to divest the wife\u2019s right of survivorship. <em>Blount vs. Bestland, </em>5 <em>Ves. </em>515. The husband, proving the wife\u2019s debt under a commission of bankruptcy and paying the contribution money, was held not to alter the property, so as, on his death, to defeat her right to the dividends. <em>Anon. </em>2 <em>Vern. </em>707. Payment of the wife\u2019s legacy into court, under a decree establishing the right of husband and wife in her right, but before any order for payment to the husband, is not sufficient. <em>Bond vs. Simmons, </em>3 <em>Atk. </em>20; <em>Macaulay vs. Philips 4 Ves. </em>17; <em>Clancy on M. W. </em>119. Payment of interest and part payment of principal, to the husband, of his wife\u2019s <em>chose </em>in action, is not a reduction to his possession of the balance. <em>Nash, vs. Nash, </em>2 <em>Madd. </em>133 (1 <em>Dan. Ch. Pr. </em>149). Even where money due to the wife comes into the hands of the husband, that is not sufficient, so long as his possession is referable to any other right than the marital right, as in <em>Baker vs. Hall, </em>12 <em>Ves. </em>497, where the executor and trustee under a will married one of the residuary legatees, his possession of the personal estate did not alter the property in his wife\u2019s legacy, until, by some act, he should convert her share to his own use. See also, <em>Wall vs. Tomlinson, </em>16 <em>Ves. </em>413.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">It need hardly be said that a joint action for the wife\u2019s <em>chose </em>in action, whether one which accrued to her before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>or after marriage does not affect her right, nor even does a judgment recovered in such action; <em>nothing short of an execution </em>is sufficient. <em>Clancy on M. W. </em>113; 2 <em>Kent </em>127; 2 <em>Ves. Sr. </em>676; 6 <em>Johns. Ch. R. </em>132; 9 <em>Paige </em>283. In a suit by the husband alone, the debt becomes reduced to his possession upon the recovery of a judgment, not before. <em>Clancy on M. W. </em>113.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Further illustration on this point cannot be necessary. It must sufficiently appear that the wife\u2019s right of survivorship to her <em>chose </em>in. action is one regarded by the law with tenderness, and can be divested only by some unequivocal act of the husband intended to alter the property. The only exceptions are found in the effect given under statutory provisions to an involuntary assignment upon the husband\u2019s bankruptcy, and in \u25a0 this State to an attachment by his creditors. In this general view of the substantial and important character of the wife\u2019s interest, I have followed an able opinioh of Chancellor Kent in <em>Schuyler vs. Hoyle, </em>5 Johns. <em>Ch. R. </em>625. The same views are also strongly and 'elaborately presented by Judge King in <em>Miller's Case, </em>1 <em>Ashmead, </em>323, by C. J. Gibson in <em>Timbers vs. Katz, </em>6 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>290, and by C. J. Parker in <em>Marston vs. Carter &amp; Trustee, </em>12 <em>N. H. </em>159.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">I do not find that our own Courts have guarded the ydfe\u2019s interest in her <em>chose </em>in action with any less strictness. It has been decided in our Court of Appeals, that an equitable assignment by the husband of his wife\u2019s distributive share in satisfaction of his debt, is ineffectual to bar her right, if the husband die before the debt is reduced to the creditor\u2019s possession <em>State vs. Robertson &amp; Burton, </em>5 <em>Harring. </em>201. And, in <em>Lendeman vs. Lendeman's,Ex'r., </em>1 <em>Houst. </em>523.it was held that a promissory note, given to the wife during the coverture, survived to her, if unpaid at her husband\u2019s death. This decision, in favor toward the wife, went beyond some authorities, which treat a negotiable instrument, given to the wife during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>coverture, as vesting, like money, absolutely in the husband. <em>Lightbourn vs. Holy day, </em>1 <em>Eq. Ca. Ab. 1; Nash vs. Nash, </em>2 <em>Mad. </em>135 <em>(n)</em>; 1 <em>Dan. Ch. Pr. </em>149; <em>Shuttlesworth vs. Noyes, 8 Mass. </em>229; <em>Com. vs. Manley, </em>12 <em>Pick. </em>172. The decision in 1 <em>Houston </em>is sustained by <em>Nash vs. Nash, </em>2 <em>Mad. </em>133.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The conclusion to be drawn from this general examination of the subject is, that the wife\u2019s right of survivor-ship, in the legacy sued for, is an interest of such substance and importance that, so long as it attaches, the legacy cannot be deemed in the sense of the statute to be due to the husband, in the same right, as is his debt to the testator\u2019s estate, <em>i. e. </em>in his sole, individual right. The ex-tinguishment of the wife\u2019s right, by such a set-off, would be contrary to the object of the statute and to the strongly marked policy of protection to the wife\u2019s interest in her <em>choses </em>in action, a policy holding it to be divested only at the election of the husband, and that to be exercised by an actual conversion, release or assignment for value. It was argued, that this Court, looking at the substance and effect of the proceeding, will hold it subject to claims against him. The answer is that no such result is certain or can be assumed. Judgment may not be recovered and execution sued out in the husband\u2019s life time, until which the wife\u2019s right of survivorship remains in force, and, while it remains, it must receive its full effect. The law will not strip her of it in anticipation and against the husband\u2019s election, merely to satisfy the husband\u2019s creditor. <em>Burrough vs. Moss, </em>10 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>558, is directly to this point. The plaintiff, having chosen to sue alone upon a promissory note to his wife, given during the coverture, the defendant attempted to set off a debt due from the wife <em>dum sola. </em>The Court disallowed the set-off, expressly upon the ground of the husband\u2019s election exercised by the form of the action. They say, \u201cThe form of the security gave the husband a \u201c right to treat it as joint property or as several; and if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u201c chose to treat it as several, he might deal with it as his \u201c own and the consequence of his so treating it,would be \u201c to let in, by way of set-off to any claim by him, any debts \u201c due from him. If oh the other hand he elected to treat \u201c it as a joint property of himself and his wife, in her right, \u201c he might let in debts due from her in her own right, but' \u201cit is clear that both classes of debts could not be let \u201cin.\" 1 <em>Roper, on H. &amp; W. </em>(212.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Nor is the position tenable, that the right of the executor to set-off ought not to depend upon mere form of the suit, upon the election of the husband to join his wife or to sue alone. For the conversion of the wife\u2019s <em>chose </em>in action is the right of the husband, to be exercised at his election, which election he signifies by the form of the action, and effect must be given to it. No act of the husband is a reduction to his possession contrary to his intention. This was the principle of <em>Wall vs. Tomlinson, </em>16 <em>Ves. </em>415, where the husband of a residuary legatee, coming into possession, as executor and trustee, of stock to which his wife ivas entitled, was held not thereby to have reduced it to possession, because the transfer of the stock to him was made <em>diverso intuitu. </em>And, in <em>Timbers vs. Katz, 6 W. &amp; S. </em>290, where the husband joined his wife, in a receipt for money due on a bond given to her <em>dum sola, </em>but without taking the money, was held not to have reduced the bond to his possession. C. J. Gibson says, \u201cthe ownership follows his will ; for the law \u201c will not cast it on him against his consent.\u201d So in <em>Dennison vs. Nigh, </em>2 <em>Watts </em>90. It is clear then that, as it is at the husband\u2019s election, whether to bar his wife\u2019s interest in her legacy, he has power, by joining her in the suit, to protect her interest until recovery and execution and thus the creditor\u2019s right of set-off is unavoidably controlled by the form of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In Pennsylvania, notwithstanding that, by some of the decisions in that State, the wife\u2019s right of survivorship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>has been treated according to the strongest view, as a subsisting title and not a bare chance, still it has been held in three cases subject to be set off against the husband\u2019s debt and in one case, in a joint suit for the <em>chose </em>in action. <em>Yohe vs. Barnett, </em>1 <em>Binn. </em>358; <em>Wishart vs. Downey and </em>wife, 15 <em>S. &amp; R. 77; Lowman's Appeal, </em>3 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>349. See also Brockenridge J., in <em>Murray vs. Williamson, </em>3 <em>Binn. </em>135.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">These cases, however, rest upon the construction given to statutes of that State, and they are expressly distinguished from the English course of decisions. In <em>Yohe vs. Barnet, </em>1 <em>Binn. </em>358, which the later cases followed, the wife had an interest in certain real estate, which was the subject of proceedings for partition in the Orphans\u2019 Court. The real estate was valued and her share of the valuation money was secured, pursuant to the statutes, by a bond taken, as it seems from the report, in the husband\u2019s name. He was indebted to the intestate upon a judgment and against this, upon petition of the administrators, the money due on the bond was allowed to be set off. The decision is based upon the effect of the bond being in the husband\u2019s name, pursuant to the statute. The case in 3 <em>Binney, Murray vs. Williamson </em>does not touch the question, though Brockenridge J., in his opinion, refers to the English doctrine against setting off the wife\u2019s <em>chose </em>in action against the husband\u2019s debt as not in force in Pennsylvania, under the broader construction of their statute of set-off. In the next subsequent case of <em>Wishart vs. Downey &amp; wife, </em>15 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>77, on a <em>sci.fa. </em>by husband and wife, on a recognizance given to secure the wife\u2019s share of her father\u2019s estate, a debt due from the husband was set off, the court resting upon the cases in Binney, as having settled a broader rule of set-off than that of the English decisions. They say, <em>\u201c </em>In England the suit being in right \u201cof the wife and of such a nature, as that it would survive \u201cto her, this claim could not be set off. Our law differs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\"from theirs and this, if proved, was a set-off.\u201d <em>Lowman's </em>Appeal, in 3 W. &amp; S. which was the case of a legacy to the wife simply follows the prior Pennsylvania cases. So that the course of decisions in that State is an acknowledged departure from the general rule founded upon their own statutes. It cannot escape notice that these decisions are strikingly incongruous with the strong views,taken in that State, as to the unaltered title or ownership of the, wife, in her <em>dioses </em>in action, until an actual reduction to the husband\u2019s possession, he having, as C. J. Gibson forcibly puts it in <em>Timbers vs. Katz, </em>6 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>290, no sem- \u201c blance of ownership in the meantime \u201d <em>i. e. </em>until the conversion toffiis possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In <em>Ferguson vs. Lathrop, </em>15 <em>Wend. </em>625, the husband and wife having joined in a lease of the wife\u2019s premises and distrained together for the rent, the tenant was allowed. to set off a demand against the husband alone, and the court go so far as to announce broadly that \"a legal \u201c demand against him ought not to be defeated by making \u201c an unnecessary use of the name of his wife,\u201d\u2014that as he had a right voluntarily to receive the rent or to receive payment of it by the satisfaction of the debt he owed the defendant without violating the rights of his wife, the law may compel him to do it without such violation. As applied to that case the principle stated was correct; because the accruing rents of the wife\u2019s real estate were the husband\u2019s absolutely without any right in the wife and the wife was improperly joined both in the lease and in action for the rent : but it is wholly unsustained by authority or principle, as applied to <em>ckoses </em>in action of the wife, in which the wife retains an interest, determinable only, as we have seen, at the voluntary election of the husband, or in some cases, of his assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">It is worthy of notice that so far as this decision rests, as it does, upon the consideration that the husband might have sued alone, even were its conclusion tenable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>that therefore the case should be treated as if he had sued alone, would not be applicable to a suit in equity, for there the husband is required in all cases to join his wife, to the very end that her interest in her <em>dioses </em>in action may be protected. A directly contrary decision in New York is <em>Mollan vs. Griffith, </em>3 <em>Paige </em>402. In a suit by husband and wife, to recover rents and profits of the wife\u2019s real estate, against executors who had collected them, the executors sought to set off the amount of an overpayment which they had made to the husband, for a legacy to the wife, he having given a bond to refund in case of a deficiency of assets, which there proved to be. The Chancellor disallowed the set-off, holding that the debts were not due in the same right, the demand for the rents and profits being in right of the wife and such as would belong to her by survivorship, whereas the overpayment to the husband, upon the legacy, was his individual debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Turning now to the English cases we shall find that they treat both debts due to the wife and from the wife <em>dum sola, </em>as being in a right so distinct from debts due to or from the husband, as to preclude set-off between them, under all circumstances, unless the husband shall have converted her <em>dioses </em>in action to his use, or have assumed her liabilities. A case from the Common Pleas in 4 Geo. III, <em>Paynter vs. Walker, </em>is cited in <em>Buller's N. P. 179, </em>(a book itself of great authority) to the point that \u2018 \u2018 a debt due to a man in right of his wife cannot be set \u201coff in an action against him on his own bond.\u201d. <em>Wood vs. Akers, </em>2 <em>Esp. Rep. </em>594, proceeds upon a like distinction between the husband\u2019s liability for the wife\u2019s debts and for his own. There the husband sued for a debt due to himself, and the defendant was not allowed to set off a debt owing by the wife <em>dum sola, </em>the husband not having assumed it, and his liability being subject to be determined by his surviving her. Upon the same principle in <em>Burrough vs. Moss, </em>10 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>558, where the husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>sued alone upon a promissory note given to the wife during coverture, thus making it his separate property, it was held that defendant could not set off a debt due from the wife <em>dum sola. </em>The Court, there in stating the effect of the joinder or non-joinder of the wife upon the question of set-off, say, that if the husband, instead of suing upon the note of the wife in his own name, had \u201celected to \u201ctreat it as the joint property of himself and his wife \u201c in her right he might let in debts due from her in her \u201cright, <em>but it is clear that both classes of debts could not \u201c be let </em>in\u201d <em>i. e., </em>her debts and his own debts. These cases abundantly show that in the common law courts the joint rights or the joint liabilities of husband and wife cannot, and the husband\u2019s separate demands or liabilities cannot be set off. The cases in equity, so far as the question has arisen, are to the same effect, with this difference in favor of the wife, that, whereas at law the husband may or may not join her in a suit for a <em>chose </em>in action accruing during the coverture, being then obliged to join her only for those which accrued to her <em>dum sola, </em>in equity he is required to join her in all cases, so that, in a court of equity, the wife\u2019s <em>chose </em>in action is always protected against set-off. <em>Lady Elibank vs. Montolieu, </em>5 <em>Ves. </em>737 was cited as an authority in favor of setting off the balance of a wife\u2019s distributive share, against the husband\u2019s debt to the intestate, after satisfying out of it her equity to a settlement. But the case decides only that on a bill filed on behalf of <em>the wife alone </em>against the administrator for a settlement the administrator could not set off the husband\u2019s debt against the wife\u2019s equity ; and it was referred to a master to determine what should be a reasonable settlement: but what disposal should be made of the balance of the distributive share after making the settlement was not a question before the court, nor was at all dwelt upon. Nor very clearly could it have been acted upon or any question of set-off against the balance have arisen except in a case between the administrator and the husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>or as in the case next cited between the administrator and the husband\u2019s assignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In the subsequent case of <em>Carr vs. Taylor, </em>10 <em>Ves. </em>575, the same question arose and was decided. The bill was filed by the wife against an administrator for a distributive share to have the whole share settled upon her in consequence of the husband\u2019s bankruptcy. The administrator claimed to retain a debt due from the husband. The assignees in bankruptcy being parties and claiming the whole share, the question of set-off was involved not only as against the wife\u2019s equity, but as against the surplus to which the assignees would be entitled. The Master of the Rolls, Sir Wm. Grant, disallowed the set-off altogether, decreeing the distributive share to the assignees, subject to a settlement to be made by them out of it upon the wife. The language of Sir Wm. Grant is very direct. \u201c with regard\u201d he says, \u201cto the claim of set-off made by \u201c the administratrix of Taylor upon the ground that the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s husband was indebted to the estate of the intestate, whatever controversy there might have been \u201c upon the right of the husband to sue in his own name \u201c for the legal <em>choses </em>in action of his wife, he could not \u201c sue for this fund without joining her; and if he had ob- \u201c tained a decree for it in her right, and died before he \u201c had reduced it into possession it would have survived. \u201c This is a case, therefore, in which there can be no set- \u201c off for the debt of the husband.\u201d Now it can make no difference, as to the application of the principle thus stated to our case, that by statute a legacy is made a legal <em>chose </em>in action, which the husband may sue for alone at law. For these parties are now in equity, where their rights stand precisely as they did before Sir Wm. Grant, and, further, even at law, as has been abundantly shewn, the husband may preserve all his wife\u2019s rights in a legal <em>chose </em>in action by joining her with him in a suit at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The question was next touched, but without any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>decision upon it, in <em>McMahon vs. </em>Burchell, 3 <em>Hare </em>97 and 5 <em>Hare </em>322, before V. C. Sir James Wigram. Upon a bill for a legacy payable to the husband, and also for one payable to the wife, the executors claimed to set off rent due from the husband, for certain premises occupied by him as tenant, in common with the testator. The Vice Chancellor held the set-off available as against the husband\u2019s legacy, adding as reported in 3 Hare, \u201cbut it will not form any set-off against the legacy to the plaintiff, Henrietta his wife.\u201d The case came before him again as reported in 5 <em>Hare, </em>upon the report of the Master to whom it had been referred to inquire what amount of rent was due from the husband to the testator. By the report of the Master no rent was found due applicable to the legacies. The report being sustained there was an end of the case before the Vice Chancellor, but at the conclusion he said that the report in 3 <em>Hare </em>of his remark as to the set-off against the wife\u2019s legacy was inaccurate ; that his meaning was not that the husband\u2019s debt could not be set-off at all against the wife\u2019s legacy but that it could not be so set-off to the prejudice of the wife\u2019s equity (if any) to a settlement. With the Vice Chancellor\u2019s explanation, his remark as first reported ceases to be an authority against the set-off of a husband\u2019s debt against the balance of a legacy after a settlement on the wife but the explanation itself expresses no opinion in favor of a set-off against such balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">A very decisive case in protection of the wife\u2019s legacy against her husband\u2019s debts came in the same year (1843) before V. C. Sir L. Shadwell. <em>Harrison vs. Andrews, </em>13 <em>Simons </em>595. There one Waters and wife had agreed with the executors that a legacy of <em>\u00a3100 </em>to the wife should be set off against the like sum due from the husband to the testator on a promissory note, and he and his wife signed a receipt for the legacy ; but <em>it did not appear that the executors had delivered tip the note to </em>him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The husband died, the wife surviving. She was decreed to have the legacy paid to her, the Vice Chancellor hold-that \u201cnothing but a release by her \u201chusband or payment of it to him could be a discharge of it \u201cas against his surviving wife.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
