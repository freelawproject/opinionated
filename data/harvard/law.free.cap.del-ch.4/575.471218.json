It was alleged that the lands in question- consisted, for the most part, of barren and rugged hillsides, of no value whatever for agricultural purposes, and of little value for building or other purposes, and the price agreed upon was grossly excessive, and that the actual market value o\u00ed the whole tract was less than twenty-five thousand dollars. Also, that the purchase of these lands would require the outlay of a large sum of money for their improvement, and would be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>fruitful source of expense and extravagance wholly unwarranted by the population or resources of said city.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-5\">The legal ground, however, upon which the information was based was, that the purchase of the lands and the creation of the debt for the same were not only wholly without any warrant of authority at law and in gross violation of the rights of the inhabitants and taxables of the city, but also that the creation of the debts and liabilities for the purchase of such lands was in violation of the express provisions of the charter of the city, and the supplements and amendments to the same limiting the amount of the debt of said city which might be lawfully created, contracted or incurred by it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-7\">On motion of <em>Spruance </em>for the relator,</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-8\">On the return day, <em>S.
