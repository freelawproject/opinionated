Lab. Law \u00a7 650 <em>et seq., </em>for, <em>inter alia, </em>unpaid overtime. The district court (Furman, <em>Judge), </em>after conditionally certifying a collective action under the FLSA, granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on both the FLSA and NYLL claims as to both the named and opt-in Plaintiffs, concluding that \u201cas a matter of law, Plaintiffs are properly classified as independent contractors rather than employees\u201d for purposes of both statutes. <em>Saleem v. Corp. Transp. Grp., Ltd., </em>52 F.Supp.3d 526, 543, 545 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). We agree with the district court that, \u201ceven when the historical facts and the relevant factors are viewed in the light most favorable\u201d to Plaintiffs, they constitute independent contractors for FLSA purposes as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Barfield v. N.Y.C. Health &amp; Hosps. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>Corp., </em>537 F.3d 132, 144 (2d Cir. 2008). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">I. Facts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Plaintiffs are black-car drivers in the tristate area who owned or operated black-car franchises and were affiliated with Defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Six Defendants (collectively, \u201cFranchisor Defendants\u201d) each own a \u201cbase license\u201d that allows them to operate a black-car dispatch base in New York City, and to sell franchises to individual drivers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 59A-03(c). The remaining three Defendants are various incarnations of the \u201cCorporate Transportation Group\u201d (collectively, \u201cCTG\u201d), which provides administrative support for the operation of the Franchisor Defendants\u2019 dispatch bases (as well as for 126 other for-hire vehicle enterprises) by handling, <em>inter alia, </em>billing, referral, payment, bookkeeping, accounting, voucher processing, and dispatching.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Franchisor Defendants and CTG operate out of a single facility in Brooklyn and constitute \u201ca single integrated enterprise and/or joint employer for the purposes of the [FLSA].\u201d Joint Appendix [\u201cJ.A.\u201d] 1317. Among the approximately 70 people employed in CTG\u2019s dispatch unit at the time relevant here, 40 were in billing, six or seven were in customer service, five were in driver relations, and at least two were in sales.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There were roughly 700 black cars affiliated with the Franchisor Defendants\u2019 dispatch bases and operating under the CTG umbrella. CTG\u2019s clients were primarily corporate entities, such as Deutsche Bank and Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">The named Plaintiffs rented or purchased their franchises directly from the Franchisor Defendants or, in some cases, from other franchisees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiffs who rented franchises paid $130 to $150 per week, while Plaintiffs who purchased their franchises directly from a Franchisor Defendant did so pursuant to franchise agreements, which required them to pay franchise fees ranging from a nominal amount (or even nothing) to as much as $60,000. The franchise agreements also required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>franchisees to pay additional .fees, some upfront and some recurring, which varied from agreement to agreement. (For example, in exchange for a high upfront fee, \u201cPlatinum\u201d franchises offered by certain Franchisor Defendants provided for a significantly lower voucher processing fee\u2014 the percentage of a fare charged to a driver for payment processing \u2014 than their free \u201cGold\u201d franchises. <em>See </em>J.A. 743, 752.) Franchisees also had to obtain a New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (\u201cTLC\u201d) license, insurance, and a vehicle which they were responsible for maintaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 franchise agreements describe the nature of the relationship between franchisor and franchisee as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">Franchisee is not an employee or agent of Franchisor, but merely a subscriber to the services offered by Franchisor. Franchisee shall at all times be free from the control or direction of Franchisor in the operation of Franchisee\u2019s business, and Franchisor shall not control, supervise or direct the services to be performed by Franchisee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">J.A. 732. Each franchise agreement also contains a \u201cnon-compete\u201d provision which prohibited CTG-affiliated drivers from driving CTG customers \u201cwithout processing payment for such services through CTG.\u201d J.A. 3477-79. Failure to comply with this and other terms was grounds for termination of the franchise. Significantly, however, the franchise agreements did not prohibit drivers from transporting non-CTG customers for a competitor black-car company, or independently, during their affiliation with CTG.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The franchise agreements also required that drivers comply with \u201cRulebooks\u201d\u2014 manuals setting out certain standards of conduct \u2014 specific to each Franchisor Defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Rulebooks forbid, for instance, harassing customers or other drivers and submitting fraudulent vouchers. The Rulebooks also include a dress code, which required drivers to dress neatly in specified business attire, as well as guidelines for keeping vehicles clean. Drivers were not required to wear a uniform, however, or to mark their cars with insignia denoting an affiliation with the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The Rulebooks were enforced by each Franchisor Defendant\u2019s Security Committee, each of which was composed entirely of drivers who served elected terms. Security Committees could hold hearings on complaints and suspected violations. If a Security Committee determined that a driver had broken a rule, it could impose a monetary penalty on the driver, temporarily suspend the driver, or even terminate the driver\u2019s franchise agreement. Although it is undisputed that drivers elected the members of the Security Committees, the parties dispute whether CTG exercised influence over the Committees.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">During their affiliation with the Defendants, Plaintiffs, like other drivers in. the CTG network, possessed considerable autonomy in their day-to-day affairs. Drivers could, for example, choose among three principal ways of securing fares for driving CTG customers. First, they could wait in a physical queue of cars outside certain high-volume CTG clients\u2019 businesses. Second, they could elect to drive under a CTG contract with the New York City Metropolitan Transport Authority (\u201cMTA\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>transporting by prearrangement clients who were unable to travel via public transportation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Third, drivers could access CTG\u2019s proprietary black-car dispatch system, through which CTG transmitted requests for service from servers in a dispatch room to an application (\u201capp\u201d) on drivers\u2019 smart phones.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In all three cases, clients provided vouchers to the driver transporting them in lieu of cash payment, and these vouchers were thereafter processed by CTG.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Drivers also determined when and how often to drive, and the record reflects that they worked vastly different amounts of time, without providing any notice to Defendants.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiffs likewise chose which area in which to work, and they were at liberty to \u2014 and did \u2014 accept or decline jobs that were offered.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Significantly, Plaintiffs also could \u2014 and did \u2014 drive for dispatch bases other than the one with which they were affiliated, and they were thus free to shift as they chose during the workday from one dispatch service to another. Most of the named Plaintiffs drove for other black-car companies regularly, and some earned substantial sums as a result.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Some drivers also transported \u2014 and were paid directly by \u2014 customers with whom they had made individual arrangements, and others, though it was contrary to TLC regulations, <em>see </em>35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 59B-25(a), picked up street hails.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Although CTG- negotiated rates with its clients, supplied the proprietary dispatch technology, and operated the dispatch system, the record suggests that Plaintiffs took home the majority \u2014 in some cases up to 85% \u2014 of each CTG fare, less some small additional fees. On this basis, Plaintiffs classified themselves as independent contractors on their tax returns and took substantial business deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">On November 19, 2012, Plaintiffs Ma-zhar Saleem and Jagjit Singh filed a complaint in district court, seeking to recover unpaid overtime and other wages under the FLSA and the NYLL on behalf of a class of similarly situated drivers. On June 17, 2013, the district court conditionally certified a collective action pursuant to Section 216(b) of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b), and approved a notice to be sent to potential opt-in plaintiffs. The court subsequently denied class certification of their NYLL claims, a determination not before us on appeal. <em>Saleem v. Corp. Transp. Grp., Ltd., </em>No. 12 CIV. 8450(JMF), 2013 WL 6061340, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 15, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">On September 16, 2014, Judge Furman granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment as to both the named Plaintiffs and those Plaintiffs who had opted into the collective action. <em>Sa-leem, </em>52 F.Supp.3d at 545. In concluding that Defendants were entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiffs were not, as a matter of law, employees of Defendants for FLSA purposes, the district court applied the five factors enumerated by this Court in <em>Brock v. Superior Care, Inc., </em>840 F.2d 1054, 1058-59 (2d Cir. 1988), analyzing each factor individually and considering whether the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d suggested that Plaintiffs were' \u201cemployees\u201d or \u201cindependent contractors,\u201d <em>Saleem, </em>52 F.Supp.3d at 535-36, 544. The district court concluded that \u201c[notwithstanding that the final <em>[Superior </em>Care] factor,\u201d the degree to which employees are integral to a business, \u201cfavors employment status,\u201d \u201c[wjeighing all of the <em>[Superior Care] </em>factors and considering the totality of the circumstances,\u201d \u201cthe drivers here fall into the [independent contractor] category as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">On January 6, 2015, Plaintiffs timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and we will affirm only if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom it was entered, demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that judgment was warranted as a matter of law. <em>Barfield, </em>537 F.3d at 140; <em>see also Delaney v. Bank of Am. Corp., </em>766 F.3d 163, 167 (2d Cir. 2014). Here, we examine the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>court\u2019s conclusion that, \u201cas a matter of law, Plaintiffs are properly classified as independent contractors rather than employees for purposes of the FLSA.\u201d <em>Saleem, </em>52 F.Supp.3d at 543. We begin, then, with a brief explication of our case law, as is relevant to this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The FLSA defines an \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cany individual employed by an employer.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(e)(1). \u201cAn entity \u2018employs\u2019 an individual under the FLSA\u201d if it \u201c \u2018suffer[s] or permit[s] that individual to work.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Zheng v. Liberty Apparel Co., </em>355 F.3d 61, 66 (2d Cir. 2003) (alterations in original) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(g)); <em>see also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(d) (defining \u201cemployer\u201d as \u201cany person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of any employer in relation to an employee\u201d). In light of the definition\u2019s circularity, courts have endeavored to distinguish between employees and independent contractors based on factors crafted to shed light on the underlying economic reality of the relationship.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As the district court recognized, this Court has focused on \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d in addressing our \u201cultimate concern ... whether, as a matter of economic reality, the workers depend upon someone else\u2019s business for the opportunity to render service or are in business for themselves.\u201d <em>Superior Care, </em>840 F.2d at 1059; <em>see also Goldberg v. Whitaker House Coop., Inc., </em>366 U.S. 28, 33, 81 S.Ct. 933, 6 L.Ed.2d 100 (1961) (\u201c \u2018[E]conomic reality\u2019 rather than \u2018technical concepts\u2019 is to be the test of employment.\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Silk, </em>331 U.S. 704, 713, 67 S.Ct. 1463, 91 L.Ed. 1757 (1947))); <em>Bartels v. Birmingham, </em>332 U.S. 126, 130, 67 S.Ct. 1547, 91 L.Ed. 1947 (1947) (\u201c[E]mployees are those who as a matter of economic reality are dependent upon the business to which they render service.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Our case law has identified certain factors, first set out in <em>Silk, </em>331 U.S. at 716, 67 S.Ct. 1463, as relevant to separating employees from independent contractors in the context of the FLSA,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>see Superior Care, </em>840 F.2d at 1058-59. Nevertheless, \u201c[tjhese factors are merely aids to analysis,\u201d <em>Thibault v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>612 F.3d 843, 846 (5th Cir. 2010), and are helpful only insofar as they elucidate the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d of the ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>rangement at issue, <em>Superior Care, </em>840 F.2d at 1059. Relevant FLSA precedent, despite endorsing the <em>Silk </em>factors, cautions against their \u201cmechanical application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we stated in <em>Barfield v. New York City Health &amp; Hospitals Corp., </em>537 F.3d at 141, \u201c[t]he determination of whether an employer-employee relationship exists for purposes of the FLSA should be grounded in \u2018economic reality rather than technical concepts,\u2019 ... determined by reference not to \u2018isolated factors but rather upon the circumstances of the whole activity,\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted) (first quoting <em>Goldberg, </em>366 U.S. at 33, 81 S.Ct. 933, and then quoting <em>Rutherford Food Corp. v. McComb, </em>331 U.S. 722, 730, 67 S.Ct. 1473, 91 L.Ed. 1772 (1947)).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, while the following discussion draws upon and discusses the <em>Silk </em>factors where relevant, it trains on the \u201cultimate question\u201d: the economic reality of Plaintiffs\u2019 relationship with CTG.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Upon <em>de novo </em>review, \u201ceven when the historical facts and the relevant factors are viewed in the light most favorable\u201d to Plaintiffs, <em>id. </em>at 144, and despite the broad sweep of the FLSA\u2019s definition of \u201cemployee,\u201d <em>Darden, </em>503 U.S. at 326, 112 S.Ct. 1344, the record here does not permit the conclusion that Plaintiffs were employees, but instead establishes that they were in business for themselves. As discussed below, Plaintiffs independently determined (1) the manner and extent of their affiliation with CTG; (2) whether to work exclusively for CTG accounts or provide rides for CTG\u2019s rivals\u2019 clients and/or develop business of their own; (3) the degree to which they would invest in their driving businesses; and (4) when, where, and how regularly to provide rides for CTG clients. While none of these facts is determinative on its own, considered as a whole with the goal of discerning the underlying economic reality of the relationship here, the district court correctly determined that Plaintiffs are, as a matter of law, \u201cproperly classified as independent contractors rather than employees for purposes of the FLSA.\u201d <em>Saleem, </em>52 F.Supp.3d at 543. As a result, Defendants were properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">A. <em>Affiliation with CTG</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">From the start, Plaintiffs were \u201cdriver-owners\u201d who made significant decisions regarding the operation of their small businesses. <em>Silk, </em>331 U.S. at 719, 67 S.Ct. 1463. Plaintiffs chose not only to enter into a franchise agreement with a CTG Franchisor Defendant instead of seeking more conventional employment, but also exercised considerable discretion in choosing the nature and parameters of that affiliation. Some Plaintiffs elected to purchase a franchise, either directly from a Franchisor Defendant or on the secondary market, while others opted to rent one. Further, because the franchise agreements contained different terms, and particularly because there was wide variation in both the price of the franchises and the fees associated with using them, Plaintiffs had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>strike a balance between a franchise\u2019s upfront cost and the favorability of its terms, a choice which ultimately affected its profitability.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The franchise agreements\u2019 termination provisions also are indicative of Plaintiffs\u2019 independence. While Plaintiffs could reassess their choice to affiliate with CTG (not to mention the nature of that affiliation) and \u201cterminate the [franchise] agreements\u201d as they pleased,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Saleem, </em>52 F.Supp.3d at 542, the terms of the agreements committed the Franchisor Defendants to maintaining them for substantial durations, or even indefinitely, absent Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of those terms. Because Plaintiffs were free to drive for competitors, for personal clients, or not at all without violating their franchise agreements, the termination provisions constituted a significant restriction on the ability of Franchisor Defendants to exercise control.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In addition, each of Plaintiffs\u2019 agreements also designated them as independent contractors, and some Plaintiffs formed corporations to operate their franchises. \u201cThough an employer\u2019s self-serving label of workers as independent contractors is not controlling,\u201d <em>Superior Care, </em>840 F.2d at 1059; <em>see also Thibault, </em>612 F.3d at 845-46 (noting that \u201ccontractual designation of the worker as an independent contractor is not <em>necessarily </em>controlling\u201d (emphasis added)), such a designation in the franchise agreement is pertinent to \u201cthe parties\u2019 beliefs about the nature of the relationship,\u201d <em>Estate of Suskovich v. Anthem Health Plans of Va., Inc., </em>553 F.3d 559, 564 (7th Cir. 2009); <em>see also Johnson v. City of Saline, </em>151 F.3d 564, 568-69 (6th Cir. 1998) (observing, in ADA case, that \u201cthe contractual relationship reads unmistakably as one with an independent contractor as opposed to one with an employee\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, in the language of the <em>Silk </em>factors, Plaintiffs demonstrated independence and initiative in selecting franchise agreements that best fit their business plans, and in choosing \u2014 independent of Franchisor Defendants \u2014 to persist in those affiliations, all of which suggests, in the circumstances of this case, that Plaintiffs were \u201cin business for themselves.\u201d <em>Superior Care, </em>840 F.2d at 1058-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">\n<em>B. Entrepreneurial Opportunities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1QN\">The fact that Plaintiffs could (and did) work for CTG\u2019s business rivals and transport personal clients while simultaneously maintaining their franchises without consequence suggests, in two respects, that CTG exercised minimal control over Plaintiffs. First, on its face, a company relinquishes control over its workers when it permits them to work for its competitors. Second, when an individual is able to draw income through work for others, he is less economically dependent on his putative employer. This lack of control, while not dispositive, weighs in favor of independent contractor status. <em>See, e.g., Keller v. Miri Microsystems LLC, </em>781 F.3d 799, 807 (6th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Cir. 2015) (\u201cIf a worker has multiple jobs for different companies, then that weighs in favor of finding that the worker is an independent contractor.\u201d); <em>Herman v. Express Sixty-Minutes Delivery Serv., Inc., </em>161 F.3d 299, 303 (5th Cir. 1998) (noting fact that \u201c[t]he drivers can work for other courier delivery systems\u201d supported independent contractor status); <em>Kirsch v. Fleet Street, Ltd., </em>148 F.3d 149, 171 (2d Cir. 1998) (affirming finding of independent contractor status when, <em>inter alia, </em>the worker \u201cwas allowed to sell merchandise on behalf of other companies\u201d); <em>see also Freund v. Hi-Tech Satellite, Inc., </em>185 Fed.Appx. 782, 784 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (affirming district court\u2019s finding that worker\u2019s ability \u201cto take jobs from\u201d competitors, and to \u201ctake as many or as few jobs as he desired,\u201d supported district court\u2019s conclusion that there was not a \u201csignificant degree of permanence\u201d in the relationship at issue); <em>cf., e.g., Baker v. Flint Eng\u2019g &amp; Constr. Co., </em>137 F.3d 1436, 1442 (10th Cir. 1998) (stating that, generally speaking, \u201c \u2018[employees\u2019 usually work for only one employer and such relationship is continuous and indefinite in duration\u201d (quoting <em>Dole v. Snell, </em>875 F.2d 802, 811 (10th Cir. 1989))).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">More specifically, Plaintiffs here operated \u201cbusiness organization^] that could or did shift as a unit from one [car-service] to another,\u201d suggesting Defendants did not exercise significant control. <em>Rutherford Food Corp. v. McComb, </em>331 U.S. 722, 730, 67 S.Ct. 1473, 91 L.Ed. 1772 (1947). Neither Plaintiffs\u2019 franchise agreements nor TLC regulations barred Plaintiffs from either providing rides arranged through dispatch bases other than the Franchisor Defendant with whom they had affiliated, or from driving for other, competing black-car companies.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The agreements likewise did not prohibit Plaintiffs from driving clients of their own (provided that payment by any CTG client was processed through the CTG system), or from picking up street hails (though doing so was forbidden by TLC rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">To be clear, pursuant to the economic reality test, \u201cit is not what [Plaintiffs] <em>could </em>have done that counts, but as a matter of economic reality what they actually <em>do </em>that is dispositive.\u201d <em>Brock v. Mr. W Fireworks, Inc., </em>814 F.2d 1042, 1047 (5th Cir. 1987). It is undisputed, however, that Plaintiffs here actually <em>did </em>provide rides to non-CTG clients in at least three different ways.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>First, many Plaintiffs provided rides by driving for competing black-car companies. Tax returns demonstrate that Plaintiffs derived substantial revenue from this practice. Ranjit Bhullar, for instance, earned $395,081.90 driving for \u201cExec. Charge\u201d between 2006 and 2008, and Malook Singh earned $206,568.71 driving for \u201cElite\u201d between 2006 and 2009. Indeed, some 71% of deposed Plaintiffs earned at least some income by driving for non-CTG black-car companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Second, it is undisputed that some Plaintiffs regularly drove personal clients. An-jum Ali, for example, had a repeat, non-CTG customer who first hailed him in 2010 and later arranged for pick-up in various places in New York City by calling Ali at his home number.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Jose Solorzano, for his part, also had one personal client for eight to ten years,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and Avneet Koura was contacted directly \u201c[o]nee or twice a week\u201d by repeat personal clients between 2006 and 2008. J.A. 404-05. Plaintiffs made investments to build these relationships, too. Some created business cards describing their services, while others placed advertisements.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Third, for the sake of completeness, many Plaintiffs also picked up passengers via street hail, despite TLC\u2019s (apparently under-enforced) prohibition of this practice. <em>See </em>35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 55-19. In fact, one driver admitted doing so while \u201clogged in\u201d to the CTG app and waiting in the dispatch queue. As with individual, non-CTG clients, street hail passengers paid in cash or via independent merchant accounts, rather than through the CTG voucher system.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">Moreover, these alternate means of generating revenue aside, Plaintiffs also wielded considerable independence and discretion when working under CTG\u2019s umbrella. To offer rides to CTG clients, Plaintiffs could join a physical queue outside of a high volume client business, offer assistance to disabled customers seeking prearranged rides pursuant to CTG\u2019s contract with the MTA, or book into CTG\u2019s dispatch system. Further, some Plaintiffs who owned franchises chose not to drive at all and, instead of letting their franchises lie dormant, permitted other individuals to drive for them.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>See Silk, </em>331 U.S. at 718, 67 S.Ct. 1463 (observing that truck-drivers\u2019 practice of \u201chir[ing] their own helpers\u201d supported finding of independent contractor status).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">Accordingly, far from a circumstance, like that in <em>Superior Care, </em>where the individuals seeking \u201cemployee\u201d classification \u201cdepended entirely on [the putative employer\u2019s] referrals to find job assignments,\u201d 840 F.2d at 1060, Plaintiffs here possessed considerable independence in maximizing their income through a variety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>of means. By toggling back and forth between different car companies and personal clients, and by deciding how best to obtain business from CTG\u2019s clients, drivers\u2019 \u201cprofits increased\u201d through \u201c \u2018the[ir] \u2018initiative, judgment!,] or foresight\u2019\u201d \u2014 all attributes of the \u201ctypical independent contractor.\u201d <em>Keller, </em>781 F.3d at 809 (quoting <em>Rutherford, </em>331 U.S. at 730, 67 S.Ct. 1473). Whatever \u201ccontrol\u201d CTG exerted over negotiated fares and its rolls of institutional clients, Plaintiffs retained \u201cviable economic status that [could] be [and was] traded to other [car companies].\u201d <em>Usery, </em>527 F.2d at 1312. Thus, as a matter of economic reality, Plaintiffs\u2019 affiliation with Defendants was but one means by which they generated income from their driving businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\n<em>C. Investment and Return</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AU3\">Regardless whether they actually purchased a franchise, the record also shows that Plaintiffs invested heavily in their driving businesses \u2014 another indication that they were \u201cin business for themselves.\u201d <em>Superior Care, </em>840 F.2d at 1059. In the economic reality test, \u201clarge capital expenditures\u201d \u2014 as opposed to \u201cnegligible items, or labor itself\u2019 \u2014 are highly relevant to determining whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor. <em>Dole, </em>875 F.2d at 810; <em>see also id. </em>at 810-11 (deeming \u201cannual investment of $400 in tools or equipment\u201d to be \u201cnegligible\u201d); <em>cf. Berger Transfer &amp; Storage v. Cent. States, Se. &amp; Sw. Areas Pension, </em>85 F.3d 1374, 1378 (8th Cir. 1996) (affirming finding of independent contractor status under common law agency test in part because \u201c[t]he owner-operators were responsible for ... purchasing and maintaining the leased equipment, [and] paying operating expenses such as fuel and repairs\u201d). In assessing such expenditures, we ask whether the alleged employee made financial commitments in an attempt to generate a \u201creturn on ... investment.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Dole, </em>875 F.2d at 811; <em>see, e.g., Silk, </em>331 U.S. at 716, 67 S.Ct. 1463 (affirming truck-drivers\u2019 independent contractor status when they, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cown[ed] their trucks\u201d). Here, Plaintiffs indisputably did.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">In disclosures to the New York State Attorney General, each Franchisor Defendant presented an \u201cestimated initial investment\u201d to be expected in acquiring a franchise. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 1817-20. One Franchisor Defendant estimated expenses for an individual purchasing a franchise as totaling between $68,838 and $89,038.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> J.A. 1817-20. Such sums constitute a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>stantial financial outlay on Plaintiffs\u2019 part, even beyond the purchase or rental of the franchise itself, and in essential facets of Plaintiffs\u2019 business operations: vehicle acquisition,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> fuel, repair, and maintenance, license, registration, and insurance fees, and tolls, parking, and tickets. CTG did not provide reimbursements for these expenses,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> never mind for discretionary investment in business cards, advertising, or other ventures designed to attract customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Because Plaintiffs were free under their franchise agreements to branch out on their own, or to drive for other, competing black-car companies, the degree to which these expenditures yielded returns was a function not only of CTG\u2019s network, but also of the business acumen of each Plaintiff, who thus had significant control over \u201cessential determinants of profits in [the] business.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Dole, </em>875 F.2d at 810. Further, while Plaintiffs ultimately all chose to affiliate with the Franchisor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Defendants, their investments were valuable \u2014 and likely necessary \u2014 even had they chosen to affiliate with a different black-car dispatch base. Thus, Plaintiffs\u2019 expenditures created the platform for a black-car business that could be operated throughout the tri-state area, whether for Defendants or otherwise, again suggesting Plaintiffs were independent contractors, and not employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">D. <em>Schedule Flexibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The ability to choose how much to work also weighs in favor of independent contractor status. <em>See Herman, </em>161 F.3d at 304; <em>Arena v. Plandome Taxi Inc., </em>No. 12 CV 1078(DRH)(WDW), 2014 WL 1427907, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2014) (noting fact that transportation company \u201cdictated the hours the drivers worked\u201d supported employee status); <em>Arena v. Delux Transp. Servs., Inc., </em>3 F.Supp.3d 1, 10 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (noting fact \u201cthat Defendants had little control over when Plaintiff drove, how much he dr[o]ve, or how frequently\u201d \u201cvery persuasively]\u201d supported independent contractor status.); <em>cf. Berger Transfer &amp; Storage, </em>85 F.3d at 1378 (affirming finding of independent contractor status based in part on \u201cconsiderable autonomy regarding when and how long they would work\u201d under common law agency test). Here, Plaintiffs\u2019 schedules were not merely <em>\u201crelatively </em>flexible,\u201d <em>Doty v. Elias, </em>733 F.2d 720, 723 (10th Cir. 1984) (emphasis added), but rather were entirely of their making.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">After purchasing or leasing a franchise and securing a suitable vehicle, Plaintiffs set their own schedules, selecting when, where, and how often to work (if at all). Defendants provided no incentive structure for Plaintiffs to drive at certain times, on particular days, or in specific locations, leaving the decision to work \u201cto the whims [and] choices\u201d of its drivers. <em>Dole, </em>875 F.2d at 806. Likewise, Defendants required no notice on the part of drivers as to when they intended to work, nor did they make any effort to coordinate drivers\u2019 schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Here, as always with the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d inquiry, it is not merely that Plaintiffs nominally could set their own schedules, but also that they actually did so. <em>Id. </em>at \u25a0808. Some Plaintiffs took vacations for weeks at a time without ever notifying Defendants. Anjum Ali, for example, took five weeks off to travel abroad, and regularly took off long weekends. Mazhar Sa-leem took a three-to-four month vacation in 2010 and vacationed for over two months in 2011. Jose Cabrera \u201ct[ook] the entire year of 2011 off\u2019 from driving for Defendants, and resumed doing so in 2012. J.A. 3393 \u00b6 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">On the days when Plaintiffs did work, their hours varied \u2014 again, based on their own preferences, and without Defendants making any attempt to coordinate schedules or set lower or upper limits on working hours. <em>Cf. Dole, </em>875 F.2d at 806 (holding that workers were employees because they did not \u201cact[ ] autonomously, or with any degree of independence which would set them apart from what one would consider normal employee status\u201d). Jagjit Singh sometimes worked as many as fifteen to sixteen hours a day, while Anjum Ali would typically log in from 4:00 p.m. until approximately midnight. Others drove on a far more sporadic basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Plaintiffs also exercised considerable discretion in choosing when and where to drive. <em>Superior Care, </em>840 F.2d at 1059. Marlene Pinedo, for instance, explained that she drove \u201c[f]rom Sunday to Friday ... [b]eeause those are the days when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>there is the most work.\u201d J.A. 416. Pinedo made a similar calculation when determining the times of day during which she would drive, performing two separate shifts, 4:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., because \u201cthey used to give good jobs at those times.\u201d J.A. 417. Anjum Ali, on the other hand, preferred to drive in the evenings in part because, with Mends driving at the same time, he could count on them if he needed help. Similarly \u2014 and predictably \u2014 drivers often selected a geographic zone based on the available jobs there, and record testimony indicates that certain zones in Manhattan were more active than others.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Additionally, the record demonstrates that, as a matter of economic reality, Plaintiffs accepted and rejected (despite the penalty of being placed at the end of the queue) varying numbers of job offers, a fact indicative of the discretion and independence associated with independent contractor status. <em>Cf. Berger Transfer &amp; Storage, </em>85 F.3d at 1378 (affirming district court finding that it was indicative of independent contractor status that long-distance truckers could and did refuse assignments without penalty); <em>Herman, </em>161 F.3d at 303 (noting that couriers could reject job offers \u201cwithout retaliation\u201d in making the same determination). For example, in March 2011, Bhavesh Shah accepted 83 jobs, Jamshed Choudhry accepted 148, and Jose Solorzano accepted fifteen. Likewise, from May 2010 to May 2013, Ranjit Bhul-lar rejected 949 job offers, while Wilman Martinez rejected none.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 flexible work schedules and considerable control over when, where, and in what circumstances to accept a CTG fare not surprisingly resulted in wide disparities in gross earnings for rides provided through Defendants.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> For example, while Jagjit Singh grossed more than $170,000 in 2009 and 2011, J.A. 3433, An-jum Ali earned between $38,928 and $42,445 a year from 2010 through 2012, J.A. 3431. These differences only underscore the economic reality, namely that the \u201cwork force [was] composed of individuals who came and went as they alone pleased,\u201d <em>Dole, </em>875 F.2d at 807, an undisputed fact that is all the more remarkable given the volume-driven nature of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">In the language of the <em>Silk </em>factors, these undisputed facts demonstrate that Defendants did not \u201cexercise control,\u201d and that Plaintiffs demonstrated \u201cinitiative.\u201d <em>Superior Care, </em>840 F.2d at 1060. They also show that, whatever \u201cthe permanence or duration\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 affiliation with Defendants, <em>id. </em>at 1059, both its length and the \u201cregularity\u201d of work was entirely of Plaintiffs\u2019 choosing, <em>cf. Keller, </em>781 F.3d at 807 (\u201cWe may look at the length and regularity of the working relationship between the parties [in assessing the nature of their relationship].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">These circumstances are readily distinguishable from those in which courts have identified an employer-employee relation. In <em>Superior Care, </em>for instance, the employer \u201climited working hours to 40 per week where nurses claimed they were owed overtime,\u201d 840 F.2d at 1060, and in <em>Reich v. Circle C. Investments, Inc., </em>the employer \u201cexercise[d] a great deal of control over the [plaintiffs],\u201d who were \u201cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>quired to comply with weekly work schedules,\u201d 998 F.2d 324, 327 (5th Cir. 1993). In <em>Dole v. Snell, </em>the plaintiff cake-decorators\u2019 schedules were \u201ctotally controlled\u201d by their employer: they were expected to arrive at the premises at a particular hour, prevented from leaving until they had decorated all the cakes to their bosses\u2019 satisfaction, and required to seek their employer\u2019s approval for vacation. 875 F.2d at 806. In short, \u201c[t]he demands of the business controlled the [workers\u2019 schedule],\u201d <em>id. </em>which was indisputably <em>not </em>the case for Plaintiffs here.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Instead, this case resembles those in which we and other Circuits have recognized independent contractor status. In <em>Kirsch v. Fleet Street, </em>for example, we upheld a jury finding that the plaintiff was an independent contractor when, <em>inter alia, </em>he \u201cwas not required to spend time in the company\u2019s offices [and] was free to set his own schedule and take vacations when he wished.\u201d 148 F.3d at 171. Likewise, in <em>Herman v. Express Sixty-Minutes Delivery Service, Inc., </em>the Fifth Circuit concluded that a courier service \u201chad minimal control over its drivers\u201d such that they were independent contractors because, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[t]he drivers set their own hours and days of work.\u201d 161 F.3d at 303. Similarly here, Plaintiffs\u2019 freedom in choosing when, where, and with what regularity to drive CTG clients shows the extent of their economic independence \u2014 that they operated their \u201cbusiness organization[s]\u201d on their own terms, and as they saw fit. <em>Rutherford, </em>331 U.S. at 730, 67 S.Ct. 1473.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u215c \u215c \u215c</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In sum, Plaintiff black-car drivers exercised their business acumen in choosing the manner and extent of their affiliation with CTG; were able to work for rival black-car services, cultivate their own clients, and pick up street hails; made substantial investments in their businesses; and determined when, where, and how regularly to work. They owned or operated enterprises which were flexible and adaptable to market conditions. In short, based on the record here, \u201c[t]hese driver-owners [were] small businessmen.\u201d <em>Silk, </em>331 U.S. at 719, 67 S.Ct. 1463.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Plaintiffs, for their part, rely on record evidence that they contend shows that Defendants exercised control over black-car drivers, so as to make them economically dependent on CTG. Such evidence, Plaintiffs contend, creates a genuine issue as to whether Defendants exercised control over drivers such that they constituted \u201cemployees\u201d pursuant to the FLSA. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We disagree. \u201cOnly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the evidence on which Plaintiffs rely does not change the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d of their business relationship with Defendants. <em>Superior Care, </em>840 F.2d at 1059.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Plaintiffs marshal evidence principally in support of two propositions. First, they argue that the record shows that Defendants exercised control over \u201call significant aspects of its black car business.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>lant\u2019s Br. 11. Plaintiffs point, <em>inter alia, </em>to CTG\u2019s roll of organizational clients, its development and operation of the dispatch system, and the fact that CTG negotiated rates with clients and charged a per-ride fee to drivers. Second, in Plaintiffs\u2019 telling, Defendants exerted influence over drivers by enforcing the Rulebooks indirectly through the Security Committees and, attunes, directly through Eduard Slinin, CTG\u2019s president.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Neither proposition, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, changes the analysis. While Defendants did exercise direct control over certain aspects of the CTG enterprise, they wielded virtually no influence over other essential components of the business; including when, where, in what capacity, and with what frequency Plaintiffs would drive. \u201c[A]ccepting that Defendants engaged in some monitoring and discipline\u201d with respect to Rulebook standards does not alter this picture. <em>Saleem, </em>52 F.Supp.3d at 539. While it may reflect a degree of control over Plaintiffs\u2019 conduct, here, as in <em>Herman, </em>the \u201copportunity for profit and loss was determined by the drivers to a greater degree than [it was by Defendants].\u201d 161 F.3d at 304. Drivers decided with which dispatch base to affiliate (even among those integrated with CTG), whether to purchase or rent franchises, and, once affiliated, how to go about their work. They could and did provide rides in three separate ways for CTG, for multiple car services concurrently, for independent, personal clients, and through street hails (albeit in contravention of TLC rules). In short, the <em>economic </em>reality was that Plaintiffs, with the assistance of CTG and as a \u201csubscriber to [its] services,\u201d J.A. 732, operated like small businesses; they decided to affiliate with Defendants based on <em>their </em>perceived economic interests, and not those of CTG.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">To be clear, we note in conclusion the narrow compass of our decision. Specifically, we do not here determine that it is irrelevant to the FLSA inquiry that the Defendants provided Plaintiffs with a client base, that Defendants charged fees when Plaintiffs utilized Defendants\u2019 referral system, or that Defendants had some involvement, if limited, in rule enforcement among franchisees. We conclude only that ass\u00e9ssing the totality of the circumstances here in light of each <em>Silk </em>factor, undisputed evidence makes clear as a matter of law that <em>these </em>Plaintiffs were not employees of <em>these </em>Defendants. In a different case, and with a different record, an entity that exercised similar control over clients, fees, and rules enforcement in ways analogous to the Defendants here might well constitute an employer within the meaning of the FLSA. Plaintiffs here, however, have raised no material issue to this effect. The district court therefore properly found them to be independent contractors as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">We have considered Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-11\">. Although Plaintiffs appealed from the district court's September 24, 2014 grant of summary judgment as to their FLSA and NYLL claims, Plaintiffs' briefs on appeal make no mention of the NYLL, and instead focus exclusively on the FLSA.

While TLC regulations require that for-hire drivers be affiliated with one, and only one, dispatch base, 35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 59A-04(h)-(i), they may legally accept work from another dispatch base (provided certain disclosures are made to the customer), <em>see </em>35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 5 9 A-11(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b160-13\">. The parties dispute CTG's role in formulating the rules contained within the Rulebooks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\">. During the period relevant to this litigation, drivers desiring MTA work informed CTG of the block of time and the zone in which they wished to work on a given day, and CTG\u2019s computerized dispatch system matched the drivers with available assignments. Notably, because the MTA paid less for jobs under its contract with CTG than many of CTG\u2019s other accounts did (as set forth below), CTG was not always able to provide sufficient drivers, notwithstanding its relationship with Plaintiffs and other black-car drivers. On such occasions, CTG reached out to other companies for assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">. Black-car drivers signaled their availability to work by consulting the smart phone app (which permitted them to see both how many jobs were available and how many other affiliated drivers were operating in particular \u201czones\u201d in the City), choosing a zone, and \"booking into\u201d it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\">. Jagjit Singh, for instance, testified that he worked seven days a week, sometimes as much as 15 to 16 hours a day, J.A. 4789, while Anjum Ali typically worked about eight hours a day, from around 4:00 p.m. until approximately midnight, J.A. 3303-04.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\">. When a driver \"logged in\u201d to the dispatch system, he saw how many jobs were available and how many other drivers were booked into each \"zone\u201d in New York City. The driver then decided which zone to \"book into.\u201d Having chosen a zone, the driver was placed at the end of a virtual queue, where he waited until a work offer appeared on his phone. Once an offer appeared, the driver had 45 seconds to accept or decline the job. If the driver rejected the job, he would be booked out of the app for five minutes and, after booking in again, placed at the end of the queue. After accepting a job, the driver received the pickup address, passenger's name, destination, rate of the fare, and the CTG account number associated with the passenger. Even with this information in hand, however, the driver could \"bail out,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>decline to complete the job. After a \"bailout,\u201d the driver was not permitted to log into the dispatch system for one to three hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Once a driver picked up a client, he was free to choose the route to that client\u2019s destination. When the driver completed the trip, he asked the customer to sign a voucher. The driver then dropped off the voucher at CTG's facility in Brooklyn at his or her convenience \u2014 there appears to have been no time limit \u2014 and CTG processed vouchers daily, weekly, or every three weeks, according to the driver's preference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b161-13\">. Ranjit Bhullar, for instance, earned $395,081.90 driving for \"Exec. Charge\u201d from 2006 to 2008, and Malook Singh earned $206,568.71 driving for \"Elite\u201d from 2006 to 2009.

Drivers generally collected payment for such services themselves, sometimes through accounts established with \u2022 credit card mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>chant companies. The record indicates that some Plaintiffs earned significant sums in this way \u2014 one driver, for instance, processed over $70,000 through a credit card merchant service account in an 18-month period. J.A. 5427-56.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b162-8\">. The district court also rejected Plaintiffs' claim that the drivers were \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of the NYLL. Because the factors for determining whether an individual is an \u201cemployee\u201d under the NYLL are similar to the <em>Superior Care </em>factors, the court referred to much of its FLSA analysis in concluding that \"all five NYLL factors favor independent contractor status.\u201d <em>Saleem, </em>52 F.Supp.3d at 545. This part of the ruling, concerning whether Plaintiffs constitute \u201cemployees\u201d under the NYLL, is not at issue in the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b163-6\">. The Supreme Court has noted that the FLSA \"stretches the meaning of \u2018employee\u2019 to cover some parties who might not qualify as such under a strict application of traditional agency law principles.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>503 U.S. 318, 326, 112 S.Ct. 1344, 117 L.Ed.2d 581 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\">. This Court has devised many such \u201ceconomic reality\u201d tests in the context of the FLSA. <em>See, e.g., Glatt v. Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc., </em>811 F.3d 528, 534-38 (2d Cir. 2016) (distinguishing \"interns\u201d from \u201cemployees\u201d under the FLSA); <em>Barfield, </em>537 F.3d at 140-50 (determining whether entity qualifies as \"joint employer\u201d under the FLSA); <em>Zheng, </em>355 F.3d at 66-71 (same); <em>Carter v.

This caution is merited because the <em>Silk </em>factors, while helpful in identifying relevant facts, overlap to a substantial degree. For instance, at least in the abstract, the more substantial the \"control\u201d (factor one) a company asserts, the less \"initiative\u201d (factor three) it allows on the part of its workers. In addition, the same facts are often relevant to multiple <em>Silk </em>factors. In <em>Superior Care, </em>for example, we categorized the fact that the alleged employer \"unilaterally dictated the nurses' hourly wage [and] limited working hours to 40 per week where nurses claimed they were owed overtime\u201d as indicative of the extent of defendant Superior Care\u2019s control over its workers. 840 F.2d at 1060. But this fact was similarly indicative of the scarce \u201copportunitfies] for profit or loss\u201d available to the nurses in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\">. The franchise agreements did provide that drivers receive franchisors' \u201cprior written consent ..., which consent [could] not be unreasonably withheld,\u201d before leasing or renting a franchise. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 3377. It is not clear whether this requirement was enforced in practice. \u2022</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\">. In this vein, CTG issued Plaintiffs 1099 Forms, not W-2 Forms, and Plaintiffs classified themselves as independent contractors for tax purposes and took deductions for business expenses. Likewise,- Plaintiffs did not receive health insurance, 401(k), retirement, or other b\u00e9nefits. <em>See Kirsch v. Fleet Street, Ltd., </em>148 F.3d 149, 171 (2d Cir. 1998) (affirming finding of independent contractor status when, <em>inter alia, </em>the worker \u201cdid not have the company withhold income or Social Security taxes [and] did not receive employee benefits such as health insurance\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b166-4\">. The Secretary of Labor incorrectly describes this practice as barred by TLC regulations. As Plaintiffs admit in a post-argument letter brief, TLC regulations permit black-car drivers to provide rides for other black-car companies provided certain disclosures are made to the customer. <em>See </em>35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 59A-11(e); Ltr. from Appellants to Court (Feb. 12, 2016); <em>cf. </em>N.Y.C.

It is certainly not unheard of for an individual to maintain two jobs at the same time, and to be an \"employee\u201d in each capacity. Plaintiffs, however, unlike traditional employees, were free \u2014 -without compromising their franchises or facing adverse consequences\u2014 to divide their time as they saw fit between CTG, its competitors, and personal clients. <em>See Reyes v. Remington Hybrid Seed Co., </em>495 F.3d 403, 408 (7th Cir. 2007) (describing an independent contractor as an individual who \"appears, does a discrete job, and leaves again\u201d). Mazhar Saleem, for example, drove for five black-car companies in addition to CTG between 2009 and 2012, earning sums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>that ranged between $539.10 at the low end to $11,052.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\">.

Plaintiffs who rented franchises avoided paying this upfront fee altogether, although the record shows that they made other, significant investments in, <em>inter alia, </em>their vehicles, license and registration, fuel, maintenance, and repairs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\">. Some drivers purchased their vehicles, while others rented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\">.

Because we evaluate the \"totality of the circumstances,\u201d however, the form of payment does not dictate a finding of employee status. In <em>Herman, </em>for instance, the Fifth Circuit determined that the district court did not err in finding courier delivery drivers, \"compensated on a commission basis,\u201d and for whom \"customer volume and the amount charged to customers\u201d were \"control[led]\u201d by the entity, to be independent contractors. 161 F.3d at 304-05. The <em>Herman </em>panel concluded that, despite these facts, other factors supported the district court\u2019s conclusion that the couriers were independent contractors. The couriers, <em>inter alia, </em>\"set their own hours and days of work and [could] reject deliveries without retaliation[, and] ... work for other courier delivery systems,\" since their franchise agreement did not contain a non-compete clause. <em>Id. </em>at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">When employees are compensated \"on a piecework basis,\u201d <em>Dole, </em>875 F.2d at 809, moreover, the FLSA economic reality inquiry asks how much revenue flows to the worker. <em>Compare, e.g., Delux Transp.

And as Eduard Slinin, CTG\u2019s president, testified here, a \"majority of the revenue [went] ... to the driver\u201d for CTG rides. J.A. 616-17.
