The defendant having contended that the liquors in the shop were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>intended for compounding medicines, and those in the rear building for manufacturing \u201c Sweet\u2019s Bitters,\u201d the Commonwealth introduced evidence that \u201cSweet\u2019s Bitters\u201d were intoxicating. One of the witnesses for the Commonwealth testified, upon cross-examination, \u201c that he knew the article known as 6 Sweet\u2019s Bitters ; \u2019 that it was a well known article of medicine kept for sale by apothecaries, grocers and others; that he had known of these \u2018 Bitters \u2019 for many years; and that some years since he was employed by Dr. Sweet, the proprietor of these 6 Bitters,\u2019 in putting them up for sale.\u201d The defendant then asked him, this question, \u201c What proportion of intoxicating liquor did these 6 Bitters \u2019 contain?\u201d The district attorney objected to the question, and the judge excluded it.

Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>87, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7. It was claimed by the defendant that the liquors found were intended by him for the manufacture of \u201c Sweet\u2019s Bitters.\u201d And this ground of defence was so far regarded as material by the government that evidence for the prosecution was produced that \u201c Sweet\u2019s Bitters \u201d was in fact intoxicating, with the purpose no doubt of showing that its manufacture was a mere evasion, and that the article itself must be regarded as intoxicating liquor within the meaning of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Upon this state of the case, a majority of the court are of opinion that on a cross-examination of the-witness for the prosecution, the defendant had a right to inquire what proportion of intoxicating liquor the article in question did contain. The interrogatory was made relevant and material by the course of the trial. After an attempt had been made to show that it was.intoxicating, the defendant should have been permitted to sh dw the contrary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The knowledge which the witness had upon the subject does not seem to us to have been so remote or uncertain as to justify its exclusion on that ground. It appears to have been a well known article of medicine kept for sale by apothecaries, grocers and others; the witness had known it for many years, and some years since had been employed by Dr. Sweet, the proprietor, in putting it up for sale. This is sufficient, in the absence of any suggestion that there had been a change in the ingredients of the article in kind or quality, to give the testimony weight and importance in its bearing upon the issue; and because of its rejection the <em>Exceptions are sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
