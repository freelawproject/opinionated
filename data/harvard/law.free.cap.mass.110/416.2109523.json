Blake, claimant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b424-11\">A complaint and warrant under the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>415, \u00a7 44, to search for \u201c intoxicating liquors, to wit: a certain quantity of mixed liquors,\u201d sufficiently alleges that the mixed liquors are intoxicating.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b424-12\">Tn a complaint under the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>415, \u00a7 44, an allegation that ale was kept for sale by J. S., he not being authorized to sell the same in this Commonwealth for any purpose under the provisions of the St. of 1869, <em>c, </em>415, or by any other legal authority whatever, sufficiently negatives any right in him to sell by virtue of a vote of any city or town under the St. of 1871, c. 334.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-13\">Complaint under the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>415, \u00a7 44, to the Police Court of the city of New Bedford, by Alfred G. Hitch and George Dunham, alleging \u201c that they have reason to believe, and do believe, that intoxicating liquors, to wit: A certain quantity of whiskey, being about, and not exceeding two hundred (200) gallons; a certain quantity of rum, being about, and not exceeding two hundred (200) gallons; a certain quantity of brandy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>being about, and not exceeding one hundred (100) gallons; a certain quantity of gin, being about, and not exceeding two hundred (200) gallons; a certain quantity of wine, being about, and not exceeding two hundred (200) gallons; a certain quantity of mixed liquors, being about, and not exceeding four (4) gallons; a certain quantity of ale, being about, and not exceeding one hundred (100) gallons; a certain quantity of porter, being about, and not exceeding one hundred (100) gallons ; a certain quantity of lager bier, being about, and not exceeding one hundred (100) gallons; \u201d were kept by James E. Blake in a building described, \u201c which liquors are intended by said Blake for sale in this Commonwealth, said Blake not being authorized to sell the same in this Commonwealth, or to manufacture or keep the same for sale, for any purpose under the provisions of chapter four hundred and fifteen of the acts of the year eighteen hundred and sixty-nine of this Commonwealth, or by any other legal authority whatever.\u201d A search-warrant was issued, reciting the complaint, and liquors were seized thereunder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">In the Superior Court, Blake appeared to claim the liquors, and, before the jury were empanelled to try the cause, moved to quash the warrant and dismiss the complaint for informalities in each, for the following reasons: \u201c Because as to a certain portion of the property to be searched for, to wit: 6 A certain quantity of mixed liquors, being about and not exceeding four gallons,\u2019 they are not particularly designated nor described with legal accuracy, in that the charging part of the complaint and warrant does not allege that they are \u2018 mixed liquors part of which is spirituous or intoxicating; \u2019 and because as to other portions of the property to be searched for, to wit, a certain quantity of ale, a certain quantity of porter, a certain quantity of lager bier, the charging part of the complaint and warrant does not allege that the same were intended by said Blake for sale in some city or town in this Commonwealth where the sale of ale, porter and lager bier is prohibited by law.\u201d The judge overruled the motion, and the trial having been had, the jury returned a verdict condemning part of the liquors, and the claimant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>JV. St. &lt;T. </em>Creen, for the claimant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsxA\">The St. of 1869, <em>e. </em>415, \u00a7 80, provides that no person shall sell \u201c any spirituous or intoxicating liquor, or any mixed liquor part of which is spirituous or intoxicating, unless he is authorized as provided in this act. Ale, porter, strong beer, lager bier, and all wines shall be considered intoxicating within the meaning of this act, as well as distilled spirits ; but this enumeration shall not prevent any other pure or mixed liquors from being regarded as intoxicating.\u201d The averment should have been \u201c that intoxicating liquors, to wit: a certain quantity of mixed liquor part of which is intoxicating,\u201d &amp;c., or \u201c that intoxicating liquors, to wit: a certain quantity of intoxicating mixed liquors,\u201d &amp;c. The defect is not aided by the use of the word \u201c intoxicating \u201d before the videlicet, because by his subsequent matter the pleader shows that his previous allegation may be false, and therefore the requisite certainty is wanting. <em>Rough's </em>case, 2 East P. C. 607, 777. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>1 C. <em>&amp; </em>K. 494. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Lonsdale, </em>4 F. <em>&amp; </em>F. 56. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beaman, 8 </em>Gray, 497. The allegation after the videlicet cannot be rejected as surplusage, because a special designation of the articles to be searched for is required; Declaration of Rights, Art. 14; St. 1869, <em>c. </em>415, \u00a7 66 ; and because it is matter of description.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-5\">2. It does not appear that the claimant had not a right to sell ale, porter and lager bier ; he did not need any authority to sell, for all sales are lawful which are not forbidden by law, and the sale of such liquors in towns that have voted affirmatively under the St. of 1871, <em>c. </em>334, is not forbidden by law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-6\"><em>C. B. </em>Train, Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b426-7\">Gbay, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWd\">Notwithstanding the ingenious argument that has been made in behalf of the claimant, the court is of opinion that neither of his exceptions can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">1. In the description in the complaint, there is no repugnancy etween the words preceding and those following the videlicet; for mixed liquors, as the statute in terms recognizes, may be intoxicating, as well as pure liquors of various kinds, whether enumerated or not in the statute or in this complaint. St. 1869 <em>e. </em>415, \u00a7 30. The word \u201c intoxicating \u201d in this complaint is tc be taken as qualifying not only the word \u201c liquors \u201d before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>videlicet, but the specific descriptions of different liquors which follow it. The mixed liquors are therefore sufficiently alleged to be intoxicating.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">2. The clauses in the complaint, negativing all authority in the claimant to sell the liquors, exclude any legal right in him to sell the same, by virtue of the vote of a city or town, or otherwise. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>108 Mass. 27. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grady, </em>Ib. 412. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
