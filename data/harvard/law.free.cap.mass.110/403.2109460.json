Codding, and by the kindling of said fire and the burning of said barn, the dwelling-house of Codding was \u201c burned and consumed.\u201d At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Brig</em>ham\u25a0, C. J., the evidence tended to show that the barn was burned entirely ; that the shingles on the roof of the dwelling-house took fire and were burned in two places; and that persons were on the roof keeping it wet with water; but as to how much the shingles were burned there was a conflict of testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-9\">The defendant asked the judge to instruct the jury \u201cthat they must be satisfied that some portion of the dwelling-house had been actually on fire by reason of the burning of the barn, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>had been burned and consumed thereby; and that the substance and fibre of the wood of such portion so on fire was actually destroyed.\u201d But the judge refused so to instruct the jury, and instructed them \u201c that they must be satisfied that some portion of the dwelling-house had been actually on fire by reason of the burning of the barn, and had been burned thereby, so that the substance of the wood of such portion so on fire was actually burned.\u201d The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-5\"><em>S.

They required the jury to find that some portion of the dwelling-house had been actually on fire and burned. To have required them to find something more, by use of the terms \u201c consumed \u201d and \u201c destroyed,\u201d as prayed for, would have been to go beyond the provisions of the statutes, and to leave the jury with no precise definition of that which was necessary to constitute the offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
