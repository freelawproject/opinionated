The defendant was convicted and appealed. At the trial on appeal in the Superior Court, before <em>Sevens, </em>J., the defendant contended that he could not be convicted upon a complaint which charged an offence as committed after the date of the complaint. It did not appear that he took this objection before the trial justice. The judge ruled that the defendant might be convicted if the evidence showed that he committed the offence before the time of the complaint. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the judge reported the case, at the defendant\u2019s request, for the determination of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-7\"><em>S.
