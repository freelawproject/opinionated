Plaintiffs claim to have purchased fine tableware from May and Federated during the period of the alleged boycott and were thus injured because the boycott impaired competition in that product market. Plaintiffs bring suit under \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, alleging that defendants\u2019 conduct is condemned <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">On November 17, 2006, Federated (joined by May) and Waterford moved for summary judgment asserting a variety of grounds. Doc # 116; Doc # 128. For reasons discussed below, the court GRANTS Waterford\u2019s motion for summary judgment and GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Federated\u2019s and May\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-13\">In early 2000, both Waterford and Le-nox considered expanding the distribution channels for their high-end tableware lines to include Bed, Bath <em>&amp; </em>Beyond and other specialty retailers. Doc # 183 at Ex 67 (\u201cIn a perfect world, this [Bed, Bath <em>&amp; </em>Beyond partnership] is the kind of new distribution that we should be exploring; otherwise, we will be forever in the grip of the department stores. However, we will have to assess the amount of angst at Federated compared with the prize before we decide whether or not to be a part of this [Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond] test.\u201d). See also Doc # 180, Ex 10 (Mielke depo) at 48:8-51:15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-14\">On March 7, 2001, Bed, Bath <em>&amp; </em>Beyond and Waterford executives met and agreed to proceed with a test project. Doc # 180, Ex 10 (Mielke depo) at 74:12-75:9; Ex 32 (\u201cA * * * meeting in New York when we agreed to proceed with the test * * * \u201d).

Doc # 179, Ex 2 (Gavin depo) at 50:19-53:6, 56:18-21, 58:15-24, 59:8-21; Ex 6 (Krangel Depo) at 94:8-98:23, 106:3-19; Doc # 180, Ex 14 (Scala depo) at 68:5-70:11, 71:12-19. Eventually, on March 30, 2001, Lenox agreed to participate in a test rollout with Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Doc # 179, Ex 2 at 64:20-65:3; Doc # 183, Ex 59 (\u201cWe will be piloting a 7 store test program in Bridal tabletop products\u201d). The parties confirmed specific product assortments at subsequent meetings. Doc # 179, Ex 2 at 139:20-142:2; Doc # 180, Ex 15 (Temares depo) at 59:9-63:22,160:2-161:3; Doc # 179, Ex 5 (Johnson depo) at 73:20-74:9,198:18-199:9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">Because Waterford had an interest in knowing the identities of the other manufacturers participating in the Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond rollout, its executives had their \u201cear to the ground from day one about which manufacturers were going to be participating and who were not going to be participating.\u201d Doc # 179, Ex 10 (Mielke depo) at 156:8-14. Indeed, Waterford\u2019s Mielke testified that he probably mentioned the Bed, Bath <em>&amp; </em>Beyond rollout during conversations with Lou Scala and Moira Gavin at Lenox. (Doc # 179, Ex 2 (Gavin depo) at 139:20-141:9); Doc # 180, Ex 10 (Mielke depo) at 153:24-157:7; Ex 60 (\u201cLenox and Waterford are anchoring the department.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">On May 31, 2001, Lenox informed May about its plans to distribute through Bed, Bath and Beyond \u201cas a \u20186 door test,\u2019 starting in 9/01,\u201d Doc # 182, Ex 44 at May 65281. Lenox further mentioned that Waterford would also be participating in the Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond rollout. Doc # 179, Ex 7 (Locraft depo) at 179:13-16. The evidence suggests that this news spurred the retailers into action. Gregory Locraft, an executive at May, was \u201cagitated, disappointed, concerned [and] upset\u201d by this news. In a raised voice, Locraft exclaimed \u201cyou do what you have to do and we\u2019ll do what we have to do.\u201d Doc # 179, Ex 7 at 176:14-16. Soon thereafter, May executive Don Engelman called Carl Mielke at Waterford to confirm whether Waterford intended to participate in the Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond rollout. Mielke told Engelman that Waterford was \u201cworking on something\u201d with Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Doc # 180, Ex 10 at 163:11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-13\">The next day, Lenox contacted May executive Judith Hofer \u201cto try to take care of the situation\u201d and \u201csettle things down.\u201d Doc # 179, Ex 6 at 206:16-25. Hofer was \u201cvery professional\u201d in response, but reiterated Loeraft\u2019s admonition, \u201cyou have to do what you need to do to grow your business and we need to do what we need to do.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 209:7-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-14\">About a week after the May 31 meeting, Federated contacted both Lenox and Waterford to complain about their participation in the rollout. Federated\u2019s Salus telephoned Lenox President Krangel and said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the decision. Doc # 179, Ex 6 (Krangel depo) at 241:9-10. At the end of the conversation, Salus told Krangel: \u201c[y]ou have to do what you have to do to grow your business and we have to do what we need to do with our business.\u201d Doc # 170, Ex 6 (Krangel depo) at 239:16-25, 236:19-244:17; Doc # 180, Ex 14 (Scala depo) at 148:5-149:19, 151:3-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-16\">On the same day, Federated president Terry Lundgren and executive Janet Grove telephoned Waterford CEO Chris McGillivary about the Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond program, warning that it \u201cwas not going to help the relationship between the two companies.\u201d Doc # 179, Ex 9 (McGillivary depo) at 65:5-66:11. A few days later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>James Zimmerman, Federated\u2019s CEO, telephoned Anthony O\u2019Reilly, Chairman of Waterford, to discuss Waterford\u2019s participation in the Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond rollout. According to Waterford, Zimmerman said he \u201cwould advise against it.\u201d Doc # 180, Ex 19 at FED 001223; Ex 16 (Zimmerman depo) at 24:4-26:6, 29:4-30:3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">On June 12, 2001, Federated executives held an internal meeting during which the Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond rollout was mentioned. Doc # 179, Ex 3 (Grove depo) at 129:13-130:14. One week later, Helaine Suval, a vice-president at Federated, sent an email summarizing the meeting as relayed to her from Federated\u2019s Dawn Robertson (Suval did not attend the meeting). The email states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYlV\">Waterford, Lenox and All-Clad have agreed to sell Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (6 stores). Major point of contention\u2014 [Federated\u2019s president] Terry Lundgren involved. Federated has threatened to drop them if they go ahead and sell BB <em>&amp; </em>B. No new initiatives with them in stores[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">Doc # 181, Ex 38. Robertson disputes the accuracy of the Suval email; although unable to recall what was said at the meeting, Robertson firmly relates what was not said. She contends that nobody at the meeting \u201cstated that Lenox or Waterford, or any of their products, would be dropped by Federated or any of its stores, nor did any Federated [employee] at the meeting state that there would be no new initiatives with Lenox.\u201d Doc # 131, Ex T, \u00b6 4. The point, of course, is that the evidence discloses conflicting versions of events, albeit both from Federated personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">Around June 12, 2002, May executive Tom Hayes had a meeting with Scala at Lenox, the substance of which Hayes relayed to Gregory Locraft. Doc # 179, Ex 7 at 215:20-23. According to Locraft\u2019s notes, Hayes maintained that he would not distribute several Lenox and Gorham brands if Lenox sold to Bed, Bath <em>&amp; </em>Beyond. Doc # 179, Ex 7 at 218:17-21; Doc # 183, Ex 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-10\">The concerns of Federated and May appear to have borne fruit. Waterford\u2019s McGillivary told his subordinate, Carl Mielke, \u201c[t]his is bad * * *, [w]e need to stop the test.\u201d Doc # 180, Ex 10 (Mielke depo) at 113:5-18. McGillivary remarked to Mielke \u201c[w]e needed to find a way to stop this and we need to tell [Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond] we can\u2019t do this test, and we can\u2019t tell them that it is because of Federated.\u201d Doc # 180, Ex 10 (Mielke depo) at 111:21\u2014 113:25, 115:22-116:10. Accordingly, Mielke drafted a script of what to tell Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, which McGillivary approved. Doc # 181, Ex 10 at 119:20-120:5, 130:22-131:7; Doc # 181, Ex 31-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-12\">On June 12, 2001, Mielke called James Peikon and Todd Johnson at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and told them Waterford would not be able to participate in the test program. Doc # 179, Ex 5 (Johnson depo) at 78:3-79:18; Doc # 180, Ex 10 (Mielke depo) at 120:6-15, 130:22-134:21. According to Mielke, Peikon and Johnson told Mielke that his reasons were \u201cbullshit,\u201d Doc # 180, Ex 10 at 133:3-25, and that \u201c[t]hese F_up department stores will promise you guys anything if you don\u2019t sell us but will go right back to F_you up the _ like they always have.\u201d Doc # 181, Ex 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-18\">At McGillivary\u2019s instruction, Mielke reported his conversation with Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond to Federated\u2019s Janet Grove. Doc # 180, Ex 10 (Mielke depo) at 134:22-136:18; Doc # 181, Ex 31. According to Mielke, Grove said \u201c[t]hat\u2019s great[,][y]ou guys do what you have to do and we do what we have to do, but I\u2019m glad you guys made this decision.\u201d Doc # 180, Ex 10 (Mielke depo) ' at 136:19-137:17; Doc # 179, Ex 3 (Grove depo) at 83:7-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>Next, Lenox called Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and terminated its participation in the Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond program. Doc # 180, Ex 15 (Temares depo) at 168:5-169:22. Lenox\u2019s Krangel called Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond President and CEO Steven Temares and told him that Lenox needed to \u201cpull back.\u201d (Doc # 180, Ex 15 (Temares depo) at 95:13-96:4, 99:15-101:14, 103:16-107:22, 109:16-110:15, 168:5-170:16). Temares thought Krangel\u2019s purported justification for pulling out of the deal \u201cwas a bunch of horse shit,\u201d sounded \u201cscripted\u201d and made no sense. Doc # 180, Ex 15 at 111:8\u2014 112:16,170:17-171:7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-5\">It is just inconsistent with common sense since I sat with them at a meeting a month before, that I imagine people told him all along where we were in the process, that we had selected the assortment, that they approved the fixturing, that we had gone through with the selection of stores, that we involved all these people and time and effort and we had numerous meetings at all different levels in the organization, so common sense would indicate that what he said is farfetched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\"><em>Id, </em>Ex 15 at 170:17-172:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">Finally, on June 18, 2001, Federated\u2019s Zimmerman wrote to O\u2019Reilly at Waterford, praising him for making the \u201cright decision\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-8\">I wanted to write and tell you I think your team made the right decision. You have a great brand and it needs to be protected and enhanced. I assume you played a role and I think you did the right thing for all partners in this game. Thanks for listening to me as I voiced my thoughts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">Doc # 180, Ex 18; Ex 16 (Zimmerman depo) at 26:13-20, 28:1-29:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">About one year later, Waterford began to sell its Wedgwood tableware products to Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond in August 2002 and its Waterford brand products in November 2004. Lenox followed suit in November 2002. Doc # 179, Ex 2 (Gavin depo) at 221:12-221:21, 231:2-21, 243:21-244:9; Doc # 183, Ex 62; Doc # 183, Ex 67 at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-13\">In its order denying defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the court remarked that plaintiffs \u201cappear to state claims (presumably in the alternative) for (1) vertical minimum resale price maintenance, (2) horizontal price fixing and (3) an exclusionary group boycott.\u201d Doc # 52 at 5. Since that time, plaintiffs have shed the first two theories of relief, rendering this suit, in plaintiffs\u2019 words, \u201ca group boycott case.\u201d Doc # 161 at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-14\">As a legal matter, however, this case is better characterized as <em>three </em>group boycott cases: in plaintiffs\u2019 view, the successful boycott of Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond arose from (1) a horizontal agreement between Federated and May, (2) a horizontal agreement between Waterford and Lenox and (3) vertical agreements among all defendants. Moreover, plaintiffs presumably regard each set of agreements as independently sufficient to effect the boycott of Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Although plaintiffs add these alleged agreements together to arrive at one grand (and overdetermined) conspiracy, various antitrust doctrines impel the court to distinguish among these three categories at various points along the court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-15\">In reviewing a summary judgment motion, the court must determine whether genuine issues of material fact exist, resolving any doubt in favor of the party opposing the motion. \u201c[S]ummary judgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine,\u2019 that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>202 (1986). \u201cOnly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact lies with the moving party. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). When the moving party has the burden of proof on an issue, the party\u2019s showing must be sufficient for the court to hold that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving party. <em>Calderone v. United States, </em>799 F.2d 254, 258-59 (6th Cir.1986). Summary judgment is granted only if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FRCP 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">The nonmoving party may not simply rely on the pleadings, however, but must produce significant probative evidence supporting its claim that a genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>TW Elec. Serv. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass\u2019n, </em>809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir.1987). The evidence presented by the nonmoving party \u201cis to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505. \u201c[T]he judge\u2019s function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides that \u201cany person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue * * 15 USC \u00a7 15(a). Although this language could be read to afford relief to all persons whose injuries are causally related to an antitrust violation, <em>Lucas v. Bechtel Corp., </em>800 F.2d 839, 843 (9th Cir.1986), the doctrine of \u201cantitrust standing\u201d precludes such an interpretation. <em>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm\u2019n v. NFL, </em>791 F.2d 1356, 1363 (9th Cir.1986). \u201cOnly those who meet the requirements for \u2018antitrust standing\u2019 may pursue a claim * * *; and to acquire \u2018antitrust standing,\u2019 a plaintiff must adequately allege and eventually prove \u2018antitrust injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glen Holly Entertainment, Inc. v. Tektronix Inc., </em>352 F.3d 367 (9th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, </em>459 U.S. 519, 530-35, 103 S.Ct. 897, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">To determine whether plaintiffs have standing to pursue their antitrust claim, the court considers five factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-12\">(1) the nature of plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injury-whether it was the type the antitrust laws were intended to forestall;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-13\">(2) the directness of the injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-14\">(3) the speculative measure of the harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-15\">(4) the risk of duplicative recovery; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-16\">(5) the complexity in apportioning damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1105-17\"><em>Associated General Contractors, </em>459 U.S. at 538-45, 103 S.Ct. 897;</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-18\">To conclude that there is antitrust standing, the court need not find in favor of plaintiffs on each factor, see <em>Amarel v. Connell, </em>102 F.3d 1494, 1507 (9th Cir.1996); generally, \u201cno single factor is decisive.\u201d <em>R C Dick Geothermal Corp. v. Thermogenics, Inc., </em>890 F.2d 139, 146 (9th Cir.1989) (en banc). Yet courts give great weight to the nature of plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injury. See <em>Amarel, </em>102 F.3d at 1507. Indeed, the Supreme Court has noted that \u201c[a] showing of antitrust injury is necessary, but not always sufficient, to establish standing.\u201d <em>Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., </em>479 U.S. 104, 110, n. 5, 107 S.Ct. 484, 93 L.Ed.2d 427 (1986). To demonstrate an antitrust injury, it is not enough that the plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>flows from the unlawful conduct; an antitrust injury must \u201cflow[ ] from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful.\u201d <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., </em>495 U.S. 328, 334, 110 S.Ct. 1884, 109 L.Ed.2d 333 (1990) (quoting <em>Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S.Ct. 690, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">Plaintiffs principally rely on <em>Blue Shield v. McCready, </em>457 U.S. 465, 102 S.Ct. 2540, 73 L.Ed.2d 149 (1982), in asserting their injury was the type the antitrust laws were intended to forestall. In <em>McCready, </em>the Supreme Court held that an individual had standing to sue her health insurer for reimbursement of payments to a clinical psychologist for allegedly conspiring with physicians to bar clinical psychologists from the market by excluding their services from coverage under the insurance policy. In doing so, the Court rejected the argument that the plaintiff lacked standing because she was not an actor in the relevant market and because the more appropriate plaintiffs were the psychologists. <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned that antitrust remedies \u201ccannot be restricted to those competitors whom the conspirators hope to eliminate from the market. * * * As a consumer of psychotherapy services * * * [the plaintiff] was within that area of the economy * * * endangered by [the] breakdown of competitive conditions.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 479-80, 102 S.Ct. 2540. Even though the plaintiff \u201cwas not a competitor of the conspirators, the injury she suffered was inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirator sought to inflict on psychologists and the psychotherapy market.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 483, 102 S.Ct. 2540.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">Like the plaintiff in <em>McCready, </em>plaintiffs here are consumers in the restrained market \u2014 the tableware market. And by purchasing tableware directly from the alleged co-conspirators, plaintiffs participated in the area of the economy endangered by anticompetitive conditions. See <em>id. </em>at 480, 102 S.Ct. 2540. See also <em>Glen Holly Entertainment, </em>352 F.3d at 372 (noting that \u201cthe party alleging the injury must be either a consumer of the alleged violator\u2019s goods or services or a competitor of the alleged violator in the restrained market\u201d) (citing <em>Eagle v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc., </em>812 F.2d 538 (9th Cir.1987)). Accordingly, under <em>McCready, </em>although plaintiffs were not the direct target of defendants\u2019 boycott, their injuries were \u201cinextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought to inflict\u201d on Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. See <em>McCready, </em>457 U.S. at 483, 102 S.Ct. 2540.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">The second factor assesses whether plaintiffs\u2019 asserted injuries were the direct result of defendants\u2019 allegedly anticompeti-tive conduct. Plaintiffs contend that defendants increased the price of its tableware by boycotting expansion to Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. To assess the directness of this injury, courts look to the chain of causation linking plaintiffs\u2019 injury to the alleged restraint in the market. See Associated <em>General, </em>459 U.S. at 540, 103 S.Ct. 897; <em>Yellow Pages Cost Consultants, Inc. v. GTE Directories Corp., </em>951 F.2d 1158, 1162 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cDirectness in the antitrust context means close in the chain of causation.\u201d). The chain of causation vis-a-vis Federated and May is direct because the boycott of Bed, Bath <em>&amp; </em>Beyond allegedly affected the price plaintiffs paid Federated and May for Lenox and Waterford tableware. See <em>Glen Holly, </em>352 F.3d at 374 (antitrust injury flowed from discontinuation of a competing product). The chain of causation with respect to Waterford and Lenox, however, is more attenuated and, for reasons discussed below, implicates the so-called \u201cdirect purchaser\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">Under the third factor, courts consider whether plaintiffs\u2019 damages are speculative. See <em>Associated General, </em>459 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>542, 103 S.Ct. 897. In <em>Associated General, </em>the Supreme Court found the damages claim in question to be speculative because (1) the alleged injury was indirect; and (2) \u201cthe alleged effects * * * may have been produced by independent factors.\u201d <em>Id; </em>see also <em>Eagle v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc., </em>812 F.2d 538, 542 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">The court finds that plaintiffs\u2019 alleged damages are not speculative enough to eviscerate plaintiffs\u2019 standing. First, as discussed above, plaintiffs\u2019 asserted injury flows directly from defendants\u2019 alleged decision to boycott Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Second, defendants do not suggest that plaintiffs\u2019 asserted injury may have stemmed from other exogenous market factors. Third, although the extent of plaintiffs\u2019 damages hinges on a complex counterfactual (the price of tableware if Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond had participated in the market), \u201cthis complexity is not so unusual as to distinguish this case from other complex business disputes * * <em>American Ad Management, Inc. v. GTE Corp., </em>190 F.3d 1051, 1059 (9th Cir.1999). See also <em>Forsyth v. Humana, Inc., </em>114 F.3d 1467, 1478 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cComplex antitrust cases * * * invariably involve complicated questions of causation and damages.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">The fourth factor \u2014 the risk of duplica-tive recovery \u2014 also weighs in favor of plaintiffs\u2019 standing. The purpose under-girding this factor is to avoid the risk \u201cthat potential plaintiffs may be in a \u2018position to assert conflicting claims to a common fund * * * thereby creating the danger of multiple liability for the fund.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eagle, </em>812 F.2d at 542 (quoting <em>Associated General, </em>459 U.S. at 544, 103 S.Ct. 897). Even if Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond could bring suit against defendants (it appears the statute of limitations has run, see 15 USC \u00a7 15(b)), duplicative recovery is unlikely because plaintiffs\u2019 damages are distinct from Bed, Bath <em>&amp; </em>Beyond\u2019s. To the extent defendants\u2019 alleged tactics raised artificially the price for tableware, plaintiffs\u2019 damages exceed \u2014 and thus diverge from\u2014 Bed, Bath <em>&amp; </em>Beyond\u2019s lost profits. See <em>American Ad, </em>190 F.3d at 1059-60 (damages related to lost profits are distinct from those related to increased costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">As discussed above with respect to the speculative measure of harm factor, the court does not find the apportionment of damages in this case to be exceedingly complicated. Furthermore, unlike <em>Associated General, </em>in which damages needed to be apportioned among \u201cdirectly victimized contractors and subcontractors and indirectly affected employees and union entities,\u201d 459 U.S. at 545, 103 S.Ct. 897, apportioning damages in this case would require only a determination of the damages suffered by direct customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">In sum, because all five of the <em>Associated General </em>factors weigh in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the court finds that plaintiffs have antitrust standing in this litigation, at least with respect to Federated and May.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">One issue involving standing remains: inasmuch as plaintiffs\u2019 suit targets an alleged horizontal agreement between Waterford and Lennox, plaintiffs run afoul of the so-called \u201cdirect purchaser\u201d requirement from <em>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977). The Court in <em>Illinois Brick </em>ruled that a plaintiff does not state a claim for relief for an illegal overcharge due to an anticompetitive agreement if the plaintiff did not purchase directly from a member of the conspiracy. In doing so, the Court precluded antitrust claims based on overcharges that were \u201cpassed-on\u201d through the distribution chain to the ultimate consumer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\"><em>Illinois Brick </em>does not preclude this suit entirely because plaintiffs purchased the relevant goods directly from Federated and May. Yet the allegations concerning a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>horizontal agreement between Waterford and Lennox implicate <em>Illinois Brick, </em>as plaintiffs stand as indirect purchasers visa-vis this alleged agreement. Putting aside, for a moment, the alleged vertical agreements, the allegations concerning an agreement between Waterford and Lennox are probative only to the extent they substantiate horizontal agreements between Federated and May or vertical agreements among defendants. See <em>Arizona v. Shamrock Foods, </em>729 F.2d 1208 (9th Cir.1984) (concluding that <em>Illinois Brick </em>is inapplicable to claims against remote sellers when the plaintiffs allege that the sellers conspired with intermediates in the distribution chain to fix the price at which the plaintiffs purchased). Moreover, if Federated and May succeed in obtaining summary judgment, leaving only an alleged horizontal agreement between Waterford and Lennox, then plaintiffs become indirect purchasers with respect to the alleged conspiracy and thereby cease to have standing to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">The next issue posed by defendants\u2019 motions is whether the alleged agreements among defendants to prevent the sale of Waterford and Lenox tableware to Bed, Bath and Beyond is properly viewed as a group boycott deserving of <em>per se </em>scrutiny. Although the Supreme Court lists \u201cgroup boycotts\u201d among the classes of economic activity that warrant <em>per se </em>invalidation under \u00a7 1, the Court acknowledges that \u201cexactly what types of activity fall within the forbidden category is * * * far from certain.\u201d <em>Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery &amp; Printing Co., </em>472 U.S. 284, 294-95, 105 S.Ct. 2613, 86 L.Ed.2d 202 (1985). See also <em>id </em>at 295, 105 S.Ct. 2613 (\u201cThere exists more confusion about the scope and operation of the <em>per se </em>rule against group boycotts than in reference to any other aspect of the <em>per se </em>doctrine.\u201d). Or as one court quipped, using the term \u201cboycott\u201d is \u201cthe equivalent of yelling \u2018fire\u2019 in the halls of traditional antitrust jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Universal Amusements Co. v. General Cinema Corp., </em>635 F.Supp. 1505, 1523 (S.D.Tex.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">The application of the <em>per se </em>rule to group boycotts developed from a series of cases in which the Supreme Court invalidated such boycotts as \u00a7 1 violations. In <em>Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers\u2019 Association v. United States, </em>234 U.S. 600, 611-14, 34 S.Ct. 951, 58 L.Ed. 1490 (1914), for example, the Court held unlawful concerted refusals to deal with wholesalers who sold directly to customers. Similarly, in <em>Fashion Originators\u2019 Guild of America v. FTC, </em>312 U.S. 457, 61 S.Ct. 703, 85 L.Ed. 949 (1941), the Court deemed unlawful a joint \u201cprogram\u201d of textile and garment manufacturers that prohibited the sale of garments to stores that sold \u201cstyle pirated\u201d garments and the sale of fabrics to manufacturers who sold to stores selling pirated goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">The Court\u2019s predilection for designating group boycotts <em>per se </em>unlawful law reached its highwater mark in <em>Klor\u2019s Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., </em>359 U.S. 207, 79 S.Ct. 705, 3 L.Ed.2d 741 (1959). A retailer, Broadway, entered into an agreement with suppliers of appliances \u201ceither not to sell to Klor\u2019s or to sell to it only at discriminatory and highly unfavorable prices.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 209, 79 S.Ct. 705. Broadway argued that because consumers and other competitors had access to supply, the public was not injured. The Court disagreed with Broadway, declaring that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYQ\">[gjroup boycotts, or concerted refusals by traders to deal with other traders, have long been held to be in the forbidden category. They have not been saved by allegations that they were reasonable in the specific circumstances, nor by a failure to show that they \u201cfixed or regulated prices, parcelled out or lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>ited production, or brought about a deterioration in quality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 212, 79 S.Ct. 705 (citing <em>Fashion Originators\u2019 Guild v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>312 U.S. 457, 466, 61 S.Ct. 703, 85 L.Ed. 949 (1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">The Supreme Court has since retreated from its stance in <em>Klor\u2019s </em>and has cautioned against blindly fixing the <em>per se </em>label on all concerted refusals to deal. See Richard A Posner, <em>Antitrust Law </em>(2d ed 2001) (\u201cA boycott * * * used to be deemed a per se violation * * *; [t]he Supreme Court has wisely abandoned that position, which anyway was never taken seriously\u201d). Indeed, in <em>Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery Printing Co., </em>472 U.S. 284, 105 S.Ct. 2613, 86 L.Ed.2d 202 (1985), the Court rejected, except for a narrow category of cases, the <em>per se </em>characterization for concerted refusals to deal. Under this new standard, the Court declined to apply the <em>per se </em>approach to the expulsion of a member from a cooperative purchasing agency because the agency achieved \u201ceconomies of scale in both the purchase and warehousing of wholesale supplies.\u201d <em>Northwest Wholesale, </em>472 U.S. at 295, 105 S.Ct. 2613.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">According to the <em>Northwest Wholesale </em>Court, a <em>per se </em>standard generally applies to cases involving \u201cjoint efforts by a firm or firms to disadvantage competitors by \u2018either directly denying or persuading or coercing suppliers or customers to deny relationships the competitors need in the competitive struggle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Northwest Wholesale, </em>472 U.S. at 294, 105 S.Ct. 2613 (quoting L Sullivan, <em>Law of Antitrust </em>261-62 (1977)). See also P Areeda &amp; L Kaplow, <em>Antitrust Analysis: Problems, Text, and Cases </em>333 (5th ed 1997) (defining paradigmatic boycott as \u201ccollective action among a group of competitors that may inhibit the competitive vitality of rivals\u201d). In these cases, \u201cthe boycott often cut off access to a supply, facility or market necessary to enable the boycotted firm to compete, and frequently the boycotting firm possessed a dominant position to the relevant market. In addition, the practices were generally not justified by plausible arguments that they were intended to enhance overall efficiency and make markets more competitive.\u201d <em>Northwest Wholesale, </em>472 U.S. at 294, 105 S.Ct. 2613.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">Guided by <em>Northwest Wholesale, </em>the Court in <em>FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, </em>476 U.S. 447, 106 S.Ct. 2009, 90 L.Ed.2d 445 (1986), refused to apply the <em>per se </em>designation to an agreement by competitors, dentists, to deny patient X-rays to insurance companies. These X-rays posed a problem for Indiana\u2019s dentists because they enabled insurance companies to review the appropriateness of the dentists\u2019 charges. The Court declined to invoke the <em>per se </em>rule and \u201cforc[e] the [dentists\u2019] policy into the \u2018boycott\u2019 pigeonhole,\u201d reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aea\">the category of restraints classed as group boycotts is not to be expanded indiscriminately, and the per se approach has generally been limited to cases in which firms with market power boycott suppliers or customers in order to discourage them from doing business with a competitor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 458, 106 S.Ct. 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-11\">A number of courts have construed <em>Northwest Wholesale </em>and <em>Indiana Federation of Dentists </em>as holding that <em>per se </em>analysis is inappropriate unless the boycotting party possesses market power or exclusive access to an element in effective competition. See, e g, <em>Hahn v. Oregon Physicians\u2019 Service, </em>868 F.2d 1022, 1030 (9th Cir.1989). But in <em>FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association, </em>493 U.S. 411, 110 S.Ct. 768, 107 L.Ed.2d 851 (1990), the Supreme Court concluded that at least some group boycotts among horizontal competitors are <em>per se </em>unlawful without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>regard to the market power of the participants. This case involved an agreement by members of a bar association not to represent indigent criminal defendants unless the District of Columbia increased their compensation. The Court held that this agreement \u201cwas unquestionably a \u2018naked restraint\u2019 on price and output\u201d and, as such, was <em>per se </em>unlawful. <em>Id. </em>at 423, 110 S.Ct. 768. See also <em>NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc., </em>525 U.S. 128, 119 S.Ct. 493, 142 L.Ed.2d 510 (1998) (limiting <em>per se </em>scrutiny to cases \u201cinvolving horizontal agreements among direct competitors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">The Ninth Circuit reads <em>Northwest Wholesale </em>and its progeny as establishing three criteria for determining whether the <em>per se </em>standard applies to a group boycott:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-5\">(1) the boycott cuts off access to a supply, facility, or market necessary to enable the victim firm to compete;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-6\">(2) the boycotting firm possesses a dominant market position; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-7\">(3) the practices are not justified by plausible arguments that they enhanced overall efficiency or competition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\"><em>Adaptive Power Solutions, LLC v. Hughes Missile Systems Co., </em>141 F.3d 947, 950 (9th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Hahn v. Oregon Physicians\u2019 Serv., </em>868 F.2d 1022, 1030 (9th Cir.1988)). In the Ninth Circuit, these three criteria \u201care indicative of <em>per se </em>illegal conduct.\u201d <em>Adaptive Power Solutions, </em>141 F.3d at 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">Notwithstanding the importance of this court\u2019s determination whether to apply <em>per se </em>scrutiny, neither party deals with this issue adequately. Defendants misstate the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test and portray these factors as prerequisites for adopting the <em>per se </em>approach. See Doc # 184 at 2 (\u201chorizontal agreements are eligible for <em>per se </em>condemnation <em>only if </em>* * * \u201d). Plaintiffs relegate their analysis to a footnote, asserting that (1) the boycott cut off Bed, Bath and Beyond\u2019s access to two of the principal suppliers of high-end tableware (Lenox and Waterford); (2) the firms instigating the boycott (Federated and May) held dominant positions in the retail tableware market; and (3) there are no plausible justifications for the boycott. Doc # 161 at n4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-13\">With respect to the first factor, the court notes that Waterford and Lennox were suppliers of tableware products necessary to enable Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond to compete in the high-end tableware market. Further, defendants allegedly cut off this essential supply in order to obstruct Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond\u2019s access to this market. The second factor (whether the boycotting firm possesses a \u201cdominant\u201d position in the market) is difficult to assess on the present record. In 2001, Federated and May were the third and fourth largest department store chains in the United States, respectively. Doc # 181, Ex 35 at 26-27. Although this ranking among department stores does not imply market power, it may suggest that defendants held a \u201cdominant\u201d position. As the Seventh Circuit observed in <em>Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc. v. FTC, </em>221 F.3d 928 (7th Cir.2000), the term \u201cdominant\u201d was \u201cplainly chosen to stand for something different from antitrust\u2019s term of art \u2018monopoly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id </em>at 936. In view of this uncertainty, the court finds that this second factor weighs in neither party\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-14\">Most damaging to Federated\u2019s argument in favor of rule of reason review is the third factor \u2014 -whether the boycott arguably enhances efficiency or competition. In accordance with this consideration, courts have noted that in the following factual settings, the effect of a refusal to deal is \u201cmore complex\u201d than in the \u201cclassic boycott\u201d scenario: industry self-regulation, sports leagues, health care, non-economic boycotts and access to joint venture facilities. ABA Section of Anti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>trust Law, <em>Antitrust Law Developments, </em>114 (5th ed 2002). The conduct alleged by plaintiffs falls within none of these exceptions. Nor does Federated proffer an independent pro-competitive justification for the alleged horizontal agreements to boycott Bed, Bath and Beyond. This silence is unsurprising, as the alleged horizontal agreement falls squarely within the ambit of <em>per se </em>treatment as dictated by <em>Northwest Wholesale: </em>\u201cjoint efforts by a firm or firms to disadvantage competitors by either directly denying or persuading or coercing suppliers or customers to deny relationships the competitors need in the competitive struggle.\u201d <em>Northwest Wholesale, </em>472 U.S. at 294, 105 S.Ct. 2613. Accordingly, the court concludes that the alleged horizontal agreement between Federated and May constitutes a classic boycott and thus warrants <em>per se </em>treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">The court hastens to add that its conclusion does not extend to the alleged vertical agreements to boycott Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. The Supreme Court has expressly \u201climit[ed] the per se rule in the boycott context to cases involving horizontal agreements among direct competitors.\u201d <em>NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc., </em>525 U.S. 128, 186, 119 S.Ct. 493, 142 L.Ed.2d 510 (1998). The vertical agreements therefore warrant <em>per se </em>treatment only to the extent they implemented the alleged horizontal agreements \u2014 a distinction plaintiffs appear to acknowledge. See Doc # 161 at 9 (\u201cSince, as explained above, the boycott of [Bed, Bath <em>&amp; </em>Beyond] at issue here includes horizontal, as well as vertical, agreements, the <em>per se </em>rule applies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">As such, plaintiffs need not define and support a relevant market (as they would need to do for a \u00a7 2 claim), nor do they need to demonstrate harm to competition, something which is presumed in a <em>per se </em>case, see <em>Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., </em>394 U.S. 495, 498, 89 S.Ct. 1252, 22 L.Ed.2d 495 (1969) (\u201c \u2018[T]here are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Northern Pacific R Co v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S.Ct. 514, 2 L.Ed.2d 545 (1958))). But plaintiffs\u2019 decision to rely on <em>per se </em>scrutiny comes at a cost: it renders the existence of a horizontal agreement essential to their suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">To sum up the court\u2019s analysis heretofore, plaintiffs lack standing to rest their case on an agreement between Waterford and Lennox and lack the evidentiary wherewithal to rely alone on the alleged vertical agreements and proceed under the rule of reason. The upshot is that the alleged agreement between Federated and May is the cornerstone of plaintiffs\u2019 legal theory; without it, the case collapses. With these insights in mind, the court turns to the substance of plaintiffs\u2019 suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">The essential issue propounded by defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions is whether plaintiffs adduced enough evidence of concerted action to survive summary judgment. In <em>Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., </em>465 U.S. 752, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984), the Supreme Court announced the modern formula by which courts determine the existence of concerted action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-11\">The correct standard is that there must be evidence that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action by the [parties]. That is, there must be direct or circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove that [the parties] had a conspicuous commitment to a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>mon scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">465 U.S. at 768, 104 S.Ct. 1464.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Conspiracies may be shown either by direct or circumstantial evidence. The Court recognizes, however, that \u201c[o]nly rarely will there be direct evidence of an express agreement\u201d in conspiracy cases; hence, circumstantial evidence plays a pivotal role in antitrust litigation. Although interpreting such evidence and drawing inferences from it ordinarily are responsibilities of the factfinder, the Supreme Court mandates a threshold judicial assessment of such evidence as set forth in <em>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 588 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-6\">[Ajntitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a \u00a7 1 case. Thus, * * * conduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy. * * * To survive a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict, a plaintiff seeking damages for a violation of \u00a7 1 must present evidence \u201cthat tends to exclude the possibility\u201d that the alleged conspirators acted independently. * * * [Plaintiffs], in other words, must show that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action or collusive action that could not have harmed [them].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 588, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">Citing its earlier decision in <em>First National Bank v. Cities Service Co., </em>391 U.S. 253, 288-289, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968), the Court in <em>Matsushita </em>identified two separate inquiries that are relevant to this issue: (1) whether the defendant had \u201cany rational motive\u201d to join the allege conspiracy, and (2) whether the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cwas consistent with the defendant\u2019s independent interest.\u201d <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 596-97, 106 S.Ct. 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-10\">Animating the <em>Matsushita </em>standard is the Court\u2019s concern that \u201cpermitting the inference of conspiratorial behavior from circumstantial evidence consistent with both lawful and unlawful conduct would deter pro-competitive conduct \u2014 an especially pernicious danger in light of the fact that the very purpose of the antitrust laws is to promote competition.\u201d <em>In re Citric Acid Litigation, </em>191 F.3d 1090, 1094 (9th Cir.1999). See also <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 593, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (\u201cCourts should not permit factfinders to infer conspiracies when such inferences are implausible, because the effect of such practices is often to deter pro-competitive conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-11\">Relying in part on <em>Matsushita, </em>the Ninth Circuit has crafted a two-part test to be applied whenever plaintiffs rest their case entirely on circumstantial evidence. First, defendants may \u201crebut an allegation of conspiracy by showing a plausible and justifiable reason for its conduct that is consistent with proper business practice.\u201d <em>In re Citric Acid Litigation, </em>191 F.3d at 1094 (citing <em>Richards v. Neilsen Freight Lines, </em>810 F.2d 898, 902 (9th Cir.1987)). The burden then shifts back to plaintiffs to provide specific evidence tending to show that defendants were not engaging in permissible competitive behavior. See <em>City of Long Beach v. Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>872 F.2d 1401, 1406 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-12\">The present action implicates this two-part test because plaintiffs have not produced direct evidence in support of their group boycott theory. As noted by the Ninth Circuit, \u201c[d]irect evidence in a[\u00a7 ] 1 conspiracy must be evidence that is explicit and requires no inferences to establish the proposition or conclusion being asserted.\u201d <em>In re Citric Acid Litigation, </em>191 F.3d at 1093-94. As plaintiffs appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>to concede, none of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence satisfies this test, at least with respect to an alleged agreement between Federated and May.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Turning to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s two-part test, the court first finds that defendants proffer a \u201cplausible and justifiable reason\u201d for acting as they did. <em>In re Citric Acid Litigation, </em>191 F.3d at 1094. <em>City of Long Beach v. Standard Oil Co., </em>872 F.2d 1401, 1406 (9th Cir.1989) (defendant is entitled to summary judgment when it \u201cprovides a plausible and justifiable alternative interpretation of its conduct that rebuts the alleged conspiracy\u201d). Defendants assert that Federated and May were concerned that the sale of its tableware products by Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond would broaden the distribution into a lower prestige channel, a valid and lawful concern. See <em>Winn v. Edna Hibel Corp., </em>858 F.2d 1517, 1520 (11th Cir.1988) (recognizing a company\u2019s interest in avoiding the \u201ccheapening\u201d of the image of its products); <em>Richards v. Neilsen Freight Lines, </em>810 F.2d 898, 902 (9th Cir.1987) (finding independent self-interest an adequate explanation).</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">Prior to 2001, Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, a national \u201cbig-box\u201d retailer of kitchen, bath and other items, was selling various standard tableware products, including, for example, lower-end dinner plates manufactured by Lenox. Doc # 131, Ex B, (Johnson depo) at 30:10-12, 37:24-40:2; Doc # 141, Ex C (Lundgren depo) at 38:14-21. Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond became interested in expanding its offerings to include more expensive china and crystal manufactured by Lenox, Waterford and others. Doc # 131, Ex E (Temares depo) at 35:11-16. Federated and May opposed the broad distribution its manufacturers sought because Federated and May had made significant investments in the sale of Lenox and Waterford products. Doc # 141, Ex C at 39:4-40:2, 44:12-45:9. See also <em>Monsanto, </em>465 U.S. at 763, 104 S.Ct. 1464 (complaints by retailers regarding other retailers are \u201cnatural \u2014 and from the manufacturer\u2019s perspective, unavoidable \u2014 \u2022 reactions by distributors to the activities of their rivals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">Consequently, the burden shifts back to plaintiffs to provide specific evidence tending to show that the defendants were not engaging in permissible competitive behavior. See <em>City of Long Beach v. Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>872 F.2d 1401, 1406 (9th Cir.1989). Such evidence must \u201ctend[ ] to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators acted independently.\u201d <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 588, 106 S.Ct. 1348. In assessing this evidence, the court also considers (1) whether the defendants had \u201cany rational motive\u201d to join the alleged conspiracy, and (2) whether the defendants\u2019 conduct \u201cwas consistent with the defendant\u2019s independent interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at at 596-97, 106 S.Ct. 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">The court focuses on the alleged agreement between Federated and May because, as established above, this suit turns on the existence of such an agreement. Plaintiffs assert that a horizontal agreement may be inferred from the following pieces of information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-10\">(1) one week after May was advised by Lennox in May 2001 of Lenox\u2019s and Waterford\u2019s intent to participate in the Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond rollout, Federated contacted both Lenox and Waterford to complain about the rollout;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-11\">(2) both Federated and May used similar language when they separately pressured Lenox and Waterford to break their deal with Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (\u201cyou do what you have to do, and we will do what we have to do\u201d) (Doc #180, Ex 10 (Mielke depo) at 136:19-137:17);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>(3) in a letter from Federated\u2019s Zimmerman to a Waterford executive, written after Waterford terminated its participation in the rollout, Zimmerman thanked Waterford for doing \u201cthe right thing for all partners in the game\u201d (Doc # 180, Ex 18); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-4\">(4) Federated\u2019s Zimmerman \u201ctook the Fifth\u201d when asked at deposition whether Federated and May entered into any agreements concerning their approach to the Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond rollout (Doc # 180, Ex 16 at 48:6-13).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">With respect to the first point, defendants note that that plaintiffs offer no evidence that Federated learned of the manufacturers\u2019 plans from May. Federated asserts that it probably learned about the rollout from the manufacturers themselves, as employees from Federated met with the employees of Lenox and Waterford regularly. Doc # 186, Ex HH, (Gavin depo) at 44:21-46:11, 48:21^19:2, 129:4-8; Ex LL, (McGillivary depo) at 153:9-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">Defendants also dispute plaintiffs\u2019 reasoning concerning the second piece of evidence \u2014 the allegation that employees of Federated and May, in separate conversations, used similar language in speaking to the manufacturers about the rollout (\u201cyou do what you have to do, and we will do what we have to do\u201d). Doc # 161 at 19, 31. According to defendants, the similarity is unsurprising because the phrase is precisely what retailers should say in order to avoid implicating the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">Third, defendants argue that Federated\u2019s letter to Waterford did not refer to May when it thanked Waterford for doing \u201cthe right thing for all partners in the game.\u201d In support, defendants claim that Federated and Waterford frequently referred to each other as \u201cpartners.\u201d Doc # 141, Ex F, (\u201cGrove depo\u201d) at 67:14-24, 69:9-13, 84:7. Federated\u2019s expert also used the term \u201cpartner\u201d to describe the nature of the relationships between vendors and retailers. Doc # 131, Ex DD at \u00b6\u00b6 48, 64, 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">Regarding plaintiffs\u2019 fourth point, defendants cite <em>Curtis v. M &amp; S Petroleum, Inc., </em>174 F.3d 661, 675 (5th Cir.1999), for the proposition that the invocation of the Fifth Amendment by Federated\u2019s CEO is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. Defendants also urge the court to interpret Zimmerman\u2019s conduct in light of prior events: When the New York attorney general\u2019s office deposed Zimmerman in 2004, he testified that he could not recall a conversation he had with an executive at Waterford. In response, the attorney general\u2019s office indicted him for perjury. A New York trial court dismissed the indictment, but the attorney general\u2019s office had appealed the dismissal. As a result, when he was deposed in this action, Zimmerman invoked his Fifth Amendment rights. Doc # 131, Ex X (Zimmerman depo) at 20:20-22:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-10\">Finally, defendants aver that all witnesses pertinent to this case have denied the existence of any communications between Federated and May regarding Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. See Doc # 141, Ex C (Lundgren depo) at 75:25-76:7; Ex F (Grove depo) at 88:15-19, 91:10-17; Ex G, (Engelman depo) at 99:19-25; 192:24-193:4; Ex H (Loeraft depo) at 181:11-24, 273:20-274:6, 275:1-10; Doc # 131, Ex D (Hofer depo) at 158:24-159:2, 214:15-24. Nor were employees of Bed, Bath <em>&amp; </em>Beyond, Lenox or Waterford aware of any communications between Federated and May. Doc # 131, Ex B (Johnson depo) at 239:12-14; Ex I (Mielke depo) at 158:18-159:6; Ex J (Krangel depo) at 300:14-18; Ex K (Gavin depo) at 255:12-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-11\">Defendants\u2019 methodical critique of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence implies that <em>Matsushita </em>demands a certain quantum of evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>verbal agreement to avoid summary judgment. Yet the <em>Matsushita </em>court never insisted that any particular kind of evidence of collusion was required. Instead, the Court demanded that the evidence be of such quality that makes collusion a likely explanation of the activity before the court. <em>Matsushita\u2019s </em>analysis, moreover, arose from the context of a highly improbable twenty-year-long predatory pricing conspiracy; as such, the Court required high-quality evidence to permit such a conspiracy to be presented to a jury. <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 587-88, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (\u201cIf the factual context renders respondents\u2019 claim implausible \u2014 if the claim is one that simply makes no economic sense \u2014 respondents must come forward with more persuasive evidence to support their claim than would otherwise be necessary.\u201d). Hence, plaintiffs need not demonstrate the existence of an explicit conspiracy, only that \u201cthe inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588, 106 S.Ct. 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">The court therefore assesses whether defendants had \u201cany rational motive\u201d to conspire and whether defendants\u2019 conduct was consistent with their independent interest. <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 596-97, 106 S.Ct. 1348. Plaintiffs correctly note that Federated and May had a \u201crational motive\u201d to conspire against Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. The gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that Federated and May acted together in an effort to block a new entrant\u2019s access to the market. The reasons why such behavior would be economically rational are straightforward. During the alleged conspiracy, consumers were steadily migrating from department stores to home specialty chain stores, such as Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, and bridal registries (which made up a significant portion of the tableware business) were following suit. Doc # 180, Ex 10 (Mielke depo) at 43:25-44:25. Federated and May, as established market participants, could reasonably fear that Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond would erode their profit and market share. As one commentator remarked, \u201c[wjhere the \u2018victim\u2019 [of an exclusionary group boycott] is a competitor of the alleged conspirators, there is no mystery as to why the defendants would want to injure the rival. It is axiomatic that firms prefer to have fewer rather than more rivals.\u201d Kenneth L Glazer, <em>Concerted Refusals to Deal Under Section 1 of the Sherman </em>Act, 70 Antitrust L J 1, 17 (2002)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">But the motive to conspire articulated by plaintiffs works both ways: insofar as Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond\u2019s competitive threat encouraged conspiracy, it also bolsters defendants\u2019 version of the events \u2014 that Federated and May pressured the manufacturers unilaterally. Accordingly, each party\u2019s account of the events make \u201ceconomic sense,\u201d see <em>Adaptive Power Solutions, LLC v. Hughes Missile Systems Co., </em>141 F.3d 947, 953 (9th Cir.1998), and the emergence of Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond as a competitor does not weigh in either party\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">Yet this same economic intuition fails to account for the alleged conspiracy between Lenox and Waterford. Nothing in the present record establishes an economic motive for a conspiracy between Waterford and Lenox to back out of the Bed, Bath <em>&amp; </em>Beyond rollout. Nor do plaintiffs articulate why Waterford and Lenox would have harbored animosity toward Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Manufacturers generally lack incentives to conspire to undercut an upstart retailer like Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond; to the contrary, such manufacturers have every reason to establish ties with these newcomers. This intuition appears to have played out here: Lennox and Waterford commenced dealings with Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond that were ruptured at the bidding of Federated and May.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">In light of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence and defendants\u2019 market conditions, the issue for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>court is to determine whether plaintiffs satisfy their burden and \u201ctend[ ] to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators acted independently.\u201d <em>Monsanto, </em>465 U.S. at 768, 104 S.Ct. 1464. That determination is clear-cut with respect to the alleged horizontal conspiracy between Len-nox and Waterford. As discussed above, the theory that Lennox and Waterford conspired to boycott Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond neither makes economic sense nor finds support in the record. See <em>Mitchael v. Intracorp, Inc., </em>179 F.3d 847 (10th Cir.1999) (granting summary judgment in circumstantial evidence case because plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any motive to conspire); <em>Orson, Inc. v. Miramax Film Corp., </em>79 F.3d 1358, 1370 (3d Cir.1996) (affirming summary judgment for defendant in part because of lack of motive to conspire). Accordingly, the court concludes that plaintiffs\u2019 circumstantial evidence of an agreement between Lennox and Waterford falls short of the standard under <em>Matsushita.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">Turning to the alleged agreement between Federated and May, the court finds that plaintiffs satisfy their burden, albeit with little evidence to spare. First, the court agrees with plaintiffs that Federated\u2019s and May\u2019s simultaneous behavior within a two-week period constitutes a pattern of uniform business conduct that bespeaks a tacit agreement or even so-called \u201cconscious parallelism.\u201d See <em>Petruzzi\u2019s IGA Supermarkets v. Darling-Delaware Co., </em>998 F.2d 1224, 1242-43 (3d Cir.1993). To be sure, that Federated learned about the rollout one week after Lenox informed May about the program hardly establishes that Federated communicated with May, as Federated met with its manufacturers on a regular basis. But defendants fail to explain precisely when or how Federated learned of the rollout from its manufacturers, leaving open the inference of horizontal communications. See generally <em>Interstate Circuit v. United States, </em>306 U.S. 208, 225-26, 59 S.Ct. 467, 83 L.Ed. 610 (1939) (\u201cWhen the proof supported, as we think it did, the inference of such concert, the burden rested on appellants of going forward with the evidence to explain away or contradict it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">The parallel language (\u201cyou do what you have to do, and we will do what we have to do\u201d) used by Federated and May also carries some weight. Granted, in both situations, business executives plausibly repeated this boilerplate to clarify that each company had to act independently, not col-lusively. And it would be anomalous for antitrust law to regard efforts against collusion as evidence of collusion. But antitrust law does not direct executives to invoke the particular phrase at issue; as such, the striking similarity permits an inference of concerted action. See e g, <em>De Jong Packing Co. v. USDA, </em>618 F.2d 1329 (9th Cir.1980) (continuance of conspiracy inferred from identical letters sent separately at the same time); <em>Apex Oil v. Di Mauro, </em>822 F.2d 246, 255-57 (2d Cir.1987) (\u201cstriking\u201d similarity of defendants\u2019 separate notebook entries of conversations among them gives rise to reasonable inference of conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">Federated\u2019s phrase (\u201cpartners in the game\u201d) in its letter to Waterford may also suggest a collusive agreement between Federated and May. That said, if the phrase is construed to encompass May, then Federated\u2019s assertion simply offers an opinion that Waterford\u2019s exclusive relationship with the various department stores is symbiotic; it does not necessarily imply an agreement between the department stores. Nevertheless, Federated\u2019s alleged acknowledgment of May\u2019s interests tends to undercut defendants\u2019 contention that they acted independently. See <em>Pe-truzzi\u2019s IGA Supermarkets, </em>998 F.2d at 1242-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>Finally, Zimmerman\u2019s \u201cpleading the Fifth\u201d may be relevant to the present dispute. In <em>Baxter v. Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976), the Supreme Court held that the drawing of the adverse inference from the invocation the Fifth Amendment in civil suit is proper when incriminating evidence is also presented. See <em>id. </em>at 317-18, 96 S.Ct. 1551. The Ninth Circuit interprets <em>Baxter </em>as licensing the drawing of an adverse inference in the civil context only if \u201cindependent evidence exists of the fact to which the party refuses to answer.\u201d <em>Doe by &amp; through Rudy-Glanzer v. Glanzer, </em>232 F.3d 1258, 1264 (9th Cir.2000). This proviso is said to broker the competing interests of the party asserting the privilege and those of the adverse party, \u201cwho is deprived of a source of information that might conceivably be determinative in a search for the truth.\u201d <em>SEC v. Graystone Nash, Inc., </em>25 F.3d 187, 190 (3d Cir.1994). Here, defendants neither contend that corroborating evidence is lacking nor counsel against drawing an adverse inference based on Zimmerman\u2019s invocation of the privilege. This omission impels the court to conclude that Zimmerman\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment may have deprived plaintiffs of probative testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">In view of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence and the market conditions defendants\u2019 faced, the court finds that plaintiffs satisfy their burden and tend to exclude the possibility that the Federated and May acted independently. Accordingly, the court finds that plaintiffs raise an inference of unlawful conspiracy between Federated and May sufficient to overcome defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">The court stresses that plaintiffs only survive summary judgment on the basis of the alleged horizontal agreement Federated and May: the vertical communications remain relevant to the extent they abetted the alleged horizontal agreement, but such communications cannot serve as an independent ground for antitrust liability under the rule of reason. Even if plaintiffs provided evidence under the rule of reason, which they have not, <em>Monsanto </em>and its progeny would require the dismissal of any vertical claims because plaintiffs\u2019 evidence suggests, at most, that Lenox and Waterford caved to complaints from Federated and May. See <em>Monsanto, </em>465 U.S. at 763, 104 S.Ct. 1464, (explaining that distributor complaints \u201carise in the normal course of business and do not indicate illegal concerted action\u201d); <em>OSC Corp. v. Apple Computer, Inc., </em>792 F.2d 1464, 1468 (9th Cir.1986) (holding that \u201c[dealer] complaints followed by termination are not enough to provide sufficient proof of an antitrust conspiracy\u201d); <em>The Jeanery, Inc. v. James Jeans, Inc., </em>849 F.2d 1148 (9th Cir.1988), 849 F.2d at 1157 (\u201cComplaints by competitors, standing alone, are not sufficient to show a conspiracy.\u201d); <em>Isaksen v. Vermont Castings, Inc., </em>825 F.2d 1158, 1162 (7th Cir.1987) (Posner, J) (\u201cComplaints to a supplier, made by competitors of a dealer who is cutting prices below suggested levels are not, standing alone, evidence of agreement\u201d). Hence, even if plaintiffs pursued a claim under the rule of reason, their evidence is insufficient to raise an inference of unlawful conspiracy or combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">In sum, the court GRANTS Waterford\u2019s motion for summary judgment and GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Federated\u2019s and May\u2019s motion for summary judgment.
