For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants Guidant\u2019s Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">For the purposes of this Motion, the Court focuses on the allegations in the Master Complaint. The Master Complaint alleges claims against Guidant for the marketing, manufacturing, distribution, sales, and eventual recall of certain allegedly defective pacemakers and implantable cardio-verter defibrillators (\u201cICDs\u201d). A pacemaker is a device that is implanted in a patient to primarily treat abnormally slow heart rhythms. An ICD is a device that is implanted in a patient with certain ventricular arrhythmias or with a risk of having such arrhythmias. It monitors a patient\u2019s heart rhythm and, if needed, acts to correct or restore that rhythm. An ICD can function both as a pacemaker and a defibrillator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">Briefly, Plaintiffs allege that Guidant was aware of a short-circuiting failure with one of its ICDs, the VENTAK PRIZM 2 DR, Model 1861 (\u201c1861\u201d), as early as February 2002. Despite this knowledge, Plaintiffs assert that Guidant did not inform the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), doctors, patients, or the public of the problem until May 2005, shortly before a <em>New York Times </em>article was published about the death of a Minneapolis man allegedly caused by a failure of an 1861 ICD. During that time, Plaintiffs assert that Guidant continued to sell 1861 ICDs that it knew were defective and continued to seek FDA approval of new pacemakers and ICDs, without informing the FDA of the known defects. In June 2005, Guidant issued a national recall of 1861 ICDs and sent doctors and patients letters about the recalled devices. Guidant informed the patients that it would pay for certain out-of-pocket costs and, if needed, a new Gui-dant ICD, as a result of the recall. Gui-dant\u2019s offer did not include reimbursement for expenses covered by Medicare or a patient\u2019s health insurance and incurred in connection with the recalled ICDs or the replacement ICDs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">Based on these events and similar but separate events concerning other pacemakers and ICDs manufactured by Gui-dant, three groups of plaintiffs \u2014 individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>device recipients, one plaintiff under the Medicare Secondary Payer (\u201cMSP\u201d) statute, and third-party payers (\u201cTPP\u201d) \u2014 allege claims against Guidant. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), Guidant now moves to dismiss the MSP and TPP claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that the MSP and TPP Plaintiffs do not have standing to pursue their claims and that the MSP and TPP Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">I. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), not Rule 12(b)(6), is the proper vehicle with which to seek dismissal of a claim for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Compare </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) with Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). A motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction may challenge a plaintiffs complaint either on its face or on the factual truthfulness of its averments. <em>Osborn v. United States, </em>918 F.2d 724, 729 n. 6 (8th Cir.1990). Where, as here, a party makes a \u201cfacial attack,\u201d the non-moving party receives the same protections as it would defending against a motion under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">In deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a court assumes all facts in the complaint to be true and construes all reasonable inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to the complainant. <em>Morton v. Becker, 793 </em>F.2d 185, 187 (8th Cir.1986). A court is, however, \u201cfree to ignore legal conclusions, unsupported conclusions, unwarranted inferences and sweeping legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations.\u201d <em>Wiles v. Capitol Indem. Corp., </em>280 F.3d 868, 870 (8th Cir.2002). \u201c[A] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in supT port of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). A court may consider the complaint, matters of public record, orders, materials embraced by the complaint, and exhibits attached to the complaint in deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See Porous Media Corp. v. Pall Corp., </em>186 F.3d 1077, 1079 (8th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">The threshold issue to be addressed is whether the MSP and TPP Plaintiffs have standing to have this Court decide the merits of their claims. The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing standing. <em>Lu-jan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). If a plaintiff lacks standing, a district court has no subject matter jurisdiction over the matter and must dismiss the case. <em>Young Am. Corp. v. Affiliated Computer Servs., Inc., </em>424 F.3d 840, 843 (8th Cir.2005). A party invoking the jurisdiction of the federal courts must meet both the constitutional requirements of Article 111 and the prudential limitations crafted by the courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 559-60, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>Article III of the Constitution limits the power of the federal courts to deciding only actual \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d U.S. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. To establish constitutional Article III standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) an injury-in-fact, (2) a causal connection between that injury and the challenged conduct, and (3) the likelihood that a favorable decision by the court will redress the alleged injury. <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130. These constitutional requirements of standing limit federal courts to deciding only cases where the plaintiffs can show a \u201cpersonal injury fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\u201d <em>Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">With these guidelines in mind, the Court considers whether the plaintiffs named in the Master Complaint have standing to allege the MSP and TPP claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">A. MSP Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">1. The MSP Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">Medicare is a federal health insurance program that benefits persons over 65 and the disabled. The MSP was enacted in 1980 and designed to \u201creduce Medicare costs by making the government a secondary provider of medical insurance coverage when a Medicare recipient has other sources of primary coverage.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Goetzmann, </em>337 F.3d 489, 495 (5th Cir.2003). The statute provides that a Medicare payment \u201cmay not be made ... with respect to any item or service to the extent that payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made\u201d under a \u201cprimary plan.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(A). In this way, the MSP makes Medicare the secondary payer for medical services provided to Medicare beneficiaries whenever payment is available through a primary payer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">The MSP\u2019s definition of \u201cprimary plan\u201d has expanded over the years to include a \u201cgroup health plan, ... workmen\u2019s compensation law or plan, an automobile or liability insurance policy or plan (including a self-insured plan) or no fault insurance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(A)(ii). \u201cAn entity that engages in a business, trade, or profession shall be deemed to have a self-insured plan if it carries its own risk (whether by failure to obtain insurance or otherwise) in whole or in part.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">Since the existence of other insurance coverage is sometimes unknown, the MSP allows Medicare to make a conditional payment to cover medical expenses and then requires a primary plan to later reimburse the Medicare Trust Fund. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). To facilitate recovery of conditional payments, the MSP provides for a direct government action against any entity that was responsible for payment under a primary plan but failed to pay it, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii), and it also subrogates the United States to the rights of a Medicare beneficiary to collect payment owing under a primary plan for items already paid by Medicare, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iv). In addition, the MSP creates a private right of action with double recovery to encourage private parties who are aware of non-payment by primary plans to bring actions to enforce Medicare\u2019s rights. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">2. Ivens\u2019 Claims Under the MSP</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-13\">Tamela Ivens, a Medicare beneficiary, asserts claims against Guidant under \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A) of the MSP on behalf of all Medicare beneficiaries who received any of the pacemakers or ICDs at issue in this litigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ivens alleges that doctors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>implanted a Guidant Vitality AVT ICD, Model A1555, in her in January 2004. (Master Compl., \u00b6 30.) In August 2005, doctors explanted her ICD and replaced it with a non-Guidant ICD. <em>(Id.) </em>Medicare paid for her medical expenses related to these procedures. <em>(Id.) </em>Ivens asserts that the implanting and explanting of a Guidant ICD gives her standing to serve \u201cfor the purposes of the Master Complaint as an exemplar and as a private attorney general under the MSP\u201d because Medicare \u201chas paid and is being charged for the medical expenditures resulting from [Guidant\u2019s] recalled ICDs.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Specifically, based on \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A), Ivens alleges four counts against Guidant: (1) Breach of Assumed Contractual Warranty Obligations; (2) Liability as First-Party Insurer Under MSP: Agreement to Pay Medical Costs; (3) Liability as First-Party Insurer Under MSP: Provision of Express and Implied Warranties; and (4) Liability as Third-Party Insurer Under MSP: Liability as Holder of a Liability Insurance Policy or Plan. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 444-470.) For these claims, Ivens seeks \u201can award of damages in an amount double the amount paid by Medicare to reimburse healthcare providers for all healthcare services provided to all Medicare beneficiaries resulted from the recalled [ICDs].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">3. Ivens\u2019 Standing Under the MSP</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">Guidant asserts that Ivens lacks constitutional standing to bring her own claims under the MSP. Guidant points out that Ivens does not allege that her ICD malfunctioned or even that she incurred any financial injury because, admittedly, Medicare paid her medical expenses. Moreover, Guidant contends that Ivens lacks standing to bring claims on behalf of other Medicare beneficiaries because Article III standing redresses injuries of the complaining party only and Ivens has not alleged that the alleged injuries suffered by other beneficiaries caused injury to Iv-ens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">Ivens responds that Congress granted her standing in the MSP, as it did for private plaintiffs in the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), and that there is no legally significant difference between a <em>qui tam </em>FCA action and a MPS private action. She explains that the \u201cMSP private plaintiff, as a substitute attorney general, is not seeking compensation damages for an injury suffered by the plaintiff!,] but is proceeding on behalf of Medicare to sue in order to right an economic wrong done to the government.\u201d (Plfs\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 8 (quotations omitted)). Accordingly, Ivens contends that she \u201cmerely presents the government\u2019s claims to be reimbursed for all of Medicare\u2019s illegitimate expenditures for Guidant\u2019s ICDs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">Relying on portions of the Medicare Secondary Payer Manual, Ivens asserts that she has standing to bring the Government\u2019s claims because she had a Guidant ICD and is a Medicare beneficiary. She contends that cases holding that plaintiffs lack standing to bring MSP claims are inapposite because those plaintiffs were non-Medicare beneficiaries. <em>See, e.g., Brockovich v. Community Med. Ctrs., Inc., </em>2007 WL 738691 (E.D.Cal. March 7, 2007). Ivens characterizes Guidant\u2019s standing argument as a frontal assault on the MSP\u2019s private right of action that should be addressed legislatively, not in a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">Ivens concedes that she lacks traditional Article III standing to bring claims based on her own injuries. She acknowledges that she suffered no economic injuries because Medicare paid for the implanting and explanting of her ICDs. However, she contends that the MSP gives her standing by partially assigning the Government\u2019s claims to her in \u00a7 1367(y)(3)(A). She analogizes this to a grant under the FCA for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number><em>qui tam </em>action. But a comparison of the two statutes reveals their differences, not their similarities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">A <em>qui tam </em>action is \u201can action under a statute that allows a private person to sue for a penalty, part of which the government or some specified public institution will receive.\u201d <em>Blacks\u2019 Law Dictionary </em>1262 (8th ed.2004). Under the FCA, a private person, known as a relator, may bring a <em>qui tam </em>civil action \u201cin the name of the Government,\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(1), against \u201c[a]ny person who knowingly presents ... to ... the United States Government ... a false or fraudulent claim for payment.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a). The relator receives a share of the proceeds from the action, sometimes referred to as a bounty. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(d). The FCA contains specific procedural mechanisms that a relator must use in order to assert a claim under the FCA, including, but not limited to, service of the complaint on the Government before service on the defendant, the Government\u2019s participation in settlement, and consent of the Government before a case can be dismissed. <em>See generally </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)-(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">The United States Supreme Court has held that a relator under the FCA has Article III standing because he or she has a \u201cconcrete private interest in the outcome of [the] suit\u201d by virtue of the relator\u2019s right to a portion of the recovery. <em>Vermont Agency of Natural Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens, </em>529 U.S. 765, 773, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000). In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court explained that the \u201cadequate basis for the relator\u2019s suit for his bounty is to be found in the doctrine that the assignee of a claim has standing to assert the injury in fact suffered by the assignor,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that a relator under the FCA is \u201csuing as a <em>partial </em>assignee of the United States,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 774 n. 4, 120 S.Ct. 1858 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">Congress cannot manufacture Article III standing for a plaintiff who otherwise has no injury simply by providing a private right-of-action in a law. <em>Raines v. Byrd, </em>521 U.S. 811, 820 n. 3, 117 S.Ct. 2312, 138 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997) (\u201cIt is settled that Congress cannot erase Article Ill\u2019s standing requirements by statutorily granting the right to sue to a plaintiff who would not otherwise have standing\u201d). Instead, the right to proceed <em>qui tam </em>arises only by affirmative statutory authorization, and in the absence of some unambiguous authorization, a purposed <em>qui tam </em>relator may not so proceed. <em>See United States ex rel. Mattson v. Northwest Paper Co., </em>327 F.Supp. 87, 93 (D.Minn.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">Unlike the FCA, the MSP does not unambiguously indicate that Congress, expressly or by implication, assigned any individual the right to bring suit on behalf of all Medicare beneficiaries. Moreover, the statute contains none of the procedural protections that are explicitly defined in the FCA, even though Congress added the private cause of action to the MSP the same month that Congress amended the FCA, which specifically allows <em>qui tam </em>actions. Without an unambiguous grant of authorization to sue, the United States as the real party in interest, or other procedural safeguards, the MSP does not share common characteristics of the FCA. <em>See, e.g., Stalley v. Genesis Healthcare Corp., </em>2007 WL 781907 at * 3 (E.D.Pa. March 12, 2007) (discussing differences between <em>qui tam </em>actions under the FCA and a private right of action under the MSP); <em>Stalley v. Sumner Reg\u2019l Health Sys., Inc., </em>2007 WL 173686 at * 6 (M.D.Tenn. Jan. 18, 2007) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">Assuming all facts in the Master Complaint to be true and construing all reasonable inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to Ivens, she cannot show that the MSP grants her stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>ing as an assignee of the United States to bring her MSP claims. Therefore, the Court must dismiss those claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">B. TPP Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">1. UFCW Fund and the City\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">The TPP Claims contained in the Master Complaint are alleged by two named TPPs, Plaintiff UFCW Local 1776 and Participating Employers Health and Welfare Fund (the \u201cUFCW Fund\u201d) and Plaintiff City of Bethlehem (the \u201cCity\u201d). (Master Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.) Both are residents of Pennsylvania. <em>(Id.) </em>The UFCW Fund is a not-for-profit <em>trust established to provide </em>comprehensive health care benefits to participant workers, and it alleges that it has \u201cpaid all or part of the cost of its participants\u2019 purchases and associated medical expenses of the Guidant products at issue in this litigation, including the medical expenses for the subrogee, John Doe.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 27.) The UFCW Fund asserts that it has standing to bring claims in its own name pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(d) of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act and that it has been injured by Guidant\u2019s alleged misconduct. <em>(Id.) </em>The City, a self-insurer, provides medical benefits to its eligible employees by means of a contract, policy or plan. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 28). It alleges that it \u201chas been billed for and has paid charges for Guidant devices at issue in this litigation\u201d and \u201chas incurred and is likely to incur ... full or policy partial costs for the Guidant products at issue in this litigation and related medical costs.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the UFCW Fund and the City bring their TPP claims on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXyW\">[A]ll third party payors ... in the United States (or its Territories) who (i) have been issuers or sponsors of a contract, policy or plan that provides medical coverage to natural persons, and (ii) have incurred, pursuant to such contract, policy, or plan, full or partial costs of any of the [pacemakers and ICDs] and related medical costs including implantation surgery, replacement surgery, medical monitoring and/or hospital costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\"><em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 254.) They assert that for the purposes of the TPP class definition, \u201cthird party entities \u2018purchased\u2019 the Guidant Devices if they paid some or the entire purchase price.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>In addition, they assert that as a direct and proximate cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>Guidant\u2019s conduct, \u201c[p]ublic and private payors of health insurance have had to shoulder, wrongfully, an enormous economic impact of Guidant\u2019s conduct, [in] an amount that is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">The TPP Plaintiffs seek \u201cnon-monetary relief including disclosure ... of registrant list(s) maintained by Guidant to enable appropriate effectuation of the recall and the proper allocation of the economic burden of that recall\u201d and \u201cmonetary relief including payment for the wrongful burden placed on TPPs for the costs of replacement and/or corrective surgeries.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 29). They allege nine counts against Guidant: (1) Violation of the Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practice Act; (2) Violation of the Minnesota Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act; (3) Violation of Minnesota False Statements in Advertising Statute; (4) Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Under State Law; (5) Subrogation Liability Determination; (6) Unjust Enrichment; (7) Breach of Implied Warranty; (8) Breach of Assumed Contractual Warranty Obligations; and (9) Misrepresentation by Omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">2. The TPP\u2019s Standing to Assert Their Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Guidant asserts that the named TPP Plaintiffs do not have Article III standing to assert seven of their claims, specifically those involving state consumer protection statutes, warranties, and misrepresentation by omission.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, Guidant asserts that the named TPP Plaintiffs have suffered no injuries-in-fact because their insureds, not the TPPs, are the persons who suffered injuries, if any. It also contends that there is no causal connection between the alleged injury and Guidant\u2019s conduct because the devices at issue in this litigation are only available through a doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">The TPP Plaintiffs respond to Guidant\u2019s argument in four sentences, asserting baldly that the they have suffered a \u201cdirect injury\u201d because they had incurred \u201ceconomic injuries by paying wholly unnecessary cost and medical expenses directly attributable and allocable to that conduct.\u201d (Plfs\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 9). In their briefs and at oral argument, both Guidant and the TPP Plaintiffs downplayed the importance of the federal standing requirements and instead concentrated on whether Minnesota and Pennsylvania law applies to the TPP\u2019s claims and whether the named TPP Plaintiffs have standing under either state\u2019s consumer protection statutes and common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">Standing under state law is not equivalent to standing under federal law. Rather, regardless of a plaintiffs ability to sue in state court, a plaintiff in a federal court must meet federal standing requirements in order to assert a claim in federal court. See <em>Metropolitan Express Servs., Inc. v. City of Kansas City, </em>23 F.3d 1367, 1369 (8th Cir.1994) (recognizing that a court sitting in diversity may not address a plaintiffs claim until the plaintiff has standing to sue under Article III and state law); <em>Group Health Plan, Inc. v. Philip Morris Inc., </em>86 F.Supp.2d 912, 917 n. 2 (D.Minn.2000) (explaining that Article III standing requirements are a \u201cwholly separate determination\u201d from state standing). Therefore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>in determining jurisdiction, district courts of the United States must look to the sources of their power, [A]rticle III of the United States Constitution and Congressional statutory grants of jurisdiction, not to the acts of state legislatures. However extensive their power to create and define substantive rights, the states have no power directly to enlarge or contract federal jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0K\"><em>Duchek v. Jacobi, </em>646 F.2d 415, 419 (9th Cir.1981). In this way, the requirement that a plaintiff must have suffered \u201ca distinct and palpable injury to himself\u2019 remains, independent of any statute. <em>Warth, </em>422 U.S. at 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">Assuming all facts in the Master Complaint to be true and construing all reasonable inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to the named TPP Plaintiffs, the Court concludes that they do not have Article III standing to assert seven of their claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The named TPP Plaintiffs assert, in conclusory fashion, that they are purchasers that suffered direct injuries. But a court is \u201cfree to ignore legal conclusions, unsupported conclusions, unwarranted inferences and sweeping legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations.\u201d <em>Wiles, </em>280 F.3d at 870. The named TPP Plaintiffs provide no support for their assertion that they are purchasers. There are no allegations in the Master Complaint that the TPPs agreed to pay for the devices at issue and related costs based on their relationship with Guidant or representations Guidant made to it. There is no allegation that the named TPP Plaintiffs had any role in selecting which devices a patient should receive. And there are no allegations that the named TPP Plaintiffs agreed to pay a certain price for the devices based on Guidant\u2019s statements or to grant Guidant some sort of preferred or approved provider status, thereby creating a direct relationship between the named TPP Plaintiffs and Gui-dant. In fact, the named TPP Plaintiffs concede that they were contractually bound to pay for their insureds\u2019 medical expenses related to the recalled devices and that Guidant has a relationship with the doctors and patients, not with the TPP Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">In this way, the named TPP Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are distinguishable from drug cases in which a third-party payer has standing because it suffered direct injuries related to its agreement to buy drugs at a high price when cheaper alternatives were available. <em>See, e.g., In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., </em>391 F.3d 516, 531 (3d Cir.2004) (\u201cNotably, TPPs, like individual consumers, suffered direct economic harm when, as a result of [Defendant\u2019s] alleged misrepresentations, they paid supracom-petitive prices for Coumadin instead of purchasing lower-priced generic warfarin sodium\u201d); <em>Desiano v. Warner-Lambert Co., </em>326 F.3d 339, 349 (2d Cir.2003) (explaining that third-party payers\u2019 injuries were direct because they were unaffected by whether any patient was harmed by the drug when, but for defendants\u2019 misrepresentations, third-party payers would not have bought cheaper alternatives, not defendants\u2019 drug). And the claims are distinguishable from the antitrust cases in which a third-party payer alleges a direct injury based on money paid directly as a result of a defendant\u2019s anticompetitive conduct. <em>See, e.g., Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield United of Wisconsin v. Marshfield Clinic, </em>65 F.3d 1406, 1414 (7th Cir.1995) (eonelud-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>ing plaintiff had standing to sue because it had made payments directly to the defendant based on alleged overcharges billed by defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Moreover, there is no causal connection between the alleged injury and Guidant\u2019s alleged misconduct. Standing requires a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, specifically, the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court. <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130. In <em>Rivera v. Wyeth-Ayerst Lab., </em>283 F.3d 315 (5th Cir.2002), the court found that a plaintiff had not established a causal connection between her taking a drug prescribed by a doctor and her alleged injuries because the causation link would depend on concluding that had the defendant acted lawfully, the doctor would not have prescribed the drug and the patient would not have taken it. <em>Rivera, </em>283 F.3d at 320. The court concluded such causation was too speculative. <em>Id. </em>The Court finds <em>Rivera </em>persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Here, the named TPP Plaintiffs\u2019 purported standing rests on the independent choices of the doctors who recommend the devices to their patients and on the patients who decide to receive the devices, in lieu of other treatment options, if any. In essence, the TPP Plaintiffs allege that Gui-dant committed a tort on their insureds, causing injury and resulting in the in-jureds seeking medical treatment, which in turn caused economic harm to the TPPs because they were contractually obligated to pay for the injureds\u2019 medical care. Without a more direct connection, these claims are too speculative to establish a causal link between the alleged injury and the alleged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">Given that the Court has concluded that the named TPP Plaintiffs lack standing to assert their claims involving state consumer protection statutes, warranties, and misrepresentation by omission, it must dismiss those claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">II. Failure to State a Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">Guidant moves to dismiss the TPP Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Court briefly considers each in turn using the standard of review discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">A. Subrogation Liability Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">In a claim entitled \u201cSubrogation Liability Determination,\u201d the TPP Plaintiffs seek relief that they characterize as injunctive relief and that Guidant characterizes as a discovery request. (Master Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 412-418.) In essence, the claim seeks a list of Guidant\u2019s records so that the TPPs may identify which of their insureds received a recalled Guidant pacemaker or ICDs so that they can seek monetary relief based on their contractual subrogation rights. <em>(Id.) </em>Guidant does not dispute the existence of the TPP Plaintiffs\u2019 right in theory to subrogation. It does, however, contest the manner in which the TPP Plaintiffs have alleged their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>The TPP Plaintiffs do not name any insureds, allege that any of their insureds have alleged claims against Guidant, or that any of their insureds have been paid any money by Guidant. Under either Pennsylvania or Minnesota law<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and in the absence of such allegations, especially from whom the subrogation rights are derived, the subrogation claims fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See, e.g., Topelski v. Universal South Side Autos, Inc., </em>407 Pa. 339, 180 A.2d 414, 421 (1962) (explaining proper manner in which to allege a subrogation claim); <em>Westendorf v. Stasson, </em>330 N.W.2d 699, 703 (Minn. 1983) (discussing \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine). Therefore, the Court must dismiss the subrogation count under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">B. Unjust Enrichment</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">The TPP Plaintiffs allege that they conferred a benefit upon Guidant by paying for the devices at issue on their insureds\u2019 behalf, that Guidant knew and accepted these payments, and that Gui-dant\u2019s retention of these payments would be inequitable. (Master Compl. \u00b6\u00b6423-427.) Because the TPP Plaintiffs have an adequate remedy of law through a properly pled subrogation claim, their claim for unjust enrichment fails under Minnesota law. <em>See Group Health Plan, Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>68 F.Supp.2d 1064, 1070-71 (D.Minn.1999); <em>reaffirmed on remand by Group Health Plan, </em>86 F.Supp.2d at 916. In addition, because the TPP Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are too remote, their unjust enrichment claim fails under Pennsylvania law. <em>See Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>171 F.3d 912, 937 (3d Cir.1999). Therefore, the Court must dismiss the unjust enrichment claim under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">1. Guidant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Medicare Secondary Payer and Third-Party Payer Claims (Doc. No. 396) is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">2. Counts XVIIIXXI and XXIII-XXX contained in the Amended Master Complaint<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">3. Count XXII contained in the Amended Master Complaint is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-14\">3. Because it appears that Guidant is no longer pursuing its Motion to Dismiss the Master Complaint Claims of the Individual Device Recipient Plaintiffs (Doc. No. 392), it is directed to withdraw that motion immediately and file an answer to the remaining portions of the Amended Master Complaint no later than 10 days after the date of this Order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">. Although not at issue in this motion, the United States Supreme Court has defined certain prudential considerations to guide questions of standing. First, a plaintiff may not assert a \"generalized grievance\u201d that is suffered by all or a large class of citizens. <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, </em>418 U.S. 208, 227, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974). A plaintiff must also assert his or her own legal rights, rather than the rights of third parties, in order to have standing to sue in federal court. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). Finally, a plaintiffs complaint must fall within the \u201czone of interests to be protected or regulated by statute or constitutional guarantee in question.\u201d <em>Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, </em>454 U.S. 464, 475, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">. Ivens also alleges individual device recipient claims, but this Order does not concern those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">. Although Ivens does not have standing to pursue her MSP claims, the Court will briefly address Guidant\u2019s second basis for its 12(b)(6) motion. Assuming, without deciding, that Guidant is a \u201cprimary plan,\u201d Guidant asserts that Ivens cannot bring her MSP claims until Guidant\u2019s responsibility to pay for health care expenses is established. Relying on portions of the Medicare Secondary Payer Manual concerning subrogation rights, Ivens responds that she does not need to demonstrate responsibility prior to alleging her claims because her MSP claims are based on the Government\u2019s direct right to action, which does not require determination of responsibility prior to the commencement of an action. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b) (2) (B) (iii) (explaining that the United States may bring an action \"against any or all entities that are or were required\u201d to make a payment under a primary plan). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit recently addressed this exact issue. <em>See Glover v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>459 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir.2006). In that case, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 1395y(b)(3)(A) supports no private cause of action against an alleged tortfeasor where a defendant's responsibility to pay for health care expenses of a Medicare beneficiary has not already been established. This Court finds that reasoning persuasive and adopts it as its own. For that reason, if Ivens had standing, her MSP claims would nonetheless fail because Guidant\u2019s responsibility to reimburse Medicare has not yet been determined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">. The fact that the named TPP Plaintiffs seek to bring claims on behalf of a class adds nothing to the question of standing because named plaintiffs who want to represent a class must show that they were personally injured by a defendant\u2019s actions before seeking relief for themselves or on behalf of others. <em>See Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 40, n. 20, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976); <em>Worth, </em>422 U.S. at 502, 95 S.Ct. 2197.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">. In reaching this conclusion, the Court acknowledges that its colleague in the Medtronic MDL recently denied a motion by the defendant to dismiss the third-party payer claims in that MDL on the basis of standing. This decision today was reached on the record before the Court in this MDL, looking only to the allegations in the Master Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">. If the TPP Plaintiffs had standing, their claims would nonetheless fail because they are premature. Standing and ripeness are related, but separate, doctrines that each focuses on whether the harm asserted has matured sufficiently to warrant judicial intervention. Wa<em>rth, </em>422 U.S. at 499 n. 10, 95 S.Ct. 2197. Ripeness is intended to prevent the courts, through the avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements. <em>Neb. Pub. Power Dist. v. MidAm. Energy Co., </em>234 F.3d 1032, 1037 (8th Cir.2000). Each of the TPP claims depends on whether Guidant committed some wrong against the TPP's participants. Until that issue is decided, the TPP Plaintiffs\u2019 claims cannot be ripe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">. There is no need to perform a choice of law analysis at this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1025-24\">. The Master Complaint was amended on February 21, 2007, to add a claim for punitive damages. (Doc. No. 1195).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
