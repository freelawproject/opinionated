Thomas, constituted the board of directors of the infirmary of Butler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>county. On that day, this board, in pursuance of section 4, of \u201c an act to authorize the establishment of poor houses,\u201d (3 Curwen\u2019s Stat. 243), proceeded to appoint a superintendent of the county infirmary. By the votes of Taylor and Shaffer, Taylor was appointed to the office in question, Thomas casting his vote for another person. The board then fixed the salary of Taylor, as superintendent, at $600 per annum; whereupon he entered -upon the discharge of the duties of that office, still continuing to hold the post of director, but consenting to serve in the latter capacity without compensation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\">The prosecuting attorney of Butler county, on the relation of Greorge W.' Louthan, the previous superintendent, by leave of one of the judges of the supreme court, on the 24th day of March, 1859, filed in the district court of that county, an information in the nature of a <em>quo warranto, </em>praying the removal of Taylor from the office of superintendent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ab1\">An answer and replication were filed, putting in issue the legality of Taylor\u2019s appointment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">The case was tried at the May term, 1859, of the district court, when the facts above recited were admitted by the parties.

The <em>ministerial </em>duty of carrying into effect the regulations of the directors, and the <em>discretionary </em>duty of requiring \u201c all persons received into the infirmary to perform such reasonable and moderate labor, as may be suited to their ages and bodily strength,\u201d are vested in the superintendent. The superintendent, though subordinate to the directors, and in that respect a <em>ministerial </em>officer, nevertheless as much exercises \u201c a public function or employment,\u201d as the directors, who prescribe the duties which he is to perform, and the regulations by which he is to be governed. Both directors and superintendent are required by a public statute, to perform their respective parts in the administration of the public charity; the <em>former </em>are required to direct the mode of its administration, the <em>latter </em>is required to execute such direction ; but the discharge of <em>both </em>duties is essential to the complete performance of this \u201cimportant public function.\u201d It is also provided that the superintendent \u201c shall receive such-compensation for his services as the board shall judge proper.\u201d Is not, then, the superintendent of a county infirmary, one who, in the language of the definition, has \u201c a right to-exercise a public function or employment, and to take the fees and emoluments belonging to it ?\u201d If so, he is a \u201c public-officer.\u201d The facts that he is removable at the pleasure of the-directors, and that the term of his office is of uncertain duration, do not alter the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-6\">2. Was the appointment of Taylor to the office in question-legal and valid?</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-7\">It must be remembered, that he, in effect, <em>appointed himself, </em>by giving the <em>casting vote </em>in his own favor. It will no doubt be contended that, inasmuch as there is no statute expressly prohibiting this, th\u00e9 act was- legal. And much will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>be sought to be inferred from the fact, that the act prohibiting any citizen of this state from holding, at the same time, more than one of certain specified offices, does not enumerate the two offices of infirmary director and superintendent. All, however, that can be inferred from this statutory silence, is, that any citizen of the state is capable of <em>having conferred upon him, </em>any two or more offices, the cotemporaneous holding of which by the same person, is not prohibited; but this is far from saying that any citizen, under any circumstances, may <em>confer upon himself, </em>any office whatsoever. The word <em>appoint, </em>when used in connection with an office, <em>ex vi termini, </em>implies the conferring of authority upon <em>another. </em>It was not necessary, therefore, that the statute should, in express terms, prohibit the infirmary directors from appointing one of their own number superintendent; for the language, \u00a3\u00a3 the board of directors shall <em>appoint </em>a superintendent,\u201d <em>necessarily </em>means, that the person <em>appointed </em>shall be different from those who <em>appoint.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-5\">The precise question here presented, was decided by the .supreme court of Pennsylvania, in the case of <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douglass et al., </em>1 Binn. Rep. 77. An act of the .legislature of Pennsylvania, passed in 1791, provided: &lt;\u00a3 That It shall and may be lawful for the mayor and two aldermen \u25a0of the city of Philadelphia, and two justices of the peace of 'the county of Philadelphia, to appoint inspectors of the prison -of the city and county of Philadelphia, on the first Mondays of May and November in every year, and on any other days when vacancies shall happen in the said office, by death, resignation, or otherwise.\u201d On the first Monday of November, 1803, the mayor summoned the requisite number of aldermen \u00a1and justices, and six inspector's (the legal number), were \u2022appointed, among whom was John Douglass, one of the appointing aldermen. Previously to the day of appointment, several aldermen and justices of the city and county, other than those summoned by the mayor applied to the mayor for Information as to the place and hour at which the appoint\u00a1\u25a0ment would be made, which information was refused. Proceedings in <em>quo warranto </em>were instituted to remove the six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>inspectors so appointed. The case was elaborately argued by counsel; and, after careful consideration, a majority of the court, Judge Brackenridge dissenting, held the appointment illegal as to <em>all </em>the appointees, on the ground of the clandestine manner in which it was made; but the court <em>unanimously </em>held, that whatever doubt there might be as to the other defendants, as to <em>Douglass </em>the case was clear; and, in disposing of that branch of the case, Judge Yeates, who delivered the opinion of the court, used this explicit language:. \u201c One having discretionary authority to appoint a fit person to a public office, appointing himself, seems a solecism in terms ; and it can not be deemed the fulfillment of his duty.\u201d If it be \u201ca solecism in terms\u201d to say, that <em>five </em>persons may appoint one of themselves to an office within their gift, what an absurdity it is to assert, that one of a board of <em>three </em>invested with appointing power, may, <em>by his own casting vote', </em>confer an office upon himself!</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-5\">In conclusion, permit us to call attention to the utter inconsistency of permitting the offices of director and superintendent to be held by the same individual. Such a union of offices gives the defendant a vote, and it may be the <em>deciding </em>one, in fixing the amount of his own salary; in the adoption of rules defining his- own duties, rendering them more or less onerous; in determining the amount and sufficiency of the security which he shall give for the faithful performance of his trust; and in deciding upon the duration of his own term of office : he is invested with visitatorial power over himself ; and, finally, he is made <em>an inspector of his own boohs and accounts. </em>3 Curwen\u2019s St. 2431, secs. 4 and 5. To permit a man thus to be \u201cjudge in his own cause,\u201d would be to convert the very checks and safeguards which t'he law has provided against fraud and peculation, into potent instruments of corruption and iniquity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-6\">In support of the proposition, that \u201c a visitor can not visit himself, and inquire into and decide upon the propriety of his own conduct,\u201d see Ang. &amp; Ames on Corp., sec. 688.'</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-7\"><em>Thomas Millihin, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Brinkerhoee, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ\">Concurring with counsel for the relators in their view of the law of the case, the judgment of the district court will be reversed at the defendant\u2019s costs; but, as it is understood that he has ceased to exercise the office of superintendent of the county infirmary under the appointment contested in the case below, there will be no judgment of ouster.</p>\n<judges id=\"b144-5\">Scott, C.J., and Sutliee, Peck and Gholson, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
