That the language of <em>\u201c </em>item third \u201d is sufficient, standing alone, to vest in Margaret a fee simple estate, and in its effect upon subsequent provisions of the will, is to be considered the same as if he had devised the residue of his real estate to Margaret, her heirs and assigns forever.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b328-12\">'2. That the words \u2018\u2018 legitimate heirs,\u201d mean <em>legitimate issue, </em>and the whole clause, \u201c should my youngest daughter, Margaret Harper, die without any legitimate heirs,\u201d refers to a definite, and notan indefinite failure of issue, and are to be construed as if the words <em>living at the time of her death, </em>had been added after the words <em>\u201c </em>legitimate heirs.\u201d <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Ferris, </em>6 Ohio St. Rep. 563, followed and approved.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b328-13\"><em>'3. </em>That under items third and fourth taken together, Margaret took an estate in fee simple, subject, however, to be determined by the contingency of her dying without issue living at the time of her death, on the happening of which, the estate would pass over to Matthew, by way of executory devise.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Reserved in the district court of Hamilton county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">The plaintiffs filed their petition in the court of common pleas of Hamilton county, to quiet their title to a tract of land near Cincinnati, against a claim made by the defendants,, as disclosed in proceedings instituted by them in said court to have testimony taken and perpetuated to sustain such-claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-6\">The plaintiffs claim title under a deed from Margaret Harper, now Margaret Gray, devisee in the will of Robert Harper, of date of August 14, 1818.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-7\">The defendants are the children of Margaret Gray, and, in their answer, claim title, not through their mother, who is still living, but directly under said will of Robert Harper; and. while they admit that the title of the plaintiffs is that vested in Margaret Harper, now Gray, by said will, the defendants insist that her estate under the will is but a life estate, and that at her death her children take a fee simple estate directly under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-8\">The plaintiffs claim, that Margaret Harper, under the will, took a fee simple estate subject to be defeated only in case she should die without issue living at her death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-9\">The answer of the defendants contains a copy of the will, of which the following parts are all that bear upon the question in controversy, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-10\">* \u201c <em>Item first. </em>\u2014 I give and bequeath unto my well-beloved wife, Mary Harper, all my personal property, to be at her disposal; also, the use of all the real property during her natural life.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-11\"><em>\u201c Item second. </em>\u2014 I give and bequeath unto my eldest son,.

The words \u201c I give and bequeath unto my youngest-daughter, Margaret Harper, the remaining part of my real property,\u201d in the will, gives Margaret a fee simple estate. That these words in the will, though by the common law of England and of many of the states, would have formed a life estate only, are such as to create a fee simple estate in Margaret, seems not to be controverted; nor could it be disputed in Ohio, with any hope of success. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>8 Ohio Rep. 365; <em>Lessee of Thompson </em>v. Hoop, 6 Ohio St. Rep. 480.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-10\">2. The added words <em>\u201c </em>should Margaret die without any legitimate heirs, her part of my estate shall fall to my eldest son, Matthew,\u201d do not, by the law of Ohio, imply an estate tail in Margaret.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-11\">The claim of the defendants that the will gave Margaret an estate tail, which by the statute of Ohio, became a life estate in her, and a fee in her children, is founded upon the clause, that \u201c should Margaret die without any legitimate heirs, her part should fall to Matthew.\u201d The argument ,of counsel for defendants, labors to show, that \u201c legitimate heirs\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>must in this case be taken to mean \u201c lawful issue,\u201d and that there is implied an estate tail in Margaret, by reason of this phrase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-5\">The interpretation given by defendants\u2019 counsel to the words \u201clegitimate heirs,\u201d is sufficiently correct, but the implication .of an estate tail in Margaret by no means follows. The great-question in all the cases-turning on the phrase, \u201c dying without issue,\u201d and other equivalent expressions, has been, whether <em>an indefinite failure of issue, </em>is implied. That is, whether <em>an estate tail </em>is implied. An <em>indefinite failure of </em>issue, measures an <em>estate tail. </em>So that the simple and only question in such a case is, whether the remainder is limited after an <em>estate tail, </em>or is limited upon an event to take place on the death of the first taker. The general disposition of the English courts to construe wills so as to create estates tail, led them to hold that there was an estate tail implied in all such cases, unless where there were added words showing, that the testator intended to restrict the failure of issue to the death of the first taker. Where there were such added words, the courts saved the remainder over, by holding that no estate tail was created. <em>Pells </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>Cro. Jac. 590; 2 Jarman, 428; <em>Doe ex dem. Bamfield </em>v. <em>Welton, </em>2 B. &amp; P. 327-8; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>3 T. R. 143; <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Jeffery, </em>7 T. R. 589.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-6\">Now, when it is remembered, 1. That the third item of the will of Robert Harper, unaccompanied by other words, by the law of Ohio passes a fee simple to Margaret, with the same certainty as if the words \u201c to her and her heirs \u201d had been used ; and 2. That it has been settled in Ohio, that the words \u201c dying without issue \u201d in a will, mean \u201c dying without issue living at the death of the first taker,\u201d the whole case is clear, in the light of the English, a\u00a1s well as the American decisions, and no implication of an estate tail can arise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-7\">See <em>Doe ex dem. King </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Ald. 546; 9 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. 88, 2 Sim. N. S. 104; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>20 N. Y.

' But in the state of Ohio, there is no such presumption; and the case stands precisely as if there were added words sufficient to rebut it in every case. This court has expressly decided, that the same words, which in England would have implied an estate tail, imply no such thing here. 6 Ohio St. Rep. 578.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-6\">3. If the added words, \u201c should Margaret die without any legitimate heirs, her part of my estate shall fall to my oldest son, Matthew,\u201d imply an estate tail in Margaret, such implication is rebutted by the provision, \u201c I give and bequeath unto my oldest daughter, Jane, fifty dollars, to be paid by Matthew and Margaret, according to the property given them in this will.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-7\">Where a devisee, whose estate is undefined by the express devise, is directed to pay legacies, or a specific sum, he takes an estate in fee; and the fact that actual loss is rendered highly improbable by the disparity in the amount of the sum charged relatively to the value of the land, does not prevent the enlargement of the estate.' 2 Jarman on Wills, 172, and note 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-8\">See also, <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>8 T.

When an estate is devised to a person generally, without words of inheritance, and if the devisee die without heirs, with a limitation over to a collateral heir of the devisee, the first devisee will take only an estate tail, which, under the laws of Ohio, vests a remainder in fee in the issue of the first donee in tail. And this construction is still stronger, when the devise over is upon a failure of <em>legitimate heirs, </em>or equivalent words. 2 Jarman on Wills (Perkins\u2019 ed.) 173; <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>Croke, James, 415, 3 Bulst. 192, 1 Rolle, 398, 436; <em>Bryce </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>Willes, 1, Comyn, 359; <em>Machell </em>v. <em>Weeding, </em>8 Simmons, 4; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>8 Simmons, 22; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>9 East. 382; <em>Butt </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>32 Eng.

When our legislature enacted the statute of Connecticut, regulating entails., the presumption is, that it did so in contemplation, and with approval of the construction and legal effect which had been given to devises under that statute by the highest courts of that state. <em>Paine, Kendall &amp; Co. </em>v <em>Mason, </em>7 Ohio St. Rep. 207.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-4\">5. Whenever a future interest in land is so devised as to fall within the rules laid down for the limitation of contingent remainders, such a devise will be construed as a contingent 'remainder, and not an executory devise. The devise'over to Matthew Harper, in item fourth, of Robert Harper\u2019s will, is such a devise. <em>Purefroy </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>2 Saunders, <em>388; Criley </em>v. Chamberlain, 30 Pa.

It follows from the last proposition, that when there is \u00e1 devise over, after a preceding devise to a person and his heirs even, that if there be any words in the will, by which the first devise can be restrained to mean heirs of the body only the first estate will be construed \"to be an estate tail, and the devise over a remainder. Cruise Dig., tit. 38, chap. 17, sec. 13.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b334-6\">Brinkerhoee, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZC\">Counsel for the defendants have argued \u2022this case, in behalf of their clients, at great length and with \u2022much learning and ingenuity. They contend, in substance, \u2022that the testator, in the use of the words, \u201cshould my youngest daughter, Margaret Harper, die without legitimate heirs,\u201d he did nnimean the same as if he had said, \u201c should my youngest -daughter, Margaret Harper, die without legitimate\u201d children, \u25a0or other descendants, <em>living at the time of her death; </em>but that he <em>did </em>mean that the devise over to his son should take effect -only on what is called an indefinite failure, of issue; or, in \u2022other words, at the time whenever, possibly in the far future, \u25a0\u25a0the line of Margaret\u2019s descendants should become extinct; so that the devise to. Margaret, instead of creating in her a fee simple estate, subject to be defeated by the contingency of -her dying without issue living at the time of her death, was a Revise to Margaret in tail; and so, under the statutes of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>state, vested in her, in effect, but a life estate, and in her immediate issue, an estate in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In the case of <em>Parish\u2019s heirs </em>v. <em>Ferris et </em>al., 6 Ohio St. Rep. 563, it was held, that \u201c when there is a devise in fee to A., but if he \u2018 die without heirs,5 or \u2018 without children,5 or \u2018without issue,5 then to B. in fee, the words, \u2018if he die without issue,5 or words of similar import, are to be interpreted according to their popular and natural meaning, and as referring to the time of the death of A., unless the contrary intention is plainly expressed in the will, or is necessary t&lt;5. carry out its undoubted purposes.55</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">But we are now, in effect, asked to review and overrule that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">We have given the elaborate and really able argument of counsel for defendants in the case before us, the best consideration of which we are capable; and we are unanimously of opinion that the case of <em>Parish </em>v. Ferris, must stand. That case, too, was strongly argued, and maturely considered; and the opinion of the court, delivered in the case, commends itself fully to the approbation of our judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The arbitrary and artificial rule of construction, so long^ prevalent in the English courts, and so inconsiderately adopted .and followed in some of the states of our Union, that such expressions as \u201c dying without issue,55 and the like, meant an indefinite failure of issue, when first adopted in England, could be excused and accounted for, if not justified, on two grounds \u2014 first, that from the very structure of the English government and English society, it was a part of English policy to encourage the perpetuity of family estates; and, second, that there, estates tail were common, prevalent, and familiar to the mind of every testator. Here, on the contrary, the public policy is to'discourage perpetuities, estates tail are utterly unknown to the generality of our people, our laws forbid them, and every presumption is against the supposition of an attempt to create them. But, even in England, the courts again and again \u2014 oppressed Avith a sense of the violence which the rule was constantly doing to the clear and obvious intent of testators \u2014 expressed their regrets that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>they were compelled to yield to its iron mandates, until they were finally relieved from it by act of parliament. So, too, in many of our states, in which the old English rule had been adopted, their legislatures have interfered for its abolition.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">It would be a work of supererogation for us to repeat the argument in favor of the repudiation of the old English rule of interpretation, already so well stated by Swan, J., in <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Ferris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">It is sufficient for us to say, that the arbitrary and artificial \u2022rule of interpretation, contended for by counsel for the defendants in this case, has never become a rule of property in Ohio, and, therefore, we . are at liberty to fall back upon the simple and just inquiry as to what the testator really did mean by the language he has employed. That we are unwilling to adopt a rule regretted by the courts of the country in which it originated, and now abolished by its legislature; a rule which presupposes an intent to contravene the fundamental principles of our governmental and social policy ; and which, with few exceptions, would ignore and subvert the clear and manifest intent of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">On the authority of <em>Parish </em>v. Ferris, then, we hold that the clause of the will of Robert Harper, relating to the limitation o.ver of the devise to his daughter, Margaret, must be considered as if the words, \u201cliving at the time of her death,\u201d were added immediately after the words, \u201c legitimate heirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">It is admitted by counsel on both sides of this case \u2014 and indeed it can not be doubted \u2014 that the words, \u201clegitimate heirs,\u201d as used in this will, signify the same thing as if the testator had said, <em>lawful issue, </em>or <em>legitimate heirs of her body.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Dismissing now, for the present, that clause of the will which provides for a limitation over in case of the death of Margaret without lawful issue living at the time of her death, we go back to the primary devise to Margaret, and inquire what estate she would have taken under the language of the devise, had there been no clause in the will making a limitation over?</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>8 Ohio Rep. 365, it was held that the words, <em>\u201c </em>I also give unto my son, Elijah Berry, the other third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>part of my land,\u201d without words of inheritance, are sufficient in a will to pass an estate of inheritance. So, it was held in <em>Thompson </em>v. Hoop, 6 Ohio St. Rep. 480, that the words, \u201c I do also give and bequeath unto my son, Isaac, the above mentioned plantation,\u201d without words of inheritance, are, in a will, sufficient to pass an estate of inheritance; and that, \u201c no words of perpetuity being essential in a will to pass an estate of inheritance, if the language used as descriptive of the estate be general, and sufficient to comprehend the whole property, without any words of limitation or provision in the will qualifying the interest devised, a fee in the land will pass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">After giving to his son, Matthew, twenty-five acres from off his farm, the testator in this case, says: \u201c I give and bequeath unto my youngest daughter, Margaret Harper, <em>the remaining part of my real </em>property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">On the authority of <em>Smith </em>v. Berry, and <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Hoop, </em>this language, in the absence of other restrictive or qualifying provisions, is clearly sufficient to pass to Margaret, without express words of inheritance, an estate in fee simple; and in legal effect, the words are the same as if the testator had said, \u201cI give and bequeath to my youngest daughter,' Margaret Harper, <em>her heirs and assigns forever, </em>the remaining part of my real property.\u201d And this construction of the primary clause of the will is strengthened by the fact that the testator charges upon Margaret the payment of a share of a pecuniary legacy to his other daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Nor is this construction precluded by the subsequent clause prescribing a limitation over to her brother in ease Margaret should die without issue of her body living at her death; for that clause does not refer at all to the quantity of the estate before devised to Margaret, but simply designates the contingency, on the happening of which, that estate, whatever was its <em>quantum, </em>should pass over to her brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The will of Robert Harper, then, so far as it relates to his daughter Margaret, construed in the light of the cases adjudged in Ohio \u2014 and, as we think, strictly in accordance with the real intent of the testator, as indicated by the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>which he employs \u2014 is, in substance, the same as if it were written thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u201c I give and bequeath to my youngest daughter, Margaret Harper, <em>her heirs and assigns forever, </em>the remaining part of my real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u201cI give and bequeath unto my eldest daughter, Jane Harper, but since married, Jane Davis, if personally herself appearing, fifty dollars, to be paid by my eldest son, Matthew Harper, and my youngest daughter, Margaret Harper, according to the property given them in this my last will. It \u00a1s also to be understood that should my youngest daughter, Margaret Harper, die without any legitimate heirs of her' body <em>living at the time of her death, </em>her. part of my real estate shall fall to my eldest son, Matthew Harper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Now, what is the legal effect of a testamentary disposition couched in this language? We think we are safe in saying, that ever since the case of <em>Pells </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>decided in the reign of James I. (Cro. Jac. 590), it has been the established doctrine in England, that such a devise vests in the primary devisee a determinable fee simple, and not a fee tail; and on the happening of the contingency on which- the fee is to be determined, the estate passes over, not as a remainder, hut by way of executory devise. In that case the devise was \u201cto Thomas and his heirs forever; and if Thomas died without issue, living William, then to William.\u201d This was held to be a devise in fee to Thomas, and not an estate tail; the words \u201c living William/\u2019 were thought sufficient to make the devise over to William an executory devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>3 T. R. 143, the will was to my son Philip, in fee; but in case he \u201c shall happen to die, leaving no issue behind him,\u201d then to his wife for life, and after, to , his son James. Kenyon, C.J., said, \u201c The general rules respecting limitations of this sort, have been for many yehrs well settled. The first question that arises in this case is, whether this is an estate tail, or in fee ? The first part of the devise to Philip, <em>prima facie, </em>carries a .fee ; for it is to him, his heirs, and assigns forever; but it is clear, that these words may be restrained by subsequent ones so as to carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>only an estate tail. And a long string of cases may be cited\u00bb in order to show that where an estate is limited to a man and his heirs forever, and if he die without leaving heirs, then to his brother, or to any person who may be his heir; those words shall not have their full legal operation, but shall be restrained to heirs of a particular kind, namely, <em>heirs of the body. </em>If the subsequent part of this devise had been, \u2018 and in case he shall die without issue, then over,\u2019 it would have given to Philip an estate tail, which he might have barred by the recovery.\u201d And so it would, under the construction of the words, \u201c die without issue,\u201d then prevalent in England, but since changed by act of parliament there, and never adopted here. He adds: \u201cBut here the words are, \u2018but in case he shall happen to die, leaving no issue behind him;\u2019 which makes a material difference, and brings it within the case of <em>Pells </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>which is the foundation, and, as it were-, th\u00e9 <em>magna eharta </em>of this branch of the law. This question arose soon after executory devises were first taken notice of, which was in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. And that doctrine has never been since doubted by the court of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">Anything approaching to a particular notice, in this opinion, of all the cases, English and American, bearing upon this- question, would be tedious, and would devolve upon us an amount of labor which, in view of other duties, we can hardly be expected to perform. We, therefore, content ourselves with citing a few. <em>Doe ex dem. King </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Aid. 546; and <em>Ex parte Davies, etc., </em>9 E. L. &amp; E. 88\u2014a case very closely in point, and decided in 1851-2. In the case of <em>Abbot </em>v. <em>Essex Company, </em>decided in 1855 (18 Howard, 202), this question was before the supreme court of the United States. In that case, the following was the clause of the will: \u201cI give to my two sons, viz., John and Jacob, all my lands, etc., live stock, etc., tools, etc., bonds, etc.,- to be equally divided between them, and the executor is ordered to pay debts out of that part of the estate. <em>Item. </em>\u2014 It is my will that if either of my said sons, John and Jacob, should happen to die without any lawful heirs of their own, then the share of him who may first decease, shall accrue to the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>survivor and his heirs.\u201d And it was unanimously held, that this \u201cgave an estate in fee simple to John and Jacob; and the share of the one who first died without issue, passed over to the other son by way of executory devise.\u201d See, also, <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Roach, </em>32 Miss. Rep. 481, where the subject is discussed at great length, and with much learning and acumen.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Among the courts of the different states of this Union, while varying constructions have been placed upon the words \u201c dying without issue,\u201d \u201c dying without heirs,\u201d \u201c dying without children,\u201d and the like \u2014 some adhering to the old English construction, and holding them to mean an indefinite failure of issue, and others, either in obedience to statutory mandate or otherwise, repudiating that construction, hold them to mean a definite failure of issue, that is, a failure of issue living at the death of the first devisee \u2014 with the single exception of the courts of Connecticut, we believe the cases are uniform and without exception in support of the doctrine, that where the words of the will clearly import a devise to the primary devisee <em>and his heirs general, </em>and in case of his death without issue living at the time of his death, the primary devisee takes a fee simple, subject only to be determined by the happening of the definite failure of issue provided for. And the cases in Connecticut, we can not follow; because, first, they are exceptional \u2014 opposed to the general current of authority; and, second, because their rules of construction, if followed, would, as we think, be far less likely to effectuate the actual intentions of testators; which, so far as may be, consistently with public policy, is, or ought to be, the leading object in the construction of all testamentary instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">If we are right in these conclusions, the children of Margaret Harper have no proper claim against the plaintiffs, who hold the lands devised'to Margaret under a conveyance from her; and they are entitled to be quieted in their title as against such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Judgment for plaintiffs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-8\">Scott. C.J., and Sutliee, Peck, and Gholson, J J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
