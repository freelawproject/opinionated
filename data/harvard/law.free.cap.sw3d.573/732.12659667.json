Father raises four points on appeal. He maintains that the trial court erred in: (1) awarding custody pursuant to Mother's parenting plan without considering his plan; (2) calculating child support; (3) dividing the marital assets and awarding maintenance and attorneys' fees to Mother; and (4) failing to consider Father's motion for a new trial.

Thus, Father's statement of facts does not comply with Rule 84.04(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, Father's points relied on are deficient. Where, as here, an appellate court is asked to review the decision of a trial court, \"each point shall (A) [i]dentify the trial court ruling or action that the appellant challenges; (B) [s]tate concisely the legal reasons for the appellant's claim of reversible error; and (C) [e]xplain in summary fashion why, in the context of the case, those legal reasons support the claim of reversible error.\" Rule 84.04(d)(1). \"The point shall be in substantially the following form: 'The trial court erred in [\n   <em>\n    identify the challenged ruling or action\n   </em>\n   ], because [\n   <em>\n    state the legal reasons for the claim of reversible error\n   </em>\n   ], in that [\n   <em>\n    explain why the legal reasons, in the context of the case, support the claim of reversible error\n   </em>\n   ].' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6941660\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/431/524/#p525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Father's points do not conform to Rule 84.04(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although each point identifies the trial court ruling challenged, each point fails to cite legal reasons supporting Father's claims of reversible error. In addition, the points are not substantially in the form required by Rule 84.04(d)(1). \"The purpose of the points relied on is 'to give notice to the opposing party of the precise matters which must be contended\n   with and to inform the court of the issues presented for review.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656452,12656453\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/546/624/\">\n    546 S.W.3d at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Treaster v.

App. W.D. 2009) ). As this court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Compliance with Rule 84.04 briefing requirements is mandatory in order to ensure that appellate courts do not become advocates by speculating on facts and on arguments that have not been made. Deficient points relied on force the appellate court to search the argument portion of the brief or the record itself to determine and clarify the appellant's assertions, thereby wasting judicial resources, and, worse yet, creating the danger that the appellate court will interpret the appellant's contention differently than the appellant intended or his opponent understood.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 627-28 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Treaster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297469\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/297/94/#p95\">\n    297 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   95 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because Father did not articulate the legal reasons for the alleged errors or explain how those legal reasons support his claims, he failed to give Mother notice of the \"precise matters which must be contended with and to inform the court of the issues presented for review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297469\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/297/94/#p95\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Treaster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297469\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/297/94/#p95\">\n    297 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   95 ). Thus, to address Father's alleged errors we would have to search the argument section of his brief and the record to \"refin[e] and supplement[ ] [his] points.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 626 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6941660\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/431/524/#p525\">\n    431 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   525 ). \"It is improper for us 'to speculate as to the point being raised by the appellant and the supporting legal justification and circumstances.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6941660\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/431/524/#p525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6941660\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/431/524/#p525\">\n    at 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Summers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876436\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/922/#p923\">\n    459 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   923 ). And doing so would create \"the danger that [we] will interpret [Father's] contention[s] differently than [he] intended or [Mother] understood.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876436\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/922/#p923\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Treaster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297469\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/297/94/#p95\">\n    297 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   95 ). Thus, Father's points relied on do not comply with Rule 84.04(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third, the argument portion of Father's brief contains several deficiencies. Under Rule 84.04(e), a brief must include an argument section that discusses the points relied on. \"Points that are not developed in the argument are deemed to be abandoned.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297469\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/297/94/#p95\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"To develop a point relied on, the 'argument should show how the principles of law and the facts of the case interact.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297469\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/297/94/#p95\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6941660\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/431/524/#p525\">\n    431 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   526 ). To the extent we can decipher Father's argument, it contains mostly argumentative allegations and conclusory statements. Although Father cites a few cases involving custody, disposition of marital property, and maintenance, he does not compare the facts or apply the legal principles of those cases to the present case. \"Mere conclusions and the failure to develop an argument with support from legal authority preserve nothing for review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6941660\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/431/524/#p525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nicol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6792638\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/491/266/#p268\">\n    491 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   271 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Specifically, with respect to Point I (custody), Father claims that the trial court neglected to make the findings required by \u00a7 452.375.6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He then proceeds to make unsupported factual assertions that he claims should have led the court to approve a different, yet unspecified, custody arrangement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Father's first\n   point relied on faults the trial court for failing to consider his parenting plan, yet he did not submit a parenting plan to the trial court, and he does not indicate how his plan would differ from the one presented by Mother and approved by the trial court. As for Point II, Father's argument consists of one paragraph containing an unsupported conclusion that the trial court relied on inaccurate information in determining child support and demanding a new trial as a result of the alleged error. And Father's arguments relative to Point III (maintenance, marital assets, and attorneys' fees)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Point IV (motion for new trial)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   consist of more unsupported factual assertions. Thus, Father's argument fails to meet the requirements of Rule 84.04(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Other briefing deficiencies include the lack of a \"concise statement describing whether the error[s] w[ere] preserved for appellate review; if so, how [they] w[ere] preserved; and the applicable standard of review.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 84.04(e). Finally, Father does not provide citations to the record on appeal for the factual assertions he makes in his argument, in violation of Rule 84.04(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Occasionally, where an appellant's argument is readily understandable, non-compliant briefs are reviewed\n   <em>\n    ex gratia.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Kim v.

We decline to conduct such review here because Father's claims are not readily understandable. \"While the preference is to decide an appeal on the merits, where[, as here,] a brief is so defective as to require the appellate court and opposing counsel to hypothesize about the appellant's argument and precedential support for it, the merits cannot be reached.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905987\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/443/29/#p31\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lattimer v.
