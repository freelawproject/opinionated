Meyers III, alleging breach of contract for a covenant not to compete, tortious interference with existing contract, and violations of the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act. At trial, the trial court granted a directed verdict on Diligent's trade secrets claim. The jury found liability and awarded damages on Diligent's remaining claims. After trial, the trial court granted Meyers's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on Diligent's tortious interference claim. In three issues on appeal, Diligent challenges the trial court's directed verdict on its trade secrets claim and its judgment notwithstanding the verdict on its tortious interference claim. In three issues on cross-appeal, BOC Trucking argues the evidence is insufficient to support the jury's determination of lost profits, the covenant not to compete is too broad to be enforceable, and the covenant not to compete is not ancillary to an otherwise enforceable agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We affirm, in part, and reverse and render, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Diligent is a transportation logistics company. It acts as a broker between companies that need freight transported and carrier companies to transport the freight. BOC Trucking is a freight transporting company. Meyers is the president and majority owner of BOC Trucking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February of 2013, Diligent and BOC Trucking entered into a broker-carrier agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Diligent would use BOC Trucking as one of the carriers when Diligent's clients needed freight transported. BOC Trucking agreed, as part of the contract, not to attempt to divert the business of any client of Diligent's to any competitor of Diligent for the duration of the contract and for two years after BOC Trucking's last contact with any client of Diligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ameriforge was one of Diligent's clients. Diligent arranged for BOC Trucking to transport some of Ameriforge's transport. About ten months after BOC Trucking began transporting Ameriforge's freight, Meyers formed a sole-proprietor logistics company. He used the name BOC Logistics as an assumed name for his work. BOC Logistics obtained Ameriforge as a client and used BOC Trucking to transport its freight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April of 2015, Diligent filed suit against BOC Trucking and Meyers. It asserted claims of breach of contract against BOC Trucking, tortious interference with existing contract against Meyers, and violations of the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act against both BOC Trucking and Meyers. The case went to trial. At the close of the evidence BOC Trucking and Meyers moved for a directed verdict on Diligent's trade secrets claim. Diligent asserted it had presented evidence that BOC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Trucking and Meyers obtained Diligent's pricing information for Ameriforge and used that information for BOC Logistics to undercut Diligent's pricing. The trial court disagreed that such evidence was in the record and granted a directed verdict on the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The jury found BOC Trucking liable for breach of contract and Meyers liable for tortious interference with existing contracts. After trial, Meyers moved for a directed verdict for the jury's questions regarding liability and damages for the tortious interference claim. For liability, Meyers argued that, because he was an agent of BOC Trucking, he could only be found to have interfered with BOC Trucking's contract with Diligence if Diligence established that Meyers's actions were so contrary to BOC Trucking's interests that Meyers could only have been motivated by personal interests. Meyers argued that there was no such evidence in the record and that, accordingly, he was entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the claim. The trial court agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Diligent filed a notice of appeal of its claims against Meyers. In its brief, Diligent indicated that BOC Trucking had filed for bankruptcy. We stayed the appeal, pending the bankruptcy. After we received notice that the bankruptcy case had closed, we reinstated this appeal. After the appeal was reinstated, BOC Trucking filed a notice of appeal, which we held was timely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Breach of Non-Solicitation Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its second issue on cross-appeal, BOC Trucking argues the trial court erred by denying its motion to reform or void the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Under the terms of the covenant not to compete, then, the covenant lasts for two years after BOC Trucking's last contact with any client of Diligent, regardless of whether BOC Trucking had had any previous interactions with them and regardless of whether the interaction was during or after the agreement.

Second, Meyers necessarily performed the actions about which Diligent complains in his capacity as agent for BOC Trucking. To establish its claim, Diligent presented evidence that Meyers decided both to breach the agreement with Diligent and to use his own logistics company instead.

The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [Diligent's Attorney]: The evidence as to trade secret was Mr. Carter's testimony that the contact information with the clients, including Ameriforge, pricing information and the kinds of logistics needs that they have are confidential and not readily available to the public, which is certainly enough evidence to submit the question to the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   THE COURT: What is your evidence of use of the trade secret?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [Diligent's Attorney]: If you look at Exhibits 4 and 5, you will see that they undercut our pricing, and I plan to go through that in my closing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   THE COURT: How do you link up the pricing with Mr. Meyers when Mr. Meyers testified that as a carrier -- well, actually, Mr. Carter testified that carriers weren't privy to pricing information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [Diligent's Attorney]: Correct. But Mr. Meyers testified that he had discussed our contract with Ameriforge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and so the implication is that he got information on pricing and used that to undercut us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   THE COURT: Yeah, I'm uncertain that the jury has anything to base a finding on in that regard, in terms of evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Diligent's theory for misappropriation, then, was that Meyers had obtained Diligent's pricing information for Ameriforge and used it to undercut Diligent. On appeal, Diligent argues it presented sufficient evidence of misappropriation: \"Meyers executed the Agreement knowing it prevented back solicitation but formed BOC Logistics and began brokering loads for Ameriforge. This constitutes improper\n   means as Meyers breached BOC Trucking's obligation to limit the use of this information.\" The jury found that BOC Trucking breached the no-solicitation provision of its contract with Diligent.

In contrast, courts cannot award damages for breach of a covenant not to compete that is not reasonable. BUS. &amp; COM. \u00a7 15.51(c). Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's award of damages on Diligent's breach of contract claim. The contract that formed the basis of Diligent's breach of contract claim allowed the prevailing party in a suit to recover attorneys' fees and costs. Because Diligent is no longer the prevailing party in this suit, the awards of attorneys' fees and costs must also be reversed.
