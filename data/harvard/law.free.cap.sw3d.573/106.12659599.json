Betty Williams also appeals from the circuit court's judgment allowing the public administrator to collect her attorneys' fees from the estate of Virgil Williams. We affirm the circuit court's judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts &amp; Procedure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November of 2015, the Circuit Court of Andrew County declared Virgil Williams (Virgil)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   totally incapacitated and disabled as a result of Alzheimer's-related dementia, alcohol abuse, and poor short-term memory. At that time, the circuit court had before it competing petitions for the appointment of a guardian and conservator: one filed by Virgil's wife, Betty Williams (Betty); one filed by Virgil's son, Ricky Williams (Ricky), and daughter-in-law, Linda Williams (Linda); and one filed by Virgil's other son, Jeffrey Williams (Jeff). Betty requested that the public administrator be appointed to serve as Virgil's guardian and conservator; Jeff requested that he be appointed to serve in that role; and Ricky and Linda petitioned to be appointed as co-guardians and conservators. After hearing the evidence, the circuit court appointed Ricky and Linda to serve as co-guardians and conservators for Virgil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January of 2016, Ricky died. Thereafter, while Linda served as his sole guardian and conservator, Virgil was placed in Oak Pointe of Kearney Senior Living skilled nursing facility. Virgil's daughter, Kim Bauman (Bauman), then petitioned the circuit court for Linda's removal and filed an application to be appointed as his guardian and conservator. While Bauman was not appointed, Virgil's family members arrived at a compromise wherein (1) Virgil would be moved to the Shady Lawn nursing facility in Savannah, Missouri; (2) Linda would be removed from her role as his guardian and conservator; and (3) the public administrator would be appointed to serve as his guardian and conservator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In September of 2016, Linda was removed and the public administrator, Janet Rosenauer (Rosenauer), was appointed as Virgil's successor guardian and conservator. In September of 2017, Betty filed a motion in the circuit court alleging, among other things, that Rosenauer had placed unjust limitations on her and Bauman's visitation with Virgil and prevented her from obtaining Virgil's medical information or participating in his medical decision making. The motion requested that Rosenauer be removed as Virgil's guardian and that Betty and Bauman be appointed as co-guardians. On the same day, Betty filed a separate motion to terminate Rosenauer as Virgil's conservator, alleging as the basis for this motion that Rosenauer had mismanaged and failed to protect and preserve Virgil's funds and assets. This motion also requested that Betty and Bauman be appointed as co-conservators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A trial was held on Betty's motions in November of 2017 and January of 2018. Evidence was provided by Virgil's children and children-in-law; a family friend of Virgil and Betty; Shady Lawn's medical staff; Rosenauer; and Virgil's guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   , John Brage. Bauman testified that Rosenauer had limited the number of visits allowed for Virgil's family members and required visits to be supervised; limited the family to one outing with Virgil per family member per month; limited each family member to one ten-minute phone call per day; and ordered the family not to take Virgil to visit his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Letters written by Rosenauer were introduced in support of Bauman's testimony. In her letters, Rosenauer explained that Virgil's dementia prevented him from understanding or handling problems and complaints brought to him by his family members. She further explained that overstimulation\n   caused Virgil to become combative and made him try to escape from the nursing home. Rosenauer urged the family to maintain a positive attitude in Virgil's company, not to complain about other family members, not to complain about Shady Lawn, and not to tell Virgil that he would be returning to his home. She warned that she would \"not tolerate people upsetting Virgil.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rosenauer elicited testimony from Virgil's children and children-in-law regarding a history of dissension among the family members that made the appointment of the public administrator necessary. Linda testified that, following Ricky's death, Betty told Linda that she was not a part of the family and then severed ties with Linda as well as Linda's children and grandchildren. When Linda would not agree to allow Bauman to serve as co-guardian and conservator, Bauman became irate and had to be restrained by Betty. Betty's sale of the family farm to Bauman's children in 2013, rather than to one of Betty's sons who had expressed interest in purchasing it, created hard feelings among the family and contributed to their estrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his trial testimony, Virgil's guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   noted that Betty needed assistance with her own finances, and recommended that Rosenauer continue to serve as Virgil's guardian and conservator. He did not believe Bauman should serve in that role, as he had \"concern about the dynamics between the siblings creating problems down the road....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the conclusion of the trial, the circuit court determined that there was insufficient evidence to remove Rosenauer from her position as Virgil's guardian and conservator. The circuit court further found that Rosenauer had incurred attorneys' fees during the course of the litigation involving Betty and allowed these fees to be taxed against Virgil's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Betty timely appeals from the circuit court's judgments denying her motion for Rosenauer's removal and allowing Rosenauer's attorneys' fees to be paid out of Virgil's funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Betty makes three points on appeal. She argues (1) that the circuit court erred, because its judgment allowing Rosenauer to continue as Virgil's guardian and conservator was not supported by substantial evidence and was against the weight of the evidence, because the evidence demonstrated that Betty and Bauman were competent to serve as Virgil's co-guardians and co-conservators, and that Rosenauer's continued service in that capacity therefore exceeded her statutory authority as public administrator; (2) that the circuit court's judgment declining to remove Rosenauer as Virgil's guardian and conservator was against the weight of the evidence in that Rosenauer had failed to act in Virgil's best interests; and (3) that the circuit court misapplied the law in allowing Rosenauer's attorneys' fees to be taxed against Virgil's estate. Finding no error, we affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"A court-tried probate case is reviewed under the standard of\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

App. 1901).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Betty concedes that Rosenauer's appointment was necessary in 2016 in order to facilitate Virgil's transfer from Kearney to Savannah; but argues that Rosenauer's continued appointment is now unnecessary because Virgil no longer drinks alcohol (making it easier for his family to attend to his needs) and because he has been successfully relocated to a nursing facility closer to Betty's and Bauman's homes. Betty argues that (if the guardianship and conservatorship were to continue) she and Bauman would be \"competent\" to serve, making the service of the Public Administrator unnecessary and beyond the scope of her duties; and that either Betty or Bauman, or both of them, should have been named as Virgil's successor guardian and conservator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In support, Betty cites \u00a7 473.730, which provides the qualifications of a public administrator to take office, and states nothing with respect to whether and when a public administrator may be appointed as guardian or conservator. Since there has been no challenge to Rosenauer's status as the duly elected public administrator, the application of \u00a7 473.730 does not support Betty's challenge to Rosenauer's appointment as Virgil's guardian and conservator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Betty also cites \u00a7 473.743,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   It shall be the duty of the public administrator to take into his or her charge and custody the estates of all deceased persons, and the person and estates of all minors, and the estates or person and estate of all incapacitated persons in his or her county, in the following cases:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (8) The estates or person and estate of all disabled or incapacitated persons in his or her county who have no legal guardian or conservator,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and no one competent to take charge of such estate, or to act as such guardian or conservator, can be found, or is known to the court having jurisdiction, who will qualify\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Betty cites no precedent in support of her position that \u00a7\u00a7 473.730 and 473.743 set the standard to determine whether and when to remove the public administrator who had been appointed guardian and conservator and substitute a family member as successor guardian and conservator of an incompetent adult. In fact, case law indicates that, although \u00a7 473.743 empowers the public administrator to serve where there is no other guardian or conservator and \"no one competent to take charge of the estate or act as guardian will qualify,\" this language does not state a\n   statutory preference for the appointment of family members.\n   <em>\n    Roots v.

App. W.D. 2003) (when reviewing a trial court's decision whether to remove a guardian and/or conservator, \"the question for [the appellate court] is whether th[e] record supports a finding by the Court 'that the guardian or conservator is not discharging his duties and responsibilities as required by this code, or is not acting in the best interests of the ward of [sic] protectee.' \") (quoting \u00a7 475.082.5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Rosenauer did not exceed her duties enumerated under \u00a7\u00a7 473.743 and 473.730 ; and those sections do not provide a basis for her removal and the substitution of family members as Virgil's guardian and conservator. Point I is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In her second point, Betty argues that the judgment of the circuit declining to remove Rosenauer was against the weight of the evidence, because she took actions that were not in the best interests of Virgil, in that she failed to appropriately manage some of his assets, and she limited interaction between him and his family that caused his residential placement to be more restrictive than necessary. Section 475.082.5 allows the circuit court to remove a guardian or conservator upon finding that he or she \"is not discharging his or her duties and responsibilities as required by this code or is not acting in the best interests of the ward or protectee....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, Betty complains about Rosenauer's handling of certain assets. Virgil (who is a musician) asked Jeff to return to Virgil one of Virgil's guitars (valued between\n   $ 3,000 and $ 5,000). Jeff believed that his sister, Bauman, had pressured Virgil to demand the guitar's return and reported the incident to Rosenauer. Rosenauer instructed Jeff to deliver the guitar to her. Rosenauer kept the guitar for some time, and then returned it to Jeff's possession. At trial, Rosenauer acknowledged that although Jeff had possession of the guitar, it remained the property of a trust owned by Virgil and Betty. No evidence has been presented to suggest that Jeff was authorized to dispose of the guitar or otherwise convert property of the estate; and no harm to Virgil or the estate has been shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Betty also argues that Rosenauer failed to act in Virgil's best interest by being dilatory in her efforts to change the listed beneficiaries on Virgil's life insurance policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rosenauer (appointed on September 1, 2016) testified at trial that she was made aware of the problem with the policy in December of 2016. In her Motion to Determine Property Interests filed in May of 2017, Rosenauer requested that the circuit court enter an order changing the beneficiary of any life insurance policy held by Virgil, naming the estate as the beneficiary, so that the proceeds could be used to pay his final expenses with the remaining balance to go to his wife, Betty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the end of the first day of trial (November 13, 2017) the parties agreed that the change in beneficiary should be ordered, and a week later the circuit court entered an order designating the \"Estate of Virgil D. Williams\" as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy. Therefore it appears that Rosenauer did seek to change the beneficiary, that this was completed, and that the estate suffered no prejudice by any purported delay in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, Betty argues that the limitations Rosenauer placed on the family's ability to visit with Virgil were overly restrictive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Virgil's guardian, Rosenauer is \"accorded substantial discretion in making decisions relating to [Virgil's] daily life and routine.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Posey v. Bergin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297082,7297027\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/299/6/\">\n    299 S.W.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 23 (Mo. App. E.D. 2009). Restrictions imposed by a guardian on a ward's visitation and communication privileges with friends and family members may (even though they displease the ward) be in the ward's best interests, particularly where the guardian had \"considered a great deal of [the ward's] history\" and the restrictions reflect the guardian's \"obvious concerns for his health and well being....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297082,7297027\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/299/6/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The circuit court does not err in declining to \"interject itself in the details of the day-to-day decisions made by [the guardian]....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297082,7297027\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/299/6/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Rosenauer's letters to Virgil's family members reflect her concern that family members were complaining to Virgil about the care he was receiving at the nursing home, and that they were encouraging Virgil to pack up his belongings and implying that he would be going home soon. Rosenauer continuously exhorted the family to remain positive while visiting with Virgil and to refrain from complaining about other family members as Virgil's weakened mental condition prevented him from understanding the family's problems. Rosenauer was particularly concerned about the family's habit of taking Virgil to visit his old home, which she believed caused him to become confused as to why he could not stay there permanently or how he ended up in a nursing home. The restrictions imposed by Rosenauer in the case at bar were similar to those imposed in\n   <em>\n    Posey\n   </em>\n   , and appear similarly justified. The evidence presented at trial indicated that the decisions Rosenauer made regarding Virgil's telephone and visitation privileges were calculated to serve his best interests by keeping him content with his living arrangements. The circuit court did not err when it declined to \"interject itself in the details of the day-to-day decisions made by\" Rosenauer.\n   <em>\n    Posey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297082,7297027\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/299/6/\">\n    299 S.W.3d at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Furthermore, Virgil's guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   (who had served in that capacity in all of the contested proceedings) indicated that he had not observed any mismanagement by Rosenauer. He was not aware of any violations of her responsibility as guardian and conservator, and recommended that she continue to serve in that capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying Betty's motion to remove the public administrator as Virgil's guardian and conservator. Because we are not firmly convinced that the judgment of the circuit court declining to remove Rosenauer was wrong, the judgment was not against the weight of the evidence. Point II is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In her third point, Betty argues that the circuit court erred in allowing Rosenauer to collect $ 36,600.58 in attorneys' fees from Virgil's estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the hearing on Rosenauer's attorneys' fees,\n   Betty specifically noted that she was \"not arguing that the fee of the hourly rate of $ 200 per hour or even the combined hourly rate of $ 400 per hour [was] necessarily or inherently unreasonable.\" On appeal, Betty does not challenge the reasonableness of the fees in light of the services rendered. Therefore the only issues before this court regarding the award of attorneys' fees are whether the amount of the fees was disproportionate to the size of the estate (allegedly totaling $ 40,890.97), and whether the fees were unnecessary in light of the fact that a guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   had been appointed to represent Virgil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Under \u00a7 475.130.1, a conservator is required to \"protect, preserve and manage the [protectee's] estate ... us[ing] the degree of care, skill and prudence which an ordinarily prudent person uses in managing the property of, and conducting transactions on behalf of, others.\" Section 475.265 provides that the guardian and conservator may be compensated \"for necessary expenses in the administration of his trust,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     including reasonable attorney fees if the employment of an attorney for the particular purpose is necessary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Legal services are not infrequently necessary for the protection of the assets of an estate in the hands of an administrator or guardian, and when this is the case it has been repeatedly held in this state that such services are for the benefit of the estate, and that the attorney who rendered them may look to the trustee for his fee, or may present his claim to the probate court, and that that court has jurisdiction to allow the fee as a charge directly against the assets of the estate as expense of administration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Grove v.

Prior to trial, Rosenauer filed with the circuit court her annual settlement of Virgil's estate for the period running from September 1, 2016, to September 1, 2017. The settlement provided information concerning the size and productiveness of Virgil's estate, including an itemization of receipts and disbursements for the relevant period. The circuit court also had before it detailed invoices from Rosenauer's attorneys, which allowed it to assess the nature and difficulty of the services performed. After reviewing the time records submitted by Rosenauer's attorneys, the circuit court deducted thirty hours which it deemed to be duplicative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   It is unfortunate that so much of Virgil's estate has been depleted by the costs of the present litigation. However, Rosenauer, as Virgil's guardian, had an affirmative duty to promote and protect his welfare, as well as his estate. \u00a7\u00a7 475.120.3(3), 475.130.1. Since the circuit court has concluded (and we have affirmed) that there was no basis to remove Rosenauer as Virgil's guardian, it would certainly be reasonable to expect Rosenauer to hire counsel to defend against the motions seeking her ouster. \"We presume an award of attorneys' fees to be correct, and the complaining party has the burden to prove otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

Betty discusses the duties of a guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   and the authority to pay the guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   's attorney's fees, but cites no authority that a guardian and conservator's attorneys' fees cannot also be paid from the estate, and we therefore consider that proposition abandoned.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Motions for removal of a guardian or conservator are not governed by \u00a7\u00a7 475.060 and 475.061. Thus, even were we to conclude that Betty's motions were \"so lacking in compliance with section 475.060 as to amount to a failure to give the court jurisdiction,\" a finding we do not make, this would still not dispose of the issue of whether Rosenauer should have been removed from her role as Virgil's guardian and conservator.

The annual settlement filed by Rosenauer prior to trial provided the circuit court with a detailed accounting of Virgil's estate. The motions filed by Betty together with the trial testimony provided by Bauman provided the circuit court with evidence of their willingness to serve as his guardians and conservators. Whether the circuit court had authority to consider Betty and Bauman's applications for appointment remains less clear, but, in light of our disposition of the other arguments, is something we need not address.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    \"[A] claim that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence presupposes that there is sufficient evidence to support the judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     Ivie v.
