Similarly, the Commission's decision is the only decision attached to Appellant's notice of appeal. Accordingly, Appellant identified the Commission's decision as the only decision for which review is sought, and our review on appeal is confined to that decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6835998\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/472/219/#p229\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Rule 100.2(c). However, Appellant's brief does not discuss Appellant's proceedings before the Commission and fails to assert a claim on appeal challenging the Commission's decision. Instead, Appellant's brief solely refers to a separate civil case that she apparently brought against her former employer alleging workplace discrimination and harassment claims although that purported judgment is not mentioned in her notice of appeal. In particular, the sections of Appellant's brief containing the statement of the case, procedural history, argument, and conclusion, as well as the relief requested by Appellant, all pertain to this separate civil case. Because Appellant fails to reference or attach a judgment, decree, or order related to her civil action in her notice of appeal, and because we are confined only to reviewing the Commission's decision but Appellant's brief does not assert a claim on appeal challenging that decision, Appellant has failed to preserve anything for our review and her appeal must be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    B.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656578\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/547/785/#p788\">\n    547 S.W.3d at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (similarly finding the appellant's claim must be dismissed under Rule 81.04(a) because it related to an order not attached to her notice of appeal).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Further compelling our decision that dismissal is necessary in this case, we find Appellant has failed to comply with\n   the mandatory briefing requirements of Rule 84.04.

Although our Court prefers to dispose of a case on the merits whenever possible, we must dismiss the appeal if the deficiencies in the appellant's brief are such that no claims are preserved for appellate review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656310\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/545/377/#p379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant's brief fails to comply with Rule 84.04 in multiple respects. Rule 84.04(a)(4) requires an appellant's brief to include the points relied on in the appeal. Rule 84.04(a)(4). Further, Rule 84.04(d)(2) sets forth the specific requirements for each point relied on.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 84.04(d)(2)(A-C). In this case, Appellant's brief did not include any points relied on, much less a point relied on that satisfied the requirements of Rule 84.04(d)(2). As such, Appellant has wholly failed to comply with Rules 84.04(a)(4) and 84.04(d)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 84.04(a)(4) ; Rule 84.04(d)(2)(A-C);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prock v.

App. S.D. 2012) (an issue not set forth in a point relied on is not preserved for appellate review). Additionally, Appellant's brief fails to comply with Rule 84.04(e), which provides the requirements for the argument portion of an appellant's brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 84.04(e) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656310\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/545/377/#p379\">\n    545 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   380 ;\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

We find Appellant's argument fails to comply with Rule 84.04(e) in that it,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , fails to describe whether the alleged errors were preserved and does not advise our Court how the facts of Appellant's case and the principles of law interact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 84.04(e) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095151\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/391/532/#p533\">\n    391 S.W.3d at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Similarly, Rule 100.02(c), providing the requirements for a notice of appeal when an appeal is taken from an administrative agency, requires an appellant to specify \"the decision sought to be reviewed[.]\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rule 100.02(c). Because the requirement in Rule 81.04(a) has been interpreted to limit an appellate court's review solely to the trial court decision(s) identified in the notice of appeal, we find the same requirement in Rule 100.02(c) would likewise limit our review to the administrative agency decision(s) identified in the notice of appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rule 100.02(c) ; Rule 81.04(a) ;\n    <em>\n     B.P.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656578\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/547/785/#p788\">\n     547 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    788 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6835998\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/472/219/#p229\">\n     472 S.W.3d at 229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Although Missouri courts have been lenient with respect to an appellant's failure to specify the decision sought to be reviewed when the lack of specificity does not prejudice the other party,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6835998\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/472/219/#p229\">\n     472 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    229 and\n    <em>\n     Hoenig\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11599597\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/983/526/#p528\">\n     983 S.W.2d at 528\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , we do not consider leniency warranted under the circumstances of this case. Here, we find the Division of Employment Security (\"Respondent\") would be prejudiced if we were to review Appellant's claim arising from her civil case because there is no indication Respondent was a party to this separate action and none of the filings or court orders related to it have been made a part of our record on appeal. Further, Respondent's brief does not discuss Appellant's civil case, as it focuses solely on the Commission's decision to deny Appellant unemployment benefits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
