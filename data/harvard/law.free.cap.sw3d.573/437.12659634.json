In what Wheeler and the State both declare is an issue of first impression, we are asked to decide whether the good-faith exception to the statutory exclusionary rule allows admission of this evidence even though it was obtained in violation of the Texas Constitution's oath requirement. Under the singular facts of this case, we conclude that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. THE ARREST\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts surrounding Wheeler's arrest and the issuance of the search warrant are largely undisputed. On July 9, 2016, Officer Tyler Bonner, who at the time had worked for the Pantego Police Department (Pantego) for one year and two months,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   responded to a report that a driver was asleep behind the wheel of an idling car in the drive-through lane of a fast-food restaurant. Bonner arrived, woke the driver up, and noted that he appeared intoxicated. The driver, identified as Wheeler, refused to perform any field-sobriety tests but told Bonner that he had \"consumed 4 beers.\" Bonner arrested Wheeler and drove him to the police department to get a search warrant for Wheeler's blood after Wheeler refused to supply a sample.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. THE SEARCH WARRANT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pantego routinely prepares premade packets that include several fill-in-the-blank forms: an affidavit for a search warrant, a search warrant, an order to execute the warrant, and a return. The affidavit form includes a recital that the \"undersigned Affiant, a peace officer ..., and after first being duly sworn, on oath makes the following statements and accusations.\" Bonner filled out the affidavit form, supplying the probable-cause facts that he believed supported the issuance of a search warrant for a compelled sample of Wheeler's blood. These facts included that Wheeler had a moderate odor of alcohol and that his speech was slurred and confused. Bonner signed the affidavit, affirming that it was sworn by his oath, and dated the jurat on the affidavit. Bonner then gave the packet to the dispatcher who called the magistrate and electronically sent the packet to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The magistrate, Sara Jane Del Carmen, knew that the arrangement of Pantego's office space dictated that the requesting officer physically hand the packet documents to the dispatcher who would then electronically forward the packet. When Del Carmen received Bonner's packet, she reviewed the affidavit, determined that probable cause had been established, and electronically signed the affidavit's dated jurat and the warrant. The jurat provided: \"Subscribed and sworn to before me on this\n   <em>\n    9\n   </em>\n   day of\n   <em>\n    July\n   </em>\n   , 20\n   <em>\n    16\n   </em>\n   , by an official authorized to administer and authorize this oath pursuant to TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 602.002.\" Del Carmen did not notice that Bonner's affidavit, unlike other affidavits she had seen from Pantego officers, did not have another officer's badge number or a notary's stamp on it. Del Carmen admitted that she had signed the jurat in error because she had \"missed\" that Bonner's affidavit was not sworn. But at the time, Del Carmen believed probable cause for a search warrant had been established and did not see any defects in Bonner's affidavit. She electronically signed the warrant, authorizing officers to take a sample\n   of Wheeler's blood, and electronically returned the packet to the dispatcher. The warrant included a recitation that the affiant-Bonner-\"did heretofore this day subscribe and swear to said affidavit before me\"-Del Carmen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The dispatcher informed Bonner that the warrant had been signed. The warrant was executed, and Wheeler's blood draw occurred approximately one hour after his arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 18.06. On Pantego's blood-room-procedure form, Bonner did not indicate whether the blood draw was pursuant to Wheeler's consent or a search warrant. He later did not remember why he did not circle \"Search Warrant\" on that form. Bonner signed the return as the affiant, but Del Carmen never signed it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   art. 18.10. Wheeler's blood-alcohol content was 0.14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    C. THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS AND APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Wheeler was charged by information with the class B misdemeanor of driving while intoxicated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049.04\">\n    Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 49.04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b). Before trial, he filed a motion to suppress the seized blood-alcohol evidence, arguing that the warrant was invalid because it was based on an unsworn affidavit and therefore violated the United States and Texas Constitutions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the trial court's December 19, 2017 evidentiary hearing, Bonner testified that he did not fabricate the probable-cause facts included in his affidavit. Although he had been trained at the police academy about the oath requirement for warrant affidavits, Pantego did not reinforce that he needed an oath or its equivalent administered before submitting the affidavit. In fact, he stated that he had never before sworn to a probable-cause affidavit in the fourteen months he was a Pantego officer and that he had previously applied for search warrants from Del Carmen. At the suppression hearing, Bonner admitted that he was aware of the constitutional oath requirement for search-warrant affidavits based on his prior academy training.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Bonner was asked if an oath had been administered or if someone watched him sign the affidavit for Wheeler's warrant, Bonner stated, \"Not that I remember.\" Bonner admitted that he never communicated directly with Del Carmen that night. But he testified that he followed what he believed to be Pantego's standard procedure in obtaining the search warrant. Bonner was familiar with oaths and understood that the probable-cause facts in his affidavit were never properly sworn. Bonner could not remember if he saw the signed search warrant, but he was not subjectively aware of any defects in his affidavit at the time and he subjectively believed he had a valid search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Del Carmen testified that she previously had seen many warrant affidavits from\n   Pantego officers and that they ordinarily were sworn either before another officer or before a notary before being sent to her by the dispatcher. She did not notice that Bonner's affidavit was not sworn and she did not administer an oath to Bonner that night. Based on her knowledge of Pantego procedure regarding officers' handing the packet to the dispatcher to forward to her, Del Carmen believed that an attestation to the affidavit could have occurred. But she testified that based on the packet she received regarding Wheeler's warrant, there was no indication of an attestation. Del Carmen agreed that Bonner's affidavit provided no verified facts supplying probable cause for the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The dispatcher did not testify at the hearing and was no longer employed by Pantego. The trial court took judicial notice that the dispatcher was terminated for \"the creation of fictitious, racial profiling codes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court denied Wheeler's motion on January 9, 2018. In its carefully crafted order, the trial court framed the issue: \"Is the good faith exception provision in Article 38.23(b) Code of Criminal Procedure applicable under these facts so that the exclusionary rule contained in Article 38.23(a) is inapplicable?\" The trial court, after paying \"particular attention\" to the plain language of the good-faith exception in article 38.23(b), found that the unsworn affidavit was a procedural mistake, not a substantive error, that fell within the good-faith exception to article 38.23(a) 's exclusionary rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After pleading guilty under a plea-bargain agreement, Wheeler now appeals the trial court's denial of his pretrial motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049.04\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 44.02. The trial court certified that Wheeler had the right to appeal from the trial court's suppression ruling notwithstanding that his guilty plea was the result of a plea bargain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(a)(2)(A), (d). Wheeler now argues that because Bonner's affidavit was not sworn, the evidence seized under the subsequently issued warrant should have been suppressed because it violated the affidavit and warrant requirements found in the Texas Constitution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which could not be cured by the exclusionary-rule exception found in the code of criminal procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In general, when tasked with the review of a trial court's suppression ruling,\n   we use a bifurcated standard of review-giving almost total deference to historical-fact and application-of-law-to-fact questions that turn on an evaluation of credibility and demeanor and reviewing de novo application-of-law-to-fact questions that do not turn on credibility and demeanor.\n   <em>\n    Amador v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311719\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/666/#p673\">\n    221 S.W.3d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 673 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). The facts presented here are undisputed, and we are presented with a question of law: Can the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule excuse the affidavit-oath requirement found in the Texas Constitution and code of criminal procedure? Because this issue solely implicates the trial court's application of undisputed facts to the law, we review the ruling de novo and will affirm it if it is correct under any applicable legal theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8370362\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/235/736/#p740\">\n    235 S.W.3d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 740 (Tex. Crim.

App.-Texarkana 2003, pet. ref'd). Further, because Wheeler's arguments implicate the scope of the statutory exclusionary rule and its exception, our question is one of statutory construction, which is also reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McClintock v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655890\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/541/63/#p67\">\n    541 S.W.3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017). Finally, because the good-faith exception is just that-an exception-the State had the burden to show its applicability to justify admission of the blood-alcohol results in response to Wheeler's motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   41 George E. Dix &amp; John M. Schmolesky,\n   <em>\n    Texas Practice: Criminal Practice &amp; Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 18:28 (3d ed. 2011);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202.02\">\n    Tex.

PURPOSE OF THE OATH REQUIREMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Texas Constitution provides that lawful issuance of a search warrant is dependent on three requirements: (1) a particular description of the person or thing to be searched, (2) facts establishing probable cause, and (3) supported by oath or affirmation. Tex. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9. The Texas Legislature codified these requirements, including that the affidavit be under oath or by affirmation, i.e., sworn. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.06 (tracking oath-or-affirmation language in Texas Constitution), art. 18.01(b) (\"A sworn affidavit setting forth substantial facts establishing probable cause shall be filed in every instance in which a search warrant is requested.\"). Thus, \"an oath is both constitutionally and statutorily\n   <strong>\n    indispensable\n   </strong>\n   \" in the context of a search-warrant affidavit.\n   <em>\n    Clay v.

But the State asserts that the oath language in the affidavit's preamble, in the jurat, and in the warrant's preamble show that the purpose of the oath was fulfilled, allowing the affidavit to be considered sworn. The purpose of an oath \"is to call upon the affiant's sense of moral duty to tell the truth and to instill in him a sense of seriousness and responsibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

At the suppression hearing, Bonner testified that he understood the meaning of the oath he took before he began his testimony but he did not state that he had that same understanding at the time he signed his affidavit. Indeed, he was not asked if that was the case. Other than his testimony that he had not falsified the affidavit facts, he did not testify that he signed the affidavit with a knowledge of its seriousness such that he would be subject to perjury.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8404153\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/207/787/#p790\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"When an individual swears under oath, society's expectation of truthfulness increases and the legal consequences for untruthfulness-prosecution for perjury, for example-may be severe.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Bonner did not take an oath or otherwise attest to the affidavit facts before having the dispatcher forward the packet to Del Carmen, and Del Carmen specifically testified that she had not administered an oath to Bonner. Both agreed that they never spoke to each other that night, and Bonner testified that he had never before sworn an oath in front of anyone to procure a warrant. And both recognized that the jurat's oath recital never occurred. We cannot conclude that the oath recitations in the affidavit's and warrant's preambles or in the jurat were sufficient to consider the affidavit sworn. The evidence reflects the opposite-no oath or its equivalent occurred. Del Carmen testified that the oath statement in the warrant's preamble never happened and opined that the affidavit was not sworn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This uncontradicted, affirmative evidence that there was no oath or affirmation to the affidavit compels us to conclude that the oath recitations relied on by the State were false and cannot render the affidavit sworn.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8404153\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/207/787/#p790\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 790 n.13 (stating \"an oath is a matter of substance, not form\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   These facts distinguish this case from the cases relied on by the State to support its argument that the oath recitations can render an affidavit sworn. In\n   <em>\n    Longoria v.

Thus, he never swore to any\n   search-warrant affidavits while working for Pantego for fourteen months. He subjectively believed that not swearing to affidavits was Pantego's standard procedure. Del Carmen testified, however, that it was normal procedure for Pantego officers to produce sworn affidavits for her review in determining probable cause. Indeed, Del Carmen \"missed\" that Bonner's affidavit lacked an oath or its equivalent because such affidavits from Pantego ordinarily contained either another officer's badge number or a notary stamp. Bonner's testimony was that he had been trained on the oath requirement and its constitutional underpinnings but that he subjectively believed that it was not necessary based on his incorrect assumption that Pantego did not require sworn affidavits to procure a search warrant. Thus, Bonner either wrongly assumed that Pantego officers did not submit sworn affidavits and followed suit notwithstanding his training to the contrary or he repeatedly ignored the oath requirement.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We conclude that Bonner's affidavit was unsworn, rendering the evidence collected\n   based on the executed search warrant subject to exclusion under the exclusionary rule. And although the good-faith exception applies even to an infirmity under the Texas Constitution, we cannot apply it under the singular and unusual facts of this case. Bonner was taught and had knowledge of the oath requirement yet repeatedly relied on his subjective but invalid belief that Pantego's procedures allowed for unsworn search-warrant affidavits. Bonner was not acting in objective good faith reliance on the issued warrant. Because the good-faith exception does not apply to render the seized evidence admissible, the exclusionary rule requires that any evidence seized pursuant to the issued search warrant be suppressed. The trial court's denial of Wheeler's motion to suppress was in error, and we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not play a role in Wheeler's decision to plead guilty. We sustain Wheeler's issue, reverse the trial court's January 9, 2018 order denying Wheeler's motion to suppress, reverse the trial court's subsequent judgment, and remand to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.
