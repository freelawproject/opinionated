On the physician's petition for judicial review, the trial court affirmed the Board's order, and the court of appeals likewise affirmed. The physician argues that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the proceedings, that the Medical Practice Act does not authorize disciplinary action for the conduct at issue, that compliance with the electronic certification requirement was impossible, that the Board's sanction was so severe as to be an abuse of discretion, and that the physician is entitled to recover attorney's fees. We agree with the physician that disciplinary action was not authorized and thus reverse the court of appeals' judgment in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Death Certificates: Statutory Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Texas Health and Safety Code places the responsibility of filing a death\n   certificate on the \"person in charge of interment or in charge of removal of a body from a registration district for disposition.\" TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 193.002. With certain inapplicable exceptions, that person must \"obtain the required medical certification from the decedent's attending physician ... if the death occurred under the care of the [physician] in connection with the treatment of the condition or disease process that contributed to the death.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 193.005(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Generally, the Act requires that the medical certification be completed no later than five days after the physician receives the death certificate,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 193.005(b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the certificate be filed with the appropriate local registrar no later than ten days after the death occurs,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 193.003(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2007, the Legislature amended chapter 193, adding a provision that requires the person completing the medical certification to \"submit the information and attest to its validity using an electronic process approved by the state registrar.\" Act of May 17, 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., ch. 302, \u00a7 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%20577\">\n    2007 Tex. Gen. Laws 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577 (codified at TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 193.005(h) ). During the time period at issue in this case, the approved electronic process for preparing and recording death certificates was the Texas Electronic Death Registration system (known as TEDR), administered by the Texas Department of State Health Services' Vital Statistics Unit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To use the TEDR system, a physician would submit an application to the Department and receive a password from the registrar. When the person required to file a death certificate (often a funeral director) prepared his portion of the certificate electronically and entered the medical certifier's information, the system automatically notified the certifier via email that certification was necessary. The certifying physician would then log into the system to complete the certification. If the certifier was not registered to use the system, the certificate could be \"dropped to paper\" by the funeral director, meaning it was removed from the system, and sent to the physician for completion on paper. In either event, the completed certificate was filed with the local registrar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   J.S., a patient of Dr. Ruben Aleman's, died on July 16, 2011. The funeral director\n   generated and signed J.S.'s death certificate electronically. However, Dr. Aleman was not registered with the TEDR system, so the certificate was dropped to paper and sent to him for manual certification. Dr. Aleman received and hand-certified the paper certificate on July 29. The certificate became \"official\" on August 8, when it was certified by the local registrar. On August 16, Dr. Aleman submitted an application to register with the TEDR system, and his application was approved and took effect three days later. After registering, Dr. Aleman attempted to certify J.S.'s death certificate electronically. However, the system would not allow him to do so once the certificate became official.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Almost two years later, on May 3, 2013, the Texas Medical Board filed a complaint with the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) seeking disciplinary action against Dr. Aleman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint, signed and sworn to by a Board staff attorney, alleged that \"[r]ather than certifying the patient's death certificate through TEDR as required, [Dr. Aleman] required the mortuary to provide him with a paper death certificate,\" which he \"ultimately signed.\" The complaint alleged that, in doing so, Dr. Aleman violated Health and Safety Code sections 193.002(4) (requiring death certificates to be filed electronically) and 193.005(h) (requiring death certificates to be medically certified electronically). The complaint further alleged that this conduct violated the Medical Practice Act, which authorizes disciplinary action against a licensed physician for \"commit[ting] unprofessional or dishonorable conduct that is likely to deceive or defraud the public,\" including \"an act that violates any state or federal law if the act is connected with the physician's practice of medicine.\" TEX. OCC. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 164.052(a)(5), .053(a)(1). Finally, the complaint alleged the case involved aggravating factors-increased potential for harm to the public and an intentional, premeditated, knowing, or grossly negligent act-that should be taken into consideration in determining sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Aleman filed a motion to dismiss and plea to the jurisdiction, arguing that the Board lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the complaint did not comply with the Medical Practice Act's requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%20577\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 164.005. The administrative law judge (ALJ) denied the motion. The ALJ also denied both parties' motions for summary disposition as well as Dr. Aleman's motion for sanctions. After a hearing, the ALJ issued a Proposal for Decision containing findings of fact and conclusions of law. The ALJ found that Dr. Aleman did not violate Health and Safety Code section 193.002(4), which applies only to persons required to\n   <em>\n    file\n   </em>\n   death certificates. However, the ALJ concluded that Dr. Aleman did violate section 193.005(h) by failing to complete the medical certification electronically and that his noncompliance \"did not result from circumstances beyond his control.\" In turn, the ALJ found that, because the violation was related to Dr. Aleman's practice of medicine, he \"by definition\" violated the Medical Practice Act. The ALJ further found that no aggravating factors were present in the case. Finally, the ALJ concluded that Dr. Aleman was not entitled to, nor was SOAH authorized to award, attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Board adopted the ALJ's findings and imposed sanctions. Specifically, the Board ordered Dr. Aleman to: take and\n   pass the Board's Jurisprudence Examination within one year (in no more than three attempts); pay a $ 3,000 administrative penalty; complete sixteen hours of continuing medical education within one year, including eight hours of ethics and eight hours of risk management; and give a copy of the Board's order to \"all hospitals, nursing homes, treatment facilities, and other health care entities\" where Dr. Aleman has privileges or otherwise practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On Dr. Aleman's petition for judicial review of the Board's order, the trial court affirmed the order in all relevant respects, and the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658613\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/565/26/\">\n    565 S.W.3d 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

Sufficiency of Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Texas Occupations Code section 164.005 prescribes the procedure for instituting formal administrative proceedings against a physician. Dr. Aleman asserts that the formal complaint against him did not comply with the section's requirements, depriving the Board of jurisdiction over this proceeding. The Board responds that the complaint was statutorily compliant and, alternatively, that any defects are not jurisdictional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of DeSoto v.

OCC. CODE \u00a7 164.005(a) - (c), (f). Dr. Aleman does not contend that the complaint provided insufficient detail or notice with respect to the particular acts underlying the alleged violations. Rather, he insists that the complaint was not \"in the form of a written affidavit\" or \"made by a credible person under oath\" because the Board staff attorney who signed the complaint lacked personal knowledge of the events in question.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    As the court of appeals noted, the Texas Government Code defines \"affidavit\" as \"a statement in writing of a fact or facts signed by the party making it, sworn to before an officer authorized to administer oaths, and officially certified to by the officer under his seal of office.\" TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 312.011(1). The complaint at issue meets this definition: it is in writing, states facts, is signed by the party stating them, and is sworn and notarized. We apply this definition in construing civil statutes \"unless a different meaning is apparent from the context of the statute in which the word appears.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%201343\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7\u00a7 312.001, .011. But no such different meaning-i.e., one adding a requirement that the complaint be signed by a person with personal knowledge-is apparent from the context of section 164.005.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    To the contrary, section 164.005(b) provides that, \"[u]nless otherwise specified, a proceeding under this subtitle or other applicable law and a charge against a license holder may be instituted by an authorized representative of the board.\" TEX. OCC. CODE \u00a7 164.005(b). This provision would make little sense if personal knowledge were required because board representatives typically will not have such knowledge of the facts underlying an alleged Medical Practice Act violation. Further, the statute contains no indication that a formal complaint is intended to have evidentiary value in the proceedings. By contrast, as the court of appeals recognized, affidavits must affirmatively be \"made on personal knowledge\" to constitute competent evidence in the summary judgment context. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(f). Section 164.005 contains no such express requirement, and we decline to imply one. Accordingly, we hold that the complaint against Dr. Aleman complied with the Medical Practice Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Authorization for Disciplinary Action Under the Medical Practice Act\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Dr. Aleman next argues that the Board erred in taking disciplinary action against him for failing to complete the medical certification for J.S.'s death certificate electronically. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Board's order may be reversed if its findings and conclusions are \"not reasonably supported by substantial evidence\" or are \"arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion.\" TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 2001.174(2)(E), (F). The Board's factual findings are reviewed under a substantial evidence standard, meaning they will be upheld if \"more than a mere scintilla\" of evidence supports them.\n    <em>\n     City of Dallas v.

However, the issue here is not whether Dr. Aleman did or did not certify electronically-it is undisputed that he did not. Rather, the parties dispute whether the Medical Practice Act authorized disciplinary action for that conduct, presenting an issue of statutory interpretation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Statutory interpretation involves questions of law that we consider de novo, even when reviewing agency decisions.\n    <em>\n     Cadena Comercial USA Corp. v.

Thus, the Board concludes, such conduct is subject to disciplinary action. Dr. Aleman responds that, even if he technically violated the electronic certification requirement, section 164.053(a)(1) does not encompass this type of conduct, which does not \"actually\" qualify as unprofessional or dishonorable conduct that could \"actually\" deceive or defraud the public. For the reasons discussed below, we hold that the Medical Practice Act did not authorize the Board to take disciplinary action against Dr. Aleman.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Board is correct that, in light of the Health and Safety Code's electronic certification requirement, Dr. Aleman necessarily violated state law by certifying J.S.'s death certificate manually, regardless of his knowledge of the law's existence.

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 193.005(a) (explaining when the medical certification should be obtained from the decedent's attending physician).

Contrary to the Board's assertion, there is no indication that the Legislature intended to authorize disciplinary\n    action under sections 164.052(a)(5) and 164.053 for conduct that is not in fact \"likely to deceive or defraud the public.\" That is, in identifying qualifying behavior, the Legislature did not alter the meaning of the phrase \"unprofessional or dishonorable conduct likely to deceive or defraud the public\" to include conduct that is not likely to do either.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Indeed, by providing a finite list of acts in section 164.053 that constitute \"unprofessional or dishonorable conduct likely to deceive or defraud the public\" for purposes of section 164.052(a)(5), the Legislature chose to allow sanctions for some acts that fall within this overarching description but not others. Section 164.053 thus\n    <em>\n     narrows\n    </em>\n    the category's scope. But under the Board's reading, subsection (a)(1) simultaneously broadens that scope by incorporating conduct that goes beyond the category's unambiguous parameters. This reading is both internally inconsistent and, again, ignores the Legislature's choice to categorize the conduct in the first instance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Applying sections 164.052 and 164.053 to the facts at hand, Dr. Aleman's conduct-medically certifying a death certificate using pen and paper rather than the approved electronic system-clearly does not qualify as an act that is connected with the practice of medicine in a manner likely to deceive or defraud the public. Regardless of the method used to complete the medical certification process, the information required is the same, the statutory deadlines are the same, and the certificate's destination-filing with the local registrar-is the same.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11590860\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/988/706/#p709\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 193.003. The effect on the public is likewise the same. By contrast, certainly a physician's failure to provide\n    <em>\n     accurate\n    </em>\n    information on a death certificate could be classified as connected with the practice of medicine in a manner \"likely to deceive or defraud the public,\" as it would amount to the inclusion of false information in a legally significant public document.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The Board insists that the electronic certification requirement serves an important public purpose by promoting the prompt issuance of death certificates, thereby reducing delays in various postmortem legal proceedings. That may very well be, but if anything it proves the point. Requiring electronic certification may address inefficiencies in the process, but it in no way addresses fraud or deception.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    And we fail to see how disciplining a physician for failing to comply with that requirement comports with the express policy behind the Act: \"to protect the public interest\" by \"regulat[ing] the granting of [the] privilege [of practicing medicine] and its subsequent use and control.\" TEX.

For example, suppose\n    a physician were cited for speeding while on the way to the hospital to deliver a baby. The physician has likely violated a state law,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    TEX. TRANSP. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 545.351 -.352, and under the Board's interpretation the physician's \"act\" is at least arguably \"connected with\" his practice of medicine. Again, however, disciplining such conduct is not consistent with either the Act's language-properly construed as a whole-or its purpose. Rather, the statute reflects legislative intent not to allow such conduct, which is in no way connected with the practice of medicine in a manner that makes the act likely to deceive or defraud the public, to be the proper subject of a disciplinary proceeding.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Accordingly, we hold that a physician's act of completing the medical certification for a death certificate manually rather than by using the approved electronic process does not constitute a \"prohibited practice\" under section 164.052 of the Medical Practice Act, and section 164.051 in turn does not authorize the Board to take disciplinary action against a person for such conduct. Because the Board relied on an erroneous interpretation of the Medical Practice Act to discipline Dr. Aleman, it necessarily abused its discretion in doing so. We therefore reverse the court of appeals' judgment to the extent it upholds the portions of the Board's order (1) concluding that Dr. Aleman violated the Medical Practice Act and (2) imposing sanctions against him.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

Dr. Aleman contends that some of the allegations against him in the formal complaint-specifically, that he violated Health and Safety Code section 193.002(4) and that aggravating factors warranted more severe discipline-were groundless and brought in bad faith, justifying an award of attorney's fees as sanctions. The Board concluded that SOAH was not authorized to award attorney's fees in this proceeding, and we agree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    As a state agency, SOAH has those powers the Legislature expressly confers, along with \"whatever powers are reasonably necessary to fulfill its express functions or duties.\"\n    <em>\n     Pub.

So that to constitute a crime against human laws, there must be, first, a vicious will; and, secondly, an unlawful act consequent upon such vicious will.\"). The act-omission distinction in criminal law, under which overt criminal acts traditionally were thought more blameworthy than omissions, may not be as strong now as it was in Blackstone's time. But it retains force today, at least enough for the legislature to invoke it in section 163.054(a)(1). Punishing overt acts that violate the law is one thing. Punishing failures to act-particularly in a profession where countless complicated federal and state regulations impose an unfathomable array of legal duties-is quite another. The statute's distinction between illegal acts and illegal omissions does not draw a perfect line between deceptive legal violations and innocuous ones, as the majority attempts to do. But it does draw a line, and we should enforce it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    In my view, section 164.053(a)(1) does not encompass the Board's allegations against Dr. Aleman, which stem from his unlawful failures to act, not from unlawful actions. Section 193.005(h), the statute Dr. Aleman admittedly violated, states: \"The person completing the medical certification shall submit the information and attest to its validity using an electronic process approved by the state registrar.\" TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 193.005(h). According to the Medical Board, Dr. Aleman's conduct falls within section 164.053(a)(1) because he violated section 193.005(h) when he \"admittedly\n    <em>\n     failed to sign\n    </em>\n    the [certificate of death] electronically.\" Resp't's Br. on the Merits 5 (emphasis added). The SOAH hearing officer stated in the Final Order that \"Dr. Aleman violated Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7 193.005(h) by\n    <em>\n     failing to certify\n    </em>\n    the death certificate for J.S. electronically.\"\n    <em>\n     Ruben Aleman, M.D.\n    </em>\n    , SOAH Docket No. 503-13-4126.MD (Tex. Med. Bd. June 27, 2014) (emphasis added). The failure to sign is not an act. The failure to certify is not an act. They are omissions. The Board's complaint is that section 193.005(h) imposes an affirmative duty on Dr. Aleman, who\n    <em>\n     failed\n    </em>\n    to discharge it. Even as described by the Board and the hearing officer, Dr. Aleman's legal error was one of omission, not of commission. Dr. Aleman admits he violated the statute, but that does not mean he \"committed an act that violated\" it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The only act Dr. Aleman committed was signing the death certificate with a pen. But section 193.005(h) does not prohibit that act. Again, it states: \"The person completing the medical certification shall submit the information and attest to its validity using an electronic process approved by the state registrar.\" It says nothing one way or another about the legality of hand-signing a certificate that has been \"dropped to paper\" and thereby removed from the state registrar's electronic system. The statute does not make it illegal to hand-sign and then\n    <em>\n     later\n    </em>\n    electronically certify, as Dr. Aleman attempted to do. The\n    statute does not prohibit any action whatsoever with respect to a \"dropped to paper\" certificate. As far as section 193.005(h) is concerned, Dr. Aleman could have hand-signed it, thrown it in the trash, or made a paper airplane out of it. No matter what happened to the paper certificate, Dr. Aleman's only obligation under section 193.005(h) is to \"submit the information and attest to its validity using an electronic process approved by the state registrar.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    It might be argued that because hand-signing and electronically certifying are mutually exclusive methods, the act of hand-signing violates the duty to electronically certify. But the statute itself does not make the two options mutually exclusive. Only after consulting the jumbled innards of the \"electronic process approved by the state registrar\" could one know that, under the registrar-approved process, hand-signing and electronic certification happen to be mutually exclusive. But the \"electronic process approved by the state registrar\" is not \"the law,\" so hand-signing in violation of it does not trigger section 164.053(a)(1).\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    And even if the \"electronic process\" were the law, the act of hand-signing a certificate still would not violate the statutory duty to electronically certify. Under the state registrar-approved process, the option to hand-sign a paper certificate only arises after it has become impossible to electronically certify it. Once the certificate was \"dropped to paper,\" hand-signing versus electronically signing was not an either/or proposition for Dr. Aleman. His options were to hand sign it or not hand sign it. Whether he took the overt act of signing the paper certificate or not, at that point he could not certify it electronically in compliance with section 193.005(h).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    What made Dr. Aleman's violation of section 193.005(h) inevitable-and where the Board says he really went wrong-was his failure to register for the electronic certification system. Ultimately, the Board's objection to Dr. Aleman's conduct is not that he hand-signed the certificate\n    <em>\n     instead of\n    </em>\n    electronically certifying it. Once the certificate was \"dropped to paper,\" he had no choice between the two methods.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    In the end, the crux of the Board's objection is that the certificate had to be dropped to paper because Dr. Aleman was not registered with the electronic system. But the law contains no requirement that he register. And even if it did, by\n    <em>\n     failing\n    </em>\n    to\n    register he did not \"\n    <em>\n     commit[ ] an act\n    </em>\n    that violates any state or federal law.\" TEX. OCC. CODE \u00a7 164.053(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The bottom line is that the Board is not prosecuting Dr. Aleman for what he did. It is prosecuting him for what he should have done. Under the Board's theory of this case, the legal violation to which Dr. Aleman admitted and for which he is being prosecuted is the\n    <em>\n     failure\n    </em>\n    to electronically certify a death certificate. Dr. Aleman may have violated the law by failing to certify electronically, but he did not thereby \"commit[ ] an act that violates\" the law. Under the text of section 164.053, his unlawful omission does not automatically qualify as \"unprofessional or dishonorable conduct likely to deceive or defraud the public.\" The Board lacks authority to prosecute him for it. I concur in the Court's judgment vacating the sanctions against Dr. Aleman.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n    After having thus taken each individual one by one into its powerful hands, and having molded him as it pleases, the sovereign power extends its arms over the entire society; it covers the surface of society with a network of small, complicated, minute, and uniform rules, which the most original minds and the most vigorous souls cannot break through to go beyond the crowd; it does not break wills, but it softens them, bends them and directs them; it rarely forces action, but it constantly opposes your acting; it does not destroy, it prevents birth; it does not tyrannize, it hinders, it represses, it enervates, it extinguishes, it stupefies, and finally it reduces each nation to being nothing more than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE, DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA: HISTORICAL-CRITICAL EDITION 1252 (Eduardo Nolla ed., James T.

Despite the statute and the notices, Dr. Ruben Aleman never registered to use the electronic-certification system during the extended grace period.

More specifically, when words \"are associated in a context suggesting that the words have something in common, they should be assigned a permissible meaning that makes them similar.\" READING LAW at 195. Specific items within a list may limit the meaning of a more general term within the same list \"to a subset of all the things or actions that [the more general term] covers-but only according to its ordinary meaning.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 196.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The Court concludes that the statute's reference to illegal acts connected with the practice of medicine must refer only to such acts that are connected with the practice of medicine \"in a manner that makes [them] likely\" deceptive or fraudulent, because all the other items in the list fit that description.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at ----. To begin with, that characterization simply isn't true: failing to adequately supervise a subordinate is not necessarily likely to deceive or defraud the public,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    TEX. OCC. CODE \u00a7 164.053(a)(8), nor is writing a prescription for a known narcotic abuser or prescribing a nontherapeutic treatment,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7\u00a7 164.053(a)(3), (5). Under the Court's construction, the Board could discipline a doctor for engaging in\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    of the listed conduct\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    if the Board demonstrates that the doctor's particular actions were likely to deceive or defraud the public. The statute, however, imposes no such requirement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    But beyond that, the Court misapplies the\n    <em>\n     noscitur a sociis\n    </em>\n    canon by focusing on the narrowest possible commonality among the listed items. When the canon applies, the \"common quality\" among the items listed \"should be its\n    <em>\n     most general\n    </em>\n    quality-the\n    <em>\n     least\n    </em>\n    common denominator, so to speak-relevant to the context.\" READING LAW at 196 (emphases added). To use the Court's example,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    at ----, the canon might justify construing the statute's reference to illegal acts \"connected with the practice of medicine\" to\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    include a doctor's speeding on the way to the hospital, because the types of acts listed share the \"general quality\" of improper acts performed\n    <em>\n     as a physician\n    </em>\n    , not\n    <em>\n     as a driver\n    </em>\n    . But whether that's true or not, no one disputes that Dr. Aleman's failure to certify the death certificate electronically was improper and connected with the practice of medicine and, in that sense, it fits squarely within the \"general quality\" the other listed items share.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Second, and more concerning, the Court's reasoning ignores-and effectively deletes-the statute's unambiguous language. According to the Court, the statute's reference to illegal acts connected with the practice of medicine must refer only to such acts that are \"connected with the practice of medicine in a manner that makes [them] likely to deceive or defraud the public\" because, \"otherwise, categorizing the conduct at all serves no purpose.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at ----. To the contrary, by \"categorizing\" actionable conduct as all unprofessional or dishonorable acts likely to deceive or defraud the public, and then defining\n    <em>\n     that category\n    </em>\n    to include a\n    <em>\n     non-exclusive\n    </em>\n    list of specific types of conduct, the statute confirms that the category includes both the listed conduct and all other unspecified conduct that fits within the broad category. In other words, by stating that the generally described conduct \"includes\" the listed conduct, the statute does not create a \"finite list of acts\" at all.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 311.005(13) (\" 'Includes' and 'including' are terms of enlargement and not of limitation\n    or exclusive enumeration, and use of the terms does not create a presumption that components not expressed are excluded.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    That one listed item does not seem\n    <em>\n     to us\n    </em>\n    to fit neatly within the general category's description does not grant us license to remove or revise that item. We have no authority \"to rewrite the statute so that it covers only what\n    <em>\n     we think\n    </em>\n    is necessary to achieve what\n    <em>\n     we think\n    </em>\n    [the legislature] really intended.\"\n    <em>\n     Lewis v.

The Court does not think that all illegal conduct connected with the practice of medicine constitutes \"unprofessional or dishonorable conduct likely to deceive or defraud the public,\" so it rewrites the statute to include only those illegal acts that it thinks fit that description. But it ignores the statute's express statement that the general category \"includes\" illegal conduct connected with the practice of medicine, whether we think it should or not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    And there's more. If, as the Court concludes, the statute allows the Board to discipline doctors only for conduct that is \"likely to deceive or defraud the public,\" there'd be no reason for the list of \"included\" conduct at all. Under the Court's approach, every act that clearly fits that description is actionable, every act that does not clearly fit that description is not actionable, and the list of acts that the statute says are \"included\" within the description is simply meaningless. But by providing the list of \"included\" conduct, the statute provides that all such \"included\" conduct is actionable even if we think it doesn't clearly fit the description.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Contrary to the Court's reasoning, the correct approach is to recognize that, by describing a general category and then listing specific conduct \"included\" within that category, the statute makes \"doubly sure that the broad (and intended-to-be-broad) general term is taken to include the specifics.\" READING LAW at 204 (noting that some statutes, like the one at issue here, \"provide this belt-and-suspenders function by introducing the specifics with a term such as\n    <em>\n     including\n    </em>\n    or even\n    <em>\n     including without limitation\n    </em>\n    \"). The statute expressly provides that the category of prohibited conduct for which a physician may be disciplined-however that category may be described-\"includes\" illegal conduct connected with the practice of medicine. Because Dr. Aleman's failure to comply with the electronic-certification statute amounts to such conduct, the statute authorizes the Board to discipline him.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Because the statute expressly grants the Board authority to discipline Dr. Aleman for violating the electronic-certification statute, I respectfully dissent.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Like the\n    unanimous court of appeals, the trial court, the Board, and the administrative law judge, I would hold that the Board acted within its authority, Dr. Aleman cannot rely on an impossibility defense, and the Board did not abuse its discretion.
