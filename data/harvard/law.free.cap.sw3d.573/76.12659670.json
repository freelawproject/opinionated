Draper III, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Gary D. Sampson, Jr. (hereinafter, \"Sampson\") filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, requesting his immediate discharge from probation. Sampson argues the circuit court erred in overruling his motion to be discharged from probation and setting the matter for a probation violation hearing because the circuit court lost authority\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by placing him on a third term of probation. Sampson asserts if his earned compliance credits (hereinafter, \"ECC\") were applied properly, he should have been discharged statutorily from probation and the circuit court had no authority to conduct another probation violation hearing because his term of probation had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Court holds the circuit court erred in placing Sampson on a third term of probation. However, due to the fact Sampson should have still been serving a valid second probationary term, it is unclear whether the circuit court had authority to\n   conduct a probation violation hearing or whether Sampson's probation expired statutorily. A permanent writ of mandamus is directed to issue ordering the circuit court to reinstate Sampson's previous probationary term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2012, Sampson pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance. Sampson was granted a suspended imposition of sentence and placed on a five-year term of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sampson's probation was revoked in November 2013. Sampson was sentenced to a six-year term of imprisonment, but the circuit court suspended the execution of the sentence and placed Sampson on a new five-year term of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December 2014, Sampson admitted to violating his probation by using controlled substances. The circuit court continued Sampson's term of probation and imposed additional conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sampson's probation was revoked again in July 2015, and the circuit court ordered his sentence to be executed. Sampson was placed into a 120-day institutional treatment program. Pursuant to section 559.115, RSMo Supp. 2013,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the circuit court retained jurisdiction for the 120-day period. Following the treatment program, the circuit court granted Sampson probation, effective November 2015, for a term of five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December 2017, the state filed a motion to revoke Sampson's probation. Sampson filed a motion to be discharged from probation in February 2018, claiming the state's revocation motion was filed after his statutory discharge date. The circuit court overruled Sampson's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sampson then petitioned this Court for a writ of mandamus or, in the alternative, prohibition, requesting this Court direct the circuit court to discharge him from probation or, alternatively, prohibit the circuit court from holding a probation violation hearing. This Court issued a preliminary writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After oral argument in this case, the Board of Probation and Parole (hereinafter, \"the Board\") issued a letter to the circuit court. The Board informed the circuit court that with the application of ECC, Sampson was discharged statutorily from probation effective August 1, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction to issue original remedial writs.

Sampson asserts if his ECC were applied properly, he should have been discharged statutorily from probation and the circuit court had no authority to conduct another probation violation hearing because his term of probation had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Sampson presents two issues in his sole point on appeal for this Court's consideration. First, this Court must determine whether the circuit court had authority to place Sampson in a 120-day institutional treatment program and subsequently place him on a third term of probation. Second, this Court must determine whether the circuit court had the authority to conduct a probation violation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Third Term of Probation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The duration of a defendant's probation and the circuit court's power to revoke probation is governed by section 559.036.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

In July 2015, the circuit court determined Sampson met all further criteria for placement in a 120-day institutional treatment program as contemplated by section 559.036.4. Accordingly, the circuit court properly placed Sampson in a 120-day institutional treatment program pursuant to section 559.036.4 and section 559.115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Sampson successfully completed his 120-day institutional treatment program. \"[O]nce the defendant has successfully completed the program under this subsection, the court shall release the defendant\n   <em>\n    to continue to serve the term of probation, which shall not be modified, enlarged, or extended\n   </em>\n   based on the same incident of violation.\" Section 559.036.4(3) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When Sampson was released from his 120-day institutional treatment program, the circuit court entered a new five-year term of probation.

While it is clear the circuit court erroneously imposed a new term of probation following Sampson's release from the 120-day program, it is not clear whether Sampson's properly imposed second term of probation has expired.
