We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 20, 2016, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services became involved with eight-month-old U.G.G. based on a report of negligent supervision by D.M., the child's seventeen-year-old mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department caseworker\n   could not locate Mother, so she instructed S.P.G. (Father) to obtain legal custody of U.G.G. and to not allow Mother to have access to the child if Father believed it was unsafe to do so. Father did not follow through with obtaining custody of U.G.G. and later returned the child to Mother. At trial, Father explained that he returned U.G.G. to Mother because they had agreed each parent would have custody on alternating months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Less than three months later, the Department received a Priority 1 intake regarding physical injuries to ten-month-old U.G.G. which occurred while in his Mother's care. Mother and U.G.G.'s maternal grandmother took him to the emergency room with a black eye, ruptured blood vessel in his eye, busted lip, and scratches on his neck and back. Mother stated that her boyfriend, J.A., had physically abused the child while she was in the shower. The injuries were two days old when Mother took U.G.G. to the emergency room. At trial, Mother testified that the Department became involved because of a \"misunderstanding\" about U.G.G. being abused. Caseworker Kelli Cantrell met with Mother on November 14, 2016. By that time, Mother had reunited with J.A., and Mother reported to Cantrell that she was five months pregnant. The Department provided Family Based Safety Services (FBSS) to Mother and it implemented a safety plan requiring U.G.G. to be placed with Father and restricted Mother to supervised visitation. Father again agreed to seek legal custody of U.G.G. but he failed to do so. In late February 2017, Cantrell attempted to make a home visit with U.G.G., but Father had returned U.G.G. to Mother. Father asserted that he had undergone an appendectomy and did not have anyone else he could ask to care for the child. At Cantrell's insistence, Father picked up U.G.G., but he returned the child to Mother the following day in violation of the safety plan. Mother gave birth to her second child, A.N.A., in March 2017 and tested positive for methamphetamine. Mother admitted using methamphetamine while she had U.G.G. in her care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 23, 2017, the Department filed a petition seeking to terminate the parental rights of both Mother and Father to U.G.G.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a hearing in May 2017, the trial court appointed the Department as the temporary managing conservator of both U.G.G. and A.N.A. and placed them with the foster parents, A.H. and R.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Joy Welch Miller, a Department caseworker, discussed the service plan requirements with Father. The service plan required Father to complete individual counseling with Lee West and to complete parenting classes. Father attended his first counseling session, but missed the second session because it snowed. Father testified that the second session was rescheduled but he again missed it. Father explained that he \"lost track\" of the counseling sessions and did not attend them because he was busy performing other parts of the service plan. Father attended eight out of the twelve or fourteen parenting classes he was required to complete. He testified that he could not complete his service plan requirements because of his work hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Father completed a drug and alcohol assessment on June 21, 2017. He testified positive for methamphetamine on hair follicle\n   tests done in September and November 2017, and on December 16, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Father also tested positive for methamphetamine on a hair follicle test done on December 16, 2017. After the first positive test for methamphetamine, Father was asked to undergo a second assessment in January 2018, but Father failed to do so. Joy Welch Miller, a Department conservatorship caseworker, discussed the positive test results with Father. Father told her that he suspected he would test positive because someone at work had been giving him drugs. Miller emphasized that Father must remain drug free if he wanted U.G.G. returned to him. On February 28, 2018, which was less than two weeks before trial, Father had another hair follicle test, and he tested positive for methamphetamine and amphetamine. Father testified that he did not start using drugs until after U.G.G. was removed from his care, and he last used methamphetamine on December 24, 2017. Consistent with what he told Miller, Father claimed that his boss gave him pills to boost his energy at work and he did not find out until later what the pills were. Despite having multiple positive drug tests, Father did not stop taking the pills until January 2018 when he left the job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 8, 2018, an associate judge heard the case and determined that Father's parental rights should be terminated. Father exercised his right to a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing. At the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing, the District Court considered the record from the trial conducted before the associate judge as well as additional evidence introduced by Father and the attorney ad litem for the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 201.015(c). The District Court found that the Department had proven by clear and convincing evidence that Father had: (1) knowingly placed or knowingly allowed the child to remain in conditions or surroundings which endanger the physical or emotional well-being of the child, pursuant to \u00a7 161.00l(b)(1)(D), Texas Family Code; (2) engaged in conduct or knowingly placed the child with persons who engaged in conduct which endangers the physical or emotional well-being of the child, pursuant to \u00a7 161.00l(b)(1)(E), Texas Family Code; and (3) failed to comply with the provisions of a court order that specifically established the actions necessary for the father to obtain the return of the child who has been in the permanent or temporary managing conservatorship of the Department of Family and Protective Services for not less than nine months as a result of the child's removal from the parent under Chapter 262 for the abuse or neglect of the child, pursuant to \u00a7 161.001(b)(1)(O), Texas Family Code. The court also found by clear and convincing evidence that termination of Father's parental rights was in the child's best interest, and it appointed the Department as the permanent managing conservator of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    TERMINATION GROUNDS AND BEST INTEREST UNDER SECTION 161.001\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Father raises eight issues challenging the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court's findings. In Issues One through Six, Father argues that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the predicate termination grounds found by the trial court under Section 161.001(b)(1)(D), (E), and (O). In Issues Seven and Eight, he challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting the best\n   interest finding made under Section 161.001(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Parental rights may be involuntarily terminated through proceedings brought under Section 161.001 of the Texas Family Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 161.001. Under this provision, the petitioner must (1) establish one or more of the statutory acts or omissions enumerated as grounds for termination, and (2) prove that termination is in the best interest of the children.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Both elements must be established, and termination may not be based solely on the best interest of the child as determined by the trier of fact.\n   <em>\n    Texas Department of Human Services v.

Father's continued drug use demonstrates poor judgment and an inability to put the interests of U.G.G. before his own. While Father claimed that he did not start using drugs until after U.G.G. was removed from his care and he stopped in January 2018 after leaving the job, the trial court was not required to believe Father's self-serving testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re J.F.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9359530\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/96/256/#p266\">\n    96 S.W.3d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, given Father's persistent use of methamphetamine during the case and his refusal to undergo a second drug and alcohol assessment just two months before trial, the trial court could reasonably conclude that Father would continue to use illegal drugs and endanger the child's well-being in the future.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re J.O.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301947\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/283/336/#p344\">\n    283 S.W.3d at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence also showed that Father knowingly returned U.G.G. to Mother after the child suffered injuries while in her care and despite being instructed by the caseworker to not allow Mother to have unsupervised access to the child. Father explained that he had no one else who could watch U.G.G. while he was recovering from surgery, but Father failed to notify anyone from the Department before returning U.G.G. to Mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Having consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's finding, we conclude that a reasonable fact finder could have formed a firm belief or conviction that Father engaged in a course of conduct endangering to U.G.G.'s physical and emotional well-being under Section 161.001(b)(1)(E).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re J.F.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9359530\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/96/256/#p266\">\n    96 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   266 ;\n   <em>\n    In re K-A.B.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656975\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/551/275/#p287\">\n    551 S.W.3d at 286-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A determination of best interest necessitates a focus on the child, not the parent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In the Interest of B.C.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6826520\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/479/918/#p926\">\n    479 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   927 ;\n   <em>\n    In the Interest of R.F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9091152,9091220\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/115/804/\">\n    115 S.W.3d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812 (Tex.App.--Dallas 2003, no pet.).

Several factors must be considered in our analysis of the best interest issue: the child's desires; the child's emotional and physical needs now and in the future; the emotional and physical danger to the child now and in the future; the parenting abilities of the individuals seeking custody; the programs available to assist those individuals to promote the child's best interest; the plans for the child by those individuals or the agency seeking custody; the stability of the home or proposed placement; the parent's acts or omissions that may indicate that the existing parent-child relationship is not a proper one; and any excuse for the parent's acts or omissions.\n   <em>\n    Holley v.

We also must bear in mind that permanence is of paramount importance in considering a child's present and future needs.\n   <em>\n    In re B.C.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6826520\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/479/918/#p926\">\n    479 S.W.3d at 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We begin by examining the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the best interest finding. The first factor is the desires of the child. U.G.G. was only two and a half years of age at the time of\n   the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   trial and there is no evidence that he is able to express his desires. Evidence that a child is well-cared for by his foster family, is bonded to his foster family, and has spent minimal time in the presence of a parent is relevant to the best interest determination under the desires of the child factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re R.A.G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656335\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/545/645/#p652\">\n    545 S.W.3d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 652-53 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2017, no pet.) ;\n   <em>\n    In re U.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9119573\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/105/222/#p236\">\n    105 S.W.3d at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . U.G.G. and his half-sister A.N.A. have resided with the foster parents since May 2017. It is undisputed that U.G.G. is well-cared for by his foster parents and is closely bonded not only to his foster family but also to A.N.A. The conservatorship caseworker and R.H. testified about U.G.G.'s strong bond to A.N.A. and how detrimental it would be to him if they were separated. Both of the children refer to the foster parents as \"Mom\" and \"Dad\". Father testified that U.G.G. lived with him for six months before he was removed from Father's care. Following U.G.G.'s removal, Father has visited with the child once every other week, and Father missed only a couple of visits. U.G.G. had lived continuously with the foster family for a year at the time of the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing. The first factor weighs in favor of the best interest finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The next two factors are the child's emotional and physical needs now and in the future, and the emotional and physical danger to the child now and in the future. The need for permanence is a paramount consideration for a child's present and future physical and emotional needs.\n   <em>\n    In the Interest of R.A.G.\n   </em>\n   , 545 S.W.3d at 653 ;\n   <em>\n    In re U.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9119573\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/105/222/#p236\">\n    105 S.W.3d at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A fact finder may infer that past conduct endangering the well-being of a child may recur in the future if the child is returned to the parent.\n   <em>\n    In re R.A.G.\n   </em>\n   , 545 S.W.3d at 653 ;\n   <em>\n    In re D.L.N.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11889193\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/958/934/#p934\">\n    958 S.W.2d 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 934 (Tex.App.--Waco 1997, pet. denied). As determined in our review of Issues Three and Four, the evidence at trial established that Father engaged in conduct which endangered the child's physical and emotional well-being, and he knowingly placed U.G.G. with Mother who endangered his physical and emotional well-being. Based on the evidence, the trial court could have determined that the second and third factors weigh heavily in support of the best interest finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The fourth factor is the parenting abilities of the individuals seeking custody. In reviewing the parenting abilities of a parent, a fact finder can consider the parent's past neglect or past inability to meet the physical and emotional needs of the children.\n   <em>\n    D.O. v. Texas Department of Human Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10000836\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/851/351/#p356\">\n    851 S.W.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 356 (Tex.App.--Austin 1993, no writ),\n   <em>\n    disapproved of on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re J.F.C.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9359530\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/96/256/#p266\">\n    96 S.W.3d 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. 2002). The evidence shows that Father has poor parenting skills. In addition to engaging in illegal drug use during the case, Father endangered U.G.G. by knowingly placing him with Mother after U.G.G. suffered injuries while in Mother's care. There is also evidence that Father made an effort to improve his parenting abilities by completing his individual counseling and parenting classes between the hearing before the associate judge and the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing. It was the trial court's task to weigh all of the evidence related to Father's parenting skills and the court could have concluded that Father's efforts came too late and are insufficient to demonstrate that he has good parenting skills. This factor weighs in favor of the best interest finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The fifth factor examines the programs available to assist those individuals to promote the child's best interest. Various programs were available to provide assistance to Father. At the first trial before the associate judge in March 2018,\n   Father admitted he had not completed his individual counseling sessions or parenting classes. He testified at the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   trial on May 10, 2018 that he had completed both individual counseling and the parenting classes. This factor is neutral in that it neither supports nor weighs against the best interest finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We will consider the sixth and seventh factors together. The sixth factor examines the plans for the child by those individuals or the agency seeking custody. The seventh factor is the stability of the home or proposed placement. The fact finder may compare the parent's and the Department's plans for the child and determine whether the plans and expectations of each party are realistic or weak and ill-defined.\n   <em>\n    D.O.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10000836\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/851/351/#p356\">\n    851 S.W.2d at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . U.G.G. and his half-sister A.N.A. have resided with the foster parents since May 2017, and by all accounts the children are thriving. R.H. testified that he and his wife love both children \"very much\" and plan to adopt them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Father testified inconsistently regarding his current status and plans for the child. At the hearing in March 2018 before the associate judge, Father testified that he had changed jobs in January 2018 and he was living with his mother. Father planned for U.G.G. to reside with him in that home. Father also stated that he planned to move to a different home with his girlfriend if U.G.G. was returned to him. At the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing in May 2018, Father claimed that he had been in his current job for two years and living with his wife. Father stated that they had been married for one year and they had been living together in their own home for a couple of months. Given the obvious inconsistencies in Father's testimony, the trial court could have found that Father would not provide a stable home and his plans for U.G.G. were weak and ill-defined. After comparing Father's plan with that of the Department and foster family, the trial court could have reasonably found that the Department's plan is more realistic and allowing U.G.G. to remain with the foster family offers him the permanency and stability he would not have with Father. The sixth and seventh factors weigh heavily in favor of the best interest finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The eighth factor is the parent's acts or omissions that may indicate that the existing parent-child relationship is not a proper one. The evidence established that Father used illegal drugs during the pendency of the case and endangered U.G.G. by placing him with Mother despite being told by the caseworker that he should not allow Mother to have unsupervised access to the child. Based on this evidence, the trial court could have found that the existing parent-child relationship is not a proper one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The ninth factor is whether there is any excuse for the parent's acts or omissions. Father's brief does not address this factor or offer any excuse for Father's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Having reviewed all of the\n   <em>\n    Holley\n   </em>\n   factors, we conclude that the evidence is both legally and factually sufficient to establish a firm conviction in the mind of the trial court that termination of Father's parental rights is in U.G.G.'s best interest. Issues Seven and Eight are overruled. The\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   order terminating Father's parental rights to U.G.G. is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    To protect the identity of the children, the opinion will refer to various individuals by either initials or an alias.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.R.App.P. 9.8.
