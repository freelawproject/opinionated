For the reasons explained herein, we reverse the circuit court's judgment modifying child custody and child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts &amp; Procedure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Erika Johnson (Mother) and Zjohn Riley (Father) have one son together, E.J.R. (born June 22, 2006). In April of 2008, an administrative order was entered requiring Father to pay child support to Mother in the amount of $ 2.00 per month (Father was incarcerated at the time).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April of 2015, Mother filed a Petition to Determine Paternity, Custody, and Child Support. On March 30, 2017, the circuit court entered an \"Order and Judgment of Default for Petition for Determination of Father Child Relationship, Child Custody, and Modification of Child Support\" (Original Judgment). In its judgment, the circuit court determined that a substantial and continuing change of circumstances had occurred since the entry of the original child support order, and ordered Father to pay support in the amount of $ 307.00 per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother\n   was awarded sole legal and physical custody of E.J.R., and Father was allowed to make arrangements for supervised visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August of 2017, Father filed his Motion to Modify (the instant action), requesting that the parties be granted joint legal and physical custody of their minor child. In December of 2017, Father filed a Request for Service by Publication; and notice was published for four consecutive weeks, beginning on January 5, 2018. Mother did not file an Answer to Father's Motion to Modify and did not appear at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, on March 16, 2018, Father submitted a proposed parenting plan and a Form 14 into evidence, and testified that he wanted to be able to see E.J.R. and wished to share joint legal and physical custody with Mother. In its judgment, the circuit court ordered that the parties would share joint legal and physical custody of E.J.R., that Mother's residence would be E.J.R.'s residence for mailing and educational purposes, and that Father would have unsupervised parenting time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court modified Father's child support downward to the presumed level of $ 188.00 per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Father's child support payments were in arrears at the time of trial, and the circuit court ordered him to pay an additional $ 25.00 per month (for a total of $ 213.00 per month) until he satisfied the full amount of the arrearage ($ 700.78).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mother timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mother raises three points on appeal. In her first point, Mother argues that the circuit court erred in granting Father joint legal and physical custody \"in that [Father]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   did not provide evidence that there were substantial and continuing changes in circumstances warranting a change in custody.\" Mother argues in her second point that the circuit court erred in modifying the child support order set forth in the Original Judgment because there was insufficient evidence of a substantial and continuing change in circumstances that would render the prior award unreasonable. In her third point, Mother argues that Father's notice of service by publication was defective and that the circuit court therefore did not acquire personal jurisdiction over Mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because it presents a threshold issue, we begin by addressing Mother's third point on appeal. \"[A] circuit court's determination of personal jurisdiction is a legal conclusion ... subject to a de novo review on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Peoples Bank v.

The Court obviously cannot assess the sufficiency of a notice that is not properly before it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lake Tishomingo Prop. Owners Ass'n v.

Mother has failed to provide a sufficient record on appeal to consider whether to upset the presumption in favor of jurisdiction. Point III is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In Point I, Mother argues that the circuit court erred in modifying the parties' custodial arrangement because there was insufficient evidence of \"substantial and continuing changes in circumstances warranting a change in custody.\" \"Our standard of review in a custody modification case is governed by\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

App. W.D. 2000) (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mother misstates the standard for modification. The change necessary to justify a modification of custody does not need to be \"continuing.\"\n   <em>\n    McIntire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11147353\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/33/565/#p568\">\n    33 S.W.3d at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nevertheless, \u00a7 452.410.1\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides that \"the court shall not modify a prior custody decree unless ... it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior decree or that were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or his custodian\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and that the modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child.\" (Emphasis added). \"In all cases, the burden of proof is on the party seeking modification to show the required change in circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Clayton v.
