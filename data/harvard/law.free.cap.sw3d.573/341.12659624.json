Her first issue on appeal--a challenge to the proof of service to support the default judgment--was decided adversely to her in a previous mandamus action. We conclude that prior decision is now law-of-the-case. As to her other issues, we reject several of her challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, as well as her claim that the trial court erred in denying a motion for new trial. We sustain her challenge to the appellate attorney's fees awarded in the default judgment and modify the judgment to conform that award to the evidence presented below. As modified, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Lawsuit Below\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 7, 2017, Jose Luis Ramirez, Sr, Velia Rios Ramirez, and Jose Luis Rios Ramirez, Jr. (collectively, the Rios family) filed suit against Edith Roman complaining of liens that she recorded against two properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   One property was Jose Luis\n   Ramirez Sr. and Velia Ramirez's homestead. The other property was owned by Jose Luis Rios Ramirez, Jr., and had been leased to Edith Roman and her husband, Alejandro Hernandez. Roman was evicted from the property on March 20, 2012 for non-payment of rent. Seven days later, she filed liens against both the property she had leased, and Jose Luis Ramirez Sr. an Velia Ramirez's homestead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Rios family's lawsuit alleged various deficiencies in the lien filings, and they sought a declaration that the liens are invalid and unenforceable. The lawsuit additionally asserted claims for slander of title and violation of Chapter 12 of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code. In addition to the damages sought for those claims, the lawsuit asked for attorney's fees and exemplary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Service of Process\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Rios family hired a private investigator, Gregory Williams of CWI Investigations, to locate and serve Roman. The investigator learned that Roman was living at an Anthony, New Mexico address. The Rios family filed a motion for substituted service which sought permission to leave the citation and suit papers with anyone over the age of sixteen at the New Mexico address. The motion was supported by an affidavit of the investigator describing his efforts to locate Roman. That motion for substituted service, however, was never acted on. Instead, the trial court signed an order that authorized Gregory Williams or Victor Hernandez of CWI Investigations to serve the process on Roman at the New Mexico address or wherever she could be found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Roman called CWI Investigations on July 17, 2017 and offered to accept service at a Walgreens located in El Paso, Texas that same day. According to Williams, the petition, citation, and the order authorizing service were all placed inside a manila envelope. Williams and his partner met Roman and her husband, Alejandro Hernandez, at the Walgreens, and after confirming her identity, he handed her the envelope. Williams documented the encounter with a photograph of Roman's passport which she provided to confirm her identity. He also photographed the vehicle that she arrived in and took a photograph of Roman holding the manila envelope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Rios family filed the return of service (endorsed on the backside of the citation) on July 18, 2017. The citation and return are at issue in this case, so we describe them further. The citation is directed to Edith Roman, with a typewritten El Paso address. That address is struck through and two addresses are handwritten on the citation: the New Mexico address where she lived, and the Walgreen's Pharmacy where she agreed to meet Gregory Williams to be served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The backside of the citation contains the return. One section titled \"Certificate of Delivery\" reads: I do hereby certify that I delivered to ________ on the 17 day of July, 2017 at 7:45 o'clock p.m. this copy of this instrument.\" The section is signed by Gregory Williams, notarized, and contains the handwritten address of the Walgreens where he met Roman. Roman's name, however, is handwritten into a blank intended to identify the sheriff, if a sheriff served the process. In effect, Williams appears to have inserted Edith Roman's name into the wrong blank. The blanks are stacked on top of each other, separated by several other pre-printed blank lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on the service date, Roman's answer was due to be filed by August 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Default Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 8, 2017, the Rios family filed a motion for default judgment. The trial\n   court signed a default judgment the next day. The judgment declared the liens on the two properties of no force and effect. It also awarded the following sums against Roman: $10,000 as statutory damages for filing the liens; $4,536.93 attorney's fees through trial; $10,000 for any appeal to the court of appeals; and $5,000 at Texas Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Post-Judgment Motions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Roman timely filed a motion for new trial. The motion asserted that Roman was not properly served in strict compliance with Rules of Civil Procedure 103, 106(a) and (b), and 107, thus denying jurisdiction to render the default judgment. In part, Roman complained about Gregory Williams's affidavit used to support the motion for substituted service and the grounds asserted in that motion (which the trial court had never acted upon). The motion further contends that Williams was not authorized to serve process under Rule 103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The motion for new trial asserted two other arguments important here. First, she claimed that the citation was not actually served on Roman. She supported that claim through her and Alejandro Hernandez's declarations that contend there was no citation in the manila envelope.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, she complained of defects in the citation. Roman pointed out that her name had been written into a blank intended to identify a sheriff who might have served the petition, and not the blank identifying the person served. Along the same lines, the motion further claimed the citation was missing several other requirements set out in Rule 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Rios family filed a response that aside from addressing each legal argument, included affidavits from their attorney and the attorney's secretary attesting that the manila envelope given to Williams contained both the petition and citation, as well as the order authorizing service. Williams affidavit then described how he personally handed the envelope to Roman, including the photographs he took documenting the service of process. Williams' partner similarly swore that the envelope was handed to Roman at the Walgreen's parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 18, 2017, the trial court signed an order requiring the El Paso County Clerk to remove specified lien filings by Roman unless she posted a bond suspending enforcement of the order. Roman filed a motion to stay that order, based on her motion for new trial. The Rios family also obtained a writ of execution on the judgment. Roman responded with a motion to dissolve that writ. Roman then filed an amended motion for new trial that added two substantive arguments. First, she contended the judgment was not final because it did not dispose of the slander and exemplary damages claim that were alleged in the original petition. Second, she claimed that her failure to answer was not intentional or the result of conscious indifference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court denied both the motion for new trial and motion to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mandamus and First Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Roman then filed two proceedings in this Court. First, she filed a notice of appeal which we docketed as case No. 08-17-00235-CV. Roman also filed a Petition for Mandamus that asserted two issues.\n   <em>\n    In re Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657382\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/73/#p75\">\n    554 S.W.3d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 75-76 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2018) (original proceeding).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her first issue, Roman argued that the default judgment was void because the court lacked personal jurisdiction over her. The five subparts of that argument from the table of authorities in the Petition for Mandamus are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Affidavit in Support of Motion for Substituted Service is Invalid\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Roman Was Not Served With a Copy of The Citation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Ms. Roman Was Not Served With a Copy of The Order Authorizing Service Other than By Certified Process Server\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The Return of Service is Defective\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   No Adequate Remedy by Appeal\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The body of the brief included argument that tracked each of these section headers. We overruled that issue, however, finding that \"[t]he mandamus record conclusively establishes that Roman was personally served by Gregory Williams on July 17, 2017 with a copy of the petition, the citation, and the order for service on July 17, 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657382\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/73/#p75\">\n    554 S.W.3d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In her second mandamus issue, Roman successfully convinced us that the default judgment was not final. The default had not disposed of the slander of title and exemplary damage claims. We therefore granted her partial relief, ordering that the trial court set aside a writ of execution that the Rios family has filed.\n   <em>\n    In re Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657382\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/554/73/#p75\">\n    554 S.W.3d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Roman filed a motion for rehearing of our decision that expanded upon her jurisdictional argument. Her first point for reconsideration stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The mandamus record DOES NOT conclusively establish that Roman was personally served by Gregory Williams on July 17, 2017 with a copy of the petition, the citation, and the order for service on July 17, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Her argument focused on claimed defects in the return: \"The return does not name Ms. Roman or any person, upon whom delivery of the citation was made, the section where the name of the person served should go, is blank.\" She argued that instead, her name \"appears where the Sheriff's name should be.\" She principally relied on two cases:\n   <em>\n    Shamrock Oil Co. v. Gulf Coast Natural Gas, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9444498\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/68/737/#p739\">\n    68 S.W.3d 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied) and\n   <em>\n    Woodall v.

We denied the motion for rehearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As to her regular appeal, we dismissed it for want of jurisdiction because we agreed that the default judgment was not final.\n   <em>\n    Roman v. Ramirez\n   </em>\n   , 08-17-00235-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20739599\">\n    2018 WL 739599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Tex.App.--El Paso Feb. 7, 2018, no pet.). On remand, the trial court non-suited the slander of title and exemplary damage claims, making the earlier default judgment final and appealable. Roman filed a new notice of appeal, and now raises five issues: (1) the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction to enter the default \"because the return of service does not show proper service;\" (2) the evidence was insufficient to show liability under Chapter 12 of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code, (3) the evidence was insufficient to support damages; (4) the evidence was insufficient to support the award of attorney's fees, and (5) the trial court abused its discretion in denying the amended motion for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTIONAL DEFECTS WERE DECIDED IN THE MANDAMUS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Roman's first issue mirrors a subset of the very same complaints she made in the mandamus already decided by this Court. Her first issue focuses on a claimed defect in the return of service--her name was handwritten into the wrong blank on the return. She made the same argument in the mandamus, and particularly the motion for rehearing. As there, she now claims that\n   <em>\n    Shamrock Oil Co. v. Gulf Coast Natural Gas, Inc.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Woodall v. Lansford\n   </em>\n   support her claim. The Rios family responds that we have already decided the issue against her, which is now law-of-the-case. We begin there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, a court of appeals is ordinarily bound by its initial decision if there is a subsequent appeal in the same case.\n   <em>\n    Paradigm Oil, Inc. v.

That standard is not met here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Roman's substantive argument turns on several claimed defects in the citation and return of service. Because the record does not show \"strict compliance\" with the rules of service, she claims the default must be set aside.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

But this case arises from a regular appeal of a denied motion for new trial. The Texas Supreme Court has drawn a distinction in such an appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A restricted appeal is filed directly in an appellate court. As in any other appeal, the appellate court does not take testimony or receive evidence. Instead, the review is limited to errors apparent on the face of the record.

Circumstances require this last rule, because presumptions can neither be confirmed nor rebutted by evidence in an appellate court.... By contrast, when a default judgment is attacked by motion for new trial or bill of review in the trial court, the record is not so limited. In those proceedings, the parties may introduce affidavits, depositions, testimony, and exhibits to explain what happened.

Roman's motion for new trial included two declarations conceding that a person who identified himself as Gregory Williams handed her a manila envelope. She claimed the citation and the order authorizing service were not in the envelope. The Rios family, however, did not concede that issue. Rather, they responded with one affidavit from the paralegal who assembled and placed the documents into the envelope. They also responded with an affidavit from the attorney who personally oversaw that process, and an affidavit from the process server who accepted the manila envelope and personally served it on Roman. Each testified that the envelope contained the petition, citation, and order authorizing service. The process server buttressed his claim with a photograph showing Roman with the manila envelope in her hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On that record, the technical errors that Roman complains of lose their luster.

On that record, and turning to the critical question of why Roman did not answer, the trial court and now this Court are left without any good answer. Accordingly, our prior resolution of the jurisdictional challenge was not clearly erroneous.

The petition asserted a claim under TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 12.002 which provides that \"[a] person may not make, present, or use a document or other record with: (1) knowledge that the document or other record is a ... fraudulent lien or\n   claim against real or personal property or an interest in real or personal property[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9963024\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/835/80/#p83\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 12.002(a)(1). A person who violates this provision is liable to each injured person for \"the greater of\" $10,000 or \"the actual damages caused by the violation[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9963024\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/835/80/#p83\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 12.002(b)(1)(A)(B). The judgment here awarded $10,000 collectively to all three plaintiffs. There is no record of the default hearing, and no proof of actual damages in the motion for default. Roman claims this lack of proof of actual damages is fatal to the default. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, Chapter 12 exemplifies several Texas statutory schemes that allow statutory damages without evidence of actual damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vanderbilt Mortg. and Fin., Inc. v. Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3515387\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/358/\">\n    692 F.3d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372 n. 12 (5th Cir. 2012) (collecting statutes). Moreover, Section 12.002 penalizes the \"intent to cause\" injury and not actual injury itself. TEX.CIV.PRAC.&amp;REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 12.002(a)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3515387\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/358/\">\n    692 F.3d at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The default proved the intent to injure which then made the $10,000 statutory penalty automatic unless a higher sum was proved up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Additionally, Roman can show no harm. Had the Rios family presented evidence of actual damages that amounted to less than $10,000, then under terms of the statute, the trial court would have been compelled to award $10,000. Had the Rios family presented evidence of actual damages of more than $10,000, the trial court would have awarded that sum obviously to the detriment of Roman. In other words, she is not prejudiced by the lack of proof of actual damages. We only reverse cases where an appellant can show reversible error. TEX.R.APP.P. 44.1. Issue Three is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    APPELLATE ATTORNEY'S FEES MUST BE MODIFIED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The judgment awards the Rios family $10,000 in appellate attorney's fees for an appeal to this Court, and $5,000 should a petition for review be filed. The affidavit that supports those awards, however, only claims that $1,500 is a reasonable fee for each appellate stage. Roman complains the evidence does not support the award. The Rios family agrees and consents to modifying the judgment to the amounts proven in the affidavit. We accordingly modify the judgment to award $1,500 for the appeal to this Court, and an additional $1,500 for successful defense of any petition for review to the Texas Supreme Court.
