Winkler, </em>639 F.3d 692, 696 (5th Cir.2011) (citation omitted). \u201cAll credibility determinations and reasonable inferences from the evidence are to be resolved in favor of the jury verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\u201cTo prove conspiracy to possess and distribute a controlled substance, the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt (1) the existence of an agreement between two or more persons to violate narcotics laws; (2) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the agreement; and (3) his voluntary participation in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>453 F.3d 252, 256-57 (5th Cir.2006). Uncorroborated testimony of a convicted co-conspirator is sufficient to support a conspiracy conviction unless the testimony is incredible as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 257. De La Paz has not shown the evidence at his trial, which includes, <em>inter alia, </em>testimony from his co-conspirators and law-enforcement officers strongly establishing his participation in the conspiracy at issue, is insufficient to support his conviction. <em>See, e.g., Winkler, </em>639 F.3d at 696; <em>Valdez, </em>453 F.3d at 256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">Although post <em>-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-senteneing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">To support a \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement, the Government is required to establish by a preponderance of the evidence a \u201ctemporal and spatial relationship [between] the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant\u201d. <em>Id. </em>If the Government makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the defendant \u201cto show that it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense\u201d. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 396 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The Government provided evidence that the firearm at issue was found inside the apartment where De La Paz was conducting drug-trafficking activity and was readily accessible. De La Paz fails to show the court erred by imposing the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement or clearly erred in its factual findings. <em>E.g., Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
