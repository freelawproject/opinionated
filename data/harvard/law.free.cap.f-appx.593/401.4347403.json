Guerra argues that the district court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>in overruling his objection to the lack of a mitigating role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Whether Guerra was a minimal or minor participant is a factual determination that we review for clear error. <em>See United States v. Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d 586, 626 (5th Cir.2013). Guerra does not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he played a minimal role in the conspiracy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.4); <em>see also Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d at 626; <em>United States v. De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d 154, 163 (5th Cir.2005). Nor does he establish that he played a \u201csubstantially less culpable\u201d role than the \u201caverage participant\u201d in the drug distribution organization or that his role was \u201cperipheral to the advancement\u201d of the organization\u2019s illegal activities. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d at 626; <em>De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d at 163; <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001); \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n. 5). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s finding that Guerra was not deserving of a minor role adjustment is not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Valdez, </em>726 F.3d 684, 692 (5th Cir.2013); <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
