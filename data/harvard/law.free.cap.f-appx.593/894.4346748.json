No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">In his motion for relief, Ellis contends that he was sentenced improperly to a mandatory life sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 and seeks resentencing in the district court. In seeking an enhanced sentence under section 851, the government relied on a 1994 cocaine trafficking charge to which Ellis had pleaded nolo <em>contendere </em>but for which Ellis had not yet been adjudicated guilty or sentenced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based in part on this previous supposed conviction, Ellis was classified as a career offender and was sentenced to two concurrent mandatory life sentences. Ellis now argues, that because he had not yet been \u201cconvicted\u201d of the 1994 cocaine trafficking charge, the charge should not have been used to enhance his sentence under section 851(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">The district court dismissed Ellis\u2019s motion for relief. To the extent Ellis\u2019s motion is construed as a section 2255 motion to vacate, the district court dismissed it as successive: Ellis\u2019s initial section 2255 motion was denied on the merits, and Ellis had not sought permission from this Court to file a second section 2255 motion. To the extent Ellis\u2019s motion is construed as a section 2241 petition, the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition because Ellis did not satisfy the requirements of section 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>\u00c9llis filed a notice of appeal, which the district court construed as a notice of appeal from the dismissal of the section 2241 petition<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and an application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) of the dismissal of Ellis\u2019s section 2255 motion. The district court issued a COA on one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUHZ\">[Wjhether [Ellis\u2019s] request for re-sentencing is a successive \u00a7 2255 motion made without first obtaining authority from the Court of Appeals and, if so, whether the Court of Appeals should now authorize this court to consider it, thus vesting this court with jurisdiction to re-sentence [Ellis].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion as second or successive. <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>754 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.2014). And we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">On appeal, Ellis contends that his current section 2255 motion is not successive because his claim (that he was sentenced improperly based on a defective section 851 notice) had not been raised in a previous section 2255 motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In support of his argument, Ellis relies mainly on two cases: <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963), and <em>Humphrey v. United States, </em>766 F.2d 1522 (11th Cir.1985). But the judicially-created equitable rules set forth and applied in <em>Sanders </em>and <em>Humphrey </em>have since been largely superseded by the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b), 2255(h); <em>Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>366 F.3d 1253, 1269 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc) (noting the \u201cincreasingly tight restrictions on second and successive petitions\u201d and explaining that we have moved away from \u201cthe more permissive ends of justice and abuse of writ standards\u201d set out in <em>Sanders </em>to, under AEDPA, \u201ca near-total ban\u201d on claims not raised in a prior petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">Under AEDPA, a prisoner who has filed a section 2255 motion to vacate is limited in his ability to file a \u201csecond or successive\u201d section 2255 motion. <em>Boyd, </em>754 F.3d at 1301. \u201cIf a court determines that a \u00a7 2255 motion is \u2018second or successive,\u2019 the motion must be certified by the court of appeals before the district court may reach the merits of the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While \u201cthe phrase \u2018second or successive\u2019 is not self-defining,\u201d we have said that \u201cthe bar on second or successive motions applies when, for example, a petitioner could have raised his or her claim for relief in an earlier filed motion, but without a legitimate excuse, failed to do so.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">We have recognized the existence of \u201ca small subset of unavailable claims that must not be categorized as successive,\u201d but Ellis\u2019s claim is not one of them. <em>See Stewart v. United States, </em>646 F.3d 856, 863 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining that \u201cif the purported defect did not arise, or the claim did not ripen, until after the conclusion of the previous [section 2255] petition, the later petition based on that defect may be non-successive.\u201d). Here, Ellis\u2019s claim about the defective section 851 notice was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>both available and ripe as soon as the defective notice was filed in 1996.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, Ellis could have \u2014 but failed to \u2014 raise the claim at sentencing, on direct appeal, or when he filed his initial section 2255 motion. Because Ellis\u2019s section 2255 motion is \u201csecond or successive,\u201d and because Ellis has failed to receive (or even argue that he qualifies for) authorization from this Court to file a successive section 2255 motion,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the district court dismissed the motion properly for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">The availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Williams v. Warden, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013). \u201cThe applicability of the savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional issue\u201d that cannot be waived. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Generally speaking, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under section 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). But, under section 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause,\u201d a prisoner may file a collateral attack under section 2241 (and, thus, avoid the bar on second and successive section 2255 motions) if the prisoner can show that the remedy available under section 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">For the savings clause to apply, a petitioner must show, among other things, that his section 2241 claim was squarely foreclosed by binding circuit precedent throughout petitioner\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and first section 2255 motion. <em>Bryant v. Warden, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1274 (11th Cir.2013); <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1343-44. We have said that usual restrictions on successive section 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render the remedies under section 2255 \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>See Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">Ellis\u2019s claim about the defective section 851 notice was available \u2014 and not squarely foreclosed by circuit precedent\u2014 throughout Ellis\u2019s trial, direct appeal, and post-conviction proceedings. Because Ellis cannot show that his section 2255 remedies were \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d for purposes of triggering the savings clause, he cannot proceed under section 2241. <em>See Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. To the extent that Ellis\u2019s contention that he is serving an \u201cillegal life sentence\u201d can be construed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>an assertion that he is actually innocent of his enhanced sentence (and, thus, supposedly entitled to raise a claim in a section 2241 petition), even if the sentencing court had disregarded completely Ellis\u2019s 1994 cocaine trafficking charge, Ellis \u2014 who un-disputedly had another prior felony drug conviction about which the government filed a proper section 851 notice \u2014 would still have been eligible for a lawful life sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). Thus, this case is not one where the alleged sentencing error resulted in a sentence greater than the statutory maximum. <em>Cf. Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1319 n. 20 (\u201cthe savings clause does not apply to sentencing errors that do not push the term of imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">The district court dismissed properly Ellis\u2019s section 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-11\">. After his <em>nolo contendere </em>plea, Ellis absconded and remained a fugitive until his arrest for federal drug offenses in this case. Final judgment was entered against Ellis for the cocaine trafficking charges two years after Ellis was sentenced in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b919-16\">. The government concedes that it filed a defective section 851 notice: not yet convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b920-7\">. Ellis does not need a certificate of appeala-bility to appeal the dismissal of his section 2241 petition. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (federal prisoners proceeding under section 2241 do not need a certificate of appealability to appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b920-11\">. Ellis filed his first section 2255 motion in 2000, which the district court denied on the merits. Ellis later filed two other motions challenging his sentence which were construed as section 2255 motions and denied as successive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b921-8\">. This case is readily distinguishable from the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Panetti, Slack, </em>and <em>Martinez-Villareal, </em>each of which involved claims that were unripe for review, unexhausted, or premature when petitioner's first habeas petitions were filed. <em>See Panetti v. Quarterman, </em>551 U.S. 930, 127 S.Ct. 2842, 2855, 168 L.Ed.2d 662 (2007) (concluding that \"[t]he statutory bar on 'second or successive\u2019 applications does not apply to a <em>Ford [v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 399, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986)] claim brought in an application filed when the claim is first ripe.\u201d); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1601, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (\"a habe-as petition which is filed after an initial petition was dismissed without adjudication on the merits for failure to exhaust state remedies is not a 'second or successive\u2019 petition\u201d); <em>Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, </em>523 U.S. 637, 118 S.Ct. 1618, 1622, 140 L.Ed.2d 849 (1998) (concluding that petitioner\u2019s <em>Ford </em>claim, which had been raised in an earlier petition and dismissed as premature, was not \"second or successive.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b921-13\">. A \"second or successive\" section 2255 motion cannot be filed unless it is certified to contain \"(1) newly discovered evidence ... sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
