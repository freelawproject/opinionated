Hamilton (\u201cHamilton\u201d), a former employee of AVPM Corporation, initiated an action in Texas state court against AVPM Corporation and Waters Landing Apartment (collectively, \u201cAVPM\u201d), asserting claims of race and age discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000 <em>et seq., </em>and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>AVPM removed the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1441. The district court later granted AVPM\u2019s summary judgment motion on both of Hamilton\u2019s claims. Hamilton appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on her race discrimination claim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the grounds that the court overlooked genuine issues of fact in its summary judgment ruling, and that it mistakenly excluded relevant evidence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-15\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b340-16\">AVPM owns and operates nineteen apartment complexes in the DallasFort Worth area, including Waters Landing in Fort Worth, Texas. At each complex, the company employs a property manager, ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ministrative staff, and maintenance staff; additionally, AVPM employs property supervisors, each with oversight responsibilities over a group of complexes. Hamilton began working for AVPM as the assistant property manager at Waters Landing in April 2010. In January 2011, she was promoted to the position of property manager of that same complex. Laura Eaton, the property supervisor who oversaw Waters Landing, was responsible for hiring and promoting Hamilton. In May 2011, Eaton sought a reduction in the number of apartment complexes under her jurisdiction, and subsequently, Robert Englard assumed supervisory duties over Waters Landing and several other AVPM properties in the Fort Worth area.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Englard visited Waters Landing soon after to meet -with Hamilton and her staff. During that visit, he commented to Hamilton that everyone in the grounds crew was African American. Hamilton, who is also African American, responded by asking if that would be a problem, to which Englard looked \u201camazed\u201d but otherwise made no reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">As property manager, Hamilton was responsible for maintaining two lists: (1) vacant apartments that were \u201cready\u201d for leasing/move-in, and (2) vacant apartments that she and the maintenance crew needed to \u201cmake ready\u201d for leasing/move-in. These lists were the \u201cbible\u201d of the apartment complex, and particularly critical when showing vacant units to prospective tenants. During Hamilton\u2019s tenure as property manager at Waters Landing, the complex had the highest vacancy rate of any of the nineteen AVPM properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Either during Englard\u2019s initial visit to Waters Landing or one shortly thereafter, he and Hamilton walked around the apartment complex and visited several vacant units that were marked as \u201cready.\u201d However, at least one \u201cready\u201d apartment was, in fact, not ready.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Hamilton went on vacation in June 2011, Englard visited Waters Landing again and found more inaccuracies in the \u201cready\u201d and \u201cmake ready\u201d lists. Englard decided that he could no longer trust Hamilton to perform the duties of a property manager, and he fired her after she returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">AVPM provided all employees with an employee manual that contained, <em>inter alia, </em>a description of the company\u2019s internal disciplinary policy, and a statement that all workers were employed at will, subject to termination at any time with or without cause or advance notice. The disciplinary policy defined the types of actions that \u201cmay be taken in response\u201d to violations of AVPM standards, including oral warnings, written warnings, and immediate termination. Neither Eaton nor Englard had documented any warnings in Hamilton\u2019s employee record before she was terminated. Both stated that they had also fired Caucasian property managers without providing written warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Hamilton and Eaton had three relevant conversations about AVPM. The first occurred when Eaton called Hamilton immediately after Eaton was fired as a property supervisor, and she bemoaned AVPM\u2019s hiring of \u201cbubbly white little girls\u201d to fill management positions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Eaton was rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>stated in her position three days later. The second and third conversations took place after Robert Englard fired Hamilton. At that time, Eaton was a property supervisor, but she no longer oversaw Hamilton or Waters Landing. In the second conversation, Eaton implied that race played a factor in Hamilton\u2019s termination, noting that AVPM might have been concerned about friction between Hamilton and the entirely African American grounds crew at Waters Landing. In the third conversation, Eaton told Hamilton that AVPM had realized it had fired Hamilton \u201cfor no reason,\u201d and asked if the company had contacted Hamilton about returning to work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Following her discharge, Hamilton filed this lawsuit, alleging race discrimination under Title VII and age discrimination under the ADEA. AVPM filed a motion for summary judgment, and in its reply brief, also lodged four evidentiary objections to statements used by Hamilton in her opposition to the motion. The district court sustained all four objections and granted AVPM\u2019s motion for summary judgment on both counts. Hamilton appeals, claiming that (1) the court erred in sustaining AVPM\u2019s objections, and (2) an issue of fact exists as to whether AVPM\u2019s reason for terminating her is pretext for race discrimination. We have jurisdiction over Hamilton\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In doing so, we consider the record as a whole, without weighing the evidence or making credibility determinations, and \u201cdraw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A party is entitled to summary judgment if \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A genuine dispute of material fact exists when the \u201cevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We review evi-dentiary rulings for manifest error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our practice has been first to \u201creview the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, which define the summary judgment record,\u201d and then to review the \u201csummary judgment decision <em>de </em>novo.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">B. Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">In its summary judgment opinion, the district court excluded four items of evi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>denee relied on by Hamilton in her briefing before that court. The first was a statement made by Robert Englard during his deposition; the other three were statements allegedly made by Laura Eaton to Hamilton, as repeated by Hamilton in her own deposition. Hamilton contends that all four statements were excluded in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">1. Englard\u2019s Deposition Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Hamilton challenges the district court\u2019s exclusion of Robert Englard\u2019s statement about hypothetical racial bias. During Englard\u2019s deposition, Hamilton\u2019s counsel asked about Englard\u2019s earlier comment to Hamilton that the entire grounds crew at Waters Landing was African American. Although Englard denied making the comment, he agreed with Hamilton\u2019s counsel that it was possible for \u201csomeone\u201d who heard such a comment to think that the hypothetical speaker \u201cmight\u201d have racial bias. We agree with the district court: \u201cEnglard\u2019s comment about how some unnamed, hypothetical person might perceive his remark is pure speculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Under Federal Rules of Evidence 602 and 701, lay testimony must arise from the witness\u2019s \u201cpersonal knowledge of the matter\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and be \u201crationally based on the witness\u2019s perception.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, the Advisory Committee explains .Rule 701(a) as the \u201cfamiliar requirement of first-hand knowledge or observation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We also require that lay opinion testimony be \u201chelpful to the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Nowhere does Englard, as Hamilton contends, assert his <em>own </em>opinion as to the meaning of the comment or make an admission regarding his <em>own </em>state of mind when allegedly making it. His testimony about the hypothetical \u201csomeone\u201d has no basis in his own perceptions, observations, or knowledge. Furthermore, his opinion as to what \u201csomeone\u201d might think is not helpful to the factfinder. The relevant issue is whether Englard acted with racial bias, not whether \u201csomeone\u201d else might think him to be racist. Englard\u2019s speculation as to that hypothetical listener\u2019s state of mind is irrelevant and unhelpful. We conclude that the district court made no manifest error in excluding this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">2. Hamilton\u2019s Deposition Testimony About Eaton\u2019s Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">Hamilton also challenges the district court\u2019s exclusion of three statements, made during her own deposition, that she attributed to Laura Eaton, her former manager at AVPM. The first statement allegedly occurred immediately after Eaton had been fired from AVPM. According to Hamilton, Eaton lamented the difficulty of \u201cget[ting] another job at [their] age\u201d and faulted AVPM for hiring \u201cbubbly white little girls.\u201d Eaton\u2019s second statement also occurred during a conversation between Hamilton and Eaton, this time after Hamilton\u2019s termination. In it, Eaton implied that Hamilton\u2019s termination was motivated by race \u2014 specifically, that AVPM had concerns about the African American grounds crew at Waters Landing, who \u201ccouldn\u2019t intimidate [Hamilton] like they\u2019re used to doing with other women that don\u2019t speak up.\u201d Eaton\u2019s third statement occurred a few days after Hamilton\u2019s termination, when Eaton called to tell her that the company discovered it had fired her \u201cfor no reason.\u201d According to Hamilton, Eaton then asked if AVPM had contacted Hamilton about returning to work. The district court excluded all three statements as inadmissible hearsay. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>It also excluded the first two statements as speculation and the third for lack of foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Hamilton claims that Eaton\u2019s statements are not hearsay as provided in Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(D).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, \u201c[u]nder our general rule, arguments not raised before the district court are waived and will not be considered on appeal unless the party can demonstrate \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We find extraordinary circumstances when \u201cthe issue involved is a pure question of law and a miscarriage of justice would result from our failure to consider it.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Hamilton failed to respond to AVPM\u2019s objections before the district court and makes no argument before us as to extraordinary circumstances, thus waiving this theory on appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">C. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">1. Title YII Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">We evaluate Title VII race discrimination cases using a modified <em>McDonnell-Douglas </em>approach.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Hamilton must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. The burden of production then shifts to AVPM to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for her discharge. If it does so, Hamilton must then show either that the proffered reason is pretext for discrimination or that AVPM acted with mixed motives, one of which was discriminatory. Hamilton has not argued before this court or the district court that AVPM acted with mixed motives. Thus, to avoid summary judgment, Hamilton must produce \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that the proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason articulated by AVPM is false or unworthy of credence, and therefore pretext for discrimination.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">2. Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory Reason</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">On appeal, AVPM does not dispute that Hamilton has established a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We therefore start with the second step of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>McDonnell-Douglas </em>framework and consider if AVPM has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Hamilton\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">AVPM contends that they discharged Hamilton because she \u201crepeatedly list[ed] apartments as ready to lease when in fact they were not ready.\u201d As a result, Robert Englard no longer trusted her to do her job effectively. Hamilton contends that this reason is not legitimate because AVPM did not follow its internal disciplinary policy. According to Hamilton, only employees guilty of a \u201cserious\u201d violation would be terminated -without documented warning, and the policy\u2019s list of serious violations did not include Hamilton\u2019s alleged transgressions. Thus, Hamilton reasons, because \u201cthe guidelines demonstrate what the employer thought was a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for termination,\u201d any reason not listed must by definition be illegitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Hamilton\u2019s reasoning is flawed. She does not dispute that she was an employee at will, subject to dismissal for any reason not statutorily prohibited. Indeed, she concedes that AVPM\u2019s guidelines do not constrain its discretion to make employment decisions: She could be terminated for \u201cgood cause, or bad cause, or no cause at all.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Furthermore, even if we accepted Hamilton\u2019s premise, she does not \u2014 and indeed, cannot \u2014 contend that the list in the employee manual is exclusive. In fact, the manual defines serious violations as \u201cdrug policy violation, sexual harassment ... destruction of company property, etc.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> That <em>et cetera </em>contains a multitude of sins. An employer\u2019s belief that she repeatedly failed to perform a critical job function, even if erroneous, would nonetheless justify her immediate termination under this provision. Because Englard\u2019s dissatisfaction with Hamilton\u2019s job performance would have been a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for discharging her, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination that AVPM satisfied its burden of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">3. Pretext</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">Accordingly, we now turn to the third step of the <em>McDonnell-Douglas </em>framework and consider whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact that AVPM\u2019s reason for terminating Hamilton was pretext.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Hamilton contends that (1) AVPM\u2019s failure to follow its internal disciplinary policy when terminating Hamilton, (2) AVPM\u2019s inconsistent explanations for Hamilton\u2019s termination, (3) AVPM\u2019s desire to reinstate Hamilton after realizing that her discharge was for no good reason, and (4) Englard\u2019s comment about the grounds crew being African American, all demonstrate that the company\u2019s proffered reason is pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">a. Disciplinary Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">First, Hamilton claims that AVPM failed to follow its internal disciplinary policy when terminating her, and that this failure demonstrates the pretextual nature of the termination. Although an \u201cemployer\u2019s failure to follow its own policies may be probative of discriminatory intent,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> we require discharged employees in discrimination eases to show, in addition, that they were treated differently from non-minority employees.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We insist on this additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>evidence because \u201cTitle VII does not protect employees from the arbitrary employment practices of their employer, only their discriminatory impact.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Hamilton offers no evidence suggesting that AVPM followed the internal disciplinary policy with non \u2014 African American employees and deviated from it in her case only. In fact, Englard stated that he also terminated three Caucasian property managers at AVPM-owned complexes for performance issues, none of whom received a written warning. Eaton testified to similar effect as to property managers under her supervision. Accordingly, AVPM\u2019s failure to follow its internal disciplinary policy does not create a factual issue as to the falsity of its proffered reason for discharging Hamilton.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">b.Inconsistent Explanations</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Second, Hamilton insists that AVPM submitted inconsistent explanations for terminating her, and that the district court erred in finding no evidence of pretext in this inconsistency. At various points, AVPM gave three reasons for firing Hamilton: (1) inaccuracy in listing apartments as \u201cready,\u201d (2) inability to do the job, and (3) lack of trust to do the job. Although Hamilton is correct that inconsistency could suggest pretext,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> no such inconsistency exists here. The district court aptly characterized these explanations as different only as to them level of generality. At the highest level, AVPM did not trust Hamilton to do the job of property manager. On a lower level, Englard distrusted her because he believed that she was unable to do the job correctly. And at the lowest level of generality, the reason he thought her incapable was her failure to keep accurate \u201cready\u201d and \u201cmake ready\u201d lists. There is no inconsistency, and thus no evidence of pretext, in AVPM\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Hamilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">c. Reinstatement</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Third, Hamilton relies on Eaton\u2019s statement that Hamilton was fired for \u201cno reason\u201d and may be asked back to AVPM as evidence undermining AVPM\u2019s stated reason for terminating her. However, the only basis for this assertion is inadmissible hearsay, as explained above. Thus, we do not consider it when reviewing a grant of summary judgment.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">d. Englard\u2019s Comment</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">Finally, Hamilton contends that Englard\u2019s comment about the race of the grounds crew at Waters Landing is evidence of racial bias. In her deposition testimony, Hamilton claimed that Englard had, when he first visited the Waters Landing apartment complex, observed to her that the entire grounds crew was African American.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Although Englard denies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the exchange took place, we make all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmov-ant when reviewing a grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Because Hamilton has failed to produce substantial evidence of pretext, we apply this court\u2019s \u201cstray remarks\u201d doctrine to Englard\u2019s comment.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> A remark is evidence of discrimination if it is (1) related to the protected class of which the plaintiff is a member, (2) proximate in time to the adverse employment action, (B) made by an individual with authority over that action, and (4) related to that action.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> \u201cComments that do not meet these criteria are considered \u2018stray remarks\u2019 and, standing alone, are insufficient to defeat summary judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Englard\u2019s comment satisfies the first three elements of the stray remarks test: (1) it relates to Hamilton\u2019s race, as she and the grounds crew are all African American, (2) it occurred shortly before she was fired, and (3) it was made by Englard, who both parties agree was the primary deci-sionmaker behind Hamilton\u2019s discharge. However, there is no evidence that En-glard\u2019s observation about the race of the grounds crew was related to the decision to terminate Hamilton. Thus, Englard\u2019s comment is insufficient to raise an issue of fact as to whether AVPM\u2019s stated reason for terminating Hamilton was pretext for race discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Hamilton fails to point to sufficient summary judgment evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether AVPM\u2019s proffered reason for terminating her was pretext for race discrimination. Thus, AVPM is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. The district court\u2019s grant of AVPM\u2019s motion for summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-17\">. Hamilton does not appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on her age discrimination claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">. There is some dispute in the record as to how many inaccuracies Englard found. There is also dispute as to whether Eaton found similar inaccuracies when she visited, in the months before Englard assumed supervisory duties over Waters Landing. However, both parties agree that Englard discovered at least one error when he accompanied Hamilton on a walkthrough of the complex.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b341-12\">.

It excludes from the hearsay rule only those statements offered against an opposing patty that were \"made by the party\u2019s agent or employee on a matter <em>within the scope of that relationship </em>and <em>while it existed.\u201d </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D) (emphasis supplied). The record is clear: Eaton was not an employee of AVPM at the time she allegedly spoke about \"bubbly white little girls,\u201d and so her first statement is not admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(D). As for Eaton\u2019s second and third statements, Hamilton has not laid a proper foundation for admitting them. Even if, as Hamilton asserts, Eaton \"was familiar with the circumstances regarding Hamilton\u2019s termination,\u201d it is undisputed that Eaton was not her supervisor at that time. Hamilton has offered no evidence to suggest that Eaton played any role in the termination decision or that the decision fell within the scope of <em>Eatons </em>employment with AVPM. The possibility of reinstating Hamilton likewise remained outside Eaton's purview. Thus, Eaton's second and third statements are not admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b344-16\">. <em>E.g., Vaughn v.
