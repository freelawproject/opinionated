Donley, Sr., appeals from the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. We have jurisdiction because both parties consented to proceed before the magistrate judge. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(3). Donley originally brought suit against Hudsons Salvage and both parties signed a consent form permitting final resolution of the case by a magistrate judge. \u00a7 636(c)(3). The magistrate judge granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Donley appealed, and we affirmed. The Supreme Court then denied certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-20\">Donley argues that he never consented to have the particular magistrate judge who heard his case and that this magistrate judge lacked \u201cpersonal jurisdiction.\u201d In addition to the numerous problems with the merits of this argument, this case was fully resolved, appealed, and certiorari was denied. Donley\u2019s argument is moot and for that reason the judgment of the magistrate judge is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-18\"> Pursuant to Fifth Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
