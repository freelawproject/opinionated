This court denied Lewis\u2019s appeal of the judgment in April 2014. <em>See Lewis v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA., </em>559 Fed.Appx. 404 (5th Cir.2014). While his appeal in that case was pending before this court, Lewis filed a nearly identical suit against Chase and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>second Defendant-Appellant, the Baton Rouge Police Department, the following month in November 2013. In both suits, Lewis wholly failed to assert any comprehensible or legally cognizable claims. Since his initial suit, Lewis has advanced numerous frivolous filings in the district court and in this court. Additionally, eleven months ago, in denying his <em>pro se </em>petition for writ of mandamus and motion to expedite petition, this court issued a warning directing Lewis to refrain from filing further frivolous filings in the district court and this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In April 2014, the district court granted Chase\u2019s motion to dismiss Lewis\u2019s second suit (filed in November 2013) against Defendants-Appellants advancing the same frivolous, incomprehensible, conclusory allegations against them. In that judgment the district court also enjoined Lewis from filing any future litigation against Chase based on the same \u201cfacts\u201d in this action or in the initial suit filed against Chase in 2012. Lewis appeals that judgment herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Because we again find Lewis\u2019s appeal to be frivolous and entirely without merit, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
