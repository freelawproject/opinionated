In determining the sentence, the district court increased Avellaneda\u2019s offense level by eight levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), because he was convicted prior to his deportation of an aggravated felony, that is, the Texas offense of felony theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-20\">Avellaneda argues that the record does not establish the subsection of Texas\u2019s theft statute that he was convicted of violating, and that the state\u2019s theft statute encompasses conduct broader than the generic contemporary definition of theft because it criminalizes the appropriation of property that has been induced by fraud or deception. He concedes, however, that this issue is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>768 F.3d 437, 438 (5th Cir.2014), which was decided during the pendency of this appeal, and he states that he wishes to preserve the issue for further review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
