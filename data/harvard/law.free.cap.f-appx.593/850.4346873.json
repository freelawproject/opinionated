He contends that the sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">On August 2, 2013, Castro pleaded guilty to a one count indictment charging him with illegal reentry to the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). The presentence investigation report (PSR) recommended a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of VI, resulting in an advisory guidelines range of 77 to 96 months imprisonment. The PSR noted that the statutory maximum penalty is 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">Castro filed a motion for a downward variance from the guidelines range. He argued that such a variance was appropriate because his reentry was motivated by cultural ties to the United States and the desire to be with his five children, all of whom are United States citizens. The government filed a response to the motion and argued that the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors weighed against a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">At sentencing Castro\u2019s counsel continued to argue for a variance, stating that a criminal history category of VI overrepresented the seriousness of Castro\u2019s prior criminal conduct and that illegal reentry was a \u201cpassive\u201d offense motivated only by Castro\u2019s significant ties to the United States. The government reiterated its opposition to the motion and emphasized Castro\u2019s criminal history, which involves fifteen convictions, including two for burglary of a dwelling, four for possession of marijuana, and one for illegal reentry. The government also noted that Castro has been arrested four times since his most recent illegal reentry, including once for domestic battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">The district court denied Castro\u2019s motion for a downward variance, finding that it was \u201cinappropriate in light of [his] criminal history category.\u201d After stating that it had considered the statements of the parties, \u201cthe advisory guideline computation\u201d contained in the PSR, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range (77 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">This is Castro\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\">Castro argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court presumed that a sentence within the guideline range was reasonable and then \u201cweighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors unreasonably.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">\u201cWe review sentencing decisions only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-19\">First, we review to \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or .failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The second step is to determine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201c[W]e are to vacate the sentence if, but only if, we \u2018are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Castro\u2019s sentence of 77 months is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. Before imposing its sentence, the district court stated that it considered the statements of the parties, \u201cthe advisory guideline computation\u201d contained in the PSR, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. It is clear from the record, in other words, that the district court did not presume that the guidelines range was reasonable; instead, the court considered Castro\u2019s arguments in support of a downward variance, treated the range as advisory, and weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">The district court was not required to engage in a lengthy discussion of each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that a district court is not required \u201cto state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d). The court was also not required, as Castro suggests, to discuss each and every mitigating circumstance mentioned in Castro\u2019s motion for a downward variance, including the representation that Castro\u2019s crime was motivated by cultural assimilation and the desire to care for his children. The court\u2019s statement that a downward variance was \u201cinappropriate in light of [Castro\u2019s] criminal history category\u201d was an adequate explanation of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Finally we note that Castro\u2019s sentence is at the low end of the advisory guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum of 20 years. Those are both indicators of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[W]e ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
