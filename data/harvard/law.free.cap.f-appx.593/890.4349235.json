After careful review, and for the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-19\">On March 20, 2012, Ms. Moseley, a passenger on the Carnival cruise ship <em>Fantasy, </em>visited the bathroom facilities at Free-port Harbour, Bahamas, a port of call that Carnival uses. She sustained severe injuries when a bathroom sink dislodged and fell on her. She filed suit against Carnival on February 4, 2013, alleging in Count I that Carnival was negligent for failure to inspect and maintain the Freeport Har-bour bathroom facility, as well as for failure to warn of dangers in the facility. In Count II, she alleged that Carnival was vicariously liable under an agency theory for the negligence of the Freeport Har-bour Company (\u201cFreeport\u201d), the operator of the bathroom facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-20\">Upon Carnival\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed Ms. Moseley\u2019s complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. The court concluded that Carnival as a shipowner had no duty to inspect facilities at a port of call<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that Ms. Moseley had failed to state a claim (1) for negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>failure to warn because she pled no facts showing Carnival knew or should have known of the risk of injury and (2) for vicarious liability because she pled no facts to support Carnival\u2019s alleged agency relationship with Freeport.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The court\u2019s first dismissal was without prejudice. Ms. Moseley then filed an amended complaint in which she made few changes to her allegations in Count I. She added factual allegations regarding Carnival\u2019s relationship with Freeport, which she referenced in her amended version of Count II. Her allegations in Count II otherwise remained almost identical to her original complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">On November 25, 2018, Carnival again moved to dismiss. Ms. Moseley neither timely filed .a response nor moved to file a second amended complaint. Four days after Ms. Moseley\u2019s response to the motion to dismiss was due, and after some discovery had been completed, Carnival moved for summary judgment. In her timely response to that motion, Ms. Moseley noted that she also opposed Carnival\u2019s November 25 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The district court did not immediately rule on either motion, so the parties continued with discovery, pre-trial motions, and trial preparation. And, because the court had previously ordered the parties to mediate their dispute, the court continued to set' mediation deadlines. On June 4, 2014, the court granted Carnival\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismissed as moot all pending motions. In so doing, the court noted that Ms. Moseley failed to cure the deficiencies identified in the first dismissal order. Ms. Moseley appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting the complaint\u2019s allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., </em>693 F.3d 1333, 1335 (11th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). We do not, however, accept as true \u201cunwarranted deductions of fact\u201d or legal conclusions. <em>Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce, N.A., </em>416 F.3d 1242, 1248 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, a \u201ccomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must plead \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The mere possibility that the defendant may have acted unlawfully is insufficient. <em>Id. </em>We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to grant leave to amend for an abuse of discretion. <em>Troville v. Venz, </em>303 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">\u201cIn analyzing a maritime tort case, we rely on general principles of negligence law.\u201d <em>Chaparro, </em>693 F.3d at 1336 (internal quotation marks omitted). To plead a viable claim for negligence, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) the defendant owed a duty to protect the plaintiff from a particular injury; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the breach actually and proximately caused the plaintiffs injury; and (4) the plaintiff suffered actual harm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number><em>See id. </em>\u201c[A] shipowner owes the duty of exercising reasonable care towards those lawfully aboard the vessel who are not members of the crew.\u201d <em>Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, </em>358 U.S. 625, 630, 79 S.Ct. 406, 3 L.Ed.2d 550 (1959). Reasonable care in this context means, \u201cas a prerequisite to imposing liability, that the carrier have had actual or constructive notice of the risk-creating condition, at least where ... the menace is one commonly encountered on land and not clearly linked to nautical adventure.\u201d <em>Keefe v. Bahama Cruise Line, Inc., </em>867 F.2d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1989). In other words, a cruise line owes passengers a duty to warn \u201cof known dangers beyond the point of debarkation in places where passengers are invited or reasonably expected to visit.\u201d <em>Chaparro, </em>693 F.3d at 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">We agree with the district court that Ms. Moseley\u2019s amended complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Although it is clear from our case law that Carnival owes Ms. Moseley a duty to warn of dangers at a port of call that Carnival knows or should know to exist, Ms. Moseley failed in her amended complaint to allege any facts that would support Carnival\u2019s actual or constructive notice of danger. Without any factual allegations to support this critical element, Ms. Moseley\u2019s complaint raises no more than a \u201cmere possibility of misconduct,\u201d which is insufficient under <em>Iqbal </em>to withstand a motion to dismiss. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937; <em>Chaparro, </em>693 F.3d at 1336. Similarly, even assuming Carnival could be hable for failure to inspect or maintain the facilities at Freeport Harbour, Ms. Moseley\u2019s claims against Carnival on these bases would fail for the same reason. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that the claims Ms. Moseley asserted in Count I fail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">We also agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Ms. Moseley failed to state a claim for relief in Count II, vicarious liability. \u201c[W]e may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below.\u201d <em>Simpson v. Sanderson Farms, Inc., </em>744 F.3d 702, 705 (11th Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Assuming Ms. Moseley\u2019s amended complaint adequately pled the elements of an agency relationship between Carnival and Freeport, she nevertheless failed to include any facts which, if true, would establish a basis for her allegation that Free-port knew or should have known of the risk by the use of reasonable care and yet failed to correct the problem. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. And, because she has failed adequately to plead the elements of a negligence claim against Free-port, her claim that Carnival is vicariously liable for that negligence- must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Ms. Moseley maintains that, regardless of any deficiencies in her factual allegations, we should remand to the district court because, in granting Carnival\u2019s motion to dismiss long after it was filed and during mediation and trial preparations, the court materially prejudiced her rights. We review claims that a district court mismanaged its docket to the prejudice of a litigant for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1366-67 (11th Cir.1997). In this case, even when faced with a second motion to dismiss, Ms. Moseley neither timely responded nor sought an opportunity to cure the alleged deficiencies in her amended complaint. Thus, although the district court could have disposed of this case more efficiently by ruling on the second motion to dismiss before, for example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>ordering and setting a date for mediation, Ms. Moseley\u2019s failure to pursue her own rights by timely responding to Carnival\u2019s second motion to dismiss forecloses any conclusion that she was prejudiced by the court\u2019s docket management. For this same reason, we conclude the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Ms. Moseley\u2019s claim with prejudice did not amount to an abuse of discretion. <em>See Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir.2002) <em>(en </em>banc) (holding the district court \u201cis not required to grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint sua sponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by counsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested leave to amend before the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Ms. Moseley\u2019s amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-13\">. The district court apparently treated the alleged duties to inspect and maintain as one duty for purposes of its first dismissal order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b916-7\">. Ms. Moseley\u2019s amended complaint contained three counts: Counts I and II mirrored those in her original complaint, and Count III added a claim against Freeport. The claim against Freeport subsequently was dismissed and is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
