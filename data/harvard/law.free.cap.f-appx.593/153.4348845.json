We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Tran owned a large fishing boat, the <em>Alexander II, </em>on which he maintained a $400,000 casualty insurance policy. In 2009, frustrated with his return on investment, Tran attempted to persuade the <em>Alexander II\u2019s </em>captain to sink the boat. Despite an offer of $10,000 and Tran\u2019s persistent prodding, the captain refused to do so. Undeterred, Tran (with the help of his \u201cright hand man,\u201d Manh Nguyen) hired a new captain, Henry Anholt, to sink the boat. Anholt then recruited a crew to assist in the <em>Alexander IPs </em>destruction. For his efforts, each crew member was to receive $2,000 from Tran, while Anholt would receive more.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Anholt and his crew developed a plan to sink the boat, and, in August of 2009, they set sail on what they believed would be the <em>Alexander IPs </em>final voyage. After piloting the boat to a location over 80 miles off the coast of New Jersey, they filled much of it with water, sent a distress call to the Coast Guard, and abandoned ship. The Coast Guard retrieved the crew from a life raft and returned them to land early the next morning. Later that day, Anholt and his crew spoke with Nguyen about their efforts. Nguyen, on Tran\u2019s behalf, paid cash to the mariners to compensate them for their trouble.' The payments were less than the previously agreed upon sums, so Anholt and one crew member went with Nguyen to Tran\u2019s office to confront him about the disparity. Once there, Nguyen entered Tran\u2019s office and returned with more cash, which he gave to Anholt, who in turn paid the crew member. Nguyen subsequently made additional cash payments to Anholt on Tran\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Despite the crew\u2019s efforts, the <em>Alexander II </em>avoided a watery grave, remaining afloat until it was towed to land two days after the failed attempt to sink it. In the meantime, Tran hastened to file a claim to collect $400,000 \u2014 the full policy amount\u2014 from his insurer the day his crew was rescued.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Within days of the rescue, the FBI began investigating the circumstances of the sinking. One of Anholt\u2019s crew members eventually admitted to the scheme, telling the FBI that Nguyen and Anholt asked him to help sink the boat. Anholt then admitted that he destroyed the <em>Alexander II </em>and that Tran and Nguyen paid him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">Tran was indicted and arrested in June 2011. In November of that year, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to destroy a vessel in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2271. At his plea hearing, Tran confirmed that he \u201cdevelop[ed] a plan to sink the <em>Alexander II </em>in order to get the insurance money for the boat\u201d; that the \u201cplan involve[d] hiring a captain and paying him and his crew to sink the boat\u201d; that Nguyen was Tran\u2019s \u201cright hand man\u201d; and that he \u201cg[a]ve Nguyen ... money to give the captain and crew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">In the plea agreement that accompanied Tran\u2019s guilty plea, the parties agreed to recommend a total United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) offense level of 19, which included a two-level enhancement because Tran was \u201can organizer, leader, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>manager, and supervisor\u201d of the conspiracy. Disagreeing with the parties, the Probation Office recommended in the Pre-sentence Investigation Report that Tran receive a four-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) because he was an \u201corganizer or leader\u201d of the enterprise, rather than simply a \u201cmanager or supervisor.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.1. The total offense level recommended by the Probation Office was 21, which resulted in a Guidelines range of 87-46 months\u2019 imprisonment, as opposed to 30-37 months under the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">At sentencing, both Tran and the Government objected to the four-level role adjustment recommended by the Probation Office, requesting that the District Court abide by the plea agreement\u2019s two-level adjustment. The Court overruled the objection. In doing so, it noted several facts it found important in determining that Tran was an \u201corganizer or leader\u201d of the conspiracy: Tran \u201cplanned the scheme to sink the boat\u201d; he \u201cpaid the hired hands, including the captain\u201d; he \u201cdirect[ed] Nguyen\u201d; he \u201chad the claim to the larger share of the fruits of the crime\u201d; and, in short, he \u201ccalled the shots.\u201d The District Court then sentenced Tran to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment. Tran now appeals, arguing that the District Court should have applied only a two-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we review Tran\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cWe review the District Court\u2019s factual findings relevant to the Guidelines for clear error and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. West, </em>643 F.3d 102, 105 (3d Cir.2011) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Tran argues that the District Court erred in applying a four-level enhancement instead of the two-level enhancement to which he and the Government stipulated in the plea agreement. Under USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), a four-level enhancement is appropriate \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants....\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">The gravamen of Tran\u2019s claim is that to be deemed an \u201corganizer or leader\u201d under the Guidelines he must be a supervisor or manager. And because he did not actively supervise the crew that sank his boat, he argues, he cannot be the leader of the conspiracy as contemplated by \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Tran also argues that the relevant factors to consider when applying \u00a7 3B1.1 \u2014 found in the application notes to that section of the Guidelines \u2014 counsel against application of the enhancement to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">We need not decide whether Tran\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) is correct, because even if it is true that one must be a supervisor or manager to qualify as a \u201cleader or organizer,\u201d Tran\u2019s actions supported the four-level enhancement. Tran directly supervised at least one person: his \u201cright hand man,\u201d Nguyen. By Tran\u2019s own admission, he hatched the plan to sink <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>his boat and solicited two captains to carry out the plan. After Anholt agreed to do so, Tran hired him, and Nguyen acted as Tran\u2019s liaison with Anholt and his crew. On Tran\u2019s behalf, Nguyen discussed the failed sinking of the boat with the crew and paid the crew with money from Tran. When the crew was dissatisfied with Tran\u2019s underpayment, Nguyen led them to Tran\u2019s office. Once they arrived there, Nguyen met with and received more cash from Tran, then gave it to Anholt and his crew \u2014 again on Tran\u2019s behalf. Nguyen\u2019s actions and Tran\u2019s own statements provide ample evidence that Tran supervised at least one other person.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, even under Tran\u2019s legal interpretation of \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), the District Court\u2019s decision to apply a four-level enhancement to Tran was not clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The application notes to \u00a7 3B1.1 also support the District Court\u2019s decision. Those notes provide factors to consider in applying the enhancement, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acj\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others- This adjustment does not apply to a defendant who merely suggests committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV4\">USSG \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Tran takes a myopic view of nearly all of these factors. He argues that he \u201cexercised no decision making authority\u201d; that he \u201cdid not participate in the attempt to sink the ship\u201d; that although he recruited Anholt, \u201cit was Anholt who recruited the crew\u201d; and that he \u201cdid not exercise any control or authority over ... Anholt or his crew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The record belies Tran\u2019s characterizations. Tran certainly exercised some deci-sionmaking authority \u2014 indeed, he set the scheme in motion by deciding to sink his own boat. Similarly, although he may not have been on the boat when the crew attempted to sink it, the nature of his participation was not minor, as he formulated the idea, solicited Anholt (and a previous captain before him) to carry it out, and provided funding for the enterprise. He recruited Anholt, the captain and critical accomplice, who then recruited the rest of the crew. And although Tran may have exercised little direct control over Anholt, he did supervise Nguyen, who worked with the crew on Tran\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">The remaining factors also support the District Court\u2019s decision. Tran claimed a right to the lion\u2019s share of the proceeds from the crime \u2014 he attempted to collect on his $400,000 insurance policy while paying Anholt and his crew a relative pittance. Moreover, although the scope of the illegal activity was a single transaction, that transaction had broad effect. It involved several innocent parties, including the Coast Guard (who rescued Anholt and the crew) and the company that towed the <em>Alexander II </em>back to shore after the failed sinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">In sum, Tran was a far cry from \u201ca defendant who merely suggested] committing the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. '4. He devised the idea to sink the boat and solicited two captains to carry out his plan, moving to the second when the first re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>fused to do so. He paid the crew for their illegal acts. He stood to profit handsomely if his scheme was successful (and indeed sought to fraudulently collect on his insurance policy, even filing a lawsuit after his claim was denied). For these reasons, the District Court did not err when it applied the \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) four-level enhancement to Tran and we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b178-9\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-14\">. The insurer denied the claim due to suspected fraud, and, six months later, Tran filed a lawsuit to compel payment of the insurance money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">. Tran's appeal was not timely under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b), a fact that would have warranted dismissal had the Government raised it. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Muhammud, </em>701 F.3d 109, 111 (3d Cir.2012). However, although \"[t]he time limit for filing a criminal appeal set forth in Rule 4(b) is rigid[, it is] not jurisdictional, and may be waived if not invoked by the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Gov\u2019t of the V.I. v. Martinez, </em>620 F.3d 321, 328-29 (3d Cir.2010); <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 212, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007)). The Government waived its right to object.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b179-14\">. Tran does not argue that the enterprise involved fewer than five participants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">. Supervision of one person is sufficient to trigger \u00a7 3B1.1. <em>See United States v. Katora, </em>981 F.2d 1398, 1402 (3d Cir.1992) (\u201cTo apply section 3B1.1, a district court must find that the defendant exercised control over <em>at least one </em>other person.\u201d (citing <em>United States v. Fuentes, </em>954 F.2d 151, 153 (3d Cir.1992)) (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
