In a four-count indictment, Millan was charged with conspiracy to traffick cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count One); with related offenses (Counts Two and Three);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Count Four). A jury found him guilty on Count Four but was unable to reach a verdict on the other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">The government decided not to retry Millan on Counts One through Three. The District Court thereafter sentenced him on Count Four to a prison term of 108 months. Millan appeals his sentence, arguing that the District Court, in calculating his offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, erred in finding that he used or possessed the Glock pistol \u201cin connection with another felony offense,\u201d cocaine trafficking, and therefore erred in enhancing his base-offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). The court erred, Millan says, because there was insufficient evidence that the firearm found in his house was possessed in connection with the drug-trafficking conspiracy alleged in the indictment. Specifically, Millan argues that the $426,000 in cash found in his residence\u2014 money the District Court characterized as \u201cpossible drug proceeds\u201d \u2014 did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm was used or possessed in connection with the alleged drug conspiracy-</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the Guidelines to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2011). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, upon review of the evidence, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Id. </em>at 1195. We give substantial deference, moreover, to the District Court\u2019s findings regarding \u201ccredibility determinations with respect to witness testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 744 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">The government bears the burden of establishing the facts necessary to support a sentencing enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d 779, 783 (11th Cir.2007). Under the preponderance-of-the-evidenee standard, the trier of fact\u2014 here, the District Court \u2014 must believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than not. <em>United States v. Almedina, </em>686 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">Section 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) provides a four-level enhancement to a defendant\u2019s base-offense level if the defendant used or possessed a firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). In general, a firearm is possessed in connection with another felony offense when it facilitates or has the potential of facilitating that offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 14(A). With respect to drug trafficking, the enhancement is warranted when the firearm is found in close proximity to drugs, drug-manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia, because the presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitating the drug offense. <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 14(B); <em>see also United States v. Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d 82, 92 (11th Cir.2013) (addressing the enhancement in \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) and holding that \u201c[a] firearm found in close proximity to drugs or drug-related items simply <em>\u2018has\u2019 </em>\u2014 without any requirement for additional evidence\u2014 the potential to facilitate the drug offense\u201d). An offense can qualify as \u201canother felony offense\u201d even if no conviction was obtained with regard to that offense. <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 14(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The District Court\u2019s finding that a firearm was possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony offense is a factual finding we review for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Whitfield, </em>50 F.3d 947, 949 &amp; n. 8 (11th Cir.1995). We have stated that the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d should be given its ordinary meaning and have refused to construe it more narrowly. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 695 (11th Cir.2002). For example, in <em>Rhind, </em>we held that unloaded and inoperable firearms located in a vehicle used in carrying out a counterfeiting scheme were possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d the counterfeiting scheme in part because \u201cit would be reasonable to conclude that the presence of the firearms protected the counterfeit money from theft during the execution of the felony.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">In deciding to apply the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) enhancement, the District Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-8\">[B]ased on.... my recollection of the facts from the trial, ... I find that ... the defendant does indeed qualify for the four-level enhancement, even though he was found not guilty on the drug count.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-9\">And in light the fact that the officers found the $426,000 in cash, the unloaded Glock .40 caliber handgun and one loaded ten-round magazine next to the cash in defendant\u2019s bedroom and a hidden compartment inside the vehicle on the defendant\u2019s property, that coupled with the fact that the defendant\u2019s gun was found inside his bedroom in close proximity to the $426,000 in possible drug proceeds, one can conclude that the gun was possessed in connection with the drug conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">Doc. 338 at 12-13.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the District Court\u2019s view, \u201c[i]t was not that difficult to establish that [the $426,000 was] drug money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42. Moreover, Millan\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony providing an alternative explanation for the source of the money was \u201ctotally incredible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42-43. Finally, in referring to Millan\u2019s criminal history, the District Court told Millan: \u201cI have no doubt what you\u2019ve been doing for the past few years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">We find no error in the District Court\u2019s finding that Millan possessed the firearm in connection with the cocaine-trafficking conspiracy. Though the jury failed to return a verdict on the conspiracy charge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>the District Court had ample evidence before it on which to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the Glock pistol was used in connection with Millan\u2019s involvement in that conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-8\">. Count Two charged Millan with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); Count Three, with possession of a firearm in furtherance of the offenses in Counts One and Two, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b972-5\">. The jury\u2019s verdict indicates no verdict for Counts One through Three. The spaces for \"Guilty\u201d and \"Not Guilty\u201d were left blank, whereas on Count Four, the space for \"Guilty\u201d was check-marked. Doc. 269.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b972-6\">. A witness, Luis Colan testified that he had known Millan since 2011 and that he used to pick up packages of cocaine for Millan. Doc. 334 at 275-77. On one occasion, he used Millan\u2019s truck, a Toyota Sequoia, to pick up six kilograms of cocaine at the Ft. Lauderdale airport. Colan testified that the cocaine was placed in the truck's hidden compartment to hide it during the drive back to Tampa. <em>Id. </em>at 276.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
