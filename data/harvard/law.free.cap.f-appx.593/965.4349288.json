We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">I.BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">In September 2009, the Internal Revenue Service sent Longino a notice of deficiency for his payment of taxes for the year 2006, and the Service assessed Longi-no an accuracy-related penalty, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662. Longino filed a petition in the Tax Court that challenged both the deficiency and the penalty. The Tax Court ruled that, with three exceptions, Longino had failed to substantiate any of his claimed deductions and exemptions. The Tax Court determined that Longino\u2019s 2006 tax deficiency was $36,715 and imposed an additional penalty of $7,343 for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-17\">II.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b991-18\">We review the findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law <em>de novo. Blohm v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>994 F.2d 1542, 1548 (11th Cir.1993). We presume that the deficiency determination and the facts that support it are correct. <em>Estate of Whitt v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>751 F.2d 1548, 1556 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-19\">III.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b991-20\">We divide our discussion in five parts. First, we explain that the notice of deficiency was valid. Second, we explain that Longino is not entitled to claim three of his children as dependents. Third, we explain that Longino has not established that the Tax Court erred when it denied him a variety of deductions. Fourth, we explain that Longino has not established that the Tax Court erred when it calculated his deficiency. Fifth, we explain that Longino has not established that the Tax Court erred when it imposed an accuracy-related penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-21\">\n<em>A. The Notice of Deficiency That Longino Received Was Valid.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b991-22\">Longino argues that the notice of deficiency he received was defective, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>we disagree. He contends that the Service issued the notice only because he failed to attend a meeting at a Florida tax office. But the notice was sufficient on its face: it explained that \u201cthe [Service] ha[d] determined that a deficiency exists for a particular year and specified] the amount of the deficiency.\u201d <em>Bokum v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>992 F.2d 1136, 1139 (11th Cir.1993). We do not consider the \u201cmotives\u201d of the Service when it issues a notice of deficiency, <em>Gatlin v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>754 F.2d 921, 923 (11th Cir.1985), unless there is \u201csubstantial evidence of unconstitutional conduct\u201d and the \u201cintegrity of our judicial process\u201d is at stake, <em>Greenberg\u2019s Express, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>62 T.C. 324, 328 (1974). Because Longino offered no evidence of misconduct, the notice of deficiency was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">\n<em>B. Longino Is Not Entitled to Exemptions For Three of His Children.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Longino argues that he is entitled to exemptions for three of his children, but this argument fails. As a noncustodial parent, Longino may claim a child as a dependent only if the \u201ccustodial parent signs a written declaration\u201d that she will not claim the child for the relevant year and the \u201cnoncustodial parent attaches such written declaration\u201d to the tax return: 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e)(2)(A)-(B). Because Longi-no did not attach to his return a declaration signed by the custodial parent of his children, he is not entitled to the exemptions. Longino\u2019s argument that the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S. Const. Art. IV \u00a7 1, requires the Service to accept his divorce decree as proof is inapposite. And because Longino makes only a \u201cpassing reference\u201d to alleged child tax credits, we need not address the issue. <em>Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 681 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">\n<em>C. Longino Is Not Entitled To The Deductions That He Claimed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Longino argues that he was entitled to deductions for medical expenses, a charitable contribution, tuition and fee expenses, domestic production activities, and various business expenses. As an initial matter, Longino contends that the burden of proof should have shifted to the Service on each deduction. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7491(a). But to shift the burden of proof to the Service, Longino had to present \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that he was entitled to a deduction, <em>id., </em>comply with the requirements to \u201csubstantiate any item,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7491(a)(2)(A)-(B), and maintain \u201call required records,\u201d <em>id. </em>With respect to each claimed deduction, the Tax Court ruled that Longino had not substantiated his claims, and Longino has not established that the Tax Court erred. We explain each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">1. Medical Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">The Tax Court did not err when it denied Longino a deduction for medical expenses. A taxpayer may deduct certain expenses for the \u201cmedical care of the taxpayer, his spouse, or a dependent.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a). The Tax Court found that Longino had presented no evidence that any of the alleged care involved him, his spouse, or a dependent, and Longino fails to explain what evidence rebuts the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">2. Charitable Contribution</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">The Tax Court did not err when it denied Longino a deduction for his alleged $25,000 charitable contribution. Because the contribution was greater than $250 Longino had to \u201csubstantiate[ ] the contribution with a contemporaneous written acknowledgment from the donee.\u201d 26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 1.170A-13(f)(l). The document Longino presented was a self-generated receipt thanking himself, and even that receipt lacked the information required in the \u201ccontemporaneous written acknowl-edgement.\u201d <em>See, e.g., id. </em>\u00a7 1.170A-13(f)(2)(ii) (the document must include a \u201cstatement of whether or not the donee organization provide[d] any goods or services in consideration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">3.Tuition Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">The Tax Court did not err when it denied Longino a deduction for his alleged payment of his son\u2019s tuition expenses. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 222(a). The Tax Court found that \u201csomeone\u201d had paid the tuition, but that none of Longino\u2019s credit card or bank statements included payment information that corroborated his \u201cvague testimony\u201d that he had incurred the tuition expenses. The Tax Court is not bound to accept the \u201cunverified, undocumented testimony\u201d of a taxpayer, <em>Villarreal v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>76 T.C.M. (CCH) 920 at *2 (T.C. 1998), and Longino points to no other evidence to substantiate his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">4.Domestic Production Activity</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">The Tax Court did not err when it denied Longino a deduction for domestic production activity. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 199(a)(1)-(2) (2006). Longino argues that he was entitled to a deduction for domestic production activity because he had grading and surveying work done on a parcel of land. But the deduction for domestic production is relevant only where the activity produced income, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 199(c), and Longino failed to prove that he earned any income from the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">5.Business Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">Longino claimed several deductions as \u201cbusiness expenses,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162(a), but he failed to establish that he was entitled to any of them. We discuss each of his claimed deductions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">Longino claimed a deduction of $17,731 for transportation expenses related to his business, but he failed to substantiate that deduction. He calculated his deduction by taking ninety percent of the miles he drove for the year and multiplying that number by the \u201cstandard mileage rate\u201d promulgated by the Service. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.274-5(j)(2). But Longino failed to substantiate the \u201cbusiness mileage\u201d that he claimed or the \u201ctime and business purpose of each use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He refers to testimony where he attempted to use Mapquest to reconstruct his business routes, but his claimed deduction is not based on these reconstructions. And he has provided no legal authority that holds that he can substantiate his business mileage with a bare assertion that 90 percent of the miles he drove were business-related.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">\u201e Longino also argues that he should receive a deduction for the use of his apartment as an office, but this argument fails too. A deduction is only available for a portion of a dwelling if it is used \u201cexclusively\u201d as a principle place of business. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 280A(c)(l)(A). Longino argues that because he testified that the rooms were used exclusively for business purposes, he is entitled to the deduction. But the Tax Court found that his testimony offered \u201calmost no details\u201d about how the rooms were used for his business, and the Tax Court is not bound to accept the \u201cunverified, undocumented\u201d testimony of a taxpayer. <em>Villarreal, </em>76 T.C.M. (CCH) 920 at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">Finally, Longino fails to establish that the Tax Court erred as to any of his other claimed deductions for business expenses. Longino argues that he should receive a deduction for expenses incurred in the use of his telephones, but he provides no support for that argument outside of referring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>to unadmitted evidence and an unpublished Tax Court decision. He argues that he should receive a deduction for expenses for \u201cclient costs advanced,\u201d but offers no response to the decision of the Tax Court that the \u201cclient costs advanced\u201d were nondeductible loans when paid out and nontaxable income when recovered. And Longi-no argues that he should receive deductions for miscellaneous office expenses, postage expenses, and his law library, but Longino again relies on unadmitted evidence, self-generated notes, and his own unverified testimony. He fails to establish that the Tax Court erred when it determined that he had not substantiated these deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">\n<em>D. Longino Has Not Established That the Tax Court Erred When it Calculated His Deficiency.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Longino argues that the Tax Court erred when it calculated his deficiency because it did not include tax credits or overpayments from other tax years, but this argument fails. \u201cDeficiency\u201d is defined as \u201cthe excess of the tax ... over the sum of the amount shown as such tax by the taxpayer upon his return and the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as a deficiency.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6211-l(a). The Tax Court calculated that figure. Longino offers no authority that a \u201cdeficiency\u201d must be reduced for overpayments or tax credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">\n<em>E. Longino Has Not Established That The Tax Court Erred When It Assessed an Accuracy-Related Penalty.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Longino challenges the imposition of an accuracy-related penalty, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662. Under section 6662, the Service shall assess a penalty \u201cequal to 20 percent of the portion of the underpayment\u201d if the underpayment is due to \u201c[n]egligence or disregard of rules or regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6662(a), (b)(1). Longino contends that the Service erroneously refused to accept his amended 2006 tax return and that the Service failed to satisfy its burden of proof under section 6662.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">Both of Longino\u2019s arguments fail. First, the Tax Court found that Longino\u2019s amended returns asserted a lower tax due than his original return, so even if the Service had used the amended returns, it would not have benefited Longino. Second, when the Service assesses a penalty under section 6662, it bears only the burden of production. <em>Higbee v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>116 T.C. 438, 447 (2001); <em>see also </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7491(c) (\u201c[T]he [Service] shall have the <em>burden of production </em>in any court proceeding with respect to the liability of any individual for any penalty.\u201d (emphasis added)). And the Service presented substantial evidence of Longino\u2019s negligence, including his failure to substantiate most of his deductions, his failure to keep adequate records, and the repeated variations in his claims. Longino must \u201ccome forward with evidence sufficient to persuade a[c]ourt that the [Service]\u2019s determination is incorrect.\u201d <em>Hig-bee, </em>116 T.C. at 447. Longino argues that his negligence should be excused because he proved \u201cgood faith\u201d when he hired an accountant to help prepare an amended return. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 664(c)(1) (no penalty shall be imposed if the taxpayer establishes that \u201cthere was a reasonable cause\u201d for the inaccuracy and \u201cthe taxpayer acted in good faith\u201d). But without evidence that the accountant was a competent professional or that Longino relied on his advice in good faith, this argument is unavailing. <em>Neonatology Associates, P.A. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>115 T.C. 43, 99 (2000), <em>aff'd, </em>299 F.3d 221 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">The remainder of Longino\u2019s contentions are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">We AFFIRM the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
