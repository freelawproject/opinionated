Cook challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level increase in his offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), for possession of.a dangerous weapon in connection with his drug offenses. After review of the record and the briefs, we affirm in part and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AX6\">A. Guilty Plea and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b903-16\">On June 2, 2009, Cook was charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii), and three counts of distribution of more than 5 grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(13)(iii). Cook entered a guilty plea to all four counts on August 13, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-17\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated: (1) a base offense level of 36, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) (2008), estimating that Cook participated in the distribution of 1,625.9 grams of cocaine base and 16 pounds of marijuana; (2) a two-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), for possession of a firearm in connection with a drug offense; and (3) a two-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c), for a leadership role in the criminal activity. The PSI did not apply a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, and thus calculated a total offense level of 40. The PSI also calculated a criminal history category of III. With a total offense level of 40 and a criminal history category of III, the PSI identified Cook\u2019s advisory Guidelines range as being 360 months to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-18\">Cook objected to these portions of the PSI: (1) the calculation of the drug quantities; (2) the application of the two-level increase for possession of a firearm; (3) the two-level increase for a leadership role; and (4) the PSI\u2019s refusal to grant him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-19\">On January 13, 2010, the district court held a sentencing hearing and sustained Cook\u2019s objections to (1) the calculation of the drug quantities; (2) the two-level increase for a leadership role; and (3) the PSI\u2019s refusal to grant Cook a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>the district overruled Cook\u2019s objection to the two-level increase for possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">In regard to drug quantity, the district court found that Cook transacted 1,006 grams of cocaine, a majority of which was cocaine base, and two pounds of marijuana. Those drug quantities produced a base offense level of 34, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3). The district court declined to apply any increase for a leadership role, but did apply a three-level decrease for his acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">With a base offense level of 34, a two-level increase for possession of a firearm, and a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, the district court calculated Cook\u2019s total offense level now at 33. That offense level, combined with Cook\u2019s criminal history category of III, yielded an advisory Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Because the only issue on appeal is the two-level increase for possession of a firearm, we review the testimony from the sentencing hearing in that regard. One witness, Travis Tise, is from the same hometown \u2014 Perry, Florida \u2014 as Cook. Tise testified that he sent Cook to Georgia at times to obtain cocaine and bought two crack cocaine \u201ccookies\u201d from Cook each day during a two-week period in January 2009. Tise testified that he saw Cook \u201ca couple of times\u201d cooking powder cocaine into crack cocaine at Cook\u2019s home, which was also Cook\u2019s mother\u2019s residence. Tise further testified that he saw Cook \u201cwith a firearm a couple of times, a black gun ... [that] looked like something the police would have.\u201d Tise said that he had \u201cseen him at the house with it\u201d; \u201cat the club with it\u201d; and \u201cup at the store porch,\u201d known as \u201cCashville.\u201d Tise also saw Cook get powder cocaine from Robert Henry Glanton, Robert Sherrelle Glanton, Alton Miller, and an individual Tise identified as Cook\u2019s uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">A second witness, Robert Henry Glan-ton, had known Cook \u201cfrom a kid on up, just know him from drugs.\u201d Glanton testified that he and his brother provided Cook with cocaine and knew Cook \u201csince he was a very young man, even a boy\u201d and started dealing drugs with him in 2007. Glanton testified that he observed Cook and three other individuals selling firearms out of the bed of an old Chevrolet pickup truck. Glanton testified that Cook called him to offer guns for him to purchase, but that Glanton declined the offer. Glanton testified that he saw two individuals buy guns and that Cook actively participated in pricing the guns. There was also testimony that money paid for the guns was given to Cook so that he would give drugs to the individuals selling the guns with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Glanton further testified that, prior to the incident where Cook was selling guns out of the pickup truck, Cook often purchased about an \u201ceighth of a key\u201d or \u201c3 and a half\u2019 ounces. When asked if it was \u201ctrue that [Cook] began to buy larger amounts following this gun encounter,\u201d Glanton replied, <em>\u201cYes, </em>sir.\u201d Glanton testified that, \u201cfollowing after\u201d the gun incident, he sold 9 ounces of cocaine to Cook.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Another government witness, James King, was also a long-time friend of Cook\u2019s. King testified that he distributed drugs with Cook. King further testified that he observed Cook with a handgun in his back pocket \u201c[s]ometime at the club.\u201d King said that Cook told him at one point that Cook was going to purchase about 9 ounces of cocaine, although King did not see the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">\u25a0 After receiving the testimony of the witnesses, the district court found that the nine ounces that Cook bought from Glan-ton was the same as the nine ounces Cook told King he was going to buy \u2014 and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>the 9-ounce transaction occurred \u201cright after the gun show.\u201d The district court also found that Cook should receive the two-level increase for possession of a gun in connection with the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">In regard to the increase for possession of a firearm, the district court found that \u201cthere was testimony that Mr. Cook had a practice of carrying a gun around in his back pocket.\u201d The district court also found that (1) Cook \u201cdid it at the club\u201d and that \u201che did it at the house,\u201d and (2) \u201c[w]e do have drug transactions at the house.\u201d The district court acknowledged that \u201c[w]e don\u2019t have precise testimony that anybody saw him with the gun at the time of the drug transaction.\u201d But the district court found that it was Cook\u2019s \u201cregular practice both to sell drugs and to have the gun in the pocket.\u201d The district court found it \u201cmore likely than not that he had the gun in the pocket during the drug transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) factors, including Cook\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, the court sentenced Cook to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 the low end of Cook\u2019s advisory Guidelines range \u2014 and 5 years of supervised release. The court entered its judgment on January 19, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">B. Reduction under Amendment 750</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">On January 11, 2012, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>issued an order notifying Cook and the government that it believed Cook was eligible for a reduced sentence pursuant to Amendment 750 to the Guidelines, and that it intended to reduce Cook\u2019s term of imprisonment from 168 months to 135 months. The district court stated that, under Amendment 750, Cook\u2019s total offense level should be reduced from 33 to 31, which would drop the low end of Cook\u2019s advisory Guidelines range from 168 months to 135 months. The court ordered the government to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">The government responded on February 13, 2012, stating that it agreed that Cook\u2019s total offense level is 31 under Amendment 750 but that it would not take a position regarding the intended reduction. On February 20, 2012, the district court ordered that Cook\u2019s sentence be reduced to 135 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">C. Cook\u2019s \u00a7 2255 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">Prior to the district court\u2019s order reducing his sentence, Cook had filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Cook alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that his counsel failed to file a notice of appeal of his 168-month sentence despite Cook\u2019s instruction for counsel to do, and requested that the court vacate its judgment and re-impose the same sentence so that he would be able to file a direct appeal. Cook\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was pending before a magistrate judge when the district court <em>sua sponte </em>raised the issue of Amendment 750 and reduced Cook\u2019s sentence to 135 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">The \u00a7 2255 action was reassigned to a new magistrate judge on April 2, 2012, and the magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing on Cook\u2019s motion on January 16, 2014. At the hearing, Cook testified that he requested that his attorney file a notice of appeal. Cook\u2019s attorney testified that he did not recall Cook telling him that he wanted to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">On February 3, 2014, the magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation, finding that Cook\u2019s testimony was more credible. The magistrate judge recommended that the district court vacate the prior judgment and re-impose the same sentence, allowing Cook to timely appeal. On March 12, 2014, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, vacated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>prior judgment, and entered a renewed judgment sentencing Cook to a term of imprisonment of 168 months and 5 years of supervised release. The district court did not reference its prior order reducing Cook\u2019s sentence, nor did it mention Amendment 750 to the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">After the district court entered the renewed judgment, Cook timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">On appeal, Cook contends that the government \u201cfailed to prove any firearm was present during any of the conduct charged or relevant conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the offense level for a drug offense is increased by two levels if \u201ca dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). This firearm enhancement applies \u201cif the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">The government has the burden of showing \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm was present at the site of the charged conduct or prove that the defendant possessed a firearm during conduct associated with the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Stallings, </em>463 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir.2006). Once the government \u201chas shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm was present at the site of the charged conduct, the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to show that a connection between the firearm and the offense is clearly improbable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>46 F.3d 62, 63 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Where a defendant has been charged with conspiracy, the \u00a7 2D 1.1(b)(1) offense-level increase may be applied \u201cif the firearm[ ] [is] found in a place where acts in furtherance of the conspiracy took place.\u201d <em>United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1246 (11th Cir.2006). For example, the two-level increase is properly applied where the defendant possessed the firearm at his residence and also engaged in conspiratorial conversations at the residence. <em>See United States v. Hansley, </em>54 F.3d 709, 716 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">Here, the evidence was sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding that Cook possessed the firearm in connection with his drug conduct. For example,.the evidence indicates that Cook possessed the firearm at the same location where he committed acts in furtherance of the drug conspiracy. Witness Tise testified that he had seen Cook with a black handgun multiple times, including at the home where Tise saw Cook convert powder cocaine into crack cocaine. Cook\u2019s possession of a gun where he cooked powder cocaine into crack cocaine is sufficient to establish the required connection between the firearm and the drug conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-14\">Indeed, the connection between the firearm and the drug conspiracy is stronger here than it was in <em>Hansley. </em>In <em>Hansley, </em>we affirmed an application of the two-level increase where the government produced evidence that agents found a firearm and drug paraphernalia at a residence that was the site of conspiratorial conversations. <em>Cf. </em>54 F.3d at 716. Here, by contrast, the government produced evidence that Cooked personally possessed the gun in a residence that was not merely the site of drug paraphernalia and relevant conversations, but rather was where the defendant actively cooked powder cocaine into crack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>cocaine \u2014 a key act in furtherance of the conspiracy to distribute cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Furthermore, Cook\u2019s reliance on <em>Stall-ings </em>is misplaced. In <em>Stallings, </em>this Court held that the government failed to meet its burden \u201cbecause the government provided no evidence connecting the pistols found in [the defendant\u2019s] home to his alleged drug activity and because the government never addressed the possibility that the weapons belonged to any of the other adults residing in his home.\u201d 463 F.3d at 1221. Here, the government produced evidence, in the form of direct testimony, that Cook engaged in drug activity at the home and that Cook himself possessed the gun in the home. Additionally, when the district court noted that \u201cthere\u2019s testimony that [Cook] had the gun at the house\u201d and stated that Cook \u201ccertainly engaged in drug business at the house,\u201d defense counsel assented. That is precisely the kind of \u201cnexus\u201d between \u201cbetween the firearm[] and the drug crime\u201d that was lacking in <em>Stallings. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">In light of the testimony offered at the sentencing hearing, and because Cook does not argue that he met his burden of establishing that any connection between the gun and the conspiracy was clearly improbable, we cannot say that the district court erred when it applied the two-level increase for possession of a firearm in connection with the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s Guidelines calculations. However, we note that the district court\u2019s renewed judgment, entered on March 12, 2014, reinstated Cook\u2019s term of imprisonment as 168 months, even though the court previously had reduced Cook\u2019s sentence to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government\u2019s brief concedes that this judgment \u201cerroneously listed Defendant\u2019s sentence as 168 [months] on each count, rather than 135 months.\u201d We remand to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the renewed judgment to reflect the reduced sentence, pursuant to Amendment 750 of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Reeves, </em>742 F.3d 487, 507 n. 12 (11th Cir.2014) (\u201cWe may <em>sua sponte </em>raise the issue of clerical errors in a judgment and remand with instructions that the district court correct them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-10\">. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s fact findings under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 and review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of those facts under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
