As part of the plea agreement, Lozano-Alcorta agreed to waive his \u201cright to appeal the conviction, the sentence imposed or the manner in which the sentence was determined.\u201d The district court sentenced him to 80 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Lozano-Alcorta has filed a timely notice of appeal and contends that the district court erred regarding his sentence by refusing to grant a downward departure based on prospective amendments to the drug quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. According to Lozano-Alcorta, the appeal waiver in his plea agreement is invalid because he could not have knowingly waived the right to appeal a sentence that had not yet been imposed. The Government seeks dismissal of the appeal based on the appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"AUg\">The validity of an appeal waiver is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, </em>741 F.3d 648, 650 (5th Cir.2014). For a defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal to be knowing and voluntary, the \u201cdefendant must know that he had a right to appeal his sentence and that he was giving up that right.\u201d <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292 (5th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Lozano-Alcorta\u2019s challenge to his appeal waiver is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567-68 (5th Cir.1992). The waiver is enforceable and encompasses Lozano-Al-corta\u2019s challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
