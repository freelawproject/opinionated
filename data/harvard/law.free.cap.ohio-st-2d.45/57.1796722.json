E. 2d 773, this court was presented with a similar situation. After the respondent therein was convicted of three counts of willfully failing to file federal income tax returns, the relator instituted proceedings before the board and introduced only the transcript of the information and convictions. Upon review of the board\u2019s action, it was the court\u2019s finding that such conduct, as evidenced from the transcript of the convictions themselves, warranted that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. Cf. <em>Toledo Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Lichota </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 217, 239 N. E. 2d 45; <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Bowman </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 220, 239 N. E. 2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">By willfully failing to file federal income tax returns in the case at bar, respondent violated Canon 29 and Canon 32 of the Canons of Professional Ethics,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Canon 1, DR 1-102(A)(4) and (6), of the Code of Professional Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>sponsibility. Respondent\u2019s behavior constituted misconduct as defined in Gov. R. V(5)(a). Furthermore, by his convictions and subsequent incarceration, respondent has lessened public confidence in the legal profession and has reflected substantial discredit upon his fellow lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The recommendation of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline is well taken and respondent is indefinitely suspended from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b83-7\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Corrigan, Stern, Celebrezze, W. Brown and P. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Respondent\u2019s failure to file income tax returns for calendar years 1968 and 1969 occurred prior to the adoption of the Code of Professional Responsibility on October 5, 1970, while the Canons of Professional Ethics governed the bar of this state.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
