Sub. H. B. 1086, which was effective during the first six months of the calendar year 1973 (the last six months of the state\u2019s fiscal year).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The following words of Section 3, Am. Sub. H. B. 1086, are at issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u2018 i \u00ab # * payments to nursing homes * * * shall be made for all eligible recipients at reasonable costs up to: fifteen dollars and fifty cents a day for patients requiring care in homes meeting federal requirements for skilled nursing care * *</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Appellants contend that those words mean: payments of up to $15.50 a day are to be made for patients in skilled nursing homes, if they require care. The D. P. W. argues, to the contrary, that those words mean: payments of up to $15.50 a day are to be made for patients in skilled nursing facilities, if they require the level of care given iu such facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The parties have cited various maxims of statutory application and construction and have delved into the history of Am. Sub. H. B. 1086. The General Assembly might plausibly have effected the statutory purpose in either way, and indeed the parties agree that an earlier version of this statute plainly adopted one view, and a later version just as plainly adopted the other. The General Assembly has used similar grammatical construction on other occasions (see E. C. 3720.01 and 5123.31), but those occasions are of no great assistance herein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">We hold that the ordinary sense of the words \u201cpatients requiring care in homes for skilled nursing care\u201d refers to the actual level of care needed by the patient, as the D. P. W. contends. That reading is reasonable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>grammatical. It presumes a normal sentence order in which the phrase \u201cin homes * * * for skilled nursing care\u201d refers to the immediately preceding word \u201ccare,\u201d rather than to the prior word \u201cpatients.\u201d If the statute had stated \u201cpatients, requiring care, in homes # * for skilled nursing care\u201d or \u201cpatients requiring care, in homes * * * for skilled nursing care,\u201d we would be inclined to agree with the appellants, but it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The words and phrases of a statute are to be read according to the rules of grammar (R. C. 1.42), and, in so reading this statute, we agree with the Court of Appeals that appellants\u2019 argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b80-9\">O\u2019Neill, C.

The former is still an extraordinary remedy, the traditional uniqueness of which should not be eroded in the name of expediency.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-14\">' The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed, but upon the basis that mandamus is not an available remedy under the instant circumstances.</p>\n<judges id=\"b80-15\">Celebrezze, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
