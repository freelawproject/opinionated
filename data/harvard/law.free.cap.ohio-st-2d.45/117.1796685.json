C. 3311.06 states, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">\u201cWhen all of the territory of a school district is annexed to a city or village, such territory thereby becomes a part of the city school district or the school district of which the village is a part, and the legal title to school property in such territory for school purposes shall be vested in the board of education of the city school district or the school district of which the village is a part. When the territory so annexed to a city or village comprises part but not all of the. territory of a school district, the said territory becomes part of the said city school district or the school district of which the village is a part only upon approval by the State Board of Education. * # *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Appellants\u2019 essential argument in this appeal is that R. C. 3311.06 is unconstitutional in that it gives the State Board of Education no standards or guides to follow in determining whether territory should be transferred to the school district following a partial annexation for municipal purposes. To reach that result, appellants must first overcome two unanimous decisions of this court interpreting Section 26 of Article II of the Ohio Constitution in <em>Bd. of Edn. of Jefferson Local </em>School <em>District </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. of Columbus City School District </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 130, 180 N. E. 2d 576, and <em>Minshall </em>v. <em>State, ex rel. Merritt </em>(1931), 124 Ohio St. 61, 176 N. E. 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">Section 26 of Article II states:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">\u201cAll laws, of a general nature,. shall have a uniform operation throughout the state; nor, shall an act, except such as relates to public schools, be passed, to take effect upon the approval of any other authority than, the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Assembly, except, as otherwise provided in this Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">. In <em>Jefferson Local, supra, </em>at page 133, this court said:</p>\n<p id=\"AK1\">\u201cUnder Section 3311.06 before its 1955 amendment,, when territory was annexed to a city, that territory .automatically became a part of the city school district. After that amendment,' some of the provisions making such territory a part of a city school district are not to \u2018take effect\u2019 except \u2018upon the approval of\u2019 some \u2018other authority than the General Assembly,\u2019 <em>i. e., </em>the state board.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u201cSuch an act is expressly prohibited by Section 26 of Article II \u2018except such [an act] as relates to public schools.\u2019 Obviously, Section 3311.06, Revised Code, does relate to public schools. Thus Section 26 of Article II. expressly recognizes the authority of the General Assembly to do what it did in Section 3311.06, Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AoT\">Appellants contend that this court placed a different interpretation on the \u201ctake effect\u201d language of Section 26 in <em>Belden </em>v. <em>Union Central Life Ins. Co. </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 329, 55 N. E. 2d 629. In <em>Belden, </em>life insurance .policyholders challenged the constitutionality of an act (119 Ohio Laws 70) under which a stock life insurance company could convert to a mutual life insurance company. The enabling legislation 'provided that such mutualization could only be effected upon the approval of a majority of the directors, shareholders and policyholders of the stock company, and then only upon'the approval of the state Superintendent of Insurance. One of the constitutional arguments advanced by the policyholders opposing the mutualization, wus that the statute \u201ctakes effect\u201d as law upon the approval of the Superintendent of Insurance rather than the General Assembly and was, therefore, violative of Section 26, Article II. This court rejected that argument, stating at page 348 :</p>\n<p id=\"A4B\">\u201cWe think that the act definitely defines the'legislative policy; th\u00e1t it does establish standards for the,guidance of the superintendent in approving or rejecting the plan; and that it does not delegate legislative power, within the meaning of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u201cThe contention that the act takes effect upon the a])<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>proval of the superintendent is without merit! The mutualization takes effect upon his approval, <em>but the act took effect in the manner and at the time for the taking effect of legislative acts as provided' by the </em>Constitution\u2022 (Emphasis added.) : \\:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The difference appellants find in the interpretation of Section 26 of Article II in <em>Belden </em>and the interpretation of that section in <em>Jefferson Local, </em>supra, and <em>Minshall, supra, </em>is more apparent than real. In <em>Belden, </em>the superintendent had standards to guide him in the approval or disapproval of a particular mutualization. As such, his action wais not a legislative act; he merely gave the original legislative act operational effect. The actions taken by the State Board of Education in the appeal herein are much different.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">R. C. 3311.06 gives the board no guides or standards to use in approving or disapproving the transfer of territory from one school district to another following a partial annexation for municipal purposes. Therefore, the act of the board in approving a transfer of territory pursuant to R. C. 3311.06 is itself a legislative act, which \u201ctakes effect\u201d upon the approval of some other authority than, the General Assembly. 7</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Section 26 of Article II expressly sanctions both the <em>delegation </em>of legislative authority by the General Assembly in R. C. 3311.06 and the <em>exercise </em>of that authority by the State Board of Education. <em>Jefferson Local, supra </em>(173 Ohio St. 130); <em>Minshall, supra </em>(124 Ohio St. 61).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the Court of Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A4H\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b144-10\">O\u2019Neill, C!
