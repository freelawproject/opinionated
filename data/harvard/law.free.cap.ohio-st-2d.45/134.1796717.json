Paragraph two of the syllabus in <em>State </em>v. <em>Arrington </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 114, recognizes that \u201c[t]he burden is on the state to show that a transcript of prior, proceedings requested by an indigent defendant is not needed for an effective defense or appeal,\u201d and paragraph four of the <em>Arrington </em>syllabus states: \u201c [o]rdinarily it is assumed that a trans-script * * * would be valuable to a defendant without requiring a showing of need tailored to facts of the particular case.\u201d See <em>Britt </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1971), 404 U. S. 226, 228, 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The second assertion appears to be a corollary to the suggestion that an indigent is bound by App. E. 9(B) to \u201carrange for\u201d the payment of those who produce transcripts. Appellants have neither cited adequate authority for such premises nor shown the propriety of such an inr quiry in the context of a mandamus proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Appellants\u2019 assertions must be rejected for the additional reason that to adopt them would create added burdens for indigents and impose further obstacles along the appellate path, which would directly violate the principle of <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1956), 351 U. S. 12, and its progeny,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>that indigent defendants may not be priced out of * * as effective an appeal as would be available to others able to pay their own way. * * * The state\u2019s fiscal interest is, therefore, irrelevant,\u201d <em>(Mayer </em>v. <em>Chicago </em>[1971], 404 U. S. 189, 197) and cannot be asserted to further infringe the rights of the disaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u201c# * * [rp]]ie state\u2019s long-term interest would not appear to lie in making access to .appellate processes from even its most inferior courts depend upon the.defendant\u2019s ability to pay.' It has been aptly said:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u201c \u2018 [F]ew citizens ever have contact with the higher courts. In the main, it ig the police and. the lower court Bench and Bar that convey the essence of our democracy to the people..</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u201c \u2018Justice, if it can be measured, must be measured, by the experience the average citizen has with' the police and the lower'courts.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\u201cArbitrary denial of appellate review of proceedings of the state\u2019s lowest trial courts may'save the state some dollars and cents, but only at the substantial risk' of generating .frustration and hostility, toward its courts among the most numerous consumers of justice.\u201d <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Chicago, supra, </em>at pages 197-198.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The Court of' Appeals properly 'exercised its jurisdiction in mandamus to compel appellants to furnish transcripts or other adequate alternative record of the proceedings to indigent, criminal appellants <em>(State, ex rel. Seigler, </em>v. <em>Rone </em>[1975]] 42 .Ohio St. 2d <em>361; State, ex rel, Wright) </em>v. <em>Cohen </em>[1962], 174 Ohio St. 47), and its judgment is, therefore,'affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Agy\">\n<em>''Judgment affirmed?</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"ArL\">'0 [Neill, C, J., Herbert, 'Corrigan, Stern, Celebrezze, W.
