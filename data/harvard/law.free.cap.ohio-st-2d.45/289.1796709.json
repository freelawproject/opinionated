It is relator\u2019s contention that the safety device on the cutting saw used by claimant complies with the specific safety requirements adopted.by the commission \u00e1nd, because there is no specific requirement that the guard be adjustable, \u201cfailure to adjust is not a proper basis on which to base a finding of a violation of a specific safety requirement.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In the recent case of <em>State, ex rel. M.T.D. Products, </em>v. <em>Stebbins </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St. 2d 114, where a safety: device malfunctioned causing a machine to injure an employee, this court held that \u201cthe purpose of the safety regulation [guards on molding machines] is to provide reasonable safety for employees. * * * The fact that a safety device that otherwise complies with the safety regulations failed on a single occasion is not alone sufficient to find that the safety regulation was violated.\u201d Such safety regulation, this court said, \u201cdoes-not purport to impose absolute liability for an additional award * *</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In this case, as in <em>M.T.D., </em>the machine was equipped with a safety device. The fact that it was improperly adjusted at the. time claimant was injured is not a violation of a specific safety requirement that \u201ccutting tools shall be guarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u2022Therefore, on authority of <em>M.T.D. </em>Products,.the allowance of an additional award in this case was an abiise of the Industrial .Commission\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Accordingly, relator, having sustained its burden of showing \u00e1 clear legal right thereto, is entitled:to a writ of mandamus as prayed for. <em>State, ex rel. Pressley, v. Indus.
