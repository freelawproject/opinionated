Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAdm\">This case invokes the original jurisdiction of this court in mandamus, and presents the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>question whether the respondents, the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority and Governor James A. Rhodes, have illegally acted to deprive relator, Gayle S. Channing, of her membership in the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Membership qualifications for the Authority are set forth in R. C. 3706.02, which reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u201cThere is hereby created the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority. Such authority is a body both corporate and politic in this state * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u201cThe authority shall consist of seven members as follows: five members appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, no more than three of whom shall be members of the same political party, and the Director of Environmental Protection and the Director of Health, who shall be members ex officio without compensation. Each appointive member shall be a resident of the state, and a qualified elector therein. * <em>* * </em>Appointed members \u2019 terms of office shall be for eight years, commencing on the first day of July and ending on the thirtieth day of June. Each appointed member shall hold office from the date of his appointment until the end of the term for which he was appointed. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term for which his predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the remainder of such term. Any appointed member shall continue in office subsequent to the expiration date of his term until his successor takes office, or until a period of sixty days has elapsed, whichever occurs first. A member of the authority is eligible for reappointment. Each appointed member of the authority, before entering upon his duties, shall take an oath as provided by Section 7 of Article XV, Ohio Constitution. The Governor may at any time remove any member of the authority for misfeasance, nonfeasance, or malfeasance in office. * * * Four members of the authority shall constitute a quorum, and the affirmative vote of four members shall be necessary for any action taken by vote of the authority. No vacancy in the membership of the authority shall impair the rights of a quorum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>by such vote to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u201cBefore the issuance of any air quality revenue bonds under Chapter 3706 of the Revised Code, each appointed member of the authority shall give a surety bond to the state in the penal sum of twenty-five thousand dollars and the Secretary-Treasurer shall give such a bond in the penal sum of fifty thousand dollars, each such surety bond to be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of the office, to be executed by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state, and to be approved by the Governor and filed in the office of the Secretary of State. Each appointed member of the authority shall receive an annual salary of five thousand dollars, payable in monthly installments. Each member shall be reimbursed for his actual expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of his duties. * * # \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Relator alleges that Governor Gilligan\u2019s appointment and the Senate\u2019s advice and consent thereto were legal and proper and vest her with membership in that Authority; that R. C. 3706.02 has been complied with; that her attempts to give a surety bond pursuant to R. C. 3706.02 have been frustrated by the Governor\u2019s refusal to approve such bond; and that the Authority cannot bar her participation in its business nor bar her from receiving compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Respondents deny that relator is a duly appointed and qualified member of the Authority, for the following reasons: (1) The appointment is invalid or incomplete because (a) it is inscribed with a facsimile signature rather than the handwritten signature of Governor Gilligan, in contravention of R. C. 107.15, and (b) the appointment is not recorded in the appointment record' kept in the Governor\u2019s office, in contravention of R., Ci 107.10(B); (2) the appointment was improperly transmitted to the Senate; (3) the appointment was withdrawn by Governor Rhodes before the Senate vote to advise and consent; and (4) the surety bond requirement of R. C. 3706.02 has not be\u00e9n met by relator thus constituting a .refusal of office pursuant to R. C. 3.30. We shall address those arguments gradatim.</p>\n<p id=\"AFV\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>\n<em>The Appointment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">R. C. 107.15 empowers the Governor to-utilize a \u201cfacsimile signature,\u201d as defined therein, on \u201cany document <em>except </em>enrolled bills enacted by the General Assembly, <em>nominations to be submitted to the Senate for confirmation, </em>clemency actions, interstate compacts, and agreements with the federal government * # (Emphasis added.) Without deciding whether the Governor may properly authorize use of his facsimile signature on documents purported to be excepted from R. C. 107.15, we need only determine herein whether relator\u2019s Letter of Appointment is a <em>nomination </em>to b\u00e9 submitted to the Senate for <em>confirmation,- </em>within the meaning of R. G. 107.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Members of the Authority are \u201cappointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate. \u2019 \u2019 At least 114 sections of the Revised Code provide for gubernatorial appointments with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. See, also, Section - 21 of Article III, Section 22 of Article IV, and Section 2 of Article VII of the Ohio Constitution. Only R. C. 107.15 mentions a gubernatorial <em>nomination </em>followed by Senate <em>confirmation-. </em>Two forms of officer selection do exist. As Judge Matthias stated in <em>State, ex rel. Brothers, </em>v. <em>Zellar </em>(1966), 7 Ohio St. 2d 109, 112:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u201cIt must be noted at the outset that;unlike the practice in some states where the Governor <em>nominates </em>an individual for an'office and such nomination is -sent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Senate for <em>confirmation </em>before the appointment is made, the procedure in Ohio is that the <em>appointment </em>is actually made by the Governor prior to its submission to the Senate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Accordingly, this court holds'that the use of a facsimile signature on a Letter of Appointment, which is authorized by the Governor to be prepared, does not contravene the provisions of R. C. 107.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Respondents assert further that the appointment is incomplete because it is not recorded in the Governor\u2019s record, as required by R. C. 107.10, which, in pertinent part, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u201cThe following records shall be kept in the Governor\u2019s office:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">&lt; &lt; # # #</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">\u201c(B) An appointment record in which is entered the name of each person appointed to an office by the Governor, except notaries public and commissioners\u00bf the office to which appointed, the date of the appointment, the date of the commission, the date of the beginning and expiration of the term, and, the result and date of action by the Senate, if required.\u201d <em>t</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">Respondents \u2019 assertion cannot be sustained because the language of R. C. 107.10(B) itself clearly shows that recordation is not contemplated until after the Senate has acted on the appointment. The recordation requirement is to set forth a <em>history </em>of each appointment, at some time after the end of the process of appointment and advice and consent. Relator\u2019s appointment has hot been recorded, first, because Governor Rhodes has contested the appointment, and, secondly, the Gilligan administration ran out of time to so record it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>We hold that relator\u2019s claim to office is not dependent upon recordation of the history of her appointment in'the Governor\u2019s record. ..</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\n<em>The Transmittal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Respondents challenge the validity of the transmittal of relator\u2019s Letter of Appointment to the Senate. That claim is based - upon \u25a0 the assumption, that the evidence \u201cestablishes beyond any reasonable doubt that relator\u2019s purported nomination was not, in fact, delivered to the [Senate] Clerk\u2019s office until Monday morning, January 13, 1975.\u201d Respondents conclude, then, that the appointment &lt;&lt;* # # wag ncq transmitted to the Senate until <em>after </em>Govr ernor Gilligan\u2019s term of office had expired and then by an unknown person who was neither a member of Governor Gilligan\u2019s staff nor a member of Governor Rhodes\u2019 staff -and who was not authorized by Governor Rhodes to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u201cIn these circumstances the best that can be said for relator\u2019s alleged appointment as a member of respondent Authority is that .-Governor Gilligan <em>intended </em>to appoint her to that office but the fact remains that that intention was never executed.in the manner required by law before Governor Gilligan\u2019s term of office expired.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\"><em>\u25a0 </em>Upon reviewing the evidence, we do not accept respondents \u2019 premise that transmittal occurred on January 13. Rather, .the clear testimony of Miss Sibley is that on January 11, 1975, she handed over the Letter of Appointment to a \u201creputable person- associated with the Ohio Senate in some way that would deliver those [the appointments] upstairs.\u201d We reject respondents\u2019 allegation of improper transmittal. . -</p>\n<p id=\"Adyf\">\n<em>The Withdrawal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Respondents state as their position \u2018 \u2018 that the Governor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>may, upon his judgment and discretion, withdraw an appointment before confirmation by the-Senate,\u201d and-allege that \u201c [o]n January 13y 1975, acting within his discretion, the Governor [Bhodes] ordered a member of his- staff to recall the alleged appointment of relator from the Clerk of the Senate. However, the Clerk of the Senate refused to relinquish the alleged appointment and said appointment was acted-upon'by the Senate on January 14, 1975. Thus,' in failing to comply with the Governor\u2019s recall the Senate wrongfully confirmed the relator\u2019s alleged appointment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A0S\">We need not decide whether a Governor is empowered to withdraw or recall appointments after they have been submitted to the Senate -for its' advice and consent, because, again, the evidence presented does not sustain respondents\u2019 allegations. There is no evidence that Governor Bhodes issued any orders in relation to the appointment of relator or other -appointments handed down to the Senate on January 13, 1975. There -is evidence, however, that the Clerk of the Senate, William H. Chavanne, submitted those appointments \u201cto the-Senate\u201d as the Senate went into session, which occurred at 10:30 a. m. on January 13, 1975. Mr. McElroy testified that after Governor Bhodes was sworn in, which Was \u201c[s]imilar to noonish\u201d on January 13, he [Mr. McElroy] stated to Mr. Chavanne, \u201cthat, \u2018The Governor has recalled the nominations that were sent up there earlier this morning.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">There is no evidence that the \u201cSenate Clerk refused to relinquish the * * * [letter of] appointment,\u201d as alleged by respondents. Bather, it would appear that relator\u2019s Letter of Appointment was out of Mr. Chavanne\u2019s hands by the time he was informed that the Governor possibly opposed the appointment. After Mr. Chavanne submitted the appointments \u201cto the Senate,\u201d they went to the Buies Committee and were consented to the next day. There is no evidence that the Governor, Mr. McElroy, or other members of the Governor\u2019s staff further attempted to bring news of the purported withdrawal to the Senate. For the foregoing reasons, we must conclude that there was no effective communication to the Senate of a gubernatorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>withdrawal of appointment, even if the Governor so intended to withdraw or recall relator\u2019s appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\n<em>The Surety Bond</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Paragraphs 13-15 of the agreed statement of facts read:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u201c13. Gayle S. Channing. submitted a surety bond in the penal sum of $25,000 conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of the office of a member of the Authority which bond was executed by Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, a surety company authorized to transact business in Ohio. This submission was made by an agent of Ms. Channing to a member of Governor Gilligan\u2019s staff in the office of the Governor of Ohio prior to noon \u2014 prior to the inaugural ceremony of Governor Rhodes \u2014 on January 13, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u201c14. The Authority received an invoice dated March 11, 1975, for the premium on said surety bond which such premium has not been paid by the Authority. It is the practice of the Authority to pay ultimately bond premiums on surety bonds which have been approved by the Governor for members of the Authority who have been duly appointed and who have duly qualified for such office.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u201c15. Governor Rhodes has not approved Gayle S: Channing\u2019s surety bond and has not forwarded said bond to the Secretary of State of Ohio for filing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Upon those facts, respondents argue that inasmuch as the invoice has not been paid, the bond is \u201ccancellable by the insurance company. The bond has thus become insufficient as to its surety and is worthless as a surety in7 strument for the purpose for which it was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">\u201cPursuant to Section 3.30 Ohio Revised Code,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>son appointed to an office who fails to furnish such security as provided by law is deemed to have refused to accept the office to which such person was appointed. The only conclusion that can be drawn from relator\u2019s failure to validate the surety bond is that she has not qualified for the position at issue in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The bond requirement in E. C. 3706.02 reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\"Before the issuance of any air quality revenue bonds under Chapter 3706 of the Eevised Code, each appointed member of the authority shall give a surety bond to the state * * * to be approved by the Governor and filed in the office of the Secretary of State.\u201d. . ..</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">This court holds that such bond requirement does not purport to be a qualification for membership in the Authority, but, by the terms of E. C. 3706.02, is merely a precondition to. the issuance of revenue bonds by the Authority. Accordingly, consideration of surety bonds is not pertinent to this action..</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Conclusion...</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">In consideration of the foregoing, we find that relator was appointed by the Governor to a seat on the Authority, that such appointment was unanimously advised and consented to by the Senate, and relator served, in full compliance with the qualifications for office set forth in E. C. 3706.-02, until excluded from service by the actions of respondents. Respondents have shown no'legal basis for so excluding relator. Therefore, a writ will issue;</p>\n<p id=\"AU_\">\n<em>Writ allowed:</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b389-11\">O\u2019Neill^ C. J., 'Herbert, Stern-and P.
