Mansfield Telephone Co., </em>v. <em>Mayer </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St. 2d 222, 223. Further, \u201cprohibition is not a substitute for appeal.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Gilla, </em>v. <em>Fellerhoff </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St. 2d 86, 88; <em>State, ex rel. Toerner, </em>v. <em>Common Pleas Court </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St. 2d 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Relator\u2019s contention as to the applicability of <em>State, ex rel. Adams, </em>v. <em>Gusweiler </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St. 2d 326, has no merit.' The instant case clearly does' not involve such a \u201c \u2018total want of jurisdiction\u2019 <em>(Gusiveiler) </em>* * * to warrant dispensing with relator\u2019s adequate remedy of appeal.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Gilla, </em>v. <em>Fellerhoff, supra, </em>at page 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Relator challenges further the constitutionality \u00f3f R. C. 3105.01 (K), and thereby'seeks to determine that issue in this prohibition action: However, \u201cthe unconstitu'tionality of a statute does hot deprive a court of the initial jurisdiction to proceed to its terms. Appellant has other remedies in the ordinary course of the law and by way of appeal. * * #\u201d <em>State, ex rel.
