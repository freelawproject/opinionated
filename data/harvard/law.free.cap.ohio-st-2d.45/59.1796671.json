The foregoing violations constitute misconduct as defined in Gov. E. V(5) (a). Furthermore, those factors offered by respondent in mitigation of his actions are insufficient to justify his failure to abide by the rules which govern the members of the bar. If the operation of decedent\u2019s music store and an alleged concurrent emotional strain prevented respondent from adequately administering the estate, it was respondent\u2019s professional responsibility to ask to be relieved of such duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We concur with the recommendation of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, and respond-dent is indefinitely suspended from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b86-7\">O\u2019Neill, C.
