Util. Comm. </em>(1959), 170 Ohio St. 105, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">The commission\u2019s opinion and order of March 4, 1975, and its entry of May 5, 1975, denying a rehearing, discussed appellant\u2019s objections and gave reasons for not following appellant\u2019s assertions. Despite the commission\u2019s cogent refutation, however, appellant continues to assert its objections apparently unmindful of its burden to overcome a presumption that the rates are fair and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">In addition, appellant assigns error to various actions and rulings of the commission without showing concomitant harm or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">\u201cThis court will not reverse an order of the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>sion as unreasonable or unlawful because of an error of the commission, if such error did not prejudice the party seeking such reversal.\u201d <em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1949), 151 Ohio St. 353, paragraph six of the syllabus. Stated another way, \u201c [a]lthough unlawful or unreasonable, an order of the Public Utilities Commission will not be reversed where its effect, to the extent that it is unlawful or unreasonable, will not be such as to prejudice someone who appeals from that order.\u201d <em>Ohio Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 478, paragraph ten of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Finally, appellant has failed to demonstrate that the commission\u2019s order is manifestly against the weight of the evidence and is so clearly unsupported by the record as to show the commission\u2019s misapprehension or mistake or willful disregard of duty <em>(Cleveland Elec. Illuminatmg Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>[1975], 42 Ohio St. 2d 403, paragraph eight of the syllabus).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Accordingly, the order of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b37-8\">O\u2019Neill, C.
