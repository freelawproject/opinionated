C. 5725.15 apportionment formula utilized to determine the extent to which Sun\u2019s total net worth is to be allocated to Ohio.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">There is no question that Sun is a \u201cdealer in intangibles\u201d as that term is defined in R. C. 5725.01 (B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>such, Sun is admittedly subject to the Ohio dealer-in-intangibles tax. The question presented, then, is to what ex:tent is Sun so subjected.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Resolution of the issue presented herein requires consideration of a number of statutory enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">R. C. 5725.13 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u201cThe following property shall be listed and assessed at its fair value * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\u201c (A) The shares of the stockholders in an incorporated dealer in intangibles having an actual place of business in this state, to the extent represented by capital employed in this state [.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">R. C. 5725.14, which concerns the filing of returns and consolidated returns, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">\u201cEach dealer in intangibles shall return to the Tax Commissioner # * * annually, a report exhibiting in detail * * * his resources and liabilities at the close of business on the thirty-first day of December next preceding.* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">\u201cIf a dealer in intangibles maintains separate business offices, whether within this state only or within and without' this state, said report shall also show the gross receipts from business done at each such office during the year finding on the thirty-first day of December next preceding.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">\u201c \u2018Gross receipts\u2019 * * * means, in the case of a dealer in intangibles principally engaged in the business of lending money or discounting loans, the aggregate amount of loans effected or discounted * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\"><em>C l </em># # *</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">\u201cAn incorporated dealer in intangibles which owns or controls fifty-one per cent or more of the common stock of another incorporated dealer in intangibles may, under uniform regulations prescribed by the Tax Commissioner,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> make a consolidated return * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>R. C. 5725.15, which sets forth the allocation formula and.1 instructions for valuation, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u201cUpon receiving the report required by Section 5725.-14 of the Revised Code, the Tax Commissioner shall ascertain and assess all the shares of such dealers in intangibles, the capital stock of which is divided into shares, representing capital employed in. this state,- and the value of the property representing the capital, not divided into shares, employed in this state by such dealer in intangibles, according, to the aggregate fair value of the capital, surplus, and undivided profits as shown in such report * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u201cIf a dealer has separate offices, whether within this state only or within and without this state, the commissioner shall find the amount of capital employed in each office in this state, which shall bear the same ratio to the entire capital of such dealer, wherever employed, as the gross receipts of such office bears to the entire gross receipts of such dealer, wherever arising.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Both parties rely upon two prior decisions of this court, <em>Certified Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 239, and <em>Household Finance Corp. v. Porterfield </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St. 2d 39, in support of their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">In <em>Certified Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Bowers, supra, </em>the court held the \u201cgross receipts formula\u201d to be a reasonable method of allocation of capital and, as such, not violative of either the Due Process or the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. In so holding, the court construed and explained R. C. 5725.13, 5725.14, and 5725.15 in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">\u201cBy reading Sections 5725.13, 5725.14 and 5725.15 <em>in pari materia, </em>it is clear that the tax on the shares of shareholders of a dealer in intangibles is assessed at the fair value of the capital employed in this state, allocated on the basis of the ratio of the gross receipts of the Ohio office or offices from consumer financing to the entire gross receipts from the dealer\u2019s small-loan and consumer finance business. * * *\u201d.,174 Ohio St. at 241..</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">-We do not construe <em>.Certified Credit </em>as dispositive of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the instant cause, however, as the opinion'in that case does not indicate the manner in which the taxpayer therein' operated its business. Although it is clear that out-of-state subsidiaries were involved in <em>Certified Credit, </em>it is not clear whether such subsidiaries were maintained as separately incorporated entities or as non-corporate divisions of the corporate parent. As a difference in R. C. Chapter 5725 taxation may result, as will be discussed <em>infra, </em>such distinction is crucial, and compels rejection of <em>Certified Credit </em>as controlling authority applicable herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In <em>Household Finance Corp. </em>v. <em>Porterfield, supra, </em>the court held, at page 42, that <em>\u201c* </em>* * [T]he burden of the DIT tax falls * * * upon its [IIFC\u2019s] issued and outstanding shares of capital stock; but only to the extent of the fair value of the capital employed (capital stock, surplus and undivided profits) in this state, measured by the ratio which the Ohio gross receipts of HFC bear to its total gross receipts of DIT business. R. C. 5725.15.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In fn. 1 of the opinion in <em>Household Fmanee, </em>at page 40, the court indicated that the parent corporation, in filing a consolidated dealer-in-int,angibles return pursuant to R. C. 5725.14, was the real party in interest with respect to its \u2018 \u2018 corporate subsidiaries which are also engaged as dealers in intangibles in Ohio. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Analysis of <em>Household Finance Corp. </em>v. <em>Porterfield, supra, </em>reveals that only returns, of dealers in intangibles as defined in R. C. 5725.01 may be included in an R. C. 5725.-14 consolidated return, and, concomitantly, that only loans discounted by such dealers qualify for inclusion in the denominator of the R. C. 5725.15 apportionment formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In the instant cause, Sun included loans discounted by its wholly-owned out-of-state corporate subsidiaries in the denominator of the R. C. 5725.15 apportionment formula. Under <em>Household Finance, </em>however, only those loans discounted by a dealer in intangibles may be so included. In order to qualify as a dealer in intangibles, R. C. 5725.01 (B) requires that an \u201coffice or other place of business\u201d be kept in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Sun has decided to operate its business using separately incorporated divisions rather than non-corporate branch offices or subsidiaries, apparently in order to limit its tort and contract liability. In so doing, however, Sun has exposed itself to greater R.. C. Chapter 5725 tax liability, for each such separately incorported division must keep an Voffice or other place of business\u201d in this state to .qualify as a dealer in intangibles. Since no such offices exist, loans discounted by Sun\u2019s separately incorporated out-of-state divisions may not be included in the denominator of the R. C. 5725.15 allocation- formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u2022. This result is mandated by statute, even though all such loans ;inust be included in the assets of Sun in makiUg the fair, value .computation required by .R. C. 5725.13, Sun is the-parent corporation, and, as such, its capital account includes the value, of its wholly-owned, separately, incorporated,, out-of-state divisions. This capital is available for use in this state and thus is \u201ccapital employed\u201d in this, state in accordance with R. Q. 5725.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the. decision-of the Board of Tax Appeals is unreasonable and unlawful, and is reversed,-</p>\n<p id=\"ASe\">\n<em>Decision reversed.-</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"ApW\">O.\u2019Neill, C.
