The real parties in interest contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>under Government Code section 815.6, which creates a private right of action against public entities that fail to discharge a \u201cmandatory duty,\u201d the DOC may be held liable for such losses because the DOC violated Corporations Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 25612\u2019s command not to rescind any order without first finding \u201cthat the action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this law [the Corporate Securities Law of 1968].\u201d (\u00a7 25612.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">As explained below, when viewed in context, section 25612 is discretionary and does not create any mandatory duty under Government Code section 815.6. In addition, it is clear that the Legislature intended that violations of section 25612 would not give rise to any private right of action, and permitting the instant lawsuit to go forward would frustrate legislative intent. Thus, while the investors\u2019 losses are indeed tragic, we conclude the instant claim <em>against the DOC </em>for redress of those losses fails as a matter of law. Consequently, we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">FACTS<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">On February 15, 2006, the real parties in interest, 44 investors (the investors), sued the DOC for $7.72 million in investment losses sustained when they purchased valueless securities in a \u201cPonzi\u201d scheme perpetrated by Daniel William Heath, Heath and Associates, Inc., Larry J. Schlarmann, and Schlarmann and Associates, Inc. The investors bought the securities based on the promise that the investments were safer than stocks and bonds and would guarantee 5.5 to 10 percent annual returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">On March 30, 1998, the DOC issued a desist and refrain order against Schlarmann and his related business entities .(the Schlarmann entities), and a separate but substantially similar order against Heath and his related business entities (the Heath entities). The orders stated: \u201cPursuant to Section 25532 of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968, you are hereby ordered to desist and refrain from the further offer or sale in the State of California of securities ... for the reason that, in the opinion of the Commissioner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>Corporations of the State of California, the sale of such securities is subject to qualification under said law, such securities are being or have been offered for sale without first being so qualified, and the Commissioner of Corporations of the State of California finds that qualification of such securities is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, and is consistent with the purposes of the policy and provisions of the Corporate Securities Law of 1968.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The DOC also issued a desist and refrain order against the Heath entities regarding their brokerage activities, which stated: \u201cPursuant to Section 25532 of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968, you are hereby ordered to desist and refrain from acting as a broker-dealer in the State of California unless and until you have been licensed as such under said law or unless exempt, for the reason that, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Corporations of the State of California, you are acting or have acted as a broker-dealer in violation of Section 25210, and the Commissioner . . . finds that this Order is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, and is consistent with the purposes of the policy and provisions of the Corporate Securities Law of 1968.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The DOC subsequently modified/rescinded these orders by entering into \u201cstipulated settlements,\u201d first with the Heath entities on May 11, 1998, and then with the Schlarmann entities on June 25, 1998. The settlements provided that the Schlarmann and Heath entities would waive their rights to an administrative hearing and appeal contesting the desist and refrain orders; in return, the parties agreed that the orders were not statements of admission, liability, fault or breach of any statute, regulation or order, and were not intended to be a \u201cstatement as to the integrity\u201d of the Heath entities or the Schlarmann entities or of the \u201cinvestment potential\u201d of any security that those entities might offer, including the investments subject to the March 30, 1998 desist and refrain orders. The stipulated settlements state that the parties intended by the settlements to \u201csave time and expenses from further litigation of this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The investors\u2019 original complaint asserted four causes of action against the DOC, alleging that it failed to fulfill its duties under the Corporations Code of protecting investors, such as the plaintiffs, from the fraudulent sales of securities. The complaint cited various provisions of the Corporations Code that it alleged had been violated by the DOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>The DOC demurred to the complaint and the trial court sustained the demurrer as to each of the causes of action, ruling that the various Corporations Code sections cited by the investors in their complaint reflected discretionary, not mandatory duties and thus could not support liability. The court, however, noted that a provision cited by the investors in their opposition to the demurrer but not in their complaint\u2014section 25612\u2014\u201cappears to impose a mandatory duty to make certain findings prior to rescinding an order.\u201d The court further noted that the DOC had entered into stipulated settlements without making the \u201cfindings\u201d specified in section 25612, instead merely reciting that the settlements would \u201csave time and expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The trial court granted the investors leave to amend their complaint to state a claim based on a breach of the duty contained in section 25612. The court noted that the investors might not be able to amend their complaint in this fashion because \u201cif the commissioner has a discretionary duty to do something and then has a duty to make findings, the fact that the findings aren\u2019t made, which is the mandatory duty, does or does not necessarily give you the relief you\u2019re requesting.\u201d The court also stated that if the investors were unable to amend their complaint successfully, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get another chance to amend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The investors then filed a first amended complaint, repeating their allegations and contending that the DOC was liable for their financial losses based on its failure to perform its mandatory duty under section 25612. After the DOC again demurred, arguing, among other things, that section 25612 did not create a mandatory duty, the trial court overruled the demurrer, stating: \u201c[T]his court has already determined that [section] 25612 imposes a mandatory duty to make certain findings prior to rescinding an order. The [c]ourt granted leave to amend in order for plaintiffs to allege a specific violation of [section] 25612. . . . Plaintiffs have amended to allege such a violation.\u201d The court also determined that section 25612 was intended to protect against the kind of injury alleged by the investors, and that whether the DOC\u2019s violation of that section was the proximate cause of the investors\u2019 injury was \u201ca question of fact.\u201d Finally, the court ruled that there was no specific grant of statutory immunity that protected the DOC from the investors\u2019 claim. (See <em>Creason v. Department of Health Services </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 623, 635 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 489, 957 P.2d 1323] (Creason) [if liability is precluded by a \u201cspecific immunity statute,\u201d it cannot be found under Gov. Code, \u00a7 815.6, \u201c \u2018which simply imposes a general legal duty or liability\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">After answering the first amended complaint, the DOC petitioned this court for a peremptory writ of mandate, contending that if the trial court\u2019s ruling were allowed to stand, it would subject the DOC to \u201cunprecedented\u201d liability, making it essentially a guarantor of investments \u201cwhenever disgruntled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>investors perceive that the Department\u2019s [desist and refrain orders] somehow fall short of the terms of the [Corporate Securities Law of 1968].\u201d The DOC complained that by virtue of the instant case alone, \u201cthe Department is exposed to staggering losses that would amount to a significant percentage of its annual budget.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">In response to the DOC\u2019s writ petition, we issued an order to show cause and stayed the trial court proceedings pending our resolution of the question of whether section 25612 imposes a mandatory duty on the DOC under Government Code section 815.6. (See <em>State of California v. Superior Court </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 848, 853, fn. 4 [197 Cal.Rptr. 914] [granting writ relief where trial court overruled demurrer filed by real estate commissioner because \u201crelief by extraordinary writ is an appropriate remedy where, as here, it is desirable that an important jurisdictional question presented by the defense of governmental immunity be speedily determined\u201d]; <em>County of Sacramento v. Superior Court </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 479, 481 [105 Cal.Rptr. 374, 503 P.2d 1382] [writ relief \u201cis an appropriate remedy where ... it is desirable that an important jurisdictional question presented by the defense of sovereign immunity from suit should be speedily determined\u201d].) It is to this question we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The legal issue presented in this case concerns the intersection of two separate bodies of law, public entity liability under Government Code section 815.6, and the DOC\u2019s duties under the Corporate Securities Law of 1968. We, therefore, begin our analysis by summarizing the applicable legal principles with respect to each of these distinct bodies of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">A. <em>Public Entity Liability Under Government Code Section 815.6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">The California Tort Claims Act provides that a public entity is not liable for injury arising from an act or omission except as provided by statute. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 815, subd. (a) [\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute; [][] (a) A public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person\u201d]; <em>Shamsian </em>v. <em>Department of Conservation </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 621, 632 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 62].)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>One form of statutory public entity liability, enacted in 1963, is contained in Government Code section 815.6, which establishes a private right of action whenever: (i) \u201ca public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment\u201d; (ii) the enactment was \u201cdesigned to protect\u201d against the injury claimed; and (iii) the injury was \u201cproximately caused\u201d by the public entity\u2019s failure to discharge its mandatory duty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See <em>Haggis </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 490, 498 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 327, 993 P.2d 983] <em>(Haggis); State of California v. Superior Court, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at p. 854 [recognizing \u201cthree-pronged test for determining whether liability may be imposed on a public entity\u201d under Gov. Code, \u00a7 815.6].)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">In applying Government Code section 815.6, the first \u201cand foremost\u201d precondition to liability is that \u201cthe enactment at issue be <em>obligatory, </em>rather than merely discretionary or permissive, in its directions to the public entity; it must <em>require, </em>rather than merely authorize or permit, that a particular action be taken or not taken.\u201d <em>(Haggis, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 498.) \u201cIt is not enough, moreover, that the public entity or officer have been under an obligation to perform a function if the function itself involves the exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>Walt Rankin &amp; Associates, Inc. v. City of Murrieta </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 605, 614 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 48] [\u201cnot every statute that uses the word \u2018shall\u2019 is obligatory rather than permissive, and there may be factors other than statutory language that may indicate that apparently obligatory language was not intended to foreclose a government entity\u2019s exercise of discretion\u201d]; <em>County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court, supra, </em>102 Cal.App.4th at p. 639 [\u201cThe use of the word \u2018shall\u2019 in an enactment does not necessarily create a mandatory duty\u201d].) Thus, even where a statute includes \u201cmandatory language,\u201d there may be \u201c \u2018other factors [that] indicate that apparent obligatory language was not intended to foreclose a governmental entity\u2019s or officer\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Creason, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 631.)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">\u201cWhether an enactment creates a mandatory duty is a question of law ...\u201d <em>(Haggis, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 499; see <em>Nunn v. State of California </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 616, 624 [200 Cal.Rptr. 440, 677 P.2d 846] <em>(Nunn).) </em>In deciding whether a statute imposes a mandatory duty, the courts look to legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>intent, which is determined primarily, although not exclusively, from the statutory text. <em>(Nunn, </em>at p. 624.) In construing the statute, we must give the statute a reasonable construction that conforms to the apparent purpose and intention of the lawmakers, and \u201cthe various parts of the statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause in the context of the whole statute.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 625; see <em>Haggis, </em>at p. 500 [reviewing court must \u201cexamine the language, function and apparent purpose of\u2019 the pertinent statutory provision \u201cto determine if [it] creates a mandatory duty\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">B. <em>The Corporate Securities Law of 1968</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Section 25612 was enacted as part of a comprehensive reform of California\u2019s securities laws passed by the Legislature as the Corporate Securities Law of 1968 (the Act). (\u00a7 25000 et seq.; see generally 1 Marsh &amp; Volk, Practice Under the Cal. Securities Laws (2006) \u00a7 1.01 et seq. (Marsh and Volk).) The \u201cprimary objective\u201d of the Act was the \u201ccreation of a balanced regulatory scheme to cope with the problems of modem securities markets in California.\u201d (Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.01, p. 1-3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Under the Act, all offers and sales of securities in California must be qualified with the Commissioner of the DOC (the Commissioner) unless specifically exempted. (\u00a7 25110.) Similarly, persons may not act as broker-dealers<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or investment advisors<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the State of California without first obtaining a certificate from the Commissioner authorizing such activity. (\u00a7\u00a7 25210, 25230.) The Act also prohibits a number of deceptive practices, such as utilizing false or misleading statements in the purchase or sale of securities and engaging in insider trading. (\u00a7\u00a7 25501, 25502.)</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The Act provides two primary enforcement mechanisms. First, it authorizes the Commissioner to prevent violations of the Act by issuing injunctive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>orders against violators of the Act. Second, it provides for private rights of action by injured parties directly against violators of the Act for financial losses incurred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">1. <em>Enforcement by the Commissioner</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Section 25532 of the Act provides discretionary authority to the Commissioner to enforce the Act\u2019s licensing and qualification requirements. Section 25532, subdivision (a) states that \u201c[i]f, in the opinion of the commissioner,\u201d a security is being sold without proper qualification, \u201cthe commissioner may order the issuer or offeror of the security to desist and refrain from the further offer or sale of the security until qualification has been made.\u201d Similarly, under section 25532, subdivision (b), \u201c[i]f, in the opinion of the commissioner,\u201d a person is acting \u201cas a broker-dealer or investment adviser\u201d without first being licensed to do so, \u201cthe commissioner may order that person to desist and refrain from the activity until the person has been appropriately licensed or the required filing has been made under this law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Once the Commissioner has issued such an order, the Act provides certain procedural rights to persons affected by the order, including the right to a hearing challenging the order under the Administrative Procedures Act. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 25532, subd. (d); Gov. Code, \u00a7 11500 et seq.) If a hearing is not requested, however, the Commissioner\u2019s order becomes final and cannot be reviewed by any court or agency. (\u00a7 25532, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Section 25612 of the Act, which is contained in a chapter of the Act entitled \u201cAdministration,\u201d provides: \u201cNo rule, form or order may be made, amended, or rescinded unless the commissioner finds that the action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">2. <em>Enforcement by Private Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">The Act also creates a \u201cnew form of statutory liability\u201d in the form of private rights of action designed to \u201cafford victims of securities fraud a remedy without the task of proving common law fraud.\u201d <em>(Boam </em>v. <em>Trident Financial Corp. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 738, 743, 744 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 177]; see <em>America Online, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1, 14 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 699] [\u201cThis California law was designed to protect the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>from fraud and deception in securities matters, by providing statutory remedies for violations of the California Corporations Code\u201d].) Thus, in a chapter entitled \u201cCivil Liability,\u201d the Act specifically authorizes four separate causes of action to enable private plaintiffs to seek redress directly from persons who have violated certain of its provisions. (See \u00a7\u00a7 25500, 25501, 25502, 25503.)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Specifically, the Act creates a private right of action for: (i) buyers or sellers of securities who are injured by persons who violate section 25400, which prohibits actions that \u201ccreat[e] a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for any security\u201d (see \u00a7 25500); (ii) buyers and sellers of securities who are injured by persons who violate section 25401, which prohibits the use of \u201cuntrue statements] of a material fact\u201d or omissions of material facts to buy or sell securities (see \u00a7 25501); (iii) buyers and sellers of securities who are injured by persons who violate section 25402, which prohibits certain forms of insider trading (\u00a7 25502); and (iv) buyers of securities sold in violation of sections 25110, 25120 or 25130, which require securities sold in California to either be qualified for sale or exempt from the qualification requirements (\u00a7 25503). In each instance, the private right of action is created against the person (or persons) alleged to have violated the specified provisions of the Act. Significantly, there is no suggestion that the DOC can be held liable for either: (i) another person\u2019s violation of the provisions of the Act for which a private right of action is provided; or (ii) itself violating provisions of the Act for which no private right of action is provided, such as section 25612.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">While intending to minimize securities fraud, the drafters of the Act were also cognizant of the dangers of casting the net of civil liability too broadly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>In the words of its principal drafters,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Act \u201cattempts to provide a scheme of liability . . . that will adequately protect the investing public without undue hardship upon persons who might be potential defendants in such actions.\u201d (Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.01 [3], p. 14-14; cf. <em>Boam </em>v. <em>Trident Financial Corp., supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at p. 744 [noting the Act \u201cimposed certain restrictions\u201d on recovery, \u201csuch as shortening the statute of limitations for bringing a statutory action and limiting the damages available\u201d]; <em>California Amplifier, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at p. 109 [\u201cThe purpose of the Act in this regard is to create statutory liability that eliminates some of the elements of common law fraud, but balances this expansion of liability by placing other restrictions on recovery\u201d].) In section 25510, the Act explicitly directs courts not to rely on the Act\u2019s provisions to authorize private rights of action beyond those explicitly enumerated. (\u00a7 25510 [mandating that except as \u201cexplicitly provided,\u201d no civil liability in favor of \u201cany private party\u201d against any \u201cperson\u201d (including government) shall arise by \u201cimplication from or as a result of the violation of any provision of this law or any rule or order hereunder\u201d].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The drafters emphasized that \u201c[i]t is difficult to see how language\u201d restricting the creation of causes of action for violations of the Act \u201ccould be any more explicit than that contained in [section] 25510.\u201d (Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.02[2], p. 14-15.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>C. <em>Section 25612 Does Not Create a Mandatory Duty Under Government Code Section 815.6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Investors contend that their complaint\u2019s allegations state a claim against the DOC under Government Code section 815.6 for breach of a mandatory duty embodied in section 25612. They argue that their claim satisfies all three prongs of Government Code section 815.6 because: (i) \u201csection 25612 imposes a mandatory duty upon [the DOC] to make a specific finding that an act \u2018is necessary or appropriate in the public interest. . .\u2019 <em>before </em>it may make, amend, or rescind an order\u201d; (ii) the requirement that the DOC make these findings was intended to protect against the kind of injury suffered by the investors; and (iii) the breach of the DOC\u2019s mandatory duty to make the requisite finding was a proximate cause of \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 investment losses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">We disagree that section 25612 creates any mandatory duty under Government Code section 815.6, and thus analyze, and resolve, the investors\u2019 contention solely by reference to the first prong of Government Code section 815.6 liability. (See <em>Haggis, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 498 [declining to decide whether claims satisfied second and/or third prongs for Gov.

(a)) a security is being offered without qualification or a broker-dealer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>is operating without an appropriate license, the Commissioner is not required to take any action. Rather, the Act is explicitly permissive, stating only that if the Commissioner perceives such a violation, he \u201cmay\u201d issue a desist and refrain order, as the Commissioner did in this case. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The investors acknowledge that the decision to <em>issue </em>a desist and refrain order is discretionary, but contend that once such an order has been issued, it cannot be <em>rescinded </em>without the Commissioner first making a mandatory \u201cfinding\u201d that the Commissioner\u2019s own action is \u201cnecessary or appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The investors argue that this statutory command creates a basis for liability against the DOC under Government Code section 815.6.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">First, the only thing that section 25612 mandates is that the Commissioner <em>\u201cfinds\u201d </em>that his actions are \u201cnecessary or appropriate.\u201d (\u00a7 25612, italics added.) The section does not provide any further guidance with respect to exactly what the Commissioner must do, for example, by mandating written or even express <em>findings. </em>(See <em>Ensworth v. Mullvain </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1105, 1112 [274 Cal.Rptr. 447] [statute that authorized an injunction if the judge \u201c \u2018finds by clear and convincing evidence that unlawful harassment exists,\u2019 \u201d did not \u201crequire the court to make a specific finding on the record\u201d prior to issuing injunction, but was satisfied by finding \u201cnecessarily implie[d]\u201d by the issuance of injunction itself].) In fact, the section does not appear to require any <em>action </em>at all, but rather a state of mind: that the Commissioner, before acting, deems the action to be taken \u201cnecessary or appropriate.\u201d (\u00a7 25612.) This statutory language, which fails to mandate any <em>specific </em>conduct on the part of the Commissioner, strongly supports a conclusion that section 25612 does not create any \u201cmandatory duty.\u201d <em>(O\u2019Toole v. Superior Court </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 488, 510 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 531] [\u201cA statute is deemed to impose a mandatory duty on a public official only if the statute affirmatively imposes the duty and provides implementing guidelines\u201d]; <em>Clausing v.

Code, \u00a7 815.6 liability \u201cthat the public entity or officer have been under an obligation to perform a function if the function itself involves the exercise of discretion\u201d].) The Commissioner is required to find that his action is \u201cnecessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions\u201d of the Act. (\u00a7 25612.) This legislative command does not dictate any particular result, or even provide a standard by which action taken by the Commissioner can be objectively measured, but rather \u201cexplicitly calls upon the judgment, expertise and discretion of the\u201d Commissioner to define what action, if any, is \u201cnecessary or appropriate\u201d\u2014again, strongly supporting the conclusion that there is no mandatory duty. <em>(Haggis, </em>at p. 507 [statutory language that calls upon the judgment, expertise and discretion of the public officer \u201cdoes not create a mandatory duty within the meaning of Government Code section 815.6\u201d]; see <em>Fox </em>v. <em>County of Fresno </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 1238, 1244 [216 Cal.Rptr. 879] [\u201cIf the statute were to be construed as mandatory, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile that part of the statute which says that \u2018the enforcement agency shall\u2019 with that portion which gives the agency the authority to take \u2018any appropriate action\u2019 \u201d].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In sum, while section 25612 includes language that appears mandatory, this language is situated squarely within a statutory framework that entrusts the action to be taken, if any, to the sound judgment, expertise and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>discretion of the Commissioner. In our view, such an enactment does not create a mandatory duty under Government Code section 815.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">E. <em>The Act Evidences an Unambiguous Legislative Intent to Preclude the Creation of Any Implicit Private Rights of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In addition to our conclusion in the preceding section that section 25612 creates only discretionary, not mandatory, duties, we also conclude the investors\u2019 action must be dismissed on a separate and independent ground. The investors\u2019 lawsuit, which seeks to hold the DOC liable for violating section 25612, contravenes section 25510 of the Act, which demonstrates a clear legislative intent that a violation of section 25612 creates no private right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In section 25510, the Act expresses a clear and unambiguous legislative intent that, apart from the four specific private rights of action provided in sections 25500 through 25503, no other private remedies are intended. Specifically, section 25510 states that except as \u201cexplicitly provided,\u201d no civil liability in favor of \u201cany private party\u201d shall arise against \u201cany person by implication from or as a result of the violation of any provision of this law or any rule or order hereunder.\u201d (\u00a7 25510.) The clear import of this provision, as supported by the statements of the drafters of the Act, is that section 25510 is intended \u201cto make it clear that the judiciary is not authorized to invent causes of action . . . additional to those provided in the statute.\u201d (Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.02[1], p. 14-14].) In other words, section 25510 is specifically intended \u201cto prevent the courts from using other provisions of the [Act] to create implied causes of action.\u201d (Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.02[1], p. 14-15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The investors\u2019 theory of liability in the instant case\u2014that the DOC can be held liable for violating section 25612\u2014is directly contrary to section 25510 in that it creates <em>implicit </em>civil liability as \u201ca result of the violation of [a] provision of\u2019 the Act. (\u00a7 25510.)  To permit such liability under the general command of Government Code section 815.6 would violate the Legislature\u2019s more recently enacted and more specific command in section 25510, and frustrate its express purpose that courts not rely on \u201cother provisions of the statute\u201d to create causes of action \u201cadditional to those\u201d specifically provided. (Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.02[1], pp. 14-14 to 14-15; \u00a7 25510; see <em>Arbuckle-College City Fire Protection Dist. v. County of Colusa </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1166 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 182] [\u201cGenerally, it can be presumed that when the Legislature has enacted a specific statute to deal with a particular matter, it would intend the specific statute to control over more general provisions of law that might otherwise apply\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Toney </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 228, 232 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 577, 82 P.3d 778] <em>(Toney) </em>[\u201cIf the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>statutory language is unambiguous, \u2018we presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the statute governs\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Of course, a specific legislative intent need not appear in section 25612 to create a private right of action to enforce that section as it is Government Code \u201csection 815.6, not the predicate enactment, that creates the private right of action.\u201d <em>(Haggis, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 499-500, italics omitted [rejecting any requirement that the \u201cenactment establishing a mandatory duty <em>itself </em>manifest an intent to create a private right of action\u201d]; see <em>Walt Rankin &amp; Associates, Inc. v. City of Murrieta, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 614 [same].) Here, however, it is not the absence of a legislative intent in section 25612 that concerns us, but rather the presence of a clear and explicit legislative intent that a violation of section 25612 <em>does not </em>give rise to any private right of action. Clearly, the Legislature may, when enacting legislation, provide that the new law creates only specifically enumerated private rights of action, and otherwise leaves the available legal remedies unchanged. The Legislature did just that here, and we are bound to honor its wishes. <em>(Toney, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 232 [\u201cIf the statutory language is unambiguous, \u2018we presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the statute governs\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">In sum, considering section 25612 in the context of the Act as a whole <em>(Nunn, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 624), we conclude that the Legislature intended: (i) that the Commissioner\u2019s actions with respect to section 25612 would be discretionary and not subject the DOC to liability under Government Code section 815.6; and (ii) that enactment of section 25612 would not create any private right of action against the DOC. As a result of either of these conclusions, and certainly both, liability is unavailable as a matter of law on the investors\u2019 claim for the DOC\u2019s alleged violation of section 25612. Consequently, the trial court should have sustained the DOC\u2019s demurrer to the investors\u2019 first amended complaint without leave to amend.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to vacate its November 9, 2006 order overruling the DOC\u2019s demurrer to the first amended complaint, and enter a new order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend and dismissing the first amended complaint.
