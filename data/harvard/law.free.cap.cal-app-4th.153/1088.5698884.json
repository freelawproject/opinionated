Code, \u00a7 12020, subd. (a)(4)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> possession of cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a)), possession of heroin (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a)), and unauthorized possession of a hypodermic needle or syringe (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4140). In a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found true four prior strike allegations and a prior prison term allegation. The trial court sentenced appellant to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life on the felony convictions, plus a one-year determinate term on the prior prison term. The court granted appellant credit for time served on the possession of a hypodermic syringe misdemeanor. Various fines and fees were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">On appeal appellant contends that: (1) the trial court erred when it denied his new trial motion based on juror misconduct; (2) the trial court improperly instructed on the elements of carrying a concealed dirk or dagger; (3) there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction for heroin and cocaine possession; (4) he was improperly convicted of possession of both heroin and cocaine under the instructions given; (5) the reasonable doubt instruction given was flawed; (6) one of appellant\u2019s two possession terms must be stayed pursuant to section 654; and (7) the trial court erred when it increased appellant\u2019s restitution and parole revocation fines in violation of section 1170. We agree with appellant\u2019s last two contentions, and in all other respects affirm. We publish that portion of this opinion that addresses the validity of the reasonable doubt instruction contained in Judicial Council of California Criminal Jury Instructions (2006-2007) CALCRIM No. 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">Between 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. on August 14, 2005, Police Officers Frederick Williams and Haywood Irving noticed appellant lying underneath a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>vehicle in the \u201cfar southwestern portion\u201d of the parking lot of an auto parts store in Fresno. The officers decided to check on appellant, whose upper body was under the car. Williams asked if appellant was okay and if he could speak to him. Appellant came out from under the vehicle and said \u201cSure.\u201d He had nothing in his hands at the time. Appellant told the officers he had just purchased the vehicle and was working on it. Williams asked appellant if he had anything illegal on him and appellant said he did not. Williams asked if he could search appellant, and appellant said \u201cSure. Go ahead.\u201d Williams felt an object in appellant\u2019s right front pocket. Williams put his hand \u201call the way in\u201d the pocket and removed a knife completely concealed in a sheath. Williams did not see the knife in appellant\u2019s pocket when he came out from under the vehicle. The knife was approximately 10 inches long, including the six-inch blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Williams then conducted a search of appellant\u2019s vehicle. In the trunk, he found a small metal box containing a hypodermic syringe with a dark brown substance later determined to be cocaine and heroin. At the preliminary hearing, Williams testified that the box was under an article of clothing, but he did not recall that at trial. Appellant\u2019s vehicle was subsequently impounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">At trial, Officer Williams placed the knife into the pants pocket of the jeans appellant was wearing at the time of the incident. Only a small portion of the scabbard was visible, as was the evidence tag, which had not been there at the time of the incident. When the pants were held up about 10 feet from Williams, he testified that the knife appeared to be concealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Hagop Toutikian sold the vehicle to appellant in March of 2005. Appellant was the registered owner, but he still owed a balance on the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">1.-4.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">5. <em>Did the trial court err in giving the CALCR1M No. 220 reasonable doubt instruction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">Appellant contends that instruction in the language of CALCRIM No. 220 violated his federal right to due process because it prevented the jury from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>considering the lack of evidence in determining whether a reasonable doubt existed as to his guilt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">CALCRIM No. 220, as given, provided: \u201cThe fact that a criminal charge has been filed against [appellant] is not evidence that the charge is true. You must not be biased against [appellant] just because he has been arrested, charged with a crime, or brought to trial, [ft] A defendant in a criminal case is presumed to be innocent. This presumption requires that the People prove each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. [][]... [ft] Whenever I tell you the People must prove something, I mean they must prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, [ft] Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leads [jzc] you with an abiding conviction that the charge is true. The evidence need not element [jzc] all possible doubt because everything in life is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. [][] In deciding whether the People have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt, you must impartially compare and consider <em>all the evidence that was received throughout the entire trial. </em>Unless the evidence proves [appellant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, he is entitled to an acquittal and you must find him not guilty.\u201d (Italics added.) The trial court then gave CALCRIM No. 222, which, in pertinent part, defined \u201cevidence\u201d as \u201cthe sworn testimony of witnesses, the exhibits admitted into evidence, and anything else I told you to consider as evidence.\u201d That instruction also stated that \u201c[n]othing that the attorneys say is evidence,\u201d that their remarks and questions are not evidence, and \u201c[o]nly the witnesses\u2019 answers are evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Appellant contends that because reasonable doubt may arise from the lack of evidence in a case as well as from the evidence presented at trial <em>(People </em>v. <em>Simpson </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 553, 566 [275 P.2d 31]), the italicized language in CALCRIM No. 220 combined with the definition of \u201cevidence\u201d given in CALCRIM No. 222 \u201ccontain[s] a flaw resulting in a due process violation because the possibility that a reasonable doubt may arise from the lack of evidence is not included in the basic definition of reasonable doubt.\u201d As argued by appellant, \u201cby requiring a reasonable doubt to be based on the evidence presented, and by excluding argument as evidence, the instruction prevents the jury from basing a reasonable doubt upon the absence of sufficient evidence, even where defense counsel has argued that sufficient evidence is lacking.\u201d Appellant also contends that the instruction implies that \u201clack of evidence does not suffice for acquittal; rather, the defendant must adduce evidence that promotes a reasonable doubt.\u201d We see no reasonable likelihood that the jury understood and applied the instruction in the manner suggested by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the accused against conviction except on proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number><em>Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 361-362 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068] &amp; cases cited therein.) The United States Constitution does not require jury instructions to contain any specific language, but they must convey both that the accused is presumed innocent until proved guilty and that the accused may be convicted only upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Victor v. Nebraska </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 1, 5 [127 L.Ed.2d 583, 114 S.Ct. 1239].) When reviewing the correctness of reasonable doubt charges, the proper constitutional inquiry is \u201cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet the <em>Winship </em>standard.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 6.) \u201c \u2018The essential connection to a \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d factual finding cannot be made where the instructional error consists of a misdescription of the burden of proof, which vitiates <em>all </em>the jury\u2019s findings.\u2019 [Citation.] Where such an error exists, it is considered structural and thus is not subject to harmless error review. [Citation.] However, if a jury instruction is deemed \u2018ambiguous,\u2019 it will violate due process only when a reasonable likelihood exists that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a manner that violates the Constitution. [Citation.] Any challenged instruction must be considered in light of the full set of jury instructions and the trial record as a whole. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Gibson v. Ortiz </em>(9th Cir. 2004) 387 F.3d 812, 820-821; see also <em>People v. Smithey </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 963 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 978 P.2d 1171].)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Here, the plain language of the instruction given tells the jury that \u201c[ujnless the evidence proves the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, he is entitled to an acquittal and you must find him not guilty.\u201d (CALCRIM No. 220.) Identical language was given in a similar instruction, CALCRIM No. 103, at the beginning of trial. The only reasonable understanding of this language is that a lack of evidence could lead to reasonable doubt. In addition, the trial court instructed the jury with CALCRIM No. 355, which specifically stated that a defendant \u201cmay rely on [the] state of the evidence and argue that the People have failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Nothing about the instructions given implies to the jury that the defendant must adduce evidence that promotes reasonable doubt or that the defendant must persuade the jury of his or her innocence by evidence presented at trial. <em>(People v. Hern\u00e1ndez R\u00edos </em>(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1154 [60 Cal.Rptr.3d 591].)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">We see no violation of appellant\u2019s federal constitutional rights in the language of CALCRIM No. 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>6., 7.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The matter is remanded to the trial court to stay execution of sentence pursuant to section 654 on either count 2 or 3. The trial court is directed to modify the judgment to reflect a restitution fine and a parole revocation restitution fine each in the amount of $1,000. (\u00a7\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b), 1202.45.) The court is directed to order that the clerk of the superior court then prepare and forward to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation an amended abstract of judgment. As so modified and in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Levy, Acting R J., and Cornell, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 31, 2007, S155713.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-12\"> Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b875-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1088.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b878-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1088.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
