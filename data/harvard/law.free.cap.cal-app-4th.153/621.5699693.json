(a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the issue of licensure is \u201ccontroverted\u201d by the defendant, then the contractor must prove licensure by producing a verified certificate from the Contractors\u2019 State License Board. (\u00a7 7031, subd. (d).) In this case, we hold that a defendant\u2019s answer containing a general denial of the material allegations of the contractor\u2019s claim (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 431.30, subd. (b)(1)) is sufficient to \u201ccontrovert\u201d the contractor\u2019s allegation of licensure, and thus invokes the requirement of section 7031, subdivision (d), that the contractor prove licensure by producing a verified certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">Defendant and cross-complainant Edwin\u2019s Plumbing Co., Inc. (Edwin\u2019s), appeals from a judgment entered after the trial court granted a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>nonsuit on Edwin\u2019s cross-complaint in favor of plaintiff and cross-defendant Advantec Group, Inc. (Advantec).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Advantec was the developer of a multiunit apartment building. It hired Edwin\u2019s to furnish plumbing services and materials, pursuant to a subcontract dated December 29, 2003. Edwin\u2019s worked on the project from February 2004 until November 2004, when Advantec terminated Edwin\u2019s from the project, prior to its completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In January 2005, Advantec filed an action for breach of contract against Edwin\u2019s.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint sought damages of $168,476.40, plus attorney fees. Edwin\u2019s filed an answer to the complaint in March 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In January 2006, Edwin\u2019s filed a cross-complaint alleging, inter alia, breach of contract by Advantec.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Edwin\u2019s alleged that it \u201cis a licensed plumbing contractor, performing work under the laws of the state of California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Advantec filed an answer to the cross-complaint, in which it denied \u201ceach and every allegation\u201d of the cross-complaint, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 431.30. The answer did not include a specific challenge to Edwin\u2019s licensure status.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">In March 2006, the matter was tried by a jury. When Shagen Galstanyan (the majority shareholder of Edwin\u2019s) began testifying and was asked whether he is a licensed plumber, Advantec objected, pursuant to section 7031, that Edwin\u2019s licensure had to be proved by way of a verified certificate. The court tentatively sustained the objection, but allowed the testimony to continue, subject to revisiting the issue later.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">During the subsequent discussion, the court stated it planned to preclude Edwin\u2019s from introducing evidence regarding its licensure other than that which is required by section 7031\u2014a verified certificate of licensure from the Contractors\u2019 State License Board. Counsel for Edwin\u2019s requested a continuance to permit her to acquire the verified certificate from the state licensing board. Advantec\u2019s counsel represented to the court that acquiring the certificate would take at least two weeks. The court declined to continue the case, but agreed to hear further argument the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Counsel for Edwin\u2019s subsequently argued that the issue of its licensure constituted \u201cnew matter\u201d pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 431.30 and, as such, was required to be pleaded as an affirmative defense in Advantec\u2019s answer. Because it was not raised in that manner, counsel argued, the defense was waived. After Edwin\u2019s rested its case, the trial court, outside of the presence of the jury, discussed the matter with counsel further, and ultimately granted Advantec\u2019s motion for a nonsuit on the cross-complaint based on the failure by Edwin\u2019s to produce proof of licensure. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Advantec for $46,200, and this appeal from the judgment follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A-Y\">I. Section 7031</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Edwin\u2019s contends that the trial court erred in concluding that Advantec\u2019s general denial in its answer to the cross-complaint controverted the issue of Edwin\u2019s licensure, such that Edwin\u2019s was required to prove licensure \u201cby production of a verified certificate of licensure from the Contractors\u2019 State License Board.\u201d (\u00a7 7031, subd. (d).) We conclude that the trial court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Section 7031, subdivision (a), provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as provided in subdivision (e) [which sets forth limited circumstances, not applicable here, under which substantial compliance may be established], no person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor, may bring or maintain any action, or recover in law or equity in any action, in any court of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract where a license is required by this chapter <em>without alleging that he or she was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act or contract, regardless of the merits of the cause of action brought by the </em>person.\u201d (Italics added.) Under subdivision (d) of section 7031, \u201c[i]f licensure or proper licensure is controverted, then proof of licensure pursuant to this section shall be made by production of a verified certificate of licensure from the Contractors\u2019 State License Board which establishes that the individual or entity bringing the action was duly licensed in the proper classification of contractors at all times during the performance of any act or contract covered by the action. Nothing in this subdivision shall require any person or entity controverting licensure or proper licensure to produce a verified certificate. When licensure or proper licensure is controverted, the burden of proof to establish licensure or proper licensure shall be on the licensee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Read together, subdivisions (a) and (d) of section 7031 provide that the contractor must plead licensure, and, if licensure is \u201ccontroverted,\u201d must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>also prove licensure by producing a verified certificate. The issue here is whether an answer that makes a general denial is sufficient to \u201ccontrovert\u201d the pleading of licensure, such that, under subdivision (d), the contractor must produce a certificate of licensure. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">An answer may contain a \u201cgeneral . . . denial of the material allegations of the complaint controverted by the defendant.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 431.30, subd. (b)(1).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The effect of a general denial is to \u201cput in issue the material allegations of the complaint.\u201d <em>(FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 383 [282 Cal.Rptr. 508].) Code of Civil Procedure section 431.10, subdivision (a) defines a \u201cmaterial allegation in a pleading\u201d as \u201cone essential to the claim or defense and which could not be stricken from the pleading without leaving it insufficient as to that claim or defense.\u201d Because section 7031, subdivision (a), requires the pleading of licensure (without it, the contractor cannot recover, regardless of the merits of the claim), the allegation of licensure is a \u201cmaterial\u201d allegation subject to being controverted by a general denial. Therefore, faced with an answer that makes a general denial, the contractor is required by section 7031, subdivision (d), to prove the allegation of licensure, and can do so only by producing a verified certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Edwin\u2019s contends that nonlicensure constitutes \u201cnew matter\u201d under section 431.30, subdivision (b)(2), which provides that an answer must contain \u201c[a] statement of any new matter constituting a defense,\u201d in other words, an affirmative defense. Thus, according to Edwin\u2019s, the failure to plead nonlicensure as an affirmative defense, or to raise it as an objection in abatement regarding Edwin\u2019s capacity to sue, precluded Advantec from raising the issue at trial. However, \u201c[generally, a party must raise an issue as an affirmative defense where the matter is not responsive to essential allegations of the complaint.\u201d <em>(Bevill </em>v. <em>Zoura </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 694, 698 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 635].) Nonlicensure <em>is </em>responsive to an essential allegation of the complaint, and therefore does not constitute \u201cnew matter.\u201d  \u201cUnder a general denial, the defendant may urge any defense tending to show that the plaintiff has no right to recover or no right to recover to the extent that he or she claims. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d (49A Cal.Jur.3d (2002) Pleading, \u00a7 186, citing in fn. 3 <em>Aetna Carpet Co. v. Penzner </em>(1951) 102 Cal.App.2d 859, 860 [228 P.2d 347].) Edwin\u2019s argument ignores the plain language of section 431.30, subdivision (b)(1), under which the material allegations of a complaint may be \u201ccontroverted\u201d by a general denial, and the plain language of section 7031, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>subdivision (d), which provides that once the allegation of licensure is \u201ccontroverted,\u201d the contractor has the burden of proving licensure by producing a valid certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Similarly, Edwin\u2019s contends that a contractor\u2019s licensure status involves its capacity to sue, and an objection as to a party\u2019s capacity to sue constitutes \u201cnew matter\u201d that must be raised as a plea in abatement, and must be specifically pleaded. Edwin\u2019s cites, for example, <em>Color-Vue, Inc. </em>v. <em>Abrams </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1604 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 443], in which the court stated that a plea in abatement such as lack of capacity to sue \u201c \u2018. . . is a technical objection and must be pleaded specifically. Thus an affirmative defense or demurrer which contains a general assertion that plaintiff has not stated a cause of action does not suffice to raise a plea in abatement. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d However, as stated in another case relied upon by Edwin\u2019s, \u201cUnless the governing statute states otherwise, a complaint need not allege the plaintiff\u2019s capacity to sue. If lack of capacity does not appear on the face of the complaint, it cannot be raised by demurrer, but is a special plea in abatement. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Hydrotech Systems, Ltd. v. Oasis Waterpark </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 988, 994, fn. 4 [277 Cal.Rptr. 517, 803 P.2d 370].) Thus, the court in <em>Hydrotech </em>recognized that some statutes require that a complaint include an allegation of capacity to sue, and distinguished such situations from the ordinary one in which capacity to sue is not alleged in the complaint. As noted, section 7031 is one such statute that requires inclusion of an allegation of the plaintiff\u2019s capacity to sue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Capacity to sue having been alleged in the complaint, a refutation of that capacity does not introduce new matter, and need not be specifically pleaded as an objection in abatement. A general denial is sufficient to controvert an allegation of licensure pursuant to section 7031.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The cases upon which Edwin\u2019s relies on appeal do not suggest that nonlicensure must be raised by way of an affirmative defense. In <em>MW Erectors, Inc. v. Niederhauser Ornamental &amp; Metal Works Co., Inc. </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 412 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 755, 115 P.3d 41] <em>(MW Erectors), </em>Niederhauser had entered into a subcontract with a general contractor to provide metal work for a large construction project. Niederhauser in turn subcontracted with MW Erectors (MW) to perform a portion of the metal work. Niederhauser later sued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the general contractor and the project owner for amounts due, and that matter settled. MW then sued Niederhauser for amounts allegedly due on its subcontract. Niederhauser moved for summary judgment on the basis that MW\u2019s claims were barred by section 7031 because MW was not properly licensed. In response, MW asserted that Niederhauser was judicially estopped from making that claim because it had implicitly represented in the related action against the owner and general contractor that MW was properly licensed. (36 Cal.4th at pp. 419-420.) The Supreme Court rejected that argument <em>(id. </em>at pp. 421-425), based in part on the conclusion that section 7031 did not require Niederhauser to allege, in its complaint against the owner and general contractor, the licensure status of its subcontractors. (36 Cal.4th at p. 424, fn. 5.) In doing so, the Supreme Court noted that the owner and general contractor \u201cwere free to assert the matter [of MW\u2019s nonlicensure] as an affirmative defense to Niederhauser\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 424.) It also commented that section 7031 \u201ccontemplates that nonlicensure must be raised as a defense,\u201d but found that \u201cno statutory provision explicitly requires a duly licensed contractor who is suing for money attributable to the work <em>of another entity </em>to affirmatively allege that <em>the other entity </em>was duly licensed.\u201d (36 Cal.4th at p. 424, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Thus, <em>MW Erectors </em>is inapposite to the issue presented here. The Supreme Court merely pointed out that the owner and general contractor could have asserted MW\u2019s nonlicensure \u201cas an affirmative defense\u201d in the action brought against them by Niederhauser, in which MW\u2019s licensure status <em>was not alleged in the complaint, and was not required to be. </em>Furthermore, the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that section 7031 \u201ccontemplates that nonlicensure must be raised as a defense\u201d <em>(MW Erectors, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 424, fn. 5), cannot be construed as a holding, or even a suggestion, that a general denial to a complaint is insufficient to controvert the required allegation in the complaint that the plaintiff is a licensed contractor. A general denial controverts, i.e., raises a defense to, all material allegations in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In <em>Walker v. Nitzberg </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 359 [91 Cal.Rptr. 526], Walker was the assignee of sums due on a residential building contract. Walker sued the homeowner to recover money paid to the contractor by the homeowner after the homeowner had received notice of the assignment. In concluding that Walker could not recover from the homeowner because the contractor was unlicensed, the Court of Appeal noted that the homeowner \u201cdid affirmatively allege in his answer . . . that Walker\u2019s assignor . . . was not a duly licensed contractor and thus tendered in issue the disability which attached to the contract between [the homeowner] and [the contractor].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 368.) Walker had not alleged in his complaint that the assignor/contractor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>licensed, nor \u201cthat he was a holder in due course or that he took the assignment in good faith without knowledge of the infirmity which attached to the contract assigned.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, here again the case relied upon by Edwin\u2019s did not decide or even address the issue presented in the case before us, because the plaintiff was not obligated to plead licensure and did not do so, and therefore the issue was raised as an affirmative defense in the defendant\u2019s answer. The fact that nonlicensure was raised as an affirmative defense in a different context in no way dictates that nonlicensure <em>must </em>be raised as an affirmative defense in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Edwin\u2019s next contends that even if the issue of nonlicensure was properly raised by a general denial, the trial court abused its discretion in denying its request for a continuance to permit it to obtain the required verified certificate from the state licensing board. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u201cGenerally, the power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>(Lucas v. George T. R. Murai Farms, Inc. </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1578, 1586 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 436].) \u2018Atrial court\u2019s exercise of discretion will be upheld if it is based on a \u201creasoned judgment\u201d and complies with the \u201c. . . legal principles and policies appropriate to the particular matter at issue.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Bullis v. Security Pac. Nat. Bank </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 801, 815 [148 Cal.Rptr. 22, 582 P.2d 109].)\u201d <em>(Color-Vue, Inc. </em>v. <em>Abrams, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at p. 1603.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Here, the legal principles and policies involved militate in favor of the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the continuance. As stated in <em>MW Erectors, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at page 423: <em>\u201cSection </em>7031(a) expressly provides that, \u2018regardless of the merits,\u2019 one may not \u2018bring or maintain <em>any action, </em>or recover in law <em>or equity </em>in any action, ... for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract where a license is required . . . without alleging that he or she was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act or contract.\u2019 (Italics added.) If the defendant then \u2018controvert\u00eds]\u2019 the plaintiff\u2019s proper licensure, <em>the plaintiff must prove it by producing verified certificates </em>establishing that he or she held all necessary licenses during performance of the work. (\u00a7 [7031], subd. (d).) [f] \u2018Because of the strength and clarity of this policy\u2019 <em>(Hydrotech Systems, Ltd. v. Oasis Waterpark[, supra,] </em>52 Cal.3d 988, 995 . . . <em>(Hydrotech)), </em>the bar of section 7031(a) applies \u2018[r]egardless of the equities.\u2019 <em>(Hydrotech, supra, </em>at p. 997.) Indeed, it has long been settled that \u2018the courts may not resort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>equitable considerations in defiance of section 7031.\u2019 <em>(Lewis &amp; Queen </em>v. <em>N. M. Ball Sons </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 141, 152 [308 P.2d 713] <em>(Lewis &amp; Queen).) </em>\u2018 \u201cSection 7031 represents a legislative determination that the importance of deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the contracting business <em>outweighs any harshness between the parties, </em>and that such deterrence can best be realized by denying violators the right to maintain any action for compensation in the courts of this state. [Citation.]...\u201d \u2019 <em>(Hydrotech, supra, </em>at p. 995, quoting <em>Lewis &amp; Queen, supra, </em>at p. 151, italics in <em>Hydrotech.)\u201d </em>(Third italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Thus, the strong, clear policy of the law placed the burden squarely on Edwin\u2019s as to proof of its licensure. Although we announce for the first time in this case the rule that a general denial sufficiently controverts an allegation of licensure, when read together the statutes at issue (\u00a7\u00a7 7031 and 431.30) plainly dictate this result. Edwin\u2019s could have had available for trial a verified certificate of its licensure, or could have clarified by way of contention interrogatories whether Advantec intended to contest the validity of its license, but it did neither.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is not accurate to say, as does Edwin\u2019s, that Advantec did not raise the issue until midtrial; as we have held, Advantec\u2019s general denial placed the issue in controversy. Nor can Advantec\u2019s conduct be described as sandbagging, where the clear weight of the statutory burden fell on Edwin\u2019s to prove its licensure.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Further, when Edwin\u2019s requested a continuance, the trial had already consumed four days, and was nearing completion. A continuance to permit Edwin\u2019s to obtain a verified certificate might well have resulted in a mistrial. Under these circumstances, the trial court was not required to delay the case for Edwin\u2019s to obtain the verified certificate it should have obtained before the trial began. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Manella, J., and Suzukawa, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-13\"> All further references to section 7031 are to the Business and Professions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-10\"> Advantec\u2019s complaint also included a second cause of action on the license bond against Surety Company of the Pacific, Edwin\u2019s surety.
