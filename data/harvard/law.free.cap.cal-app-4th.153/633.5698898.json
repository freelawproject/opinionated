Jose Reyes Ramirez injured his back and neck on the job in July 2004 and received temporary disability benefits for the period from July 13, 2004, through March 24, 2005. The question here is whether\u2014based on the date of Ramirez\u2019s injury and the dates his temporary disability benefits began and ended\u2014the workers\u2019 compensation administrative law judge (WCJ) properly calculated Ramirez\u2019s permanent disability award using the 1997 schedule for rating permanent disabilities, rather than the 2005 rating schedule. As we will explain, we agree with petitioners Energetic Painting and Drywall, Inc., and its insurer Zurich North America Insurance Company<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the WCJ used the wrong schedule. Accordingly, we will annul the order denying Energetic\u2019s petition for reconsideration and remand the case for recalculation of Ramirez\u2019s permanent disability rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In 2004, the Legislature enacted omnibus modification of the workers\u2019 compensation system. As pertinent here, Senate Bill No. 899 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) amended Labor Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 4660, which governs the calculation of the percentage of permanent disability. The amended statute required the administrative director to formulate a new rating schedule. (\u00a7 4660, subd. (b)(2).) That new schedule went into effect on January 1, 2005, superseding the 1997 rating schedule previously in effect. (See <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1313 [53 Cal.Rptr.3d 568].)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Subdivision (d) of section 4660 (section 4660(d)) provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he [2005] schedule . . . shall apply prospectively and shall apply to and govern only those permanent disabilities that result from compensable injuries received or occurring on and after the effective date of the adoption of the schedule .... For compensable claims arising before January 1, 2005, the [2005] schedule . . . shall apply to the determination of permanent disabilities when there has been either no comprehensive medical-legal report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability, or when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by Section 4061 to the injured worker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u201cWhile the statute is not a model of linguistic clarity, its intent is clear.\u201d <em>(Costco Wholesale Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 148, 157 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 611].) \u201c[W]hen any of the[] three circumstances [described in the final sentence of section 4660(d)] have occurred before January 1, 2005, the percentage of permanent disability will be calculated using the earlier schedule that was in effect on the date of the injury.\u201d <em>(Costco Wholesale, </em>at p. 152.) On the other hand, when <em>none </em>of the three circumstances has occurred before January 1, 2005, then the 2005 schedule applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">This case involves the proper application of the third circumstance described in section 4660(d)\u2014specifically, \u201cwhen the employer is not required to provide the notice required by Section 4061 to the injured worker.\u201d Subdivision (a) of section 4061 provides that \u201c[t]ogether with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity, the employer shall . . . provide the employee\u201d with a certain type of notice regarding permanent disability (hereafter the section 4061 notice).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, if the employer was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>provide the section 4061 notice to the injured worker before January 1, 2005, then the schedule in effect on the date of injury is to be applied in determining the extent of permanent disability; otherwise, the 2005 schedule is to be applied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Adopting the reasoning of two earlier decisions by panels of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB), the WCJ in this case decided that the percentage of Ramirez\u2019s permanent disability was to be determined under the 1997 schedule (which was in effect at the time of Ramirez\u2019s injury) because the WCAB panels had \u201cdistinguished between when a duty to provide a notice pursuant to Labor Code \u00a7 4660(d) arises from when it must be executed.\u201d Under the panels\u2019 reasoning, \u201cthe duty to provide the notice mentioned in \u00a7 4660(d) arises when temporary disability is [first] paid\u201d; therefore, \u201cthe 1997 permanent disability rating schedule must be applied\u201d \u201cwhen any temporary disability is paid in 2004.\u201d Because Ramirez\u2019s temporary disability benefits began in 2004, the WCJ concluded that the extent of his permanent disability had to be determined under the 1997 schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In December 2006, Energetic petitioned the WCAB for reconsideration of the WCJ\u2019s decision to apply the 1997 schedule. While that petition was pending, the WCAB (sitting en banc) decided <em>Pendergrass </em>v. <em>Duggan Plumbing </em>(2007) 72 Cal.Comp.Cases 95. In <em>Pendergrass, </em>a four-member majority of the WCAB agreed with the reasoning of the panel decisions on which the WCJ in this case had relied. According to the majority, \u201cthe employer \u2018is required\u2019 to provide the notice required by section 4061 once the first payment of temporary disability indemnity is made, although the timing of the notice is contingent on the duration of temporary disability indemnity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 99.) \u201cTherefore, if the first date of compensable temporary disability occurred prior to January 1, 2005, then the 1997 Schedule applies to determine the extent of permanent disability.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 96.)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The three dissenting members of the WCAB concluded that the \u201cplain language\u201d of sections 4061 and 4660(d) required a different result. <em>(Pendergrass v. Duggan Plumbing, supra, </em>72 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 100 (dis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>opn. of Miller).) In their view, the \u201cobligation to provide notice [does] not arise until the actual last payment of temporary disability indemnity.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Relying on the majority\u2019s decision in <em>Pendergrass, </em>the WCAB denied Energetic\u2019s petition for reconsideration in February 2007. Energetic subsequently petitioned this court for review. While that petition was pending, the WCAB granted reconsideration in <em>Pendergrass </em>and in April 2007 issued a new opinion in which the former dissenting view now became the majority (and vice versa).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Pendergrass v. Duggan Plumbing, supra, </em>72 Cal.Comp.Cases 456.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In May 2007, we issued a writ of review in this case to decide the proper interpretation of section 4660(d). Subsequently, Division Four of the Court of Appeal, First Appellate District addressed the issue in <em>Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>The <em>Costco </em>court agreed with the new majority in <em>Pendergrass </em>that an employer \u201cis required\u201d to give notice under section 4061 within the meaning of section 4660(d) when the employer makes the last payment of temporary disability benefits, not when those payments commence. <em>(Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>151 Cal.App.4th at p. 155.) According to the <em>Costco </em>court, \u201cthe legislative goal\u201d behind section 4660(d) was to bring \u201cas many cases as possible under the new workers\u2019 compensation law. (See Stats. 2004, ch. 34, \u00a7 49; <em>Green v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>[(2005)] 127 Cal.App.4th [1426,] 1441 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 527].) If ... the commencement of any temporary disability payments before 2005 required application of the rating schedule in effect at the time of injury, this legislative goal would be defeated. It would be rare, indeed, for temporary disability payments not to be owed or paid prior to 2005 for an injury occurring in or before 2004. Such a limited exception would be pointless where the Legislature could more easily have drafted the statute to apply the schedule in effect on the date of injury in all cases.\u201d <em>(Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>151 Cal.App.4th at p. 157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The <em>Costco </em>court also explained that if section 4660(d) were interpreted to require the 1997 schedule to be applied whenever temporary disability benefits were paid before 2005, it would \u201crender meaningless that portion of the statute that requires application of the 2005 schedule if, before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>2005, there was \u2018no comprehensive medical-legal report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability . . . .\u2019 Temporary disability will have been paid or owed before January 1, 2005, in virtually every case where a qualified medical examiner or doctor prepared a pre-2005 medical report indicating permanent disability, meaning there would be no practical need for the other two exceptions. \u2018 \u201c[A]n interpretation that renders statutory language a nullity is obviously to be avoided.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Branciforte Heights, LLC </em>v. <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 914, 937 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 96].)\u201d <em>(Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>151 Cal.App.4th at p. 157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">We wholeheartedly agree with the <em>Costco </em>court\u2019s interpretation of section 4660(d), which we believe is compelled by the plain language of sections 4061 and 4660(d). Because section 4061 provides that the employer must give the notice required by that statute to the injured worker \u201c[tjogether with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity,\u201d it follows as a matter of simple reasoning that an employer is \u201cnot required\u201d to provide that notice (within the meaning of section 4660(d)) until the last temporary disability payment is made or has become due. To conclude, as the original majority in <em>Pendergrass </em>did, that an employer is required to provide the section 4061 notice as soon as the first payment of temporary disability indemnity is made, even though that requirement does not have to be satisfied until the last payment is made, simply stretches the statutory language beyond its plain and ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u201cOur role in construing a statute is to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citation.] In determining intent, we look first to the words of the statute, giving the language its usual, ordinary meaning. If there is no ambiguity in the language, we presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the statute governs.\u201d <em>(Hunt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 984, 1000 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 236, 987 P.2d 705].)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Here, the plain meaning of the operative statutes compels the conclusion that Energetic was \u201cnot required\u201d to provide Ramirez with the section 4061 notice until March 2005, when Ramirez\u2019s temporary disability benefits ended. Since Energetic was not required to provide the section 4061 notice as of January 1, 2005, the 2005 table must be used to determine the extent of Ramirez\u2019s permanent disability, and the WCAB and the WCJ erred in concluding otherwise. Accordingly, we will remand this matter to the WCAB, so that it can send the case back to the trial level to recalculate Ramirez\u2019s permanent disability rating under the 2005 schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The WCAB\u2019s order denying Energetic\u2019s petition for reconsideration is annulled. The matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein. The parties shall bear their own costs in the proceedings before this court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.490(m)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Blease, Acting P. J., and Hull, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-12\"> We will refer to the two petitioners jointly as Energetic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\"> All further statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-10\"> Specifically, the employer must give the employee \u201c[n]otice . . . that no permanent disability indemnity will be paid because the employer alleges the employee has no permanent impairment or limitations resulting from the injury,\u201d \u201cnotice of the amount of permanent dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ability indemnity determined by the employer to be payable,\u201d or \u201c[n]otice that permanent disability indemnity may be or is payable, but that the amount cannot be determined because the employee\u2019s medical condition is not yet permanent and stationary.\u201d (\u00a7 4061, subd. (a)(1), (2).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b517-10\"> Of course, the schedule in effect on the date of injury also must be applied if either of the other two circumstances described in section 4660(d) occurred before 2005. Here, neither of those circumstances is at issue. Thus, we are concerned only with whether Energetic was required to provide Ramirez with the section 4061 notice before January 1, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\"> The explanation for this about-face lies in the fact that the composition of the WCAB changed after the original en banc decision in <em>Pendergrass, </em>and the new board member agreed with the three members who had dissented originally. (See <em>Pendergrass v. Duggan Plumbing </em>(2007) 72 Cal.Comp.Cases 456, 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">A petition for writ of review in <em>Pendergrass </em>is now pending in the Sixth Appellate District. <em>(Pendergrass v.
