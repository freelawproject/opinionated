J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQR\">Deanna C.\u2019s parental rights over her biological son, Cody B., were terminated in 2001 in a former dependency action. Cody was adopted by Vincent V, but Vincent allowed him to live at least part time with Deanna. At the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing in this action, the court removed Cody from Vincent\u2019s custody. Deanna and Cody appeal the order denying her request to have her designated his \u201cpresumed mother\" on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>the ground that under Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 366.26, subdivision (i)(1), the motions were impermissible collateral attacks on the earlier judgment of termination. We agree with the court\u2019s assessment. The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (the Agency), however, concedes the order must be reversed for the limited purpose of ensuring compliance with the inquiry and notice provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (the ICWA) (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Deanna has a history of drug abuse. She has four children: Michael, now an adult; K., bom in 1989; R., bom in 1994; and Cody, bom in 1993. In May 1997 the children were removed from Deanna\u2019s custody after they were found wandering the streets unsupervised and dirty, and her home was found unsuitable for children. Deanna was offered reunification services and the children were returned to her, but she was unable to comply and in August 1998 they were removed again. R. was eventually placed with Vincent, her biological father. In February 2001 the court terminated Deanna\u2019s parental rights to Cody, along with those of his biological father, and no appeal was taken. In 2002 Vincent adopted Cody and the court terminated its jurisdiction over the first dependency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Vincent nonetheless allowed Cody and R. to live with Deanna, at least sporadically. In September 2006 the children were living with Vincent when the Agency learned his home lacked proper plumbing, and Cody and R. had not bathed in more than a week and appeared at school dirty. The health department condemned the home as a safety hazard. Vincent agreed to a voluntary services case plan but before the Agency implemented it he was arrested for vandalism. It appears that on September 28 the children were delivered to Deanna, and they remained with her until October 9 when she left the state. Deanna left R. with the maternal grandmother and Cody with K., who was then 17 years of age and could not provide adequate care for him. Vincent was released from jail on October 3, but he did not retrieve the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">On October 13, 2006, the Agency placed Cody and R. in foster care and filed petitions on their behalves under section 300, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parents\u2019 whereabouts were unknown. When the social worker asked Cody where he and R. had been living, he said, \u201c \u2018[w]e mostly stayed with Vince, but went back and forth between him and my mom.\u2019 He said his mom didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>have a house so she would visit them where they lived with [Vincent.]\u201d Since Vincent\u2019s arrest, Cody had been staying with Deanna at a motel and at the home of a friend of Deanna. He wanted to live with Deanna even though she had no permanent housing. He did not want to live with Vincent because of physical abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The social worker wrote in the jurisdictional and dispositional report that \u201c[d]espite losing parental rights of Cody, [Deanna] has maintained a parental relationship with this child. Cody and [R.] have a close bond with their mother and hope to eventually return to her care.\u201d The social worker recommended that Vincent be offered reunification services for both children and Deanna be offered services only for R. because her parental rights over Cody were previously terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">On November 7 the court continued the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing because the parents\u2019 whereabouts remained unknown. The following day, Deanna telephoned the social worker and explained she \u201chad left town for a few weeks and went to Virginia to \u2018get my thoughts clear.\u2019 \u201d Deanna told the social worker that Vincent adopted Cody only so she could continue to have contact with him, and Cody and R. \u201chad stayed with her for a year, prior to her being evicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">On November 14 the court again continued the jurisdictional hearing, noting Vincent\u2019s whereabouts remained unknown. On November 27 Vincent appeared, but Deanna was not present. Attorneys for Deanna and Cody moved for her designation as his presumed mother, and the court denied the motions without prejudice. The court again continued the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Deanna first appeared at a special hearing on December 5, 2006, during which the court set a briefing schedule for the presumed mother issue. In January 2007 Deanna and Cody submitted memoranda of points and authorities in support of their motions. Cody\u2019s memorandum stated Vincent \u201callowed the children to live with [Deanna] soon after jurisdiction in the prior proceedings was terminated,\u201d and \u201cCody is in an adoption that has failed and there is an opportunity for him to live with his mother as his mother has continued to be an important person in his life.\u201d Deanna\u2019s memorandum stated that after termination of her parental rights over Cody in <em>2001 </em>\u201cshe continued to maintain regular custody of Cody.\u201d The motions sought reunification services for Deanna to assist her in gaining custody of Cody.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">The Agency opposed the motions, citing section 366.26, subdivision (i)(1). At a special hearing on February 7, the court denied the motions as improper collateral attacks on the earlier judgment of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>At a contested jurisdictional and dispositional hearing on February 20, the court sustained the petition, declared Cody a dependent child and continued him in foster care. The court ordered Vincent to comply with his case plan for Cody and R., and ordered Deanna to comply with her case plan for R. The court, however, also ordered the Agency to evaluate Deanna\u2019s home for possible placement of Cody, explaining that \u201c[i]f she can qualify as a foster mom she could be the foster mother.\u201d Additionally, the Agency informally agreed to facilitate visitation between Deanna and Cody. The Agency was concerned about Deanna\u2019s drug use and refusal to voluntarily undergo drug testing, and the court ordered her to report to the Substance Abuse Recovery Management System program.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">\n<em>Presumed Mother Status</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Deanna and Cody contend the juvenile court erred by determining that as a matter of law she cannot be deemed a presumed mother in this proceeding because of the earlier termination of her parental rights over him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They cite Family Code section 7611, subdivision (d), under which a man is a presumed father if he \u201creceives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.\u201d California differentiates between the rights of presumed, natural and alleged fathers, and \u201c \u2018[presumed father status ranks the highest. Only a \u201cstatutorily presumed father\u201d is entitled to reunification services under . . . section 361.5, subdivision (a) and custody of his child under . . . section 361.2.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Mary G. </em>(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 184, 197 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 703].)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">\u201cThe paternity presumptions are driven, not by biological paternity, but by the state\u2019s interest in the welfare of the child and the integrity of the family. [Citation.] The familial relationship between a nonbiological father and an older child (over two years of age), resulting from years of living together in a purported parent/child relationship, is \u2018considerably more palpable than the biological relationship of actual paternity\u2019 and \u2018should not be lightly dissolved.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Salvador M. </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1357-1358 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 705].)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>The scope of Family Code section 7611, subdivision (b) has been expanded by case law to include granting \u201cpresumed mother\u201d status to a nonbiological parent under certain circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Elisa B., supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at page 125, the court held a lesbian was the presumed mother of twins bom to her domestic partner, because she took them into her home and held them out as her natural children. In <em>In re Salvador M., supra, </em>111 Cal.App.4th at pages 1357-1359, the court held that a woman who raised her half brother as her son from the age of three w\u00e1s his presumed mother under Family Code section 7611, subdivision (d), particularly since the boy believed she was his mother and that her biological children were his siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">Deanna and Cody cite no authority for the designation of a biological mother, whose identity is of course known, as a presumed mother. They assert she is entitled to presumed mother status in this action because after her parental rights were terminated in 2001, Cody continued to live with her and she held him out to be her biological son.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-16\">In rejecting that argument, the juvenile court relied on section 366.26, subdivision (i)(1), which provides: \u201cAny order of the court permanently terminating parental rights under this section shall be conclusive and binding upon the child, upon the parent or parents and upon all other persons who have been served with citation by publication or otherwise as provided in this chapter. After making the order, the juvenile court shall have no power to set aside, change, or modify it, except as provided in paragraph (2), but nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the right to appeal the order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-20\">Under section 366.26, subdivision (i)(1), \u201ca juvenile court lacks jurisdiction to modify or revoke an order terminating parental rights once it has become final.\u201d <em>(In re Jerred H. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 793, 796 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 481] <em>(Jerred H.).) </em>In <em>Jerred H., </em>the appellate court held the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to consider a motion to establish the proposed adoptive father, from whom the teenage child was removed before the adoption was final, as a presumed father under Family Code section 7611, subdivision (d) after the termination of all parental rights under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-23\">In <em>Jerred H., </em>the court rejected the notion Family Code section 7630, subdivision (b) conferred jurisdiction on the juvenile court to reconsider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>termination of parental rights. That statute provides that \u201c[a]ny interested party may bring an action <em>at any time </em>for the purpose of determining the existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship presumed under subdivision (d) or (f) of [Family Code] Section 7611.\u201d (Italics added.) The court explained that \u201cinterpreting this section to authorize proceedings to designate a presumed father after parental rights have been terminated under Welfare and Institutions Code, section 366.26 would undermine the finality of an order terminating parental rights, the importance of which our Supreme Court has emphatically recognized. [Citation.] Indeed, if this argument were accepted, it would be possible to seek presumed father status even after a child has been adopted by another father. Family Code section 7630 must be understood to mean that proceedings under that section may be brought at any time before parental rights have been terminated under section 366.26.\u201d <em>(Jerred H., supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at p. 799.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">We agree with the <em>Jerred H. </em>court\u2019s analysis. If Family Code section 7630, subdivision (b) were read to allow a parent to seek presumed parent status after termination of parental rights, Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26, subdivision (i)(1) would be meaningless and the goals of stability and finality within a reasonable time would be substantially undermined. \u201c \u2018[W]e do not construe statutes in isolation, but rather read every statute \u201cwith reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is [a] part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Calatayud v. State of California </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1057, 1065 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 202, 959 P.2d 360].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>Deanna and Cody contend <em>Jerred H. </em>is inapplicable because it involved a collateral attack on a judgment of termination of parental rights before the adoption was finalized, and in this action they seek presumed mother status long after Cody\u2019s adoption was finalized. Although <em>Jerred H. </em>was in a different procedural posture, its holding promotes public policy in preserving the finality of termination judgments, and it is equally applicable to a collateral attack on a termination judgment brought, as here, long after entry of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">We are also unpersuaded by Deanna and Cody\u2019s contention their motions for presumed mother status were not collateral attacks on the 2001 termination judgment, because after termination Deanna was a \u201clegal stranger\u201d to Cody and they were free to forge a new relationship the court should now recognize.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe Uniform Parentage Act defines the parent-child relationship as \u2018the legal relationship existing between a child and the child\u2019s natural or adoptive parents incident to which the law confers or imposes rights, privileges, duties, and obligations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(County of Ventura v. Gonzales </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1120, 1122 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 461], citing Fam. Code, \u00a7 7601.) \u201cUnder section 366.26, the purpose of a termination order is to free a child for adoption; i.e., to extinguish the child\u2019s ties to his biological parents and enable him to become a member of a new, stable family. [Citations.] An order terminating parental rights \u2018 \u201crepresents the total and irrevocable severance of the bond between parent and child.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(County of Ventura v. Gonzales, supra, </em>at p. 1123; see <em>Fraizer </em>v. <em>Velkura </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 942, 946 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 918] [\u201corder terminating the parent and child relationship divested the parent and child of all legal rights and powers with respect to each other\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The judgment terminating Deanna\u2019s rights severed her legal interest in Cody. In this action, their motions sought reinstatement of her legal rights through the presumed parenthood statute, which, if applied, would give Deanna reunification services and perhaps custody of Cody. As the court noted, the motions were an attempt to revive Deanna\u2019s \u201cparental rights under a different theory.\u201d We acknowledge Deanna and Cody\u2019s shared desire to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>together, but their motions were indubitably collateral attacks on the termination judgment. Thus, the court correctly determined that as a matter of law it lacked jurisdiction to consider the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Deanna asserts presumed parent status for a biological parent whose rights were previously terminated is proper in a second dependency proceeding against an adoptive parent, because \u201c[f]or many children who were adopted by relatives or family Mends, the social, emotional relationship between biological parent and child continues.\u201d Further, the social worker wished Deanna could be considered for presumed parent status in this action, and in denying the motions the court stated, \u201cI feel bad about this.\u201d Given the plain language of section 366.26, subdivision (i)(l), however, any exception to the statute for circumstances such as those here would have to come from the Legislature. There is simply no statute that would allow Deanna to be designated a presumed mother after the termination of her parental rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">\n<em>ICWA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The court and the Agency have an affirmative and continuing duty to inquire whether a child for whom a petition has been filed under section 300 is or may be an Indian child. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.664(d).) \u201cThe ICWA provides that \u2018where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child\u2019s Mbe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.\u2019 [Citation.] If the Mbe is unknown, the notice must be given to the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] as the agent for the Secretary of the Interior. [Citations.] \u2018No foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the . . . Mbe [or] the [BIA].\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Daniel M. </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 703, 707 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 897].)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Cody contends the court committed reversible error by not making any inquiry as to his possible status as an Indian child within the meaning of ICWA. We need not address the point more thoroughly as the Agency agrees limited remand is required for ICWA compliance. <em>(In re Francisco W. </em>(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 695, 705-706 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 171].)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The jurisdictional and dispositional order is reversed. The case is remanded to the juvenile court with directions to make the proper inquiry under the ICWA, and to order the Agency to comply with the notice provisions of the ICWA if any Indian heritage is indicated. If no Indian heritage is indicated, or if it is indicated but after proper notice no tribe claims Cody is an Indian child, the jurisdictional and dispositional order shall be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Haller, J., and McIntyre, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-11\"> Statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code except when otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-12\"> Because R. is not involved in this appeal her petition is not in the record.

Such relief is not available, whether the parents\u2019 expectations were not met because of an uncontrollable turn of fate [citation] or for any other reason.\u201d (See also <em>In re Ronald V. </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1803, 1806 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 334] [biological mother who acquiesced to termination of parental rights on understanding her friend would adopt the child could not petition for modification and de facto parent status when the friend died before the adoption].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\"> Presumably in response to <em>Jerred H., </em>in 2005 the Legislature added section 366.26, subdivision (i)(2), which provides in part: \u201cA child who has not been adopted after the passage of at least three years from the date the court terminated parental rights and for whom the court has determined that adoption is no longer the permanent plan may petition the juvenile court to reinstate parental rights pursuant to the procedure prescribed by Section 388.\u201d (See Stats. 2005, ch. 640, \u00a7 6.5.) The <em>Jerred H. </em>court pointed out that because it lacked jurisdiction to reinstate parental rights or designate the stepfather as a presumed father, \u201c[i]n all likelihood, Jerred will be left a \u2018legal orphan,\u2019 despite the recognized disfavor of such status.\u201d <em>(Jerred H., supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at p. 799.)
