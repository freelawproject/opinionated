Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25249.5-25249.13).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The action was bifurcated, and respondent\u2019s defense of a statutory exemption from the warning and enforcement provisions of the Act (\u00a7 25249.10, subd. (c)) was first adjudicated before the court, sitting without a jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court found that Bondo\u2019s product is exempt from the warning requirements of the Act, and entered judgment in favor of Bondo. Bondo\u2019s subsequent request for attorney fees was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">DiPirro claims in his appeal that he was denied the right to a jury trial, and the trial court erred by finding that respondent established the warning exemption. Bondo appeals seeking reversal of the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. We conclude that DiPirro was not entitled to a jury trial on Bondo\u2019s affirmative defense that warnings under the Act were not required, and the trial court\u2019s finding that Bondo established the warning exemption is supported by substantial evidence. As to Bondo\u2019s appeal, we conclude that the denial of its motion for attorney fees was properly based upon a finding that it did not vindicate an important public right or confer a significant benefit on the general public within the meaning of section 1021.5. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Bondo manufactures and sells exclusively to \u201cauto makers\u201d a product in 0.44-fluid-ounce bottles that is used for \u201ctouch-up\u201d painting of motor vehicles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The paint contains the industrial solvent toluene, which in 1991 was listed in the Act as a reproductive developmental toxin (\u00a7 25249.8, subds. (b), (c)). (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12000.) The designation of toluene as a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity triggered the mandate of Proposition 65 that \u201cNo person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose' any individual\u201d to the chemical \u201cwithout first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual, except as provided in Section 25249.10.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7 25249.6.) Bondo has always been aware that its touch-up paint contained the listed chemical toluene. Since at least 1997, Bondo placed \u201cProposition 65 warnings\u201d on its \u201cMaterial Safety Data Sheets\u201d included with wholesale shipments of the touch-up paint to automobile manufacturers, but no warnings were placed on the individu\u00e1l paint bottles.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On November 30, 2001, DiPirro filed a complaint for injunctive relief and civil penalties against Bondo that alleged violation of the Act through the manufacture and distribution of touch-up paints containing toluene without the required \u201cclear and reasonable warnings\u201d of reproductive toxicity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> DiPirro requested relief in the nature of an injunction to prohibit Bondo from selling or distributing the touch-up paints without the required warnings, civil penalties, and restitution, along with attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Bondo answered the complaint with a general denial and numerous affirmative defenses, including the seventh affirmative defense which alleged that any exposure to toluene that occurs as a result of reasonably anticipated use of its touch-up paint products poses \u201c \u2018no significant risk\u2019 of causing cancer or reproductive toxicity to users of those products, within the meaning of Health and Safety Code \u00a7 25249.10(c).\u201d Subdivision (c) of section 25249.10 grants a warning exemption for products with listed chemicals if the defendant proves an exposure level 1,000 times less than the maximum specified dose level at which a chemical has no observable reproductive effect (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12801, subd. (c)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>The parties stipulated to bifurcation of the proceedings, \u201cwith the trial of issues relating to Bondo\u2019s seventh affirmative defense\u2014which may be dis-positive\u2014to be tried first.\u201d Thereafter, upon motion by Bondo the trial court struck DiPirro\u2019s demand for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The trial then proceeded before the court primarily on the basis of the declarations and testimony of experts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The undisputed evidence established that for inhaled toluene the exposure level of the warning exemption of section 25249.10, subdivision (c), is set at 13,000 micrograms per day. The focus of the trial was upon studies, tests and surveys concerning the nature and level of exposure to toluene by persons using Bondo\u2019s touch-up paints.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Evidence was presented on the essential nature and effects of toluene. Toluene is an aromatic hydrocarbon often used as a solvent that is found in gasoline, paint products, cosmetics, adhesives, and inks. Toluene promotes the flow and coating of pigments onto a surface, then evaporates and dries quickly, even at cold temperatures and high humidity. Exposure occurs as the result of airborne inhalation of the chemical through the bloodstream. The primary toxic effect of toluene is neurotoxicity. At very high concentration levels toluene may have a narcotic impact upon the central nervous system to produce \u201cgiddy\u201d behavior. At \u201clower doses,\u201d toluene has an effect on <em>reproductive developmental </em>processes in the body. According to studies on animals, gestational exposure to the chemical at particular stages of development of a fetus may cause identified anomalies: intrauterine growth retardation, premature delivery, low birth weight, retarded skeletal development, kidney abnormalities, congenital gastrointestinal, urogenital, central nervous system, craniofacial, and cardiac malformations, along with postnatal interruptions in neurobehavioral development.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The evidence of <em>developmental </em>toxicity of toluene in humans is limited, but strongly indicates adverse effects upon fetus development resulting from toluene abuse by pregnant women. The evidence does not indicate <em>maternal </em>toxicity of toluene in humans.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>By 1990, the California Department of Health Services decided to list toluene as a reproductive developmental toxicant under Proposition 65. In 1991 toluene was \u201cplaced on the safe harbor list\u201d of chemicals known to cause reproductive developmental toxicity. A \u201csafe harbor\u201d or \u201cmaximum allowable dose level,\u201d the \u201cMADL,\u201d of 13,000 micrograms per day\u2014below which the warning requirements of Proposition 65 are not triggered\u2014was established for toluene by multiplying the figure of 7,000 micrograms per day of <em>ingested </em>toluene by nearly twice, to account for the 50 percent rate of absorption of an <em>inhaled </em>chemical. (\u00a7 25249.10, subd. (c); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 12801, subds. (a), (b)(1), (c), 12803.) The MADL is the level at which no observable reproductive developmental effects will occur upon exposure to the chemical at a level 1,000 times higher. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 12801, subds. (b)(1), (c), 12805.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The remaining evidence offered at trial dealt with the tested levels of exposure to toluene that result from use of Bondo\u2019s touch-up paint. The formula for calculating or quantifying exposure is rather simple and straightforward. As the experts agreed, the implementing regulations specify that for purposes of section 25249.10, subdivision (c), the level of exposure to a listed chemical that causes reproductive developmental toxicity must be determined by multiplying the measured concentration level of the chemical in the product\u2014in this case, the amount of toluene in a unit of air\u2014times the inhalation rate, times the duration of exposure. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12821, subd. (b).) The regulations specify that for toluene the inhalation rate is 20 cubic meters per day, or 0.833 cubic meters per hour, for a \u201cwoman with conceptos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The calculation becomes more complex, however, when measuring the inhalation of a chemical like toluene during use of a consumer product like Bondo\u2019s touch-up paint. The level of toluene in the \u201cbreathing zone\u201d around the head must be measured, along with the amount that is then exhaled. The rate of breathing and level of intake per unit of time must be taken into account. Both the immediate, more acute exposure and the cumulative exposure \u201cover time\u201d must be measured. The rate of dilution and dispersal of the chemical into the air must be known\u2014for instance, toluene evaporates into the air \u201cvery rapidly,\u201d within minutes. Any testing must also consider the manner in which the product is used, including the directions for use that accompany the product. All the potential sources of toluene from the touch-up paint must be measured: the gas diffusing out of the bottle; the amount emanating from the area on which the paint is being applied; the exposure from any other areas that have been \u201cjust painted\"; and the paint on the wand or brush. Thus, a \u201cvery detailed protocol\u201d must be established in testing to account for these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Only scientifically approved methods and procedures may be followed to quantify an exposure under the Act. A hierarchy of accepted methodologies has been established by the California Department of Health Services (CDHS). The parties agreed that the \u201cappropriate sampling protocol for assessing toluene concentration in the air is NIOSH[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] 1501,\u201d the \u201ctop-tiered method\u201d established by the CDHS for toluene exposure testing. The parties\u2019 experts both reviewed existing studies and performed numerous tests under various conditions to measure exposure to toluene from use of Bondo\u2019s touch-up paints in accordance with the NIOSH 1501 protocol. The results of the surveys and testing present evidence that is conflicting, but fall within certain defined parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Bondo\u2019s expert in the field of toxicology, human health risk and exposure assessment, Dr. Michael Lakin, compiled and reviewed surveys of the reasonably anticipated use of automotive touch-up paints to determine exposure conditions. Dr. Lakin concluded, based upon his review of the studies and expert depositions provided to him, that the \u201cgreat majority\u201d of consumers use touch-up paint sparingly for only a few small nicks or scratches, outside or in an open garage, complete the painting process within a minute, then immediately reseal the container and move away from the vehicle once painting is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Tom Shellworth, the owner of an automobile dealership in Vacaville for the past 16 years who had often personally used touch-up paint and observed \u201ccountless applications of touch-up paint by dealership personnel and outside vendors,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in addition to inspecting \u201cthousands\u201d of \u201ctouch-up repairs\u201d performed upon vehicles by consumers, essentially agreed with Dr. Latin\u2019s characterization of the customary nature of the use of touch-up paint. Shellworth offered his opinion that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of consumers do not ever use touch-up paint, or if they do, make limited use of the paint for one or two chips for \u201cabout 10 seconds.\u201d Shellworth also stated that due to the variation in use of touch-up paint, description of the \u201caverage or typical\u201d extent of repair was difficult. In his testimony Shellworth did not refer to the conditions under which touch-up paint is applied, other than to very generally assert that it was used both inside and outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">In an attempt to describe the use of touch-up paint by consumers Bondo presented the results of a survey distributed by its counsel to car dealerships in California\u2014referred to as the \u201cNossaman survey.\u201d The survey enlisted assistance from car dealerships in the form of responses to inquiries about the \u201caverage\u201d or \u201ctypical\u201d use of touch-up paint. A cover letter that accompanied the survey advised the dealerships of Bondo\u2019s defense of a \u201cProposition 65 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>lawsuit\u201d filed by a \u201cbounty hunter,\u201d DiPirro, and the intended \u201cmeritless\u201d \u201cfollow-up lawsuits\u201d against dealerships and others in the industry. The letter also mentioned the specific need to prove that \u201ctouch-up paint does not expose the average consumer to levels of toluene and other chemicals that exceed 13,000 micrograms per day.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A summary of the responses, more than 300 in number, indicate that the paint is typically applied in one or two coats of paint to a few small chips or scratches of less than an inch in length by a service person at the dealership, usually outside or less often in the service bay, for between five seconds and a minute. Most consumers who purchase touch-up paint never use it, and if they do the quality of the work is poor. The dealerships also noted in their responses that a small number of consumers used the paint inappropriately for larger scratches or chips.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">DiPirro\u2019s expert criticized the partiality of the Nossaman survey, suggesting that it was obviously conducted and structured as a response to an \u201cadversarial situation.\u201d He asserted that the results of the Nossaman survey were skewed by the improper \u201ctarget population\u201d of car dealerships rather than \u201cthe average consumer,\u201d and the nature of the questions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">DiPirro also conducted an \u201con-line consumer survey\u201d of touch-up paint use, referred to as the \u201cCooper-Roberts survey.\u201d Three hundred fifty-three (353) responses to questions were received, which were compiled into a summary of the nature of use of touch-up paint by average consumers: about 74 percent used the paint once a year or less; 88 percent used the paint only on one vehicle; only 21 percent of the use occurs in a covered carport or in a garage; less than half of the people used the paint on scratches; nearly half of the people who painted a scratch on their car from a key had a scratch one foot long or more; 70 percent applied the paint to three or fewer scratches; 80 percent painted three or fewer nicks; 80 percent used less than one-quarter of the bottle; typically the paint was applied by dipping the wand into the bottle one to two times per application; 81 percent expressed no health concerns associated with use of the paint.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Bondo offered evidence of practical field tests of toluene exposure from James Embree, the principal toxicologist for the environmental sciences and engineering consulting firm Geomatrix Consultants, and an expert in the field <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>of \u201cProposition 65-required methods for determining exposures to listed chemicals.\u201d In 2003, Dr. Embree designed, supervised and reviewed a series of three \u201ctouch-up paint application tests,\u201d referred to collectively as the \u201cGeomatrix Paint Application Study\u201d (Geomatrix Study), to measure the exposure to toluene of an \u201caverage consumer\u201d of Bondo\u2019s touch-up paint under \u201cconservative and varied \u2018real world\u2019 conditions.\u201d The tests followed some accepted assumptions, protocols and methodologies related to toluene exposure from touch-up paint, including the NIOSH 1501 first-tier method of analysis, and were implemented with \u201ca series of actual-use measurements\u201d based on \u201cconservative factors\u201d of application. The touch-up paint used was one with approximately 27.5 percent toluene, which is \u201ctoward the upper limit of toluene routinely used in Bondo touch-up paint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Three tests in the 2003 Geomatrix Study measured exposure in varying environments under different conditions. The first test: in a three-car open garage, with four painted surfaces attached to the sides of a car, each about one-half inch square, and each painted for three and one-half minutes, followed by the painter remaining within several feet of the car for another 15 minutes, for a total of 30 minutes of exposure. The second test, comparable to the first, but conducted in a two-car garage, and with the addition of two more scenarios with the garage door closed: one with painting of a \u201cding approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch in diameter and 3 one-inch scratches, and the other to touch-up a one-half square inch area.\u201d The third test: conducted in a one-car open garage, with the application of paint to \u201cone 6-inch scratch\u201d and \u201cthree dings\u201d as indicated in the results of DiPirro\u2019s Cooper-Roberts survey of the \u201creasonably anticipated rate of exposure\u201d for the \u201caverage users\u201d of the product, with the added assumptions of application of two coats over an eight-minute period, seven minutes for each coat of the paint to dry while the painter remained in the area of the car, for a 30-minute total period of exposure. In each of the three studies, one collection tube was placed in the painter\u2019s breathing zone as the NIOSH 1501 method requires, and a second or \u201cback\u201d tube collected samples from ambient air that may have \u201cgone through the first tube.\u201d Due to the greater area painted and the longer duration of painting, Dr. Embree opined that measured concentrations were far higher than any reasonably anticipated use by the average consumer, so the conditions of testing assured results in excess of any likely consumer exposure. However, the airflow rates were twice that specified in the NIOSH manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">All the samples collected during the three tests were sent to an approved laboratory for detection of the concentration of toluene in accordance with the NIOSH 1501 method. No evidence of \u201cblow-by\u201d or \u201cbreakthrough\u201d of chemicals from the first breathing tubes was found in the second sampling tubes. Exposure levels were then calculated from the measured concentration results of the tests according to the \u201cProposition 65 specified formula\u201d for toluene: multiplication of the concentrations, times the specified inhalation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>rate, times the conservative 30-minute period of exposure. Even without adjustment for averaging over a 270-day gestation period, all three of the tests conducted for the 2003 Geomatrix Study indicated exposure levels substantially below\u2014only 0.4 to 16 percent of\u2014the MADE for toluene of 13,000 micrograms per day.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Averaging the exposure over a nine-month gestation period resulted in calculated levels between 0.002 and 0.06 percent of the MADE, or 1,700 to 65,000 times less than the MADE.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The Geomatrix Study was repeated in 2004, with slight variations in the conditions of application of paint to account for objections to the 2003 study. Three additional tests were done: one with the vehicle in a garage with the door closed, another with the garage door open, and a third with the vehicle in the driveway just outside an open garage. The painted test panels were confined to one side of the car, and ranged in size from one-quarter- to one-half-inch dings to a \u201c6-inch by 1/4-inch scratch.\u201d Two coats of paint were applied, with a five-minute interval between coats,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and a waiting time following the conclusion of painting, for a total exposure duration of 28 minutes. The air temperature was lower than the 2003 test, which resulted in theoretically slower evaporation, but the humidity was slightly higher. A new paint container was used for each test, and the weight of the paint used during each test was calculated, unlike the prior study. Airflow rates were half that used in the 2003 Geomatrix Study, 0.2 liters per minute as approved in the NIOSH manual. Again, the tested exposure levels of toluene in all three tests were far below the MADE, and even \u201cslightly lower\u201d than in the 2003 Geomatrix Study.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Dr. Lakin performed his own \u201cEnSIGHT Study\u201d for Bondo to quantify exposure to toluene from touch-up paint. In doing so, he consulted the measured data and analytical methods from the \u201cNail Polish study\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> conducted by Clayton Engineering for the Attorney General\u2019s Office using protocols developed by the CDHS. He considered the Nail Polish study \u201cacceptable for this purpose\u201d due to the \u201cgreat similarity in use and composition of nail polish and touch-up paint.\u201d A distinction in the Nail Polish study is that the CDHS-approved Method 4000 protocol was used, which is similar to the tier-one NIOSH 1501 protocol, with the only modification being the use of a badge with charcoal on it to absorb the air rather than drawing the air through a tube. Dr. Lakin testified that the two methods are \u201cequally efficient\u201d at detecting exposure, and DiPirro\u2019s expert agreed that the two methods are \u201cequivalent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>In the Nail Polish study the exposure to toluene by both the manicurist and customer were measured from over 500 samples collected under varied conditions, with the customer monitored only for the duration of the appointment\u2014about one hour\u2014while the manicurist was monitored for the entire workday. The average concentration of toluene in the samples was then multiplied by the amount of air breathed by the person during the time present in the salon. Even upon application of a \u201cmore conservative inhalation rate\u201d\u2014that is, a higher rate than the actual level\u2014and without adjusting for exposure over the nine-month gestation period, the exposure results of the Nail Polish study were below the MADE figure: 570 micrograms per visit for the customer, and 9,023 micrograms per workday for the technician.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Dr. Lakin asserted that the Nail Polish study was conducted in compliance with tier-one testing methods and protocols that have the requisite wide acceptance of reliability within the scientific community. He also found that the data from the Nail Polish study provided a \u201crepresentative and conservative basis\u201d for the evaluation of the \u201creasonably anticipated\u201d consumer exposure to toluene in the present case. He noted that some environmental factors associated with the application of nail polish\u2014specifically, use of the product indoors, with fewer air exchanges, and at lower temperatures and humidity levels\u2014resulted in more conservative, higher exposure levels than the conditions which accompany use of touch-up paint.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Dr. Lakin also gathered information from other studies on the range of exposures to touch-up paint. Finally, he reviewed the Geomatrix Study of Dr. Embree, which he found to be consistent with \u201cstandard guidance, procedures and methodologies recognized and accepted by experts in the field,\u201d and in compliance \u201cwith 22 C.C.R. \u00a7 12901(b).\u201d According to Dr. Lakin the results of the Geomatrix Study, which he reiterated are \u201centirely consistent\u201d with the findings of the Nail Polish study, provide a \u201csound technical basis for evaluation of exposure\u201d to toluene.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Using the \u201cextremely conservative values\u201d from the Nail Polish study that are \u201cmore health protective,\u201d along with the Geomatrix Study results and other data from scientifically accepted practices, some of it provided by DiPirro, Dr. Lakin calculated an exposure concentration of toluene in the EnSIGHT Study that encompassed all but a \u201cvery small proportion of the users of touch-up paint.\u201d His calculation of exposure included consumers of touch-up paint who used the paint indoors, in an area with a very high background level of toluene, applied two or three coats of paint to the equivalent of 60 nicks and 60 scratches, for a total of about 30 minutes. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>used the inhalation rate established in the Proposition 65 regulations, and the concentration level measured in the Nail Polish study that he believed was \u201coverly conservative when compared to the application of touch-up paint.\u201d The result was an exposure concentration level higher than \u201cany reasonably foreseeable circumstances for the average consumer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Dr. Lakin thereby arrived at a \u201cbounding estimate\u201d or \u201cbounding study,\u201d which is an approach of risk assessment used to determine the exaggerated \u201cupper end or extreme estimate of the population\u201d that is \u201cabove what most of the population would actually receive,\u201d and constitutes a \u201cvery rare event.\u201d He found that the reasonably anticipated exposure to toluene of the average user of touch-up paint is no more than 75 micrograms per day, \u201cunadjusted for exposure over the nine-month gestation period,\u201d and only 0.3 micrograms per day when divided by the 270-day gestation period. Both figures are \u201cwell below the MADL.\u201d He added that even DiPirro\u2019s \u201cown testing results\u201d obtained during a 41-minute exposure test show exposure of 2,991 micrograms per day, or less than 25 percent of the MADL, without adjustment for the nine-month gestation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">DiPirro relied heavily on declarations and testimony from Dr. David Brown, a public health toxicologist who is a qualified expert on human exposures to toxic chemicals from a variety of sources. Dr. Brown offered the opinion that \u201cit is inappropriate to use the nine months of gestation as the basis for averaging to derive a pregnant woman\u2019s reasonably anticipated rate of exposure.\u201d He stated that according to current studies toluene \u201cproduces teratogenesis,\u201d but not as a \u201cfrank teratogen,\u201d rather as a \u201cneurodevelopmental toxin.\u201d Toluene produces impacts upon the \u201csensitive developmental processes\u201d of the fetus during \u201cshort-term exposures\u201d that may not be repaired or overcome during subsequent stages of development. Thus, he maintained that \u201cthere is sufficient human and animal evidence in the literature to support that birth defects occur with short-term exposures,\u201d and even in \u201cone hour\u2019s worth of exposure it is possible that damage could be elicited from which the organism cannot recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Dr. Brown expressed concern with the methodologies used in the Geomatrix Studies. His primary criticisms were the lack of control or knowledge of the air \u201cexchange rates\u201d during exposure, and the failure to explain protocols in detail. He particularly disapproved of the use of the 0.4-liters-per-minute airflow rate in the 2003 Geomatrix Study, twice that required by the NIOSH 1501 methodology. Dr. Brown did not find any information in the scientific literature to suggest that a flow rate of 0.4 liters per minute is an appropriate or acceptable method to assess inhalation of toluene. He testified that the \u201chigher flow rate\u201d causes the \u201csample to become overloaded and blow by,\u201d thereby reducing the amount of chemical absorbed in the sampling tube, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>resulting in \u201cunderestimation\u201d of the \u201cexposure in the breathing zone.\u201d He added that the 2003 Geomatrix Study did not account for the greater airflow rate by properly placing a second tube \u201cat the end of the first tube\u201d to measure with sensitivity any amounts of toluene that bypassed the first chamber. Dr. Brown acknowledged that a second sampling tube was used in the 2003 Geomatrix Study, but he could not \u201ceasily figure out exactly\u201d from his review of the study how the tests were configured to report the amount collected in the second tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Dr. Brown further expressed dissatisfaction with some aspects of Dr. Embree\u2019s methodology: the use of the \u201csame person\u201d to do all the painting \u201cthroughout the process,\u201d the location of the painted devices attached all around the car, the insufficient sampling number, the brief departure of one of the technicians during sampling, the dilution of peak values of exposure by sampling over a \u201cset time period,\u201d the failure to take into account the elevated breathing rate\u2014a quarter to a half higher than the default number\u2014of pregnant women, the use of a figure of 25 percent volume of toluene rather than 30 percent, and the failure of the Geomatrix investigators to \u201cchemically measure the amount of toluene\u201d in the touch-up paint bottles or the amount of paint used for each test. He opined that the Geomatrix Study did not comply with \u201caccepted scientific methodology,\u201d and therefore failed to accurately \u201ccharacterize a consumer\u2019s exposure to toluene when using touch-up paint under reasonably foreseeable conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Dr. Brown also disapproved of any reliance by Dr. Lakin upon the results of the Nail Polish study \u201cfor assessing a consumer\u2019s exposure to toluene using automotive touch-up paint.\u201d He stated that the Nail Polish study did not follow the NIOSH 1501 protocol \u201cin its entirety,\u201d specifically in the use of a \u201cpassive badge\u201d to collect the chemical rather than an \u201cactive sampling method\u201d such as a pump to draw air into the sampling tube. He noted several other factors that he believed undermined the credibility and \u201cappropriateness of using the Nail Polish study to infer exposures similar to those experienced by a consumer applying touch-up paint\u201d in a garage: the absence of testing for \u201cpotentially interfering compounds\u201d likely to be in the air in a nail salon; the lack of equivalent air exchange rates in a nail salon and a garage; the differences in environmental factors between a nail salon and a garage or driveway; and potential \u201chydrocarbon interferences\u201d in a salon that \u201cdiffer from those encountered in a residential garage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Dr. Brown devised his own exposure study that was conducted by Air Quality Sciences, Inc., an independent testing laboratory. Dr. Brown\u2019s evaluation used two environmental test chambers that he claimed met the requirements of section 12901 of the regulations: a \u201cLarge Chamber\u201d study and a \u201cSmall Chamber\u201d study.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The Large Chamber study was designed by Dr. Brown to measure exposure based upon \u201crealistic\u201d parameters of application: three coats of touch-up paint used in a small area\u2014less than the size of a one-car garage\u2014upon a Plexiglas test fixture divided into a one-inch square and further divided into four equal quarters; painting of the equivalent of \u201cseveral small scratches,\u201d with allotted time of five minutes to wait for the paint to dry between coats at a distance of 20 to 24 inches while the bottle was closed; a total exposure time of 41 minutes. The environmental test chamber controlled the variables of exchange rates, background contaminants, humidity and temperature. The chemical content of each bottle of paint was determined, and the weight of the bottle was measured and tested for toluene content before and after each application. The airflow rate was 0.2 liters per minute, as approved in the NIOSH 1501 tier-one method. Samples of toluene exposure were collected from multiple charcoal sampling tubes draped around the mouth, nose, and chest of the painter. Dr. Brown asserted the results provided a \u201clower bound estimate of \u2018real\u2019 exposure,\u201d of approximately 3,000 micrograms per day, or about one-quarter of the MADL.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The Small Chamber study collected air in essentially the same manner, but in a chamber the size of a breadbox at the application site around the painter\u2019s head to \u201cfully assess\u201d and quantify the magnitude of concentration of toluene during \u201cspikes\u201d of peak exposure while painting. The Small Chamber study was designed to simulate exposure immediately around the painter\u2019s head while working in very close proximity to the brush or wand, without dissipation of the chemical into the air, at \u201cdiscrete time intervals while using the product.\u201d A 12-inch key scratch was painted, which was an average size based upon the results of the Cooper-Roberts online survey performed for DiPirro. Dr. Brown agreed that the Small Chamber study \u201cwasn\u2019t realistic,\u201d but instead was a method of \u201cgetting another piece of information\u201d on the \u201cvalues in the breathing zone\u201d during \u201csporadic or episodic exposures.\u201d From the results of the Small Chamber study, he concluded that exposure levels of toluene would exceed the MADL.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The results Dr. Brown obtained in the Small Chamber study, along with his extrapolations from the 2003 Geomatrix Study, indicated to Dr. Brown that within the range of measurable exposures is the \u201cpossibility a person could be exposed to levels that exceed the California MADL\u201d at \u201cvarious levels of use.\u201d He submitted two conclusions as to the exposure to toluene from touch-up paint: first, that toluene may produce neurological damage from \u201cshort-term episodic exposures\u201d rather than \u201cchronic dosing\u201d over time; and second, that \u201ca consumer, at various levels of use, will be exposed to levels of toluene that exceed the MADL.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Dr. Lakin testified for Bondo that many of Dr. Brown\u2019s extrapolations and assumptions were flawed. Primarily, Dr. Lakin challenged the assumption that \u201cpeak exposure at some point in time\u201d is an appropriate measure for an assessment of the MADL of toluene. He testified that under Proposition 65 the \u201ctotal exposure per day over the amount of time the exposure may occur\u201d is the correct measurement, \u201cnot parsing it out.\u201d Dr. Lakin explained that the NOEL (no observable effect level) and MADL figures for toluene are set according to animal studies of effects from ingestion that are related to daily intake, not momentary peak exposure. Further, he asserted that the sampling by Dr. Brown at discrete, isolated distances from the source that have changing concentrations at different points in time is not a reliable test of real exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The trial court accepted the testimony and test results of Bondo\u2019s experts. In determining the exposure of an average consumer, the court accepted a model that included 75 to 85 percent of the users of touch-up paint. No single test presented by the parties\u2019 experts was found determinative, but the court relied upon the tests to determine \u201cbounding estimates\u201d to find an exposure level below which average consumers will not be at risk. Based primarily on the results of the 2003 and 2004 Geomatrix Studies, the court found that Bondo \u201cmet its burden of proof establishing that the exposure to average users of automotive touch-up paint as used in a reasonably foreseeable manner poses no significant risk as the exposure level falls below the MADL\u201d of 13,000 micrograms per day. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">I. <em>The Denial of DiPirro\u2019s Request for a Jury Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">DiPirro challenges the trial court\u2019s order that granted Bondo\u2019s motion to strike the demand for a jury trial. After Bondo\u2019s seventh affirmative defense was ordered to be tried first, Bondo moved to strike DiPirro\u2019s request for a jury trial of the \u201cPhase 1 Issues.\u201d DiPirro opposed the motion, based upon the argument that the Phase 1 \u201cnarrow factual question of whether plaintiff can show a detectable exposure to toluene and, if so, whether the exposure is low enough to exempt Bondo from providing a warning,\" was \u201cnot equitable in nature,\u201d and therefore \u201cmust be considered by a jury.\u201d The court found that \u201cthe gist\" of DiPirro\u2019s action \u201cis equitable,\u201d and therefore no right to a jury trial existed. DiPirro complains that the Phase 1 issue of the section 25249.10, subdivision (c), \u201cwarning exemption\u201d was \u201cnever available in courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>equity, did not turn on the exercise of equitable principles, and was not committed to the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d He therefore argues that he was \u201centitled to a jury trial to resolve this purely legal issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">A. <em>The Waiver of the Right to a Jury Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We first confront Bondo\u2019s contention that DiPirro waived his right to a jury trial of the Phase 1 issues related to the warning exemption. Bondo maintains that a jury trial waiver is found in DiPirro\u2019s opposition to the motion to strike the request for a jury trial, in which he \u201cconcedes that any penalty that may be imposed and any injunctive relief ordered shall be determined by a Court, not a jury.\u201d Bondo\u2019s position is that DiPirro thereby acknowledged \u201che wasn\u2019t entitled to a jury trial of Phase 1 issues,\u201d and \u201cwaived any right to appeal the trial court\u2019s determination.\u201d Bondo also contends that DiPirro \u201cwaived his right to assert error on appeal\u201d by failing \u201cto appear at the hearing to contest the court\u2019s tentative ruling on Bondo\u2019s motion to strike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u201cThe California Constitution guarantees the right to a jury trial in a civil action at law.\u201d <em>(Salisbury </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 756, 764 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 831].) Pursuant to article I, section 16 of the California Constitution, trial by jury is \u201c \u2018an inviolate right,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018a basic and fundamental part of our system of jurisprudence. ... As such, it should be zealously guarded by the courts .... In case of doubt therefore, the issue should be resolved in favor of preserving a litigant\u2019s right to trial by jury.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cohill v.

In a civil cause a jury may be waived by the consent of the parties expressed as prescribed by statute.\u201d Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivisions (a) and (d) provide in part: \u201cIn civil cases, a jury may only be waived pursuant to subdivision (d). [][]... [][] (d) A party waives trial by jury in any of the following ways: [f] (1) By failing to appear at the trial.

[][] (4) By failing to announce that a jury is required, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>at the time the cause is first set for trial, if it is set upon notice or stipulation, or within five days after notice of setting if it is set without notice or stipulation. f\u00edQ (5) By failing to deposit with the clerk, or judge, advance jury fees as provided in subdivision (b). [][] (6) By failing to deposit with the clerk or judge, at the beginning of the second and each succeeding day\u2019s session, the sum provided in subdivision (c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Thus, \u201cAs a matter of constitutional right [DiPirro] was entitled to a jury unless he \u2018waived such right in the manner prescribed by law\u2019 [citation]; \u2018the manner prescribed by law\u2019 specifically refers to the provisions for jury waiver in civil cases. They constitute the exclusive modes of waiver in civil cases. It has long been held in this state that a jury trial may not be waived by implication; it may only be waived affirmatively and in the manner designated by the provisions of section 631, Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>(City of Redondo Beach </em>v. <em>Kumnick </em>(1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 830, 835 [31 Cal.Rptr. 367].) \u201cAnd \u2018[n]o waiver results from going to trial after the erroneous denial of a jury, if the party makes a proper objection.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cohill v. Nationwide Auto Service, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th 696, 700.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We would be hard pressed under any circumstances to find an express waiver of a jury trial right in DiPirro\u2019s <em>opposition </em>to a request to strike his demand for jury trial. As we read DiPirro\u2019s concession, it related only to the contingent issues of \u201cany penalty that may be imposed\u201d or any \u201cinjunctive relief ordered\u201d by the trial court <em>following </em>the Phase 1 trial. DiPirro acknowledged that penalty and injunctive relief matters were equitable in nature, but argued that the trial of Bondo\u2019s \u201cliability\u201d under the Act \u201cmust be considered by a jury.\u201d We do not find that DiPirro\u2019s limited concession was a waiver of a jury trial of the Phase 1 part of the proceeding. The acknowledgement of the equitable nature of the penalty and injunctive relief issues expressed by DiPirro in his opposition to Bondo\u2019s request to strike a jury trial was not a \u201cwritten consent filed with the clerk or judge\u201d of a jury trial waiver within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (d)(2). No waiver of DiPirro\u2019s right to a jury trial occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Nor do we find that DiPirro <em>forfeited </em>the right to challenge the ruling on the jury trial issue by failing to appear at the hearing on the motion to contest the trial court\u2019s tentative decision.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018[A] reviewing court ordinarily will not consider a challenge to a ruling if an objection could have been but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>was not made in the trial court. [Citation.] The purpose of this rule is to encourage parties to bring errors to the attention of the trial court, so that they may be corrected.\u2019 [Citation.] The critical point for preservation of claims on appeal is that the asserted error must have been brought to the attention of the trial court.\u201d <em>(Boyle v. CertainTeed Corp. </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 645, 649 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 501]; see also <em>In re S.B., supra, </em>32 Cal.4th 1287, 1293.) \u201c \u2018It is unfair to the trial judge and to the adverse party to take advantage of an alleged error on appeal where it could easily have been corrected at trial. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cabrini Villas Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Haghverdian </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 683, 693 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 192].) In a written opposition to Bondo\u2019s motion DiPirro presented his objections to any denial of his right to a jury trial. Based upon DiPirro\u2019s opposition, both Bondo and the trial court were aware of the precise grounds for his challenge to the proposed ruling. After the tentative decision was issued, a repetition of the same opposition at the hearing on the motion was not required to preserve the issue on appeal. No forfeiture of the issue resulted. DiPirro neither waived the right to a jury trial nor forfeited the right to assert error in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">B. <em>DiPirro\u2019s Right to a Jury Trial of the Exposure Exemption Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We turn to DiPirro\u2019s claim of entitlement to a jury trial of Bondo\u2019s warning exemption defense found in section 25249.10, subdivision (c). The Act (\u00a7\u00a7 25249.5-25249.13) does not grant any statutory right to a jury trial in enforcement actions, so DiPirro must rely on the right to jury trial provided by article I, section 16 of the California Constitution. Code of Civil Procedure section 592 also specifically provides that \u201cIn actions for the recovery of specific, real, or personal property, with or without damages, or for money claimed as due upon contract, or as damages for breach of contract, or for injuries, an issue of fact must be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial is waived . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u201cWhere the action is one at law, there is a right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>(Van de Kamp v.

[Citation.] There is no right to a jury trial in an action in equity.\u201d <em>(Baugh </em>v. <em>Garl </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 737, 740 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 539].) \u201c \u2018It is the right to trial by jury as it existed at common law which is preserved; and what that right is, is a purely historical question, a fact which is to be ascertained like any other social, political or legal fact.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wisden </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 750, 754 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 523].) \u201cIf the action is essentially one in equity and the relief sought depends upon the application of equitable doctrines, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>are not entitled to a jury trial.\u201d <em>(American Motorists Ins.

That, of course, is not the end of the inquiry. \u201c[T]he right to a jury trial does not entirely depend upon the existence of a particular right of action in 1850.

We thus first \u201c \u2018compare the statutory action to 18th-century actions brought in the courts of England prior to the merger of the courts of law and equity,\u2019 \u201d and then \u201c \u2018examine the remedy sought and determine whether it is legal or equitable in nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Granfinanciera, S.

An action that seeks to enforce the consequences of the listing of a chemical fundamentally seeks a form of declaratory relief\u2014that the product requires a warning under the Act\u2014which is equitable in nature and does not carry with it the guarantees of a jury trial.

Damages sought in the nature of civil penalties for violations of the Act are assessed upon consideration of articulated factors that do not primarily take into account any harm suffered by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (\u00a7 25249.7, subd. (b)(2).) Where, as here, the statute has delegated the assessment of civil penalties in accordance with a highly discretionary calculation that takes into account multiple factors, this is the kind of calculation traditionally performed by judges rather than a jury, and does not require a jury trial for that purpose in a civil action. (See <em>Tull v. United States, supra, </em>481 U.S. 412, 427.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The Act is informational and preventative rather than compensatory in its nature and function. The statutory damages available under the Act in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the nature of civil penalties do not grow out of a claim for moneys due and owing or for personal harm or property damages that have resulted from discharge of pollutants or other toxic chemicals, which are actions triable by a jury at common law.

Rather, Proposition 65 is distinguishable in its fundamentally equitable purpose and remedy: to facilitate the <em>notification </em>of the public of potentially harmful substances, so informed decisions may be made by consumers on the basis of disclosure.  \u201cCitizens bringing [Proposition 65] suits need not plead a private injury and instead are deemed to sue \u2018in the public interest.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(National Paint &amp; Coatings Assn. v.

An award of civil penalties under the Act is a statutory punitive exaction determined on the basis of equitable principles, designed to deter misconduct and harm, not to compensate the plaintiff for actual damages sustained.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (See <em>Korea Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1144 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937]; <em>Shamsian </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 967, 977 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 635]; <em>Day v.

Silvercrest Industries, Inc. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 218, 226-228 [220 Cal.Rptr. 712].) The primary right to bring an action for civil penalties pursuant to the Act is also given to the state rather than individuals seeking compensation. (\u00a7 25249.7, subd. (c).) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Moreover, the Act does not have a standing requirement; a plaintiff need not allege or prove damages to maintain an action under Proposition 65. As such, the statutory remedies afforded by the Act, including civil penalties, are not damages at law, but instead constitute equitable relief appropriate and incidental to enforcement of the Act, which do not entitle the plaintiff to a jury-trial. (See <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 348, 382 [261 Cal.Rptr. 318, <em>777 </em>P.2d 91]; <em>Beasley v. Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1383, 1392-1393 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 446].) The \u201cincidental award of monetary damages by a court in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction does not convert the proceeding into a legal action.\u201d <em>(Snelson </em>v. <em>Ondulando Highlands Corp. </em>(1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 243, 259 [84 Cal.Rptr. 800].)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Finally, even without consideration of the specific <em>remedies </em>provided in section 25249.7, we conclude that the <em>gist </em>of DiPirro\u2019s statutory enforcement action given recognition and implementation in the Act is to enjoin or prevent the knowing distribution, sale and use of products with listed dangerous chemicals, <em>unless the requisite warnings are provided. </em>(See <em>Dowhal v. SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 910, 918 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 262, 88 P.3d 1]; <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp. v. Denton, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th 333, 355.) Although DiPirro could not have pursued this particular statutory action under the Act in 1850, the bulk of the relief sought here was cognizable at common law as an equitable action to abate a public nuisance. (See <em>Arciero Ranches v. Meza </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 114, 124-125 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 127]; <em>Wolford v. Thomas </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 347, 353-354 [235 Cal.Rptr. 422].) \u201cThe essence of an action to abate a public nuisance and for injunctive relief is equitable and there is no right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>(People v. Englebrecht </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1245 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 738]; see also <em>People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1090, 1102 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 277, 929 P.2d 596]; <em>County of Santa Clara v.

DiPirro is not entitled to a jury trial on his enforcement action in equity under section 25249.7. <em>(Stell </em>v. <em>Jay Hales Development Co. </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1220 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 220]; see <em>Van de Kamp v. Bank of America, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d 819, 865; <em>Wolford v. Thomas, supra, </em>at p. 354.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">We further conclude that the trial court\u2019s bifurcation of the proceeding and separate initial adjudication of Bondo\u2019s warning exemption defense did not transform the case into an action at law or require a jury trial. We acknowledge the rule that the right to a jury trial may not be abrogated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>trial court\u2019s severance of equitable claims from legal claims that have been joined in the same action. <em>(Walton </em>v. <em>Walton, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th 277, 292; <em>Selby Constructors v. McCarthy </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 517, 527 [154 Cal.Rptr. 164].) Where a \u201cmixed bag\u201d of legal and equitable claims is presented in a case, a court trial of the equitable claims first may obviate the necessity of a jury trial on the legal claims, but otherwise the plaintiff cannot be denied the right to a jury trial on the legal causes of action. <em>(Nwosu </em>v. <em>Uba, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1238; see also <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>County of Kern, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th 606, 619-620; <em>Van de Kamp </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d 819, 863.) If \u201cthere are equitable and legal remedies sought in the same action, the parties are entitled to have a jury determine the legal issues unless the trial court\u2019s initial determination of the equitable issues is also dispositive of the legal issues, leaving nothing to be tried by a jury.\u201d <em>(American Motorists Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th 864, 871, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">But here, Bondo\u2019s warning exemption defense was not a separate legal claim or cause of action, nor was the trial a special proceeding that engendered its own right to a jury trial. (See <em>Cornette v. Department of Transportation </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 63, 76-77 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 26 P.3d 332].) It was just what it purported to be, an affirmative defense to the primary and singular equitable action brought by DiPirro under the Act. \u201cAn action \u2018is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration, enforcement, or protection of a right, the redress or prevention of a wrong, or the punishment of a public offense.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cornette, supra, </em>at p. 76; see also <em>Jefferson v. County of Kern, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th 606, 616.) For purposes of deciding the right to a jury trial, the action in the present case is DiPirro\u2019s claim brought under the Act; the warning exemption defense is merely an affirmative defense within that action. <em>(Jefferson v. County of Kern, supra, </em>at p. 617.)  \u201c \u2018[A] \u201cdefense\u201d is \u201c[t]hat which is offered and alleged by the party proceeded against in an action or suit, as a reason in law or fact why the plaintiff should not recover or establish what he seeks[; ...[][] it is a] response to the claims of the other party, setting forth reasons why the claims should not be granted.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] That the common meaning of \u2018action\u2019\u2014as in an \u2018action to enforce\u2019\u2014does not include procedural steps such as a demurrer or other defenses is illustrated by the following passage in an authoritative work: \u2018The broad definition [of action] covers the following: (1) suits at law or in equity. [Citation.] (2) Certain adversary proceedings that take place during a probate proceeding. [Citation.] (3) Actions for declaratory relief. [Citations.] (4) Actions for divorce (dissolution of marriage). [Citation.]\u2019 (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1996) Actions, \u00a7 11, pp. 64-65.) There is nothing in this passage to suggest that a defensive matter ... is included in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the term \u2018action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Salawy v. Ocean Towers Housing Corp. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 664, 673 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 427], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">And even though issues of fact would be resolved in the adjudication of the warning exemption defense asserted under the Act, there is no \u201cjury trial right on affirmative defenses that can be tried separately and first.\u201d <em>(Windsor Square Homeowners Assn. v. Citation Homes </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 547, 558 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 818]; see also <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>County of Kern, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th 606, 616-617.) No \u201cCalifornia authority . . . stands directly or indirectly for the proposition that there is such a jury trial right. All the authority we have discovered and exhaustively described, assumes, without much analytical discussion, that such factual issues are naturally tried to the court.\u201d <em>(Windsor Square Homeowners Assn. v. Citation Homes, supra, </em>at p. 558.) We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err by granting the motion to strike DiPirro\u2019s demand for a jury trial and proceeding to adjudicate the equitable action without a jury. <em>(People v. Englebrecht, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1246; <em>Wolford v. Thomas, supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 347, 354.)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">II. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Finding of a Warning Exemption Under Section 25249.10.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We proceed to DiPirro\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s finding that Bondo established the warning exemption of section 25249.10, subdivision (c). DiPirro argues that the trial court did not follow the \u201cproper standards\u201d in undertaking the assessment of the warning exemption evidence. He has two essential complaints with the trial court\u2019s evaluation of the warning exemption evidence. First, he insists that a defendant seeking to prove the warning exemption under the Act \u201cmust show that <em>no consumer </em>using the product in a reasonably foreseeable manner will be exposed to levels of toxins above\u201d the MADL. (Italics added.) The issue was in dispute at trial, and the court settled upon a model \u201cthat captures the 75th to 85th percentile\u201d of the population rather than the no-consumer level. Second, DiPirro maintains that the MADL must be calculated on a per day basis, not averaged over a nine-month gestational period. He recognizes that the trial court did not reach this issue, but asks us to \u201cresolve it as well\u201d to apprise the trial court on remand of the rule that \u201cthe MADL is just what it says: a daily limit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">As a necessary prelude to our review of the trial court\u2019s finding on the warning exemption defense, we provide a recitation of some of the pertinent provisions of Proposition 65. Section 25249.8, subdivision (a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>requires the Governor of the State of California to \u201ccause to be published a list of those chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity within the meaning of this chapter, and he shall cause such list to be revised and republished in light of additional knowledge at least once per year thereafter.\u201d The list of known carcinogens and teratogens must be published and updated annually. <em>(Mateel Environmental Justice Foundation </em>v. <em>Edmund A. Gray Co. </em>(2003) 115 Cal.App.4th 8, 18 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 486].) Section 25249.8, subdivision (b), states that \u201cA chemical is known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity within the meaning of this chapter if in the opinion of the state\u2019s qualified experts it has been clearly shown through scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted principles to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity, or if a body considered to be authoritative by such experts has formally identified it as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity, or if an agency of the state or federal government has formally required it to be labeled or identified as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity.\u201d The list of chemicals known to the state to cause reproductive developmental toxicity is found at section 12000 in title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, and as the parties agree, it contains toluene.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Once a chemical such as toluene is listed as a reproductive toxin, section 25249.6 \u201cprohibits the knowing and intentional exposure of any person to a cancer-causing chemical without first providing a warning, except as provided in section 25249.10.\u201d <em>(Consumer Cause, Inc. </em>v. <em>Weider Nutrition Internat., Inc., supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th 363, 365; see also <em>DiPirro v.

The \u201c \u2018level in question\u2019 must be one thousand times less than the level which would produce no observable effect.\u201d (OEHHA, Final Statement of Reasons: Article 8 (June 1989) pp. 82-83; see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12821, Level of Exposure to Chemicals Causing Reproductive Toxicity.) \u201cA defendant is exempt from warning others about a reproductive toxin if the level of exposure in question is 1,000 times below the NOEL.\u201d <em>(Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare, supra, </em>at p. 465.) Thus, Bondo\u2019s burden was to first prove the NOEL for exposure to toluene, then ultimately prove that the level of exposure of its touch-up paint is \u201c1,000 times below the NOEL. (\u00a7 25249.10, subd. (c); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 12801, subds. (a), (b)(1), (c), 12803.)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 469.) This threshold warning exemption level of 1,000 times below the NOEL is referred to as the maximum allowable dose level, or MADL. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 12801, subds.

The NOEL for toluene is already the maximum dose level at which the chemical has no observable reproductive effect. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12801, subd. (c).) To establish the warning exemption defense, a defendant must additionally prove that the level of exposure caused by its product is 1,000 times below the NOEL. (\u00a7 25249.10, subd. (c); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 12801, subds. (a), (b)(1), (c), 12803; <em>Consumer Cause, Inc. </em>v. <em>SmileCare, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th 454, 469.)

According to the regulations, the level of \u201cexposure\u201d to a reproductive toxin for purposes of the warning exemption is determined by \u201cmultiplying the level in question (stated in terms of a concentration of a chemical in a given medium) times the <em>reasonably anticipated rate of exposure for an individual </em>to a given medium. The reasonably anticipated rate of exposure shall be based on the pattern and duration of exposure that is relevant to the reproductive effect which provided the basis for the determination that a chemical is known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12821, subd. (b), italics added.) A \u201creasonably anticipated\u201d rate of exposure is not one that includes every conceivable consumer or use, but instead \u201cwill vary from case to case\u201d and person to person. (OEHHA, Final Statement of Reasons: Article 8 (June 1989) p. 83; see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12821, Level of Exposure to Chemicals Causing Reproductive Toxicity.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Further, subdivision (c)(2) of California Code of Regulations, title 22, section 12821 provides that for exposures to <em>consumer products </em>described in section 12601, subdivision (b), \u201cthe level of exposure shall be calculated using the reasonably anticipated rate of intake or exposure for <em>average users </em>of the consumer product, and not on a per capita basis for the general population.\u201d (Italics added.) While the reference to \u201caverage users\u201d in section 12821 may indicate an intent to focus upon the \u201creasonably anticipated rate of consumption by the product user\u201d rather than \u201cper capita consumption of the general population\u201d\u2014many of whom will not use the product at all\u2014we think the language of the regulation reasonably supports an interpretation that excludes at least some nonconforming or unusually high-intake consumers of a product when assessing exposure to consumer goods. (OEHHA, Final Statement of Reasons; Article 8 (June 1989) p. 84; see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12821.) Subdivision (c) of section 12821 takes into account the factor that \u201c[different individuals take in different amounts\u201d of a given medium of exposure, and by limiting the exposure assessment to \u201creasonably anticipated\u201d use by \u201caverage consumers\u201d seeks to deal with the \u201cvariability and fluctuation of the \u2018rate of exposure\u2019 \u201d to resolve and avoid the concern with unreasonably requiring a \u201cwarning to all users of a product on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>occasional high consumption.\u201d (OEHHA, Final Statement of Reasons: Article 8 (June 1989) pp. 84-85; see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12821.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The flexibility necessary to arrive at an appropriate exposure assessment is not provided by adhering to a standard that <em>invariably </em>requires the defendant to prove a level of exposure caused by its product that is 1,000 times below the NOEL for <em>every user. </em>Instead, we conclude that the statute envisions a case-by-case approach which takes into account the totality of the quantitative risk assessment evidence presented. For some products and some exposures\u2014although probably very few\u2014evidence of precise and uniform exposure may indicate that if \u201cany consumer\u201d is exposed to levels of toxins above the MADE with a \u201creasonably anticipated\u201d use of the product, the warning exemption must be denied. In most other cases, the \u201caverage user\u201d may incur exposure at a level appreciably below the most extreme level of exposure incurred by an atypical user.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In the present case, the evidence of the surveys and test results supports the trial court\u2019s finding that for purposes of the warning exemption the \u201caverage users of the consumer product\u201d comprise less than the class of every consumer of Bondo\u2019s touch-up paint. If the survey data demonstrated anything, it is that the use of touch-up paint and the associated exposure to toluene is subject to significant disparity\u2014in the total duration of use, the number and size of scratches or nicks painted, the number of coats applied, the amount of paint used, the nature of the area in which the paint is applied and the airflow in it. Use of touch-up paint by an appreciable fraction of consumers may fall well outside the average. Given the extreme variation in manner of use and extent of exposure, inclusion of all conceivable consumers in the determination of the allowable level of exposure to toluene from touch-up paint does not meet the governing standard of the \u201caverage users\u201d of the product. We therefore find that in resolving the warning exemption defense the trial court did not err by failing to require proof from Bondo that \u201cno consumer\u201d who uses touch-up paint will suffer exposure to toluene above the MADE.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">We further conclude that the \u201c75th to 85th percentile\u201d risk assessment test adopted by the trial court was appropriate and supported by the evidence. As the trial court recognized, the evidence presented by the parties of the results of their experts\u2019 surveys and studies does not lend itself to any precise, definitive statistical analysis or computation of toluene exposure for purposes of the warning exemption defense. Nevertheless, based upon evidence adduced in the case before us, Bondo\u2019s burden to prove that at least 75 to 85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>percent of the consumers of touch-up paint do not receive a toluene exposure above the MADL complies with the mandate of section 25249.10, subdivision (c), and subdivision (c)(2) of section 12821 of the California Code of Regulations, to calculate the level of exposure using the reasonably anticipated rate of intake or exposure for average users of the consumer product. Dr. Latin testified that the reference in Proposition 65 to the \u201creasonably anticipated exposure to an average person\u201d means \u201ca real person,\u201d not someone \u201coutside the actual population\u201d of users. He added that the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) guidance documents used in Proposition 65 assessments, called the Exposure Assessment Guidance, address \u201chigh exposures\u201d of the \u201ctheoretical bounding estimate,\u201d but nothing \u201cabove the <em>75th percentile </em>as being a reasonably anticipated or a typical or an average-type exposure.\u201d (Italics added.) Dr. Latin\u2019s testimony was corroborated by the evidence of valid bounding studies or estimates that followed excessively conservative assumptions, variables and protocols designed to assess exposure at a \u201cmuch higher level\u201d than the \u201cactual population\u201d to safely calculate the \u201cno risk\u201d level even at the \u201cupper end or extreme estimate of the population.\u201d In this case, the 75 to 85 percent standard corresponded to the evidence of appropriate bounding estimates and was properly protective of average consumers of touch-up paint.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">B. <em>The Evidence to Support the Trial Court\u2019s Finding That Bondo Established the Warning Exemption.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">We find support in the evidence offered by Bondo\u2019s experts for the trial court\u2019s determination of exposure that does not reach the MADL. The results of the 2003 Geomatrix Study by Dr. Embree established that toluene exposure from use of touch-up paint by average consumers was between 58 and 2,042 micrograms <em>per day, </em>or only 0.4 to 16 percent of the MADL of 13,000 micrograms. DiPirro presented evidence from Dr. Brown to contest the legitimacy of the protocols used in the 2003 Geomatrix Study, particularly the 0.4-liters-per-minute airflow rate that was double the NIOSH 1501 approved methodology. Dr. Brown also disapproved of the placement of the painted devices on the car, the breathing rate calculation, the sampling number, the lack of measurement of the volume of toluene or the amount of the paint, and other variables used in the 2003 Geomatrix Study.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Bondo offered expert testimony to rebut Dr. Brown\u2019s complaints, however, which was accepted by the trial court. For instance, Dr. Lakin explained that the deviation from the NIOSH 1501 airflow rate in the study did not compromise the results of the Geomatrix Study, given the use of second sampling tubes to account for any \u201cblow-by\u201d that resulted from the increased airflow. He also testified that failure to weigh the touch-up paint bottles before an application did not impair the validity of the study as long as the remaining methodology was acceptable. Further, many of the criticisms leveled at the 2003 Geomatrix Study were alleviated by the 2004 study, which modified the airflow rate\u2014to the NIOSH 1501 figure\u2014and other variables to more conservative levels, yet still achieved essentially the same results far below the MADL of 13,000 micrograms per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Dr. Lakin not only provided testimonial support for the Geomatrix Studies of Dr. Embree, but also performed his own EnSIGHT Study, which found that the reasonably anticipated exposure to toluene of the daily average use of touch-up paint is no more than 75 micrograms per day, unadjusted for exposure over the nine-month gestation period. While Dr. Lakin\u2019s reliance on the Nail Polish study and the Nossaman survey for his extrapolations may have been problematic, we still consider his ultimate findings to be valid bounding estimates, as did the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The trial court accepted the evidence offered by Bondo\u2019s experts and found that the 2003 and 2004 Geomatrix Studies were valid quantitative risk assessments based upon evidence and standards of comparable scientific validity to the evidence and standards which form the scientific basis for the listing of toluene. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 12801, subd. (a).) While DiPirro presented evidence to the contrary, on appeal we cannot reweigh the evidence, and do not consider any of the testimony of Bondo\u2019s expert witnesses so inherently lacking in credibility as to be unworthy of consideration. The testimony of witnesses who were apparently believed by the trier of fact may be rejected on appeal only if that testimony was physically impossible of belief or inherently improbable without resort to inferences or deductions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 13, 21 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 541]; <em>In re Andrew I. </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 572, 578 [281 Cal.Rptr. 570]; <em>People v. Breault </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 125, 140-141 [273 Cal.Rptr. 110].) At most the record before us reveals the presentation of contrary evidence by DiPirro, which does not subject the testimony of Bondo\u2019s witnesses to repudiation or doubt. <em>(People v. Cantrell </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 523, 538 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 188].)</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Even Dr. Brown\u2019s Large Chamber study, which was accepted by the court as a \u201chigh end of what might reasonably be anticipated\u201d in a bounding study, resulted in daily exposure results below the MADL: 2,991 micrograms per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>day, or less than 25 percent of the MADE, without adjustment for the nine-month gestation period. Only his Small Chamber study of isolated, peak level exposure while painting produced the possibility of results above the MADE at various levels of touch-up paint use, and even Dr. Brown acknowledged that this study departed from realistic exposure parameters in many respects. In his testimony, Dr. Lakin effectively challenged the peak exposure assumption of Dr. Brown as inconsistent with Proposition 65, and the trial court rejected the Small Chamber study results as a bounding study. The only evidence that remotely contradicts the judgment was rejected by the trial court. Evidence \u201crejected by the trier of fact cannot be credited on appeal unless, in view of the whole record, it is clear, positive, and of such a nature that it cannot rationally be disbelieved.\u201d <em>(Beck Development Co. v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1204 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 518].)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">We have been presented in this appeal with a classic case of conflicting evidence. We find in the record substantial evidence to support the finding that the daily exposure to toluene by average users of touch-up paint is below the MADE, and cannot disturb the judgment merely because conflicting evidence was also presented by DiPirro. Consequently, we need not resolve the issue addressed by the parties and the Attorney General concerning the propriety of averaging the exposure over the gestational period in determining the allowable exposure limit for toluene. The trial court did not reach this question and it is not our function to render an advisory opinion on this issue. (See <em>Coleman v.

Nor do we disagree with the assertion that as a result of the judgment in its favor some consumers may now more freely use Bondo\u2019s touch-up paint unconcerned with fears of exposure to excessive amounts of a chemical that causes reproductive toxicity. Automobile dealerships also received a benefit by avoiding possible litigation over toluene exposure through the use of touch-up paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">And we agree with Bondo\u2019s position that under the proper circumstances attorney fees may be awarded to parties who successfully <em>defend </em>a public interest lawsuit. \u201cGenerally speaking, the opposing party liable for attorney fees under section 1021.5 has been the defendant person or agency sued, which is responsible for initiating and maintaining actions or policies that are deemed harmful to the public interest and that gave rise to the litigation.\u201d <em>(Connerly </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1169, 1176-1177 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 788, 129 P.3d 1].) However, to effectuate the policy of providing substantial attorney fees to successful litigants in suits enforcing important public policies, the courts \u201chave taken a broad, pragmatic view of what constitutes a \u2018successful party.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 565 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 331, 101 P.3d 140].) An \u201copposing party\u201d against whom attorney fees may be awarded pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 is defined broadly as \u201ca party whose position in the litigation was adverse to that of the prevailing party. Simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>put, an \u2018opposing party\u2019 within the meaning of section 1021.5 is a losing party.\u201d <em>(Nestande </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 232, 240-241 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 18].) Thus, prevailing defendants are entitled to attorney fees upon a proper showing. (See <em>Hammond v. Agran </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 115, 136-137 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 646]; <em>Hall v. Butte Home Health, Inc. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 308, 323 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 246].) \u201c[S]ection 1021.5 draws no distinctions between plaintiffs and defendants as a \u2018successful party.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hull v. Rossi </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1763, 1768 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 457].) An award of attorney fees pursuant to section 1021.5 is available if a party defends an action \u201c \u2018primarily to advance\u2019 \u201d a public interest \u201c \u2018rather than personal interests.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Jobe </em>v. <em>City of Orange </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 412, 417 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 782].)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The flaw in Bondo\u2019s claim to attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 is that the essence and fundamental outcome of its defense was the advancement of its own economic interests. Although the ultimate decision in the present case may have resulted in a determination advantageous\u2014or at least reassuring\u2014to potential consumers that touch-up paint does not contain sufficient quantities of toluene to require warnings, we are not persuaded that any greater benefit to the virtues of Proposition 65 was conferred by Bondo in the present case. The judgment that Proposition 65 warnings are not required on its touch-up paint tubes is a result that affects a limited class of consumers of that product. Bondo only prevented the placement of unnecessary warnings on its touch-up paint; any additional impact on other products or the overall statutory scheme is nebulous and speculative. Further, the benefit conferred upon automobile manufacturers or dealerships was certainly not significant to the general public or a large class of persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The primary focus of defendant\u2019s interest in the case was pecuniary: to avert the cost of placing warnings on its product and perhaps the consequential loss of potential customers, as well as to avoid the imposition of civil penalties. \u201c[I]t has been repeatedly held that an award of attorney fees is not justified under section 1021.5 if the public benefit gained from the law suit (assuming arguendo there is such a benefit here) and the important public right enforced by the suit (assuming arguendo such a right was vindicated here) are coincidental\u201d to the monetary or other personal gain realized by the party seeking fees. <em>(Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1153, 1165 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 99].) \u201cBecause the public always has a significant interest in seeing that laws are enforced, it \u00bfways derives some benefit when illegal private or public conduct is rectified. Nevertheless, the Legislature did not intend to authorize an award of fees under section 1021.5 in every lawsuit enforcing a constitutional or statutory right. [Citations.] The statute specifically provides for an award only when the lawsuit has conferred \u2018a significant benefit\u2019 on \u2018the general public or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>large class of persons.\u2019 The trial court must determine the significance of the benefit and the size of the class receiving that benefit by realistically assessing the gains that have resulted in a particular case.\u201d <em>(Flannery v. California Highway Patrol </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 635 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 632].)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Our review of the record indicates to us that both the principal objective and consequence of the defense of the Proposition 65 lawsuit was to advance or vindicate Bondo\u2019s economic interests. Where the enforcement or advancement of any public interest with the defense of the action was secondary and incidental to achieving personal business goals, an award of fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 is not warranted. (See <em>Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 167 [188 Cal.Rptr. 104, 655 P.2d 306]; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Vista Unified School Dist., supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 672, 690-691; <em>Williams v. San Francisco Bd. of Permit Appeals </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 961, 968 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 565]; <em>Flannery v. California Highway Patrol, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th 629, 635; <em>California Common Cause </em>v. <em>Duffy </em>(1987) 200 Cal.App.3d 730, 750-751 [246 Cal.Rptr. 285]; <em>Terminal Plaza Corp. v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 892, 914 [223 Cal.Rptr. 379].) If we were to grant attorney fees to Bondo, prevailing defendants in nearly all cases brought under Proposition 65, despite the primary pursuit of their own interests, might be entitled to an award under section 1021.5, a result the statute does not countenance. <em>(Flannery v. California Highway Patrol, supra, </em>at p. 636.) We agree with the assertion in the amicus curiae brief of the Attorney General\u2019s Office that while an award of attorney fees to a successful defendant in a Proposition 65 case may be appropriate in limited circumstances where the public benefit is more obvious and substantial, those circumstances do not exist in the present case.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Code of Civil Procedure \u201c \u2018[s]ection 1021.5 was not designed as a method for rewarding litigants motivated by their own pecuniary interests who only coincidentally protect the public interest.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Flannery, <em>supra, </em>at p. 635.) We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying an award of attorney fees based upon a finding that Bondo did not confer the requisite significant benefit upon the public. <em>(Jobe </em>v. <em>City of Orange, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.4th 412, 417, 419; <em>Bell v.

The Act recognizes the interests of manufacturers and the users of needed chemicals,\u201d and seeks to balance the need for a warning of dangerous chemicals against the negative consequences that ensue from the decision to avoid use of a potentially beneficial product. <em>(Baxter Healthcare Corp. </em>v. <em>Denton, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th 333, 366, 368.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\"> We realize that the OEHHA Final Statement of Reasons includes a reference to the \u201ctraditional\u201d use of 95 percent confidence limits as \u201cbest estimates\u201d in \u201cregulatory toxicology\u201d risk assessments.

We do not disagree with appellant that a 95 percent standard may be appropriate in some cases, but in the present case the trial court\u2019s adoption of a 75 to 85 percent standard is at least supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"> We do not think that at least in the present case, the first criterion of an important right affecting the public interest can entirely be disassociated from the second: that the party thereby conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b188-5\"> We also observe that defendants in spurious Proposition 65 actions may seek \u201cimposition of sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, or other statutes providing for an award of reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, for frivolous, bad faith, or unmeritorious actions, motions or pleadings.\u201d <em>(Rodgers </em>v. <em>Sargent Controls &amp; Aerospace </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 82, 95 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 528].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
