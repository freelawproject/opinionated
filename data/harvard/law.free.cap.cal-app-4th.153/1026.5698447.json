The Attorney General argues that the ruling was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Before his first trial, Sol\u00f3rzano filed a motion to suppress arguing that the sole basis of his search was rank speculation, not reasonable suspicion. He noted that the police seized cash from his person and a shaving kit from his residence bearing moisture from which the police inferred he had just shaved to change his appearance. The prosecutor filed an opposition arguing that Sol\u00f3rzano was on parole and that totality-of-the-circumstances analysis showed reasonable suspicion for the warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">At the hearing on the motion, counsel stipulated that the search was warrantless and that Sol\u00f3rzano was on parole at the time. One of the two witnesses at the hearing, a police officer, testified that he heard a report of a store robbery perpetrated by a 40-something, pierced-lip Hispanic male five-two to five-five in height wearing a baseball cap, bandanna, and sunglasses and driving a pickup truck with primer spots, that he recalled a string of four to six armed robberies of stores a few years ago by a similar suspect with a similar modus operand!, and that after his request for additional information Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s name came up as \u201cattached\u201d to one of those robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>From his knowledge of the prior robberies, the officer drove to, and then circled, the immediate area of Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s residence, learned his address, out-of-custody status, and subject-to-search status from his parole agent, and saw parked near his residence a vehicle similar to the one involved in the latest robbery. On the basis of the descriptions of the suspect and the vehicle, the officer thought Sol\u00f3rzano, with whom he made contact outside the residence, was responsible for the robberies. The other witness at the hearing, a parole officer, testified that Sol\u00f3rzano was on parole subject to search of his person, his vehicle, and his residence. The court (Hon. John L. Fielder) denied the motion. Before his second trial, Sol\u00f3rzano renewed, the prosecutor opposed, and the court (Hon. James Stuart) denied the motion after the parties stipulated to the transcript of the hearing before the first trial as the factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">On review of a denial of a motion to suppress, an appellate court defers to the findings of fact, express or implied, that have the support of substantial evidence but nonetheless independently determines, and applies to those findings of fact, the relevant legal principles so as to determine whether the search was constitutionally reasonable. <em>(People v. Weaver </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 876, 924 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 29 P.3d 103].) A ruling on a motion to suppress generally implies \u201ca finding of fact favorable to the prevailing party on each ground or theory underlying the motion.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Manning </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 586, 601-602 [109 Cal.Rptr. 531].) If facts not in dispute establish that the search or seizure at issue was not constitutionally reasonable as a matter of law, however, an appellate court is not bound by the ruling. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 809, 815 [103 Cal.Rptr. 337].)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Sol\u00f3rzano focuses his challenge to the court\u2019s ruling on the prosecution\u2019s lack of proof of the existence of, and the searching officer\u2019s awareness of, a signed parole search agreement. In reliance on section 3067,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which took effect a decade ago, he argues that \u201cthe authority to search a parolee derives from a written search agreement that the parolee signs when released on parole.\u201d (Stats. 1996, ch. 868, \u00a7 2, p. 4656.) With commendable candor, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>acknowledges that <em>People v. Middleton </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 732 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 813] <em>(Middleton) </em>rejected a similar argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Congruently, the United States Supreme Court last year affirmed a Court of Appeal judgment that, under the doctrine of stare decisis <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937] <em>(Auto Equity)), </em>upheld a \u201csuspicionless\u201d but neither \u201carbitrary, capricious, [n]or harassing\u201d search condition in reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Reyes </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 743 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 734, 968 P.2d 445] <em>(Reyes), </em>in which the California Supreme Court held that \u201ceven in the absence of particularized suspicion, a search conducted under the auspices of a properly imposed parole search condition does not intrude on any expectation of privacy \u2018society is \u201cprepared to recognize as legitimate\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 754). <em>(Samson v. California </em>(2006) 547 U.S. 843, 846-848 [165 L.Ed.2d 250, 255-256, 126 S.Ct. 2193].) The high court emphasized the state\u2019s \u201c \u2018overwhelming interest\u2019 in supervising parolees\u201d and carefully noted that the California Supreme Court has not yet construed section 3067 but nonetheless expressly declined to rely on the \u201cconsent rationale\u201d of that statute. <em>(Samson, supra, </em>547 U.S. at pp. 851-854 &amp; fn. 3 [165 L.Ed.2d at pp. 258-260 &amp; fn. 3, 126 S.Ct. at pp. 2199-2200 &amp; fn. 3], citing <em>Middleton, supra, </em>131 Cal.App.4th at pp. 739-740.)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\"><em>Middleton\u2019s </em>rejection of an argument similar to Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s arose from a line of California Supreme Court cases\u2014all decided before section 3067 took effect\u2014holding that \u201c \u2018a warrantless search condition is a reasonable term in any parole of a convicted felon from state prison\u2019 \u201d <em>(Middleton, supra, </em>131 Cal.App.4th at p. 739, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Burgener </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 505, 532 [224 Cal.Rptr. 112, 714 P.2d 1251], disapproved on another ground in <em>Reyes, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 756) and that \u201c \u2018every grant of parole included an implied search condition, and an officer\u2019s knowledge of parole status was equivalent to knowledge of a parole search condition\u2019 \u201d <em>(Middleton, supra, </em>at p. 739, quoting <em>In re Tyrell J. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 68, 94 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 876 P.2d 519] (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.), overruled on another ground in <em>In re Jaime P. </em>(2006) 40 Cal.4th 128, 130 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 430, 146 P.3d 965]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanders </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 318, 328-335 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 630, 73 P.3d 496]).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\u201cThe Court of Appeal must follow, and has no authority to overrule, the decisions of [the California Supreme Court].\u201d <em>(People v.

By the applicable standard of review, we determine that section 3067 does not abrogate the rule in force before the statute took effect and that Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s challenge to the denial of his motion to suppress is meritless. (See <em>Middleton, supra, </em>131 Cal.App.4th at p. 740.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>2. <em>Pretrial </em>Lineup<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">3. <em>Instruction on Possession of Stolen Property As Evidence of Robbery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Sol\u00f3rzano argues that instruction with CALCRIM No. 376 (Possession of Recently Stolen Property as Evidence of a Crime) instead of with CALJIC No. 2.15 (Possession of Stolen Property) undermined the presumption of innocence and violated due process by substituting the requirement of slight supporting evidence for the requirement of slight corroborating evidence and by allowing on that basis a permissive inference of the stolen character of the property from his possession of the property. He argues, too, that lack of substantial evidence of his possession of stolen property made instruction with CALCRIM No. 376 a violation of due process. The Attorney General argues the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Just hours after Sol\u00f3rzano committed the second of his two videotaped robberies, the police arrested him and found $286 in his pockets\u2014seven $20 bills, five $10 bills, sixteen $5 bills, and sixteen $1 bills\u2014\u201cfolded or maybe wadded or some way\u201d but not in a billfold, a money clip, or a wallet. The clerk at the restaurant testified that usually bills smaller than $20 go into, and larger bills go beneath, the restaurant\u2019s cash register drawers. The bills he handed Sol\u00f3rzano were in someone else\u2019s drawer, not his, and he had no idea if any $20 bills were there. Sometimes he puts $20 bills into his drawer and only later puts them beneath his drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">At the instruction-settling conference, the court noted that the bench notes to CALCRIM No. 376 require the instruction to be given sua sponte \u201cif there is evidence of possession of stolen property and corroborating evidence of guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The prosecutor argued that Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s way of storing cash in his pockets was consistent with the recently stolen cash from the restaurant. Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s counsel argued that the instruction lacked evidentiary support. The court found the instruction \u201cappropriate\u201d and instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-9\">\u201cIf you conclude that the defendant knew he possessed property and you conclude that the property had, in fact, been recently stolen, you may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>convict the defendant of robbery based on those facts alone; however, if you also find that <em>supporting evidence </em>tends to prove his guilt, then you may conclude that the evidence is sufficient to prove he committed the crime of robbery. The <em>supporting evidence </em>need only be <em>slight </em>and need not be enough by itself to prove guilt. You may consider how, where, and when the defendant possessed the property, along with any other relevant circumstances tending to prove his guilt of robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-4\">\u201cRemember that you may not convict the defendant of any crime unless you are convinced that each fact essential to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of that crime has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-5\">\u201cI want to reread that last sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-6\">\u201cRemember that you may not convict the defendant of any crime unless you are convinced that each fact essential to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of that crime has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Italics added; see CALCRIM No. 376.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">In argument to the jury, Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s counsel contended that the clerk at one store testified \u201cthat all the robber got was ones, fives, and tens. That\u2019s what he said, no twenties. I asked him was it twenties? Did you go somewhere else? [f] He said no, I didn\u2019t go into that part of the drawer. All the person got was ones, fives, and tens, because there was no twenties in that area, [f] That\u2019s what he said. That\u2019s what he testified to under oath. [The prosecutor] is the advocate of that testimony. FjQ And my client had $20 bills on him. What are we going to say about that, just forget about it? What, did he stop along the way somewhere after the robbery and changed <em>[sic] </em>some of the tens for the twenties? Is that what they\u2019re telling you? [f] That\u2019s ridiculous. They have proved he didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">In rebuttal, the prosecutor argued to the jury that according to Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s counsel the clerk at the store \u201ctestified that the defendant stole no twenties. [][] That\u2019s not what he said, ladies and gentlemen. You can go through the transcript, check your notes. He said that, in general, they don\u2019t put twenties on the top of the drawer, they put them underneath, but I asked him are you saying there were no twenties in the drawer that were taken out of the drawer and given to him? He said he couldn\u2019t say that because it was somebody else\u2019s drawer. He doesn\u2019t know if there were any twenties. [1] But that man had 16 $5 bills, five $10 bills, 16 $1 bills, as well as 14 $20 bills\u2014or not 14, but seven $20 bills jammed in his pocket. How did that manage to happen? []\u25a1 We don\u2019t know. It\u2019s consistent with the robbery. I suppose it\u2019s consistent with other things too. But it\u2019s not inconsistent with the robbery. [Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s counsel] stood up here and told you that proves he didn\u2019t do the robbery. [][] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>No, it doesn\u2019t, because he stretched on what he told you the evidence said. There\u2019s no evidence that no twenties were taken. The evidence is that, in general, they slip the twenties down under the drawer, but [the clerk] told you he wasn\u2019t at his own cash register. He doesn\u2019t know that for sure. fi[] So what is the explanation as to why $270 is jammed in one of the defendant\u2019s pockets and 16 $1 bills in the other? What is the explanation? [][] One you can make, make up whatever you want. The other is that he took it from the robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">CALJIC No. 2.15 (Possession of Stolen Property) instructs on slight <em>corroborating </em>evidence instead of on slight <em>supporting </em>evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-6\">\u201cIf you find that a defendant was in [conscious] possession of recently [stolen] [extorted] property, the fact of that possession is not by itself sufficient to permit an inference that the defendant is guilty of the crime of _. Before guilt may be inferred, there must be <em>corroborating evidence </em>tending to prove defendant\u2019s guilt. However, this <em>corroborating evidence </em>need only be <em>slight, </em>and need not by itself be sufficient to warrant an inference of guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-9\">\u201cAs corroboration, you may consider [the attributes of possession\u2014time, place and manner,] [that the defendant had an opportunity to commit the crime charged,] [the defendant\u2019s conduct,] [[his] [her] false or contradictory statements, if any,] [and] [or] [other statements [he] [she] may have made with reference to the property] [a false account of how [he] [she] acquired possession of the stolen property] [any other evidence which tends to connect the defendant with the crime charged].\u201d (CALJIC No. 2.15, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Sol\u00f3rzano argues that the absence from CALCRIM No. 376 of the requirement in CALJIC No. 2.15 of slight <em>corroborating </em>evidence makes the former instruction constitutionally defective. We disagree. First, a respected dictionary\u2019s list of synonyms including the word \u201ccorroborate\u201d notes: <em>\u201cCorroborate </em>refers to <em>supporting </em>something by means of strengthening evidence: The witness is expected to corroborate the plaintiff\u2019s testimony.\u201d (American Heritage Dict. (4th ed. 2000) p. 386, italics added &amp; omitted.) Since the CALJIC No. 2.15 references to \u201ccorroborating evidence\u201d and the CALCRIM No. 376 references to \u201csupporting evidence\u201d are synonymous, neither instruction permits the jury to find the defendant guilty of robbery solely on the basis of possession of stolen property. Both instructions\u2014CALJIC No. 2.15 by the requirement of slight <em>corroborating </em>evidence and CALCRIM No. 376 by the requirement of slight <em>supporting </em>evidence\u2014prohibit the jury from finding him guilty on the basis of that fact alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">Second, the inference that possession of stolen property creates is permissive, not mandatory. The case law is settled that requiring only slight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>corroborating evidence in support of a permissive inference, like the one that possession of stolen property creates, neither changes the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving every element of the offense nor otherwise violates the right to due process if, as here, the conclusion suggested is one that common sense and reason can justify \u201cin light of the proven facts before the jury.\u201d <em>(People v. Snyder </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1200, 1226 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 711] <em>(Snyder), </em>citing, e.g., <em>Francis v. Franklin </em>(1985) 471 U.S. 307, 314-315 [85 L.Ed.2d 344, 105 S.Ct. 1965] &amp; <em>People v. Holt </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 619, 677 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 782, 937 P.2d 213].)</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The permissive inference that CALCRIM No. 376 authorizes if the jury finds slight supporting evidence is linguistically synonymous with, and constitutionally indistinguishable from, the permissive inference that CALJIC No. 2.15 authorizes if the jury finds slight corroborating evidence. CALJIC No. 2.15 has withstood repeated constitutional attack. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Yeoman </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 93, 130-132 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 186, 72 P.3d 1166]; <em>Snyder, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 1226, citing, e.g., <em>People v. Mendoza </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 130, 176-177 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 485, 6 P.3d 150].) Like CALJIC No. 2.15, CALCRIM No. 376 neither undermines the presumption of innocence nor violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Finally, we turn to Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s argument that lack of substantial evidence of his possession of stolen property made instruction with CALCRIM No. 376 a violation of due process. Besides the cash the police found in his pockets just hours after the robbery, the record shows that a customer who pursued the perpetrator from the restaurant but lost him in traffic positively identified as the getaway vehicle the \u201cold\u201d and \u201cbeat up\u201d truck with \u201crust spots or something behind some of the wheels\u201d parked outside Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s house. The evidentiary context of the cash in his pockets includes flight, which tends to show consciousness of guilt <em>(People v. Scott </em>(1924) 66 Cal.App. 200, 203 [225 P. 767]), \u201cattributes of possession\u201d like \u201c \u2018time, place and manner,\u2019 \u201d which tend to show guilt <em>(People v. Anderson </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 414, 424 [258 Cal.Rptr. 482], italics omitted), and \u201cthe opportunity to commit the crime\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 425, italics omitted). His argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">4. <em>Instruction on Prior Statements As Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Sol\u00f3rzano argues that instruction with CALCRIM No. 318 (Prior Statements as Evidence) instead of with CALJIC No. 2.13 (Prior Consistent or Inconsistent Statements as Evidence) violated due process by authorizing the jury to consider a witness\u2019s prior statements as substantive evidence without finding those statements inconsistent with his or her testimony. The Attorney General argues that Sol\u00f3rzano forfeited his right to appellate review by failing to make a timely objection and that the instruction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>On direct examination, both of Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s parents testified to where he was around the time of the robbery. His father testified that his son went to a swap meet around 11:00 a.m. to look for a truck and was at home again around 2:15 or 2:30 p.m. His mother testified that her son was home from around 2:00 p.m. to around 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. when the police arrived. On cross-examination, both parents denied telling the police where their son was that afternoon and, additionally, his father testified that he did not remember telling the police about that. On rebuttal, a police officer testified that he asked where Sol\u00f3rzano was and that both of his parents told him he had gone to the swap meet around 11:00 a.m. to look for a truck, had returned home around 2:00 p.m., had gone out again around 3:00 or 3:30 p.m. \u201cto go get some papers fixed on the truck,\u201d and had returned home again around 4:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">At the instruction-settling conference, the court read and then asked counsel for comment about CALCRIM No. 318. \u201cI think that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d the prosecutor replied. Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s counsel answered, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, Judge.\u201d The court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cYou have heard evidence of statements that a witness made before the trial. If you decide that the witness made those statements, you may use those statements in two ways: First, to evaluate whether the witness\u2019s testimony in court is believable; and, two, as evidence that the information in those earlier statements is true.\u201d (See CALCRIM No. .318.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">In argument to the jury, the prosecutor suggested that Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s parents no longer remember the details about the day of the robbery. \u201cWhen would their memory have been the best? Probably that day.\u201d He pointedly did not accuse them of lying but merely suggested, \u201cMaybe they were looking through their hearts instead of their eyes. Maybe they were remembering back in ways to help their relative instead of the ways they remembered at the time, which they didn\u2019t know at the time helped proved his guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">In his argument, Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s counsel chose to tell the jury essentially \u201cthe same thing [the prosecutor] does.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re talking about good, honest people, God-fearing people. They\u2019re not going to come in here and take the oath and lie to you.\u201d Instead, he argued \u201cthat the police are obviously mixing things up\u201d since they were \u201cinterviewing people fast and furious.\u201d In rebuttal, the prosecutor argued, \u201cnone of the alibi evidence is real alibi evidence. It\u2019s the familial affection of a family that you may have a great deal of respect for, but they can\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t the robber.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">During deliberations, the jury requested a copy of the officer\u2019s police report and a readback of his testimony. The court granted the readback request but, since the police report was not in evidence, denied that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>Preliminarily, we turn to the Attorney General\u2019s forfeiture argument. Applying the established rule that allows appellate review, even in the absence of an objection, of any instruction affecting the substantial rights of the accused, we reject his argument. (\u00a7 1259; <em>People v. Brown </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 539, fn. 7 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 145, 73 P.3d 1137].) So we turn to the merits of the CALCRIM No. 318 issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Sol\u00f3rzano argues that CALJIC No. 2.13 (Prior Consistent or Inconsistent Statements as Evidence) \u201cprovide[s] the jury with proper guidance as to the use of prior consistent or inconsistent statements as evidence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-5\">\u201cEvidence that at some other time a witness made a [statement] [or] [statements] that [is] [or] [are] <em>inconsistent [or </em>consistent] with [his] [her] testimony in this trial, may be considered by you not only for the purpose of testing the credibility of the witness, but also as evidence of the truth of the facts as stated by the witness on that former occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-6\">\u201c[If you disbelieve a witness\u2019 testimony that [he] [she] no longer remembers a certain event, that testimony is <em>inconsistent </em>with a prior statement or statements by [him] [her] describing that event.]\u201d (CALJIC No. 2.13, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">\u201cUnlike CALJIC No. 2.13,\u201d Sol\u00f3rzano argues, \u201cCALCRIM No. 318 fails to inform the jury that a prior statement can be considered as evidence only if it is found to be inconsistent with trial testimony.\u201d \u201cTo the extent that CALCRIM No. 318 deviates from CALJIC No. 2.13 by denying the defendant the same jury determination on the issue of inconsistency,\" he claims, \u201cit must be deemed erroneous.\u201d For two reasons, we reject his argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">First, Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s argument intimates that CALJIC instructions serve as the benchmark by which to adjudicate the correctness of CALCRIM instructions. He is mistaken. \u201cThe California Judicial Council withdrew its endorsement of the long-used CALJIC instructions and adopted the new CALCRIM instructions, effective January 1, 2006. At the time of [his] trial, former rule 855(e) of the California Rules of Court (now renumbered rule 2.1050) provided that \u2018[u]se of the Judicial Council instructions is strongly encouraged.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 461, 465 [58 Cal.Rptr.3d 581].)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Second, Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s argument betrays an incorrect reading of CALJIC No. 2.13, which straightforwardly allows the jury to use prior statements as substantive evidence without finding those statements inconsistent with his or her testimony (as does CALCRIM No. 318) and which optionally characterizes as inconsistent a witness\u2019s testimony that he or she \u201cno longer remembers a certain event\u201d if the jury disbelieves that testimony. (CALJIC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>No. 2.13.) Since both of Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s parents denied telling the police where their son was on the afternoon of the robbery, the optional characterization is surplusage, as is his father\u2019s additional testimony that he did not remember telling the police about that.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">5. <em>Harsher Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Sol\u00f3rzano argues, first, that the due process and double jeopardy clauses of the California Constitution prohibit the imposition of a sentence impermissibly harsher than his original sentence and that the due process clauses of the United States Constitution and the California Constitution prohibit the imposition of a sentence vindictively harsher than the indicated sentences he rejected before his first and second trials. The Attorney General argues the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Preliminarily, we turn to Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s vindictive sentence argument. Before his first trial, the court (Hon. Colette M. Humphrey) noted at a hearing before the preliminary hearing his rejection of an offer of 25 years to life. Almost three months later, the court (Hon. Stephen P. Gildner) put on the record at the readiness conference, \u201cThere is an offer of 25-to-life on any one of the four counts. That would require, of course, a plea to the charge plus an admission of two strike allegations. That has been rejected. There is no counteroffer.\u201d The court observed that his \u201cexposure, if convicted as alleged, is in the neighborhood of 107 years-to-life.\u201d In the middle of the defense case, he blurted out in front of the jury, \u201cI would like to take the 25 to life.\u201d Outside the presence of the jury, the court (Hon. Lee P. Felice) informed Sol\u00f3rzano that a 31-year-to-life offer was on the table, but he rejected the offer. Before his second trial, the court (Hon. Clarence Westra, Jr.) compared the prosecutor\u2019s 25-year-to-life offer with the \u201cpossible exposure if all the allegations and charges are proved is in excess of 120 years to life,\u201d but Sol\u00f3rzano rejected that offer, too.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Due process is not offended by all possibilities of increased punishment but only by those that pose a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness. <em>(Alabama </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 794, 800, fn. 3 [104 L.Ed.2d 865, 109 S.Ct. 2201].) \u201cA prosecutor should remain free before trial to exercise the broad discretion entrusted to him to determine the extent of the societal interest in prosecution. An initial decision should not freeze future conduct.\u201d <em>(United States v. Goodwin </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 368, 382 [73 L.Ed.2d 74, 102 S.Ct. 2485], fn. omitted; <em>People v. Michaels </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 486, 514-515 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 285, 49 P.3d 1032].) Here, Sol\u00f3rzano was informed with care of the sentencing implications if he were to proceed to verdicts on charges already pending instead of accepting offers on the table. Since nothing in the record warrants a presumption of vindictiveness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>that would shift the burden of proof from the defense to the prosecution, and since he fails to show any evidence of a desire by the court or the prosecutor to punish him for doing something the law plainly allows him to do, we reject his vindictive punishment argument. (See <em>Goodwin, supra, </em>at pp. 372-384; <em>Michaels, supra, </em>at pp. 514-515; cf. <em>People v. Jurado </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 72, 98 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d <em>319, 131 </em>P.3d <em>400]; </em>see also <em>People v. Collins </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 297, 304-309 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 836, 27 P.3d 726].)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">So we turn to his argument that his sentence is impermissibly harsher than his original sentence. After his first trial, the court (Hon. Lee P. Felice) sentenced Sol\u00f3rzano to four consecutive 25-year-to-life terms plus a determinate six-year eight-month term (a five-year term for the serious felony prior, a one-year term for one personal knife use, and four-month (one-third middle) terms for each of the other two personal knife uses). After his second trial, the court (Hon. Gary T. Friedman) sentenced him to four consecutive 25-year-to-life terms plus a 23-year determinate term (a five-year term for each of the four serious felony priors, a one-year term for the prison term prior, a one-year term for one personal knife use, and four-month (one-third middle) terms for each of the other three personal knife uses).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">If a defendant successfully challenges his or her conviction on appeal and secures a new trial, the due process and double jeopardy clauses of the California Constitution generally prohibit the imposition of a harsher sentence after retrial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hanson </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 355, 357, 366 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 58, 1 P.3d 650]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 482, 495-497 [35 Cal.Rptr. 77, 386 P.2d 677]; <em>People v. Torres </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1391, 1403 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 518].) The rule is otherwise, however, if the original sentence was not legally authorized by law. <em>(People v. Serrato </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 753, 764 [109 Cal.Rptr. 65, 512 P.2d 289] <em>(Serrato), </em>overruled on another ground in <em>People v. Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 583, fn. 1 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144].) Here, two errors\u2014one by the probation officer, the other by the probation officer and the prosecutor\u2014 influenced sentencing. The question before us is whether those errors fall within the scope of the <em>Serrato </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">An oversight in the probation report initiated the first error. \u201cIt is noted the allegation as to Penal Code Section 667.5(b) must be stricken,\u201d the probation report read, \u201cas it is for the period of incarceration which is being used to enhance the case pursuant to Penal Code section 667(a).\u201d The serious felony prior (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)) and the prison term prior (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)) did not arise from a single conviction, however. So the court was not only, in the Attorney General\u2019s words, \u201centitled\u201d to impose sentence on both <em>(People v. Gonzales </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1607, 1610-1611 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 305]) but also, due to statutory mandate, obligated either to impose sentence on, or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>enter in the minutes the reasons for striking, the prison term prior <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 386, 392-396 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 244] (Bradley); \u00a7 1385, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Yet the court neither struck nor imposed sentence on the prison term prior. (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b).) The reporter\u2019s transcript shows the court stating only that the prison term prior \u201ccan\u2019t be used.\u201d The minutes show no reason at all. Since the court\u2019s failure not only to identify and articulate available sentencing choices but also to impose or strike the prison term prior created a sentence that was not legally authorized, the sentence is subject to correction on appeal. <em>(Bradley, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 391.) Our duty is to remand for the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion in compliance with the statutory mandate. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 400, fn. 5, citing <em>People v. Williams </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 159 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 917, 948 P.2d 429]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 355 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040]; cf. <em>People v. McCray </em>(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 258, 267 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 343].)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">A mistake by the probation officer and the prosecutor initiated the second error. \u201cIt will be recommended,\u201d the probation report read, \u201cthe case be enhanced by five years pursuant to the true finding as to Penal Code Section 667(a).\u201d At the probation and sentencing hearing, however, the court imposed a five-year enhancement on each of the four serious felony priors as requested at that time by both the probation officer and the prosecutor. The day after the probation and sentencing hearing, both the probation officer and the prosecutor informed the court that sentence could be imposed on only one of the serious felony priors, and the court so amended the judgment. To the contrary, the court was not only, in the Attorney General\u2019s words, \u201centitled\u201d to impose sentence on all four serious felony priors but also, due to a statutory mandate, obligated to do so. <em>(People v. Williams </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 397, 401-405 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 619, 98 P.3d 876]; \u00a7 1385, subd. (b); Stats. 1986, ch. 85, \u00a7 2, p. 211, eff. May 6, 1986.)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Since both sentencing errors created a sentence that was not legally authorized, the <em>Serrato </em>rule applies, allowing the imposition of a harsher sentence after retrial. Our duty, then, is to order a remand for the exercise of the court\u2019s sentencing discretion as to the prison term prior and to let the harsher sentence stand as to the serious felony priors.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">6. <em>Personal Knife Use </em>Enhancement<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The personal knife use enhancement in count two is ordered stricken from the judgment. The matter is remanded with directions to the court to exercise sentencing discretion solely as to the prison term prior (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (a)) and to issue, and to send to each interested party a certified copy of, an amended abstract of judgment. Otherwise the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Wiseman, Acting P.
