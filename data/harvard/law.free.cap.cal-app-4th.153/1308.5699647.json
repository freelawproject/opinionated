Plaintiff was the victim of embezzlement by an employee, whom defendant had recruited and placed with plaintiff. The trial court concluded that plaintiff should have discovered the embezzlement sooner, and it therefore sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer, brought on statute of limitations grounds. Plaintiff brought this appeal from the ensuing judgment. Applying the delayed discovery rule to plaintiff\u2019s claims of independent wrongdoing by defendant, we conclude that the trial court erred in finding plaintiff\u2019s claims barred as a matter of law. We therefore reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\">Only two of the parties to this action are before us on appeal: appellant E-Fab, Inc., (plaintiff), and respondent Accountants, Inc. Services (defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Plaintiff designs and manufactures precision components and tools. Plaintiff has been in business since 1981, employing 15 to 20 individuals at any given time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">In 1996, plaintiff needed \u201ca new bookkeeper to manage its financial affairs including accounts receivable and accounts payable.\u201d Plaintiff contacted defendant \u201cto obtain a temporary accountant who was qualified to work for plaintiff in such a position.\u201d Defendant agreed to provide \u201ctemporary or permanent accountants to meet plaintiff\u2019s accounting needs. . . .\u201d Defendant represented that the candidates \u201chad been personally interviewed,\u201d that \u201ctheir background, qualifications, accomplishments, employment references, academic credentials had been screened, confirmed and verified,\u201d and that \u201cthe temporary accountants had been recruited by [defendant] and were employed, supervised and managed by [defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">Relying on those representations by defendant, \u201cplaintiff hired defendant Vickie Hunt as a temporary accountant and then as a permanent accountant/bookkeeper.\u201d As it turned out, Hunt had prior criminal convictions for theft and for welfare fraud, she had been incarcerated, and she had falsified her academic credentials, but defendant had failed to discover any of those problems in its screening process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">From 1996 to 2003, while employed by plaintiff, Hunt embezzled approximately $1 million. Hunt successfully avoided detection \u201cby making multiple small withdrawals, in irregular amounts, to different payees,\u201d by destroying records, including parts of bank statements, and \u201cby providing the management of [plaintiff] with erroneous financial information, both oral and written, as to the status of the bank accounts,\u201d as well as assurances that the information provided was accurate. As a result, \u201cplaintiff had no reason to believe\u201d that the embezzlement \u201cwas occurring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">Hunt\u2019s embezzlement scheme came to light in November 2003, when a prospective \u201cnew partner\u201d was investigating plaintiff\u2019s finances. During the course of that investigation, \u201che discovered that Vickie Hunt had removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>and destroyed portions of the monthly bank statements the company had received. After obtaining copies of the missing documents from the bank the evidence of Vickie Hunt\u2019s embezzlement was first uncovered.\u201d Law enforcement was notified in December 2003. A police investigation and an audit of plaintiffs finances disclosed \u201cthe nature and extent\u201d of Hunt\u2019s embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">In connection with the law enforcement investigation, the police informed plaintiff of Hunt\u2019s criminal record. \u201cIt was at that time that Plaintiff first became aware that Vickie Hunt had not been \u2018screened\u2019 by\u201d defendant and that defendant\u2019s \u201crepresentations as to her background were false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">In March 2005, Hunt was convicted by plea, sentenced to serve four years in state prison, and ordered to pay more than $1.5 million in restitution to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">Plaintiff filed its initial complaint in August 2005, naming Hunt, defendant, and others. Of the five causes of action in the complaint, three were asserted against defendant: the second cause of action, for negligence; the third cause of action, for negligent misrepresentation; and the fourth cause of action, for breach of implied in fact contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">In response to plaintiff\u2019s complaint, defendant demurred and moved to strike the causes of action asserted against it. In its supporting papers, defendant asserted several grounds for the demurrer, including the complaint\u2019s untimeliness. Defendant also asked the court to take judicial notice of several documents, including the police report. That request drew plaintiff\u2019s successful objection. Plaintiff also opposed the demurrer and motion to strike on the merits. In January 2006, the trial court sustained the demurrer on the ground that the claims against defendant were barred by the statute of limitations. In its formal order, the court stated that plaintiff had failed to adequately plead facts bringing it within the delayed discovery rule. The court granted plaintiff leave to amend its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint in January 2006. As before, defendant demurred on statute of limitations grounds. It also requested the court to judicially notice the \u201cfact that it is the custom of commercial banks to send its depositors a monthly statement Plaintiff opposed the demurrer. In its ruling, the trial court granted the request for judicial notice. As to the second and third causes of action (for negligence and negligent misrepresentation), the court sustained the demurrer, again granting plaintiff leave to amend; as to the fourth cause of action (for breach of implied contract), the court overruled the demurrer \u201cas Defendant failed to assert any arguments in support thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>Plaintiff then filed a second amended complaint in March 2006. Once again, defendant demurred and requested judicial notice of the fact that banks customarily send monthly statements. As before, plaintiff resisted the demurrer on the merits. In June 2006, the trial court sustained the demurrer to the second, third, and fourth causes of action on statute of limitations grounds, but this time without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">In July 2006, the court entered a judgment of dismissal in favor of defendant. This appeal by plaintiff followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">The question before us is this: Considering the facts alleged on the face of the complaint, together with judicially noticed matters, are plaintiff\u2019s claims against defendant time-barred as a matter of law? To establish the proper framework for deciding that question, we first describe the standard of review that governs this appeal, which follows a demurrer. We then address the statute of limitations issues presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">I. <em>Judgment Following Demurrer: Appellate Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">\n<em>A. General Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">\u201cA demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or the facts alleged.\u201d <em>(City of Atascadero </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 329].) For that reason, we \u201cassume the truth of the complaint\u2019s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations.\u201d <em>(Schifando </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 457, 79 P.3d 569].) We also \u201cconsider judicially noticed matters.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cIn addition, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and read it in context.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>On appeal from a judgment of dismissal after a demurrer has been sustained without leave to amend, the plaintiff has the burden of proving error. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cBecause the trial court\u2019s determination is made as a matter of law, we review the ruling de novo.\u201d <em>(Moreno v. Sanchez </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1415, 1423 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 684].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-10\">B. <em>Demurrer Based on Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-11\">At issue here is the sustention of defendant\u2019s demurrer on statute of limitations grounds. \u201cThe defense of statute of limitations may be asserted by general demurrer if the complaint shows on its face that the statute bars the action.\u201d (1 Schwing, Cal. Affirmative Defenses (2007) Statute of Limitations, \u00a7 25:78, p. 1609, fns. omitted; see <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hibernia Bank </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 540, 550 [305 P.2d 20].) There is an important qualification, however: \u201cIn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>order for the bar of the statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the complaint shows merely that the action may be barred.\u201d <em>(McMahon v. Republic Van &amp; Storage Co., Inc. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 871, 874 [31 Cal.Rptr. 603, 382 P.2d 875]; see also, e.g., <em>Geneva Towers Ltd. Partnership v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 769, 781 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 60 P.3d 692].) \u201cThe ultimate question for review is whether the complaint showed <em>on its face </em>that the action was barred by a statute of limitations, for only then may a general demurrer be sustained and a judgment of dismissal be entered thereon.\u201d <em>(Moseley v. Abrams </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 355, 358 [216 Cal.Rptr. 40].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">In assessing whether plaintiff\u2019s claims against defendant are time-barred, two basic questions drive our analysis: (a) What statutes of limitations govern the plaintiff\u2019s claims? (b) When did the plaintiff\u2019s causes of action accrue? As both parties acknowledge, the second question is the key inquiry here. We nevertheless begin with a brief discussion of the first issue, the governing limitations statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">II. <em>The Limitations Period</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">A. <em>General Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">The applicable statute of limitations depends on \u201cthe nature of he cause of action, i.e., the \u2018gravamen\u2019 of the cause of action.\u201d <em>(Hensler v. City of Glendale </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1, 22 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 244, 876 P.2d 1043]; see generally 1 Schwing, Cal. Affirmative Defenses, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25:1, pp. 1322-1323 at fns. 39, 43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">As relevant here, a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation typically is subject to a two-year limitations period. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 339; <em>Ventura County Nat. Bank v. Macker </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1528, 1530-1531 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 418]; see generally 1 Schwing, Cal. Affirmative Defenses, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25:21, pp. 1415-1416, fns. 8-9.)  That same two-year period generally applies to actions \u201cupon a contract, obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument of writing . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 339, subd. 1.) <em> A </em>cause of action for fraud or mistake is governed by a three-year statute of limitations. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 338, subd. (d).)  And the limitations period for a written contract is four years. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 337; see <em>United States Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Haidinger-Hayes, Inc. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 586, 596 [83 Cal.Rptr. 418, 463 P.2d 770].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-12\">Where more than one statute might apply to a particular claim, \u201ca specific limitations provision prevails over a more general provision.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number><em>(Creditors Collection Service v. Castaldi </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1043 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 511].)  \u201cWhile Code of Civil Procedure section 339 applies generally to quasi-contract actions as actions \u2018upon a contract, obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument of writing,\u2019 Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (d) applies more specifically to those quasi-contract actions which seek recovery of money obtained by fraud or mistake.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1044.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">B. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">In this case, plaintiff asserts both tort and contract claims against defendant. In its order on defendant\u2019s first demurrer, plaintiff notes, the trial court applied a two-year statute to all of its claims, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 339. Plaintiff questions that decision, arguing that negligent misrepresentation is a \u201cspecies of fraud,\u201d which is subject to the three-year statute provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (d). (But see <em>Ventura County Nat. Bank v. Macker, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1530-1531 [\u201cthe essence of this cause of action is negligence, not fraud\u201d].) Plaintiff also suggests that a four-year statute might apply to its contract claim under Code of Civil Procedure section 337. (See <em>United States Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Haidinger-Hayes, Inc., supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 596 [applying that four-year statute to a claim for \u201cnegligent performance of an implied obligation which is based upon a contract in writing\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">In any event, plaintiff states, the choice of statute has \u201cno bearing on the issue before this court.\u201d Rather, the \u201ckey question\u201d here relates to accrual\u2014whether plaintiff \u201cmay rely on the discovery rule.\u201d Defendant effectively agrees, stating: \u201cEven if section 337 applies, the statute of limitations has run because each of the causes of action accrued in 1996 . . . .\u201d And as one commentator has observed, a dispute over which statute governs \u201cdoes not preclude a demurrer when the complaint is barred no matter which statute applies.\u201d (1 Schwing, Cal. Affirmative Defenses, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25:78, p. 1612.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">We therefore turn to the question of accrual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">IH. <em>Accrual: General Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">The limitations period commences when the cause of action accrues. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 312; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 806 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 661, 110 P.3d 914] <em>(Fox); Norgart v. Upjohn Co. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 397 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 453, 981 P.2d 79] <em>(Norgart).) </em>\u201cGenerally speaking, a cause of action accrues at \u2018the time when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Fox, </em>at p. 806, quoting <em>Norgart, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>at p. 397.) \u201cAn exception to the general rule for defining the accrual of a cause of action\u2014indeed, the \u2018most important\u2019 one\u2014is the discovery rule.\u201d (Norgart, at p. 397; see generally 1 Schwing, Cal. Affirmative Defenses, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25:4, pp. 1334-1343.) The application of that rule is the crux of the dispute here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">A. <em>The Discovery Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">The discovery rule \u201cpostpones accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the cause of action.\u201d <em>(Norgart, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 397; accord, <em>Fox, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 807.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">The discovery rule \u201cmay be expressed by the Legislature or implied by the courts.\u201d <em>(Norgart, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 397.) By statute, the discovery rule applies to fraud actions. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 338, subd. (d).) In addition, \u201cjudicial decisions have declared the discovery rule applicable in situations where the plaintiff is unable to see or appreciate a breach has occurred.\u201d <em>(Moreno v. Sanchez, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 1423.) \u201cDelayed accrual of a cause of action is viewed as particularly appropriate where the relationship between the parties is one of special trust such as that involving a fiduciary, confidential or privileged relationship. Employing this rationale, the discovery rule has been applied, sometimes by statute and sometimes through judicial decisions, to claims against professionals . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1424.) \u201cCourts have also employed the rule of delayed accrual in cases involving tradespeople who have held themselves out as having a special skill, or are required by statute to possess a certain level of skill.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">The discovery rule \u201cprotects the plaintiff, whose cause of action is preserved when, despite diligent investigation, he is blamelessly ignorant of the cause of his injuries. It also protects the defendant, who is spared precipitous litigation.\u201d <em>(Bastian v. County of San Luis Obispo </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 520, 529 [245 Cal.Rptr. 78].) The discovery rule \u201cis based on the notion that statutes of limitations are intended to run against those who fail to exercise reasonable care in the protection and enforcement of their rights; therefore, those statutes should not be interpreted so as to bar a victim of wrongful conduct from asserting a cause of action before he could reasonably be expected to discover its existence.\u201d <em>(Saliter v. Pierce Brothers Mortuaries </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 292, 297 [146 Cal.Rptr. 271].) Thus, in actions where the rule applies, the limitations period does not accrue until the aggrieved party has notice of the facts constituting the injury. <em>(Fox, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 807.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">B. <em>Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">Notice may be actual or constructive. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 18.) Actual notice is \u201cexpress information of a fact,\u201d while constructive notice is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>\u201cwhich is imputed by law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>A person with \u201cactual notice of circumstances sufficient to put a prudent man upon inquiry\u201d is deemed to have constructive notice of all facts that a reasonable inquiry would disclose. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 19; see <em>Hobart v. Hobart Estate Co. </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 412, 439 [159 P.2d 958]; 1 Schwing, Cal. Affirmative Defenses, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25:4, pp. 1340-1341 at fn. 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">Notice possessed by one person\u2014actual or constructive\u2014may be imputed to another person. For example, it has long been the rule in California that \u201cnotice to an agent is notice to the principal. . . .\u201d <em>(Watson v. Sutro </em>(1890) 86 Cal. 500, 516 [25 P. 64].) \u201cThere is no difference in this respect between actual and constructive notice.\u201d <em>(Shapiro v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. </em>(1946) 76 Cal.App.2d 75, 87 [172 P.2d 725].) Thus, \u201can employer is charged with the knowledge that an honest agent would have gained in the course of a reasonably diligent examination\u201d of records available to it, such as monthly bank statements. <em>(Sun \u2019n Sand, Inc. </em>v. <em>United California Bank </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 671, 702 [148 Cal.Rptr. 329, 582 P.2d 920]; see also <em>Basch </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 316, 327-328 [139 P.2d 1]; <em>Kiernan v. Union Bank </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 111, 117 [127 Cal.Rptr. 441].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">For purposes of accrual of the limitations period, inquiry notice is triggered by suspicion. As the California Supreme Court explained in the <em>Jolly </em>case: \u201cOnce the plaintiff has a suspicion of wrongdoing, and therefore an incentive to sue, she must decide whether to file suit or sit on her rights.\u201d <em>(Jolly </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1103, 1111 [245 Cal.Rptr. 658, 751 P.2d 923].) The court recently reaffirmed the suspicion rule in <em>Fox, </em>saying \u201cunder the delayed discovery rule, a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff <em>has reason to suspect an injury and some wrongful cause, </em>unless the plaintiff pleads and proves that a reasonable investigation at that time would not have revealed a factual basis for <em>that particular cause of action.\u201d (Fox, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 803, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">C. <em>Pleading Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">\u201cA plaintiff whose complaint shows on its face that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery rule must specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and manner of discovery <em>and </em>(2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence. The burden is on the plaintiff to show diligence, and conclusory allegations will not withstand demurrer.\u201d <em>(McKelvey v. Boeing North American, Inc. </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 151, 160 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 645], superseded by statute on another point, as stated in <em>Grisham v. Philip Morris U.S.A., Inc. </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 623, 637, fn. 8 [54 Cal.Rptr.3d 735, 151 P.3d 1151]; accord, <em>Fox, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 815.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>D. <em>Question of Law or Fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">\u201cResolution of the statute of limitations issue is normally a question of fact.\u201d <em>(Fox, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 810.) More specifically, as to accrual, \u201conce properly pleaded, belated discovery is a question of fact.\u201d <em>(Bastian v. County of San Luis Obispo, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at p. 527.) As our state\u2019s high court has observed: \u201cThere are no hard and fast rules for determining what facts or circumstances will compel inquiry by the injured party and render him chargeable with knowledge. [Citation.] It is a question for the trier of fact.\u201d <em>(United States Liab. Ins. Co. v. Haidinger-Hayes, Inc., supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 597 [reversing judgment after demurrer].) \u201cHowever, whenever reasonable minds can draw only one conclusion from the evidence, the question becomes one of law.\u201d <em>(Snow v. A. H. Robins Co. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 120, 128 [211 Cal.Rptr. 271] [reversing summary judgment].) Thus, when an appeal is taken from a judgment of dismissal following the sustention of a demurrer, \u201cthe issue is whether the trial court could determine as a matter of law that failure to discover was due to failure to investigate or to act without diligence.\u201d <em>(Bastian v. County of San Luis Obispo, </em>at p. 527.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">IV. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">Governed by the foregoing principles, we turn to the case at hand. We proceed in two steps. First, we briefly address plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations concerning its former employee, Vickie Hunt, to the extent that those facts concern plaintiff\u2019s diligence in discovering the embezzlement. Next, we analyze the accrual question as it relates more directly to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">A. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s Allegations Against Hunt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">As alleged in the operative pleading, Hunt successfully avoided detection by various means, including destroying parts of bank statements, and her embezzlement did not come to light until a proposed new partner investigated plaintiff\u2019s finances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>Defendant asserts that plaintiff should have discovered the embezzlement earlier, saying: \u201cIt is clear from the manner in which Appellant claims it first discovered Mrs. Hunt\u2019s embezzlement that the same information . . . would have been discovered much earlier if it ever reviewed . . . bank statements that it received on a monthly basis from 1996 to 2003.\u201d As legal support for that assertion, defendant relies principally on <em>Sun \u2019n Sand, Inc. v. United California Bank, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 671 <em>(Sun \u2019n Sand).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There, the court stated, the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cdelay in discovering its mistake and commencing this action was attributable to its own negligence. If it had examined its bank statements with reasonable care, Sun \u2019n Sand would have discovered that its employee was altering the checks issued to UCB; reasonable inquiries following such discovery would have revealed the employee\u2019s fraudulent scheme. That its dishonest employee may have concealed her perfidy by manipulating and destroying records does not exonerate Sun \u2019n Sand of its negligent omission.\u201d <em>(Sun \u2019n Sand, </em>at p. 702; see also, e.g., <em>Basch v. Bank of America, supra, </em>22 Cal.2d at p. 323.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">We question whether the complaint before us here so clearly and affirmatively discloses plaintiff\u2019s lack of diligence in uncovering the embezzlement that the determination may be made as a matter of law. We need not decide that question, however. What concerns us here is not plaintiff\u2019s discovery of <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>fraud, but rather its discovery of <em>defendant\u2019s </em>independent wrongdoing, a point we consider now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">B. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s Claims Against Defendant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">Our analysis of the accrual of plaintiff\u2019s claims against defendant proceeds in two steps. First, we discuss the separate accrual trigger for defendant\u2019s independent wrong. Next, we assess plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint to determine whether it meets the requisite pleading standards to survive demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>1. <em>Independent Accrual of Plaintiff\u2019s Claims Against Defendant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">The first step in the analysis requires us to segregate plaintiffs claims against its employee Hunt from its claims against defendant, recognizing that each may accrue at a different time. As the California Supreme Court explained in <em>Fox, </em>\u201cif a plaintiffs reasonable and diligent investigation discloses only one kind of wrongdoing when the injury was actually caused by tortious conduct of a wholly different sort, the discovery rule postpones accrual of the statute of limitations on the newly discovered claim.\u201d <em>(Fox, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 813.) In such cases, the key issue is whether \u201ca reasonable investigation at that time would . . . have revealed a factual basis for <em>that particular cause of action.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 803, italics added.) Applying that principle, the court in <em>Fox </em>held that the plaintiffs later discovered cause of action for products liability against one defendant did not necessarily accrue at the same time as her cause of action for medical malpractice against another defendant, her surgeon. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 802-803.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">A similar accrual principle has been recognized in other contexts, in appellate decisions predating <em>Fox </em>that involve claims against a single wrongdoer. One example is <em>Snow v. A. H. Robins Co., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d 120. In that case, the plaintiff, Snow, suffered an \u201cunwanted pregnancy and resulting abortion,\u201d and sued the defendant, A. H. Robins Company, the maker of the Daikon Shield contraceptive device that she had used. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 130.) First addressing the plaintiffs personal injury claim, the court concluded that it was time-barred since her pregnancy and ensuing abortion made it \u201cfacially apparent \u2018that someone has done something wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 130.) As the court explained, the plaintiff \u201ccannot come eight years later to pursue these causes of action for injuries based on the unsafe nature of the Daikon Shield when she knew in 1974 it was responsible for the abortion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 131.) Next, the court separately analyzed the plaintiffs allegation that \u201cshe was defrauded by Robins, which proximately caused her injuries.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court stated that \u201cthe fraud is a concurrent cause of the injuries, and one which presents triable issues of fact for which summary judgment is not appropriate. [Citation.] Fraud may excuse lack of diligence on the part of plaintiff to pursue an action, and thus, the discovery-of-facts rule allows her cause of action to accrue.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In the court\u2019s view, Snow\u2019s factual allegations supported \u201ca cause of action for relief based on fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation of pregnancy rates.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 134.) As for accrual of that cause of action, the court stated: \u201cIt is painfully obvious to us plaintiff could not bring an action for fraudulent concealment of information until she learned of the possibility of any fraudulent concealment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, the plaintiffs awareness that her contraceptive device had failed did not commence the limitations period on her fraud claim; that claim accrued much later, when she first learned that the defendant had misrepresented pregnancy rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>A somewhat analogous question concerning the accrual trigger was presented in <em>Brandon G. v. Gray </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 29 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 330]. The plaintiffs in that case \u201cenrolled their children in the KidStop daycare facility in Sonoma County,\u201d after a county agency told them that it \u201cwas licensed, no complaints had been made about it, and it appeared to be a good daycare facility.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 32.) In June 1993, they learned that at least one of their children had been sexually molested there. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The following month, the plaintiffs read a newspaper article \u201cthat mentioned that two minor complaints had been made about KidStop.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 33.) They hired two attorneys in succession to represent them against the county. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 32-33.) The second attorney, Gray, filed a claim against the county on the plaintiffs\u2019 behalf, but it was untimely. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 33.) The plaintiffs then instituted a legal malpractice action. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The accrual date of their claim against the county was crucial to the second attorney\u2019s liability. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 35.) The plaintiffs argued for accrual in July 1993, when they \u201cfirst learned that, contrary to the representations of the county, complaints had been filed against KidStop.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 34.) The attorney argued for accrual the prior month, when the plaintiffs \u201clearned that at least one child had been molested.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 35.) The court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201cwere based on the County\u2019s misrepresentation, and therefore did not accrue until plaintiffs were on notice that the County had made a misrepresentation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 36.) Knowledge of the molestation did not provide notice of the county\u2019s misrepresentations; reading the news accounts did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\">To sum up, as <em>Fox </em>teaches, claims based on two independent legal theories against two separate defendants can accrue at different times. <em>(Fox, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at pp. 802-803.) And as <em>Snow </em>recognizes, a second, independent claim against a single defendant based on fraud or concealment can have a later accrual date. <em>(Snow </em>v. <em>A. H. Robins Co., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at p. 134.) In <em>Snow, </em>the accrual trigger for the plaintiff\u2019s fraud claim was her discovery of the defendant\u2019s deception concerning pregnancy rates, not her earlier knowledge that her contraceptive device had failed, harming her. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Likewise, in <em>Brandon G., </em>the critical event for accrual was the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery of the county\u2019s misrepresentations about the daycare facility, not their earlier knowledge that their child had been molested there. <em>(Brandon G. v. Gray, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.4th at p. 36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">Applying the foregoing legal authority, we conclude that the accrual trigger in this case was plaintiff\u2019s discovery that defendant had misrepresented Hunt\u2019s record and qualifications, not any earlier notice of Hunt\u2019s fraud. The limitations period thus commenced in November 2003, when the police reported Hunt\u2019s criminal record, which first put plaintiff on notice of defendant\u2019s independent wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>Since plaintiff filed this action in August 2005, and since both parties agree that the shortest limitations period is two years, the action is not barred, provided only that plaintiff has met the pleading requirements imposed by the discovery rule. We turn to that issue now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">2. <em>Adequacy of Plaintiff\u2019s Pleading</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">As noted above, a plaintiff invoking \u201cthe discovery rule must specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and manner of discovery <em>and </em>(2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence. The burden is on the plaintiff to show diligence, and conclusory allegations will not withstand demurrer.\u201d <em>(McKelvey v. Boeing North American, Inc., supra, </em>74 Cal.App.4th 151, 160; accord, <em>Fox, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 815.) We consider each of those two requirements in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">a. <em>Time and Manner of Discovery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">The first prong requires plaintiffs to allege \u201cfacts showing the time and surrounding circumstances of the discovery of the cause of action upon which they rely.\u201d <em>(Bennett </em>v. <em>Hibernia Bank, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d at p. 563.) \u201cThe purpose of this requirement is to afford the court a means of determining whether or not the discovery of the asserted invasion was made within the time alleged, that is, whether plaintiffs actually learned something they did not know before.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">Here, plaintiff alleges that it \u201cdid not become aware of, nor did it have any reason to suspect, that Vickie Hunt had prior convictions for theft and welfare fraud and that her academic credentials had not been verified until after her embezzlement became known in November 2003 when Plaintiff was first informed of Vickie Hunt\u2019s criminal record by the police. It was at that time that Plaintiff first became aware that Vickie Hunt had not been \u2018screened\u2019 by [defendant] and that [defendant\u2019s] representations as to her background were false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">Given the specificity of the foregoing allegations, we conclude that the factual circumstances of plaintiff\u2019s discovery of defendant\u2019s wrongdoing are sufficiently asserted to meet this first pleading requirement of the delayed discovery rule. (See <em>Bennett v. Hibernia Bank, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d at pp. 563-564.) That conclusion is bolstered by a comparison with the insufficient pleadings found in other cases. Thus, for example, the pleading here is unlike those in the <em>McKelvey </em>case, which failed to \u201cdisclose the time or manner of discovery by any plaintiff.\u201d <em>(McKelvey v. Boeing North American, Inc., supra, </em>74 Cal.App.4th at p. 160.) As the <em>McKelvey </em>court described the pleadings there, the plaintiffs \u201coffer only conclusory allegations of [defendant\u2019s] \u2018massive cover-up,\u2019 and allegations that plaintiffs discovered that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>\u2018may have sustained injuries\u2019 as a result of [defendant\u2019s] wrongs \u2018less than one year prior to filing the instant action . . . .\u2019 Before that time, they say (without elaboration), they did not suspect any wrongdoing.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 160-161, fn. omitted.) Nor is our case comparable to <em>Unpingco </em>v. <em>Hong Kong Macau Corp. </em>(1991) 935 F.2d 1043. There, \u201cplaintiffs claimed that it was not until 1988 that Segundo Unpingco discovered the facts constituting the fraud.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1045.) But they \u201cfailed to explain what it is that Segundo Unpingco discovered in 1988 that finally put him on notice of the alleged fraud.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1046.) Our case likewise is distinguishable from <em>Mangini v. Aerojet-General Corp. </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1125 [281 Cal.Rptr. 827]. In that case, the court observed, the \u201ccomplaint fails to allege when plaintiffs made the discovery,\u201d or \u201cthe circumstances of the discovery.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">In contrast to the foregoing cases, the pleading here specifically describes both the time and the circumstances of plaintiff\u2019s discovery of its claim against defendant: \u201cin November 2003 when Plaintiff was first informed of Vickie Hunt\u2019s criminal record by the police.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s allegations show that it \u201cactually learned something [it] did not know before.\u201d <em>(Bennett v. Hibernia Bank, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d at p. 563.) Those allegations thus satisfy the first prong of the discovery rule\u2019s pleading requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">b. <em>Inability to Have Made Earlier Discovery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">As to the second pleading requirement, inability to have made an earlier discovery, plaintiff alleges that it had \u201cno reason to suspect that [defendant] did not screen plaintiff and failed to discover she had prior convictions for theft and welfare fraud, or that her academic credentials were misrepresented, or that she was embezzling money as Vickie Hunt appeared to be a competent and honest employee.\u201d Plaintiff also alleges that it relied on defendant\u2019s \u201cexpertise and experience in determining the qualifications and credentials of its accountants. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">As before, we find this averment adequate to meet the pleading requirements of the discovery rule and thus to survive demurrer. (See <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hibernia Bank, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d at pp. 563-564.) The pleading does not suggest any circumstances that should have alerted plaintiff to its injury at defendant\u2019s hands. To the contrary, plaintiff\u2019s reliance on defendant\u2019s expertise would warrant a sense of reassurance, not alarm. (See <em>Moreno </em>v. <em>Sanchez, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 1424.) The lack of any basis for suspicion distinguishes this case from <em>Mangini v. Aerojet-General Corp., supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d 1125. In <em>Mangini, </em>the plaintiffs had actual or constructive knowledge of three key facts: the defendant\u2019s history of potentially hazardous activity on their land; a Justice Department investigation of the defendant\u2019s practices in the area; and the defendant\u2019s request to them for permission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>inspect their property. <em>(Id. </em>at 1152.) The court opined: \u201cWhether any of these three facts in isolation would be sufficient to impart notice is open to dispute. However, the combination of these facts together establishes] as a matter of law that ... in 1984, plaintiffs had sufficient information to put them on notice of the possibility that defendant had dumped hazardous waste on their land.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1152-1153.) Here, as alleged in the complaint, plaintiff possessed no factual basis for suspicion. Nor is defendant assisted by the <em>Saliter </em>case, in which the plaintiff \u201cfailed to state facts showing that discovery could not have been accomplished at an earlier date.\u201d <em>(Saliter v. Pierce Brothers Mortuaries, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.3d 292, 297.) The plaintiff there \u201cwas quickly aware of both defendant\u2019s alleged breach of duty and plaintiff\u2019s resulting injury\u201d but he claimed that \u201chis emotional disturbance kept him from perceiving the causal link between the two.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In the court\u2019s view, that claim provided no justification for delayed discovery. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, the court observed, \u201cthe circumstances of injury are dissimilar from cases in which late discovery has been justified. It is clear from the complaint that neither plaintiff\u2019s injuries nor their cause were latent and imperceptible.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 298.) In this case, by contrast, as alleged in the second amended complaint, both plaintiff\u2019s injury and its cause were imperceptible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">In sum, we conclude, the pleading requirements for the delayed discovery rule are met here. In this case, it does not \u201cclearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint that the action is barred by the statute of limitations\u201d and \u201cthe demurrer should have been overruled on this ground.\u201d <em>(Geneva Towers Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 782, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">Assuming the truth of the facts alleged in plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint, the running of the statute of limitations did not commence until November 2003, when plaintiff first learned from the police that Hunt\u2019s background was not as represented. This action was brought within two years of that discovery. Plaintiff\u2019s claims against defendant thus are not time-barred as a matter of law, and the trial court erred in sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"AiU\">Bamattre-Manoukian, Acting P. J., and Duffy, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1063-11\"> Because this appeal follows a successful demurrer, the facts are drawn from the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint, the operative pleading. (See <em>Gu </em>v. <em>BMW of North America, LLC </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 195, 200 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 617].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1070-9\"> Those allegations are set forth in some detail in the second amended complaint, as follows: Hunt \u201cpurposefully hid her ongoing embezzlement by transferring small sums of money, in irregular amounts, on a monthly basis, from plaintiff\u2019s commercial account at Comerica Bank to accounts at other banks not readily identified as Vickie Hunt\u2019s, and to other commercial accounts and to individuals not readily identified as pertaining to or related to Vickie Hunt.\u201d Hunt further avoided detection \u201cby destroying checks [and] transfer authorizations, removing portions of the bank statements pertaining to the fraudulent transfers, by providing the management of [plaintiff] with erroneous financial information, both oral and written, as to the status of the bank accounts, and by assuring the management of [plaintiff] that the accounts] payable and receivable were accurate, and in accordance with company policy.\u201d Plaintiff thus \u201chad no reason to believe she was embezzling money, to doubt her competence or her representations regarding the finances of the company, or her honesty, due to her work skills <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>and the representations of [defendant].\u201d Hunt\u2019s embezzlement scheme did not come to light until \u201cNovember of 2003 when the company was going to take on a new partner. During the course of the potential partner\u2019s investigation into the finances of [plaintiff], and his attempt to reconcile recent bank transactions, he discovered that Vickie Hunt had removed and destroyed portions of the monthly bank statements the company had received. After obtaining copies of the missing documents from the bank the evidence of Vickie Hunt\u2019s embezzlement was first uncovered.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1071-9\"> We acknowledge the existence of authority questioning the precedential value of <em>Sun \u2019n Sand. </em>(See, e.g., <em>Roy Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1067-1068 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 309]; <em>Mac v. Bank of America </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 562, 565, fn. 1 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 476].)
