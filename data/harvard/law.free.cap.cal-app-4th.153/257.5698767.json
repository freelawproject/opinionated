(M&amp;A), to recover attorney fees. Ersoff asserts the trial court committed multiple errors before, during and after trial and contends the jury\u2019s special verdict is not supported by substantial evidence. Ersoff and his trial counsel also challenge an order imposing monetary sanctions against each of them \u201cjointly and severally\u201d in the amount of $3,500. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">1. <em>The Infomercial Deal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Ersoff managed the careers of Sugar Ray Leonard, the former Olympic boxing gold medalist and world champion, and Billy Blanks, a physical trainer who had developed an exercise program called Tae Bo. In March 1998 Ersoff entered a written agreement with Universal Management Services, Inc. (UMSI), an infomercial production company, and its president, Paul Monea, to create an infomercial marketing Blanks\u2019s Tae Bo program. After Leonard gave Ersoff a videotaped testimonial for the Tae Bo tapes, Ersoff, purportedly on Leonard\u2019s behalf, signed Leonard\u2019s name to a testimonial release authorizing UMSI\u2019s use of the videotape for the infomercial under certain conditions. Under the terms of Ersoff\u2019s own agreement with UMSI, Ersoff would receive five percent of adjusted gross revenue from the Tae Bo infomercial. Within a few days of Ersoff\u2019s execution of the agreement with Monea and UMSI, Leonard notified UMSI that he did not wish the videotaped testimonial or his name to be used in connection with the infomercial.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">2. <em>Ersoff Retains M&amp;A to Prosecute His Claim in the Tae Bo Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Ersoff became concerned UMSI did not intend to honor its agreement to pay him a percentage of the profits generated by the infomercial sales. Accordingly, in August 1998 Ersoff asked M&amp;A and, specifically Garo Mardirossian, the firm\u2019s named partner, to represent him in an action he wished to file against UMSI potentially involving, among other things, breach of contract, fraud and related tort claims. Ersoff, a law school graduate, told Mardirossian that Leonard wished to participate in the action and to sue UMSI for the unauthorized use of his name and likeness and to seek a temporary restraining order enjoining the broadcast of the infomercial. Ersoff suggested to M&amp;A that Leonard\u2019s celebrity status would add value to the action by generating publicity and that a temporary restraining order prohibiting UMSI\u2019s use of Leonard\u2019s name and likeness would help forge a quick settlement, which Ersoff repeatedly informed M&amp;A was his main objective in bringing the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>M&amp;A initially declined to take the case, concerned about a number of things, including the solvency of UMSI and Monea and the difficulty of obtaining any recovery even if Ersoff were to prevail. However, at Ersoff\u2019s repeated insistence, M&amp;A agreed it would represent Ersoff at a 50 percent contingency fee if Mardirossian determined, after meeting with Leonard, that he could fairly represent both Ersoff and Leonard in the action. During a personal meeting with Leonard, Mardirossian advised Leonard that Leonard\u2019s involvement would generate publicity with Ersoff likely being the main beneficiary. Leonard replied he was participating in the action to assist Ersoff, he wished to pursue the action and the temporary restraining order primarily to help Ersoff and further communications to him about the case should be directed to Ersoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In November 1998 Ersoff signed a retainer agreement that provided M&amp;A would take the matter on a contingency fee basis and retain or claim \u201c50% of any and all sums recovered on behalf of Client from any defendant and/or insurance company which may be paid or become due in settlement, or by judgment or otherwise. [][]... If recovery is not obtained, the Attorney will receive no fee.\u201d The retainer agreement further provided, \u201cThe Client hereby grants Attorney a lien upon the cause of action, and upon any document, records, or papers in connection therewith and upon any sum received to the extent of the foregoing fees and costs incurred or advanced. Said lien is based upon the reasonable value of Attorney\u2019s services valued at $400.00 per hour for Garo Mardirossian and $220.00 per hour for other attorneys of [M&amp;A]. Or, Attorney may elect compensation based upon the agreed contingency for any offer to Client to settle the matter prior to the Attorney\u2019s discharge.... In the event Client discharges Attorney and/or chooses to terminate the claim, Client agrees to compensate Attorney pursuant to the hourly fee schedule set forth above for efforts expended by Attorney plus all costs advanced by Attorney on Client\u2019s behalf. If another attorney assumes responsibility for the file thereafter upon discharge, Client agrees to pay Attorney upon settlement or verdict the reasonable value of services performed by [M&amp;A]. Attorney may elect compensation based upon the agreed contingency for any offer to Client received prior to attorney\u2019s discharge.\u201d Both Ersoff and Leonard signed separate documents expressly consenting to M&amp;A\u2019s representation of them notwithstanding any conflicts of interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>3. <em>Ersoff Terminates M&amp;A and Nine Days Later Settles the Tae Bo Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">On April 12, 1999, after M&amp;A had filed a complaint against Monea and UMSI, worked on the case for seven months and prepared for Blanks\u2019s deposition scheduled for April 13, 1999, and for a mediation scheduled for April 21, 1999, Ersoff terminated M&amp;A\u2019s representation and replaced it with the law firm of Wood, Smith, Henning &amp; Berman, where Ersoff\u2019s wife is a partner. At the April 21, 1999 mediation Ersoff received his first settlement offer from Monea and UMSI. Ersoff s case settled that day, with UMSI and Monea agreeing to pay Ersoff $3.7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">4. <em>M&amp;A\u2019s Complaint Against Ersoff for Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">On November 7, 2002 M&amp;A filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court (case No. BC284854);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> its operative first amended complaint asserts a single cause of action for quantum meruit seeking at least 50 percent of the $3.7 million settlement amount.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">5. <em>The Bifurcated Trial: Phase One</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">In February 2004 the trial court granted Ersoff s motion to bifurcate two issues to be decided by the court prior to a jury trial: (1) whether the retainer agreement provided that the reasonable value of M&amp;A\u2019s services in the event of a discharge prior to the receipt of a settlement offer was to be measured solely by multiplying the hours the firm spent on the case by the hourly billing rates of the attorneys who worked on the case ($400 for Mardirossian and $220 for his associates) and (2) whether an actual conflict of interest existed between Ersoff and Leonard as to which Ersoff could not, as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>of law, give his informed consent; and if so, whether M&amp;A\u2019s simultaneous representation of both Ersoff and Leonard in the underlying action against UMSI and Monea violated rule 3-310 of the California Rules of Professional Conduct (rule 3-310) and required forfeiture of any right to attorney fees as a matter of law. (See, e.g., <em>Huskinson &amp; Brown </em>v. <em>Wolf </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 453, 463 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 693, 84 P.3d 379] [when attorney violates rules of professional conduct by engaging in simultaneous and conflicting representation without obtaining sufficient informed consent, quantum meruit recovery to collect fees may be prohibited under certain circumstances]; <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Lees </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 614, 618 [120 Cal.Rptr. 253] [quantum meruit recovery found inappropriate when former corporate counsel labored under a conflict of interest in representing a minority shareholder and director of his former client in a proxy battle in violation of predecessor rule to rule 3-310].)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Following the presentation of testimony and other evidence on the bifurcated issues, the trial court ruled the retainer agreement was unambiguous: When, as here, there had been no settlement offer prior to its discharge, the agreement contemplated M&amp;A would receive the reasonable value of its services as measured by multiplying a reasonable number of hours spent on the case by the attorneys\u2019 hourly rates. The court further ruled it was for the jury, as the finder of fact, to determine in the next phase of the proceeding the number of hours Mardirossian and his associates actually worked on the matter and whether that number of hours was reasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The trial court rejected Ersoff\u2019s contention that, by simultaneously representing both Ersoff and Leonard in the underlying litigation against UMSI and Monea, M&amp;A had violated rule 3-310 and thus forfeited its right to attorney fees as a matter of law. The court concluded there existed, at most, a potential conflict of interest between Ersoff\u2019s and Leonard\u2019s interests in the litigation and the consent form Ersoff had executed was sufficient and valid for the potential conflict that existed during the relevant period. The court further found no prejudice to Ersoff as a result of the dual representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">6. <em>Ersoffs Motion to Dismiss M&amp;A\u2019s Complaint and the Court\u2019s Imposition of Sanctions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">After the first phase of the trial had been completed, the court set an April 28, 2004 trial date for phase two. Ersoff sought and successfully obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>several continuances of the trial date. On July 7, 2004, days before the trial was scheduled to begin, Ersoff sought and obtained an additional continuance to November 3, 2004, based on representations by his counsel, the law firm of Riley &amp; Reiner, that it had a scheduling conflict. M&amp;A did not oppose the request. Immediately after the hearing, Ersoff hand-served M&amp;A with a \u201cmotion to dismiss the complaint\u201d on the ground M&amp;A was not a corporation at the time it filed its action and thus lacked \u201cstanding to prosecute or defend\u201d the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">One week later, on July 14, 2004, Ersoff replaced his trial counsel, Riley &amp; Reiner, with Philip Levy, whom Riley &amp; Reiner had associated in as counsel on January 27, 2004. M&amp;A opposed the motion to dismiss and requested sanctions against Ersoff and Levy in the amount of $7,000 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.6, arguing the motion to dismiss was frivolous, designed to harass and delay the trial and omitted pertinent case authority. M&amp;A also argued the continuance that immediately preceded the motion had been obtained under false pretenses and in violation of the local rules of the superior court. The trial court denied Ersoff<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> s motion to dismiss and imposed sanctions against Ersoff and Levy \u201cjointly and severally\u201d in the amount of $3,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">7. <em>The Trial: Phase Two</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">a. <em>Ersoff s motions in limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Ersoff moved in limine pursuant to Evidence Code sections 350 and 352 to exclude testimony by M&amp;A attorneys as to the number of hours each of them had worked on Ersoff\u2019s case. Citing Mardirossian\u2019s deposition testimony that, as contingency fee lawyers, neither he nor his associates kept any time records memorializing the time spent on each case, Ersoff argued the testimony was \u201cincompetent and insufficient,\u201d M&amp;A\u2019s estimates were false and absurd and admission of the testimony would be unduly burdensome, requiring a minitrial as to the amount of work claimed to have been accomplished by each M&amp;A attorney. M&amp;A opposed the motion, arguing each attorney that would testify had personal knowledge of the time he or she had spent on the case and could fairly estimate the number of hours each had worked. The court denied the in limine motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Ersoff also moved in limine to exclude testimony by M&amp;A\u2019s expert witness, contingency fee attorney Dana Hobart, on the ground that, absent any billing records, M&amp;A\u2019s time estimates were too speculative to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Hobart a basis to opine on whether those estimates were reasonable. He also argued the expert testimony would not assist the trier of fact, as required for admissibility under Evidence Code section 801. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The trial court granted in part and denied in part ErsofFs motion in limine to exclude evidence of the settlement amount in ErsofFs case against Monea and UMSI, permitting evidence of the settlement amount to be disclosed to the jury only to the extent Hobart relied on it in forming his opinion whether the hours M&amp;A had spent on the case were reasonable. Evidence of the amount of M&amp;A\u2019s prior arbitration award was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">b. <em>The trial testimony of M&amp;A\u2019s attorneys</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">At trial Mardirossian and three of his associates during the relevant period, Joseph Barrett, Donald Conway and Kathy Mardirossian, testified that, as contingency fee attorneys, they kept no time sheets but could recall the number of hours they worked in total during the relevant period and could fairly estimate the percentage of their work time spent on ErsofFs case. Each testified as to the work he or she specifically accomplished for Ersoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Barrett testified that, between August 1998 and April 11, 1999, ErsofFs case was the major matter in the office and Barrett\u2019s primary case for that time period. He met or spoke with Ersoff almost daily and explained there were a number of difficult issues in the case that he had to research and resolve including UMSI\u2019s rescission claims based on allegations of ErsofFs fraud, UMSI\u2019s solvency, receivership issues and difficulty tracking sales from the infomercial. He testified he worked 60 hours per week for Mardirossian during the period August 1998 to April 11, 1999, and estimated 60 percent of that time was spent on Ersoff\u2019s case. He also testified that, in late April 1999, he began preparing a written summary of the work he had performed on the case at the request of ErsofFs new firm, but stopped when it appeared an agreement had been reached. The 13-page summary, which details, week by week, the work Barrett states he performed for Ersoff (but does not include a reference to the hours spent), was admitted into evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Conway explained the Ersoff case was also the primary matter that occupied his time from September 1998 until the middle of April 1999 and that he and Barrett worked closely together on every matter in the case. He, like Barrett, was personally involved in drafting or assisting on every one of the pleadings and the unsuccessful attempt to obtain a temporary restraining order against UMSI. Conway also testified at length as to the receivership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>issues he worked on with associated counsel and explained that additional work was required when it came to light that Ersoff had made representations to UMSI that he did not disclose to M&amp;A until well into the litigation. According to Conway\u2019s estimates, he worked 50 to 60 hours a week from August 1998 to April 11, 1999, and spent two-thirds of that time working on Ersoff\u2019s case in 1998 and one-half of that time working on Ersoff\u2019s case in 1999, for a total of approximately 1,020 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Kathy Mardirossian testified she worked five to six hours a week for approximately 40 weeks participating in every meeting and strategy session and assisting in drafting pleadings and discovery in the action. She explained this was a conservative estimate and that she took pains to review the file and to discuss the work she performed on the case with the other associates and with Mardirossian to ensure there was no duplication of effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Garo Mardirossian testified he worked 60 hours a week from August 1998 to April 11, 1999, and spent approximately 50 percent of that time on Ersoff5 s case in various capacities, less the four weeks he worked exclusively on another trial. He explained he participated in every meeting, met with Ersoff and his associates and reviewed every pleading and all correspondence that was drafted in regard to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">c. <em>Expert testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Expert testimony as to whether the number of hours claimed by M&amp;A was reasonable was also presented by both M&amp;A and Ersoff. Testifying as an expert for M&amp;A, Hobart explained, based on his review of the files in the underlying case, as well as all of the pleadings and deposition testimony in the instant case and the multimillion dollar settlement amount, it was reasonable for M&amp;A to have worked approximately 3,700 hours on the matter. He explained that, because contingency fee lawyers\u2019 fees depend on the outcome, they often spend many more hours than an hourly attorney would on a case, unconcerned about the mounting hours because the client will not be billed. He also explained the number of hours cannot be determined solely from looking at the tangible work product in the file, such as the pleadings and discovery. In light of the $3.7 million settlement, achieved just days after M&amp;A was substituted out of the case, with little or no additional work accomplished by the firm that substituted in for M&amp;A and the complexity and number of issues involved in the case, Hobart opined that it was not unreasonable for M&amp;A to have put in 3,700 hours worth of work leading up to the eventual settlement in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Alan Jay Weil, an attorney who does not take cases on contingency, testified as an expert for Ersoff. Weil opined that it was preposterous for any firm to have spent 3,700 hours on this case. Based upon the work product in the file in the underlying case, Weil opined that, at most, a reasonable attorney would have spent no more than 200 hours preparing the case from August 1998 to April 11, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">d. <em>The jury\u2019s verdict and entry of judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In its special verdict the jury found M&amp;A had reasonably spent 2,392 hours on Ersoff\u2019s case: Mardirossian had reasonably spent 540 hours on Ersoff\u2019s case and M&amp;A associates Conway, Barrett and Kathy Mardirossian had reasonably spent 960 hours, 890 hours and 102 hours, respectively. In accordance with the court\u2019s instructions to multiply the hours by each attorney\u2019s hourly rate, the jury awarded M&amp;A $645,440. Following the jury\u2019s verdict, the court ordered statutory prejudgment interest be added to the verdict amount from the date the complaint had been filed (November 7, 2002) until the date the amount is paid. Judgment was entered on April 6, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Ersoff contends (1) the trial court erred in denying his motions in limine to exclude evidence of the number of hours the M&amp;A attorneys worked on Ersoff\u2019s case and expert testimony as to whether the claimed hours were reasonable; (2) there is no substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict; (3) prejudgment interest is improper in a quantum meruit action; (4) the jury instructions and special verdict forms were erroneous and resulted in a miscarriage of justice; (5) the court erred in denying Ersoff s motion to dismiss M&amp;A\u2019s action for lack of standing; and (6) the court erred in imposing monetary sanctions against him. Ersoff\u2019s counsel, Philip Levy, also challenges the sanctions order against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">1. <em>The Court Did Not Err in Denying Ersoff\u2019s Motions in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"AB\">a. <em>Governing law and standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">\u201c \u2018The usual purpose of motions <em>in limine </em>is to preclude the presentation of evidence deemed inadmissible and prejudicial by the moving party.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kelly v. New West Federal Savings </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659, 669 [56 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 803] <em>(Kelly).) </em>Although in limine motions are typically brought at the beginning of trial, they may also be brought during trial when evidentiary issues are anticipated by the parties. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As rulings on the admissibility of evidence, they are subject to review on appeal for abuse of discretion. <em>(People v. Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 203 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365] [\u201cappellate court reviews any ruling by a trial court as to the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion\u201d]; <em>KB Home v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1083 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 587].)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">b. <em>The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ersoff\u2019s motion in limine to prohibit M&amp;A attorneys from testifying as to the hours they spent on Ersoff\u2019s case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Ersoff contends that, because none of the attorneys kept contemporaneous time records, evidence of their time \u201cestimates\u201d was without foundational support and should have been excluded. Contrary to Ersoff5 s contention, there is no legal requirement that an attorney supply billing statements to support a claim for attorney fees. As this court has held, \u201cAn attorney\u2019s testimony as to the number of hours worked is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records.\u201d <em>(Steiny &amp; Co. v. California Electric Supply Co. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285, 293 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 920]; see also <em>Martino v. Denevi </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559 [227 Cal.Rptr. 354] <em>(Martino) </em>[same].) Of course, the attorney\u2019s testimony must be based on the attorney\u2019s personal knowledge of the time spent and fees incurred. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 702, subd. (a) [\u201cthe testimony of a witness concerning a particular matter is inadmissible unless he has personal knowledge of the matter\u201d].) Still, precise calculations are not required; fair approximations based on personal knowledge will suffice: \u201c[T]he general rule [is] that while a plaintiff must show with reasonable certainty that he has suffered damages by reason of the wrongful act of defendant, once the cause and existence of damages have been so established, recovery will not be denied because the damages are difficult of ascertainment.\u201d <em>(Stott </em>v. <em>Johnston </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 864, 875 [229 P.2d 348]; see <em>ibid. </em>[proof of lost profits need not be exact but may be estimated based on past volume of business and other provable data relevant to the probable future sales]; see also <em>GHK Associates v.

[Citations.] The law requires only that some reasonable basis of computation of damages be used, and the damages may be computed even if the result reached is an approximation\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Although none of M&amp;A\u2019s contingency fee lawyers kept billing records, each planned to testify that he or she could recall the amount of time spent in total on Ersoff\u2019s case, albeit not the amount of time spent preparing each piece of correspondence, discovery or pleading. Citing <em>Ajaxo Inc. v. E*Trade Group Inc. </em>(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 21, 64-65 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 221] <em>(Ajaxo) </em>and <em>Martino, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.3d 553, Ersoff insists the trial court should have excluded this testimony as legally \u201cinsufficient\u201d to recover fees. Both cases are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In <em>Ajaxo </em>the prevailing party (Ajaxo) in a breach of contract action sought to recover attorney fees paid to his former counsel prior to trial pursuant to Civil Code section 1717. Ajaxo submitted declarations from its current counsel detailing its work on the case but no evidence from Ajaxo\u2019s former attorneys as to the work they had accomplished for Ajaxo: No declarations, \u201c \u2018no billing records, nothing to support why [the court] should award in excess of $177,000 to these attorneys,\u2019 \u201d who, according to the declarations provided by Ajaxo\u2019s current counsel, did not even correctly prepare the case for trial. <em>(Ajaxo, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 65.) Considering the absence of any evidence presented by Ajaxo\u2019s former counsel, the trial court\u2019s conclusion there was no evidence to support Ajaxo\u2019s request for pretrial attorney fees paid to its former counsel was well within its discretion. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><em>Martino </em>is likewise distinguishable. In <em>Martino, </em>a case involving the dissolution of a partnership, an accounting and damages, the trial court awarded $40,000 in attorney fees to the prevailing party based solely on the attorney\u2019s request for a \u201cflat fee for \u2018services rendered.\u2019 No documents, such as billing or time records, were submitted to the court, nor was an[y] attempt made to explain, in more than general terms, the extent of services rendered to the client.\" <em>(Martino, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.3d at pp. 559-560.) The Court of Appeal reversed the attorney fee award. Acknowledging that \u201c[i]n California, an attorney need not submit contemporaneous time records in order to recover fees\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 559), the court concluded the evidence presented\u2014a mere request for a flat fee for services rendered\u2014was insufficient to support an award. Further hindering the court\u2019s review of the award was the trial court\u2019s failure to explain the basis for its decision. The case was remanded for a rehearing of the attorney fee issue. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Unlike in <em>Ajaxo, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th 21 and <em>Martino, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.3d 553, each attorney in the instant case had personal knowledge of the legal services he or she had performed for Ersoff. Notwithstanding the absence of billing records, each testified at length concerning the work he or she performed, the complexity of the issues and the extent of the work that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>was required. There was nothing presented in the motions in limine to suggest to the trial court that such testimony, plainly relevant (see <em>Glendora Community Redevelopment Agency v. Demeter </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 465, 470-471, 478 [202 Cal.Rptr. 389]; <em>Martino, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.3d 553; <em>Ajaxo, </em>at p. 64), should be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Ersoff suggests Mardirossian\u2019s deposition testimony that any reconstruction of the hours spent would not be exact or accurate should have foreclosed M&amp;A from offering its estimates of the number of hours expended. Although Mardirossian did testify he could not recreate time sheets six years after the fact with any precision, he also testified later in his deposition that he and his associates could review the file and use their own personal knowledge of the time worked to provide fair estimates of the hours spent on the case. His deposition testimony is not inconsistent with his trial testimony on that point; but, even if it were, the trial court properly concluded such inconsistency was to be evaluated by the trier of fact. <em>(Kelly, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at p. 673.) As our Division Four colleagues recognized in <em>Kelly, </em>although a party may be precluded from introducing evidence contrary to its response in a request for admission (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2033.410, subd. (a)), deposition testimony does not serve the same purpose as a request for admission, which is aimed primarily \u201cat setting at rest a triable issue so that it will not have to be tried.\u201d <em>(Kelly, </em>at p. 673.) Accordingly, \u201c[i]t is a misuse of a motion <em>in </em>limine\u201d to attempt to compel a witness or a party to conform his or her trial testimony to his or her deposition testimony. Trial testimony may be impeached by inconsistent deposition testimony, but absent an abuse of the discovery process, such testimony should not be precluded. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 672.)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Ersoff also argues that the testimony of the M&amp;A attorneys should have been excluded under Evidence Code section 352 because it would, and did, lead to a virtual minitrial as to each attorney\u2019s assessment of the hours worked. The court determined that such a \u201cmini-trial\u201d was especially appropriate in this case in which a jury was asked to decide the number of hours each attorney spent on the case and whether that number of hours was reasonable. That determination was well within the court\u2019s discretion. (See <em>People v. Rodrigues </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 885 P.2d 1] [trial court\u2019s ruling excluding evidence under Evid. Code, \u00a7 352, reviewed for abuse of discretion, may be reversed only when it is shown the ruling was \u201c \u2018arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd\u2019 \u201d resulting in \u201c \u2018a manifest miscarriage of justice\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 132-133 [211 Cal.Rptr. 356, 695 P.2d 653].)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>c. <em>The court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ersoff s motion to exclude expert testimony on the reasonableness of the hours expended</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Ersoff also contends the court erred in denying his motion in limine to exclude Hobart\u2019s expert testimony that the number of hours M&amp;A claimed to have spent on the case was reasonable. He asserts Hobart\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because it was grounded in speculative testimony about the hours worked and did not assist the jury in its fact finding process. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. (a) [expert testimony authorized when subject is sufficiently beyond common experience that opinion of expert would assist trier of fact]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McAlpin </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1289, 1299 [283 Cal.Rptr. 382, 812 P.2d 563].)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">It is well settled that a contingency fee lawyer discharged prior to settlement may recover in quantum meruit for the reasonable value of services rendered up to the time of discharge. <em>(Fracasse v. Brent </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 784, 791 [100 Cal.Rptr. 385, 494 P.2d 9].) \u201cThe most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. This calculation provides an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value of a lawyer\u2019s services. The party seeking an award of fees should submit evidence supporting the hours worked and rates claimed.\u201d <em>(Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 424, 433 [76 L.Ed.2d 40, 103 S.Ct. 1933].) However, providing evidence as to the number of hours worked and rates claimed is not the end of the analysis in such a quantum meruit action. The party seeking fees must also show the total fees incurred were reasonable. Factors relevant to that determination include \u201c[t]he nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure of the attorney\u2019s efforts, the attorney\u2019s skill and learning, including his [or her] age and experience in the particular type of work demanded.\u201d <em>(Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Inyo-Farms Co. </em>(1933) 134 Cal.App. 268, 276 [25 P.2d 224], cited with approval in <em>Fracasse, </em>at p. 791; see also <em>PLCM Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Drexler </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 997 P.2d 511] [citing same factors in considering whether fees to the prevailing party under Civ. Code, \u00a7 1717 were reasonable].) Because evidence and analysis of all these factors can be a \u201cformidable undertaking\u201d <em>(Cazares v. Saenz </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 279, 287-288 [256 Cal.Rptr. 209]), expert testimony in a quantum meruit action for attorney fees is appropriate to assist the fact finder. <em>(Matthiesen v. Smith </em>(1936) 16 Cal.App.2d 479, 481 [60 P.2d 873].)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The trial court\u2019s determination that Hobart\u2019s testimony would assist the trier of fact in this action was, therefore, well within its discretion. <em>(People v. McAlpin, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1299 [trial court\u2019s decision to admit expert testimony \u201c \u2018will not be disturbed on appeal unless a manifest abuse of discretion is shown\u2019 \u201d].) Hobart opined on the inherent differences in approach between contingency fee lawyers and hourly lawyers. He explained (contrary to the testimony provided by Ersoff\u2019s expert) the case involved much more work than the work product reflected in the file, provided some insight as to the complexity of the issues involved and concluded, based on his review of the file in the underlying case and in this case that, in light of the value of the settlement and the handful of hours that had elapsed between M&amp;A\u2019s termination and the settlement of the case, 3,700 hours<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was unquestionably reasonable. Hobart\u2019s testimony was plainly relevant and likely to assist the jury in evaluating all the factors related to the issue of reasonableness. Ersoff\u2019s objection to it, both here and in the trial court, and his contention Hobart\u2019s conclusions are \u201cpreposterous\u201d and unbelievable when compared to Weil\u2019s testimony that the total case should have taken only 200 hours, relate to Hobart\u2019s credibility as an expert and the appropriate weight to be given to the opinion he provided, matters properly resolved by the jury, not an appellate court. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 1244, 1265 [226 Cal.Rptr. 306] [\u201ccredibility of expert witnesses is a matter for the jury . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">2. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Jury\u2019s Verdict as to the Number of Hours Expended</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Although Ersoff frames his argument on appeal as a challenge to the trial court\u2019s rulings on the motions in limine, his appellate brief cites to testimony actually provided during phase two of the trial. In effect, Ersoff\u2019s challenge to the in limine rulings \u201cis really one of insufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s judgment. As such, it fails since all hours allegedly worked by counsel for which no time records were available were attested to by the attorneys under oath. The problem then becomes one of fact finding\u201d <em>(Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1006-1007 [185 Cal.Rptr. 145] [considering reasonable attorney fee award under private attorney general statute, Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.5]) and accordingly, for this reviewing court, whether the fact finder\u2019s conclusions are supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Although Ersoff suggests the attorneys\u2019 time estimates amounted to nothing more than guesses without any present recollection by the M&amp;A attorneys of the hours spent, the record shows otherwise. Each of the M&amp;A attorneys who worked on Ersoff s case testified in detail as to the work he or she had performed for Ersoff. Although the attorneys explained they could not remember six years after the fact the amount of time spent on each item for which they had labored on Ersoff\u2019s behalf, the attorneys explained they remembered the amount of work accomplished during the period and could provide fair weekly estimates of their time by recalling the percentage of their work week spent on Ersoff\u2019s case. Each provided specific testimony on the work he or she performed individually for Ersoff, discussed the complexity of the issues in a multimillion dollar case and explained the obstacles faced and the hours spent in preparing the matter for trial. Ersoff\u2019s counsel vigorously cross-examined each witness as to the items he or she had worked on and argued to the jury the estimates were inexact and totally disproportionate to the amount of work product created for the case. Expert witnesses on both sides testified concerning the reasonableness of the time spent in light of the nature of the case and the complexity of the issues presented. There was also evidence presented to the jury that the law firm that replaced M&amp;A itself spent a total of 400 to 500 hours in the nine days leading up to the mediation simply to become familiar with the issues in the case\u2014that is, without performing any additional work. The jury found that M&amp;A did spend a great deal of time on the case\u20142,392 hours\u2014albeit far less (less than two-thirds) than the approximately 3,800 hours testified to by the M&amp;A attorneys. Based on the testimony at trial, the jury\u2019s verdict is amply supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>3. <em>Neither the Challenged Jury Instruction Nor the Special Verdict Was Improper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">a. <em>The challenged jury instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The jury was instructed, \u201cThe plaintiff law firm was not required to maintain time records, nor to bill the client monthly or at all for the legal services rendered to defendant Seth Ersoff.\u201d Ersoff contends, even if evidence of billing records is not required to support a claim for attorney fees, Business and Professions Code section 6148, subdivision (b), mandates they be maintained. He insists the instruction suggesting otherwise was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">As Ersoff contends, Business and Professions Code section 6148, subdivision (b), provides, \u201cAll bills rendered by an attorney to a client shall clearly state the basis thereof. Bills for the fee portion of the bill shall include the amount, rate, basis for calculation, or other method of determination of the attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d However, subdivision (a) of section 6148, which Ersoff fails to cite, states its provisions do not apply to any case coming within Business and Professions Code section 6147, pertaining to contingency fee agreements. Section 6147, in turn, requires a statement of the contingency fee rate, but does not require contingency fee lawyers to maintain billing records.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, Ersoff s argument omits reference to subdivision (c) of section 6148, which makes clear that, even when the section applies and has been violated, an attorney is still \u201centitled to collect a reasonable fee.\u201d (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6148, subds. (b), (c); see also <em>Flannery v.

Nor, in light of M&amp;A\u2019s entitlement to \u201ca reasonable fee\u201d notwithstanding any violation of Business and Professions Code section 6148, subdivision (a) (see Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6148, subd.

He did not challenge the special verdict form for omitting the period M&amp;A represented him nor did he include in his own proposed special verdict form the temporal inquiry he now says was unfairly omitted. Because Ersoff did not challenge the special verdict form on this ground below, we do not consider it for the first time on appeal.

According to Ersoff, a conflict existed at the inception of the dual representation because Ersoff had signed Leonard\u2019s name to the testimonial release authorizing UMSI\u2019s use of Leonard\u2019s testimonial for the infomercial, but Ersoff and Leonard apparently claimed in the litigation that Ersoff did not have the authority to sign Leonard\u2019s name. Also, Leonard sought (albeit unsuccessfully) a temporary restraining order that, if granted, would have interfered with Ersoff\u2019s interest in having the infomercial broadcast. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>result of these \u201cegregious conflicts\u201d and the failure to obtain sufficient informed consent, Ersoff argues the trial court erred in ruling M&amp;A had not forfeited its right to recover attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In certain circumstances, a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct may result in a forfeiture of an attorney\u2019s right to fees.

Although the breach of a rule of professional conduct may warrant a forfeiture of fees, forfeiture is not automatic but depends on the egregiousness of the violation. <em>(Pringle v.

It concluded the written consent informing Ersoff a conflict might exist, in which Ersoff expressly acknowledged the opportunity to consult outside counsel concerning the issue, was sufficient to comply with rule 3-310. In any event, the court ruled, any violation of rule 3-310 was not sufficiently egregious under the circumstance to justify a total forfeiture of fees. The court rejected Ersoff\u2019s analysis, namely, that as the person who signed Leonard\u2019s name to the release, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>existed at the inception of the litigation an actual conflict of interest between Leonard and Ersoff, finding Ersoff had withheld this information from his attorney. The court explained, \u201cIf I were to excuse the requirement that Mr. Ersoff pay, I would be rewarding Mr. Ersoff for hiding conflicting information from his attorney. And it would be, I believe, a bizarre result.\u201d The court further concluded that, in light of M&amp;A\u2019s work on Ersoff s behalf up until the mediation, \u201cthere would be an unjust enrichment of Mr. Ersoff if I would excuse the payment of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Ersoff does not challenge these factual findings on substantial evidence grounds. Instead, he asserts that rule 3-310 was violated because, even if the conflict were potential rather than actual, the written consent did not detail the conflicts at issue. As a result, he asserts, the consent is inadequate and M&amp;A should be denied any fees. Yet, the adequacy of the written disclosure and consent is not dispositive. As the court observed, even if rule 3-310 were violated in this instance, Ersoff has not shown the violation was particularly egregious or that he was in any way prejudiced by it. Under the circumstances, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in concluding it would be inequitable and an \u201can unjust enrichment\u201d if Ersoff s attorney fee obligation were to be excused.

The arbitrator awarded M&amp;A $1.5 million, which the trial court confirmed. On October 30, 2001, Division One of this court concluded the arbitration award must be vacated because Ersoff had not been properly advised of his right to nonbinding arbitration of attorney fee disputes in accordance with Business and Professions Code section 6201. (See <em>Ersoff </em>v. <em>Mardirossian &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>(Oct. 30, 2001, B142063) [nonpub. opn.].) In accordance with the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, the trial court vacated the arbitration award in February 2002. Thereafter, Ersoff notified M&amp;A of his intent to waive his right to arbitration and to litigate the dispute in the superior court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b207-12\"> On November 12, 2002, Ersoff filed his own action for breach of fiduciary duty and declaratory relief <em>(Ersoff v. Mardirossian, Inc. </em>(Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2005, No. BC284993)). Initially, the two cases were consolidated. However, only M&amp;A\u2019s quantum meruit action against Ersoff was submitted to the jury. The judgment from which Ersoff appeals pertains only to that case and not to Ersoff1 *s claims against M&amp;A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\"> M&amp;A has filed a protective cross-appeal, to be considered solely in the event the judgment is reversed, arguing the trial court erred in interpreting the retainer agreement to require the reasonable value of services to be measured solely by the number of hours each attorney worked on the case multiplied by that attorney\u2019s hourly billing rate. M&amp;A asserts that, under the express terms of the retainer agreement, M&amp;A is entitled to the \u201creasonable value of services,\u201d in which the number of hours worked is but one factor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\"> Although the estimates of the M&amp;A attorneys totaled approximately 3,800 hours, 3,700 hours was the number assumed by Hobart in reaching his conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\"> In resolving challenges to- a verdict based on sufficiency of the evidence, we review the record as a whole, resolving all conflicts and indulging all legitimate and reasonable inferences in favor of the prevailing part, to determine whether substantial evidence supports the verdict. <em>(Western States Petroleum Assn. v.

However, as we explained, there was admissible evidence to establish the fact of damage. The only question for the jury, and one not properly resolved in a motion for nonsuit or a directed verdict, related to the <em>amount </em>of damage. Because Ersoff5 s motion for a nonsuit was without merit, it was properly denied. <em>(Elmore v.
