In the published portion of this opinion, we affirm the juvenile court\u2019s order disqualifying CLC Unit 1 from representing four of the siblings because the record contains substantial evidence of an actual conflict among those four siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">The Center is a publicly funded, nonprofit law office that represents parties in the Los Angeles County Juvenile Dependency Court when legal services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>are required under Welfare and Institutions Code section 317.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Center formerly was called Dependency Court Legal Services. Pursuant to two agreements, first with the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and now with the Administrative Office of the Courts, the Center has been structured with three separate units, designated CLC Units 1, 2, and 3, to permit the Center to provide legal representation to multiple children in the same dependency proceeding, even if the children have conflicting interests.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">This case involves five children (collectively children), who lived with their mother (mother) and Nah. H. (Nah.). The children have three different fathers. Joshua E. and Justin E., aged seven and four respectively, are the children of Joshua E., Sr.; three-year-old Zamer G. is the child of Zack G.; Naes. H. (Naes.) and Nay. H. (Nay.), aged one and four months respectively, are the children of Nah.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">On June 23, 2006, the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) responded to a report of child abuse at a motel room and found that Zamer had suffered a fractured right femur falling in the bathtub. Zamer was transported to the hospital. When interviewed, Zamer said he was pushed, although he did not say by whom; he later told a DCFS social worker that Nah. \u201chit him and he went into the tub.\u201d Nah. stated that he had been giving Zamer and Justin a bath, and that he had taken Justin out of the bath and into another room when Zamer fell and injured himself trying to get out of the tub. Justin, however, told a DCFS social worker that he was in the bathroom when Zamer fell. The physicians who examined Zamer opined that his injuries were not consistent with the explanation given by Nah., and stated that Zamer also exhibited bruising that \u201cdid not look new\u201d and that had occurred prior to Zamer\u2019s fall. The physicians could not determine, however, whether the injuries were accidental or caused by abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">DCFS detained all of the children. On June 28, 2006, DCFS filed a petition pursuant to section 300 with respect to all five children. The petition alleged, in essence, that Zamer had been hospitalized due to physical abuse by mother and by Nah., and that all of the children were at risk of severe harm. Prior to the detention hearing, DCFS filed an addendum report recommending no reunification services for either mother or Nah. The report recounted a social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>worker\u2019s interview with Justin, in which Justin said that his \u201cdaddy\u201d (presumably referring to Nah.) had \u201cwhopped [his] brother\u201d (presumably Zamer) with a rolled towel because Zamer had \u201cpeed on himself.\u201d Justin further stated that he, too, had been hit, and that he had seen \u201chis father\u201d hit his siblings and his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">At the detention hearing on June 28, the juvenile court stated its intention to appoint Archana Gupta of CLC Unit 2 to represent all five of the children. Gupta responded, \u201cThis is a detention. I\u2019m available to take Zamer. I believe Mr. Feldman [of CLC Unit 1] is taking the other children.\u201d The juvenile court appointed Gupta of CLC Unit 2 to represent Zamer only, and appointed Kevin Feldman of CLC Unit 1 to represent Joshua, Justin, Naes. and Nay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Of the children\u2019s three fathers, only Nah. attended the detention hearing. He requested and was granted presumed-father status with respect to Naes. and Nay. DCFS did not then know the whereabouts of Joshua E., Sr., the father of Joshua and Justin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Zamer\u2019s father, Zack G., was incarcerated in state prison. Mother requested that the children be placed with her sister; Nah. requested that his children, Naes. and Nay., be placed with his mother. Feldman requested that all five children be kept together. The juvenile court ordered DCFS to evaluate the homes of mother\u2019s sister and of Nah.\u2019s mother, and whether it would be possible to keep the children together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Prior to the pretrial resolution conference (PRC) on July 27, Joshua was placed in a foster home; Justin, Naes. and Nay. were placed together in another foster home; Zamer remained hospitalized. DCFS submitted a report setting forth witness statements to substantiate the allegations in the petition. Joshua and Justin both stated that Nah. had struck both of them and Zamer. Justin also stated, \u201cHe don\u2019t sock [Naes.] because she\u2019s a baby, but he pops her real hard.\u201d DCFS recommended that no family reunification services be provided to Nah., but reported that mother could benefit from such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">At the PRC, Gupta, Zamer\u2019s CLC Unit 2 attorney, requested an evaluation of Zamer\u2019s paternal grandmother for potential placement for Zamer only. The juvenile court granted Gupta\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">DCFS filed an amended petition on August 25. The amended petition alleged that mother and Nah. had physically abused Joshua and Justin in addition to abusing Zamer. There were no allegations that Naes. or Nay. had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>been abused. Prior to the PRC on the amended petition, DCFS reported that, although Zamer\u2019s grandmother was not yet approved for placement, she was willing to care for Zamer when he was released from the hospital. Joshua\u2019s foster parent was not willing to accept Zamer; the foster parent for Justin, Naes. and Nay. was willing to accept Joshua, but had not been consulted about accepting Zamer. DCFS further reported that it could \u201cnot make a definitive conclusion regarding the child Zamer\u2019s injuries,\u201d but believed \u201cit is likely that father [Nah.] . . . cause <em>[sic] </em>the injuries to this child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">At the PRC, the juvenile court ordered DCFS to place Zamer either with his siblings or with his paternal grandmother. The juvenile court set a contested hearing on the amended petition for September 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">On September 26, DCFS submitted a packet of \u201clast-minute information\u201d to the juvenile court. Among the documents submitted was a report from Dr. Karen Imagawa of Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, stating that Zamer had described incidents of physical abuse inflicted on him by a person called \u201c12.\u201d Joshua and Justin identified \u201c12\u201d as Nah.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">Prior to the September 26 hearing, both Joshua and Zamer were placed in the same foster home at which their siblings had been placed. Joshua, however, was subsequently removed due to behavioral problems and returned to his prior placement. At the September 26 hearing, the juvenile court learned that Joshua E., Sr. (the father of Joshua and Justin) had been released from prison but had not received notice of the hearing. The court therefore continued the contested hearing on the petition to November 1, and ordered that notice be given to Joshua E., Sr. Feldman (the CLC Unit 1 attorney for all the children except Zamer) raised the issue of Joshua\u2019s removal from the foster home, and requested that DCFS continue to seek a placement where all five children could be together. The juvenile court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether or not there\u2019s a conflict because\u2014what if they like living where they are and they don\u2019t want to get moved?\u201d The juvenile court nevertheless ordered DCFS to \u201cexplore placing all children together and whether be [szc] in the best interest.\u201d The juvenile court did not raise the issue of disqualification, nor did any of the attorneys or parties object to the Center\u2019s continued involvement in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">The matter was called for the contested hearing on November 1. Marc Leftwich, the unit head of CLC Unit 2, appeared with Gupta as cocounsel for Zamer. CLC Unit 1 attorney, Feldman, appeared for the other children. Joshua E., Sr., the father of Joshua and Justin, had received notice of the hearing and was present. Panel Attorney Katie Baca announced that she was \u201cseeking appointment on behalf of\u2019 Joshua E., Sr. The juvenile court told her, \u201cYou\u2019re appointed to represent [Joshua E., Sr.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>Although no motion or order to show cause had been made for the Center\u2019s disqualification, Feldman began the hearing by stating, \u201cI know this court intends to remove us [the Center] ... as counsel for the minors. I just want to state for the record that CLC objects that there\u2019s any actual or structural conflict and that if, your honor, wants to seek a waiver it is our position that\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The juvenile court interrupted, \u201cI don\u2019t want to seek a waiver. ... It\u2019s not my business or job to resolve the conflict other than to make sure there is no conflict or whatever conflict exists. ... I found that there was a structural conflict problem . . . .\u201d Feldman requested that the juvenile court appoint a guardian ad litem for the minors to explore the possibility of waiving the \u201cstructural\u201d conflict. The juvenile court denied Feldman\u2019s request, stating that appointing a guardian ad litem \u201ccosts taxpayers more money. . . . My decision was not made, frankly\u2014did not consider the fiscal consideration, considered just the structure vis-a-vis <em>Castro </em>[v. <em>Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d 1432] and what <em>Castro </em>required.\u201d (Italics added.) Leftwich (the head of CLC Unit 2) stated, \u201cWe do not believe that there is a conflict, either actual or structural. And we do not believe that a waiver is required in this case or any other case of this nature.\u201d The juvenile court announced, \u201cYour objection is noted. [][] I am going to relieve CLC 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">After disqualifying CLC Unit 1, the juvenile court <em>then </em>asked, \u201cIs there a conflict between the children, is that the basis for this problem?\u201d Feldman responded that there had been a conflict at the outset of the case between Zamer, on the one hand, and his half siblings, on the other, because Zamer had been injured. Counsel for Nah., however, stated her belief that there was a conflict between Joshua and Justin, on the one hand, and Naes. and Nay., on the other hand\u2014that is, among the four children represented by CLC Unit 1\u2014because Joshua and Justin allegedly had been abused by Nah., the father of Naes. and Nay., and presumably would testify against Nah. Feldman, the CLC Unit 1 attorney, volunteered that he had received confidential information from his \u201ctwo verbal clients\u201d (presumably, Joshua and Justin).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">The juvenile court reiterated that CLC Unit 1 was relieved as counsel. Leftwich reiterated that Unit 2 wanted to remain on the case. The juvenile court stated that it would \u201cthink about\u201d whether CLC Unit 2 would be disqualified from representing Zamer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">The juvenile court then reversed its prior decision to appoint Baca to represent Joshua E., Sr. Instead, the juvenile court appointed Baca to represent <em>all four </em>of the children formerly represented by CLC Unit 1, and appointed a new attorney to represent Joshua E., Sr. Prior to issuing its minute order, however, the juvenile court reconsidered its decision yet again. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>The November 1 minute order indicates that the juvenile court disqualified <em>both </em>CLC Unit 1 and CLC Unit 2; that Baca was appointed to represent Joshua and Justin only (even though Baca had been representing Joshua E., Sr., whose interests were adverse to Joshua and Justin);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that another panel attorney was appointed to represent Naes. and Nay. The Center timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">\u201cGenerally, a trial court\u2019s decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. [Citations.] If the trial court resolved disputed factual issues, the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the trial court\u2019s express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence. [Citations.] When substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings, the appellate court reviews the conclusions based on those findings for abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>of discretion. [Citation.] However, the trial court\u2019s discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles. [Citation.] Thus, where there are no material disputed factual issues, the appellate court reviews the trial court\u2019s determination as a question of law. [Citation.] In any event, a disqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Dept. of Corporations v. SpeeDee Oil Change Systems, Inc. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1135, 1143-1144 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 816, 980 P.2d 371] <em>(SpeeDee </em>Oil); see also <em>City and County of San Francisco v. Cobra Solutions, Inc., supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 848.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">B. <em>The Juvenile Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Disqualifying CLC Unit 1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">1. <em>General Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">A minor\u2019s right to appointed counsel in dependency proceedings is guaranteed by section 317. Section 317, subdivision (c) provides, in relevant part, that a child in dependency proceedings is entitled to appointed counsel \u201cunless the court finds that the child would not benefit from the appointment of counsel. ... A primary responsibility of any counsel appointed to represent a child pursuant to this section shall be to advocate for the protection, safety, and physical and emotional well-being of the child. Counsel for the child may be a district attorney, public defender, or other member of the bar, provided that the counsel does not represent another party or county agency whose interests conflict with the child\u2019s interests.\u201d Once appointed, \u201c[c]ounsel shall continue to represent the . . . child unless relieved by the court upon the substitution of other counsel or for cause.\u201d (\u00a7 317, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">In <em>In re Celine R. </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 45 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 432, 71 P.3d 787], the California Supreme Court construed the phrase \u201cwhose interests conflict with the child\u2019s interests\u201d in section 317, subdivision (c) to refer to an actual\u2014not a potential\u2014conflict of interest. (31 Cal.4th at p. 56.) The Supreme Court recognized that section 317 \u201cappear[s] to differ slightly\u201d from the California Rules of Professional Conduct (CRPC), rule 3-310(C), governing the concurrent representation of conflicting interests. Unlike section 317, CRPC rule 3-310(C) prohibits a lawyer from representing clients with <em>potential </em>conflicts, as well clients with <em>actual </em>conflicts, without the clients\u2019 informed written consent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Celine R., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at pp. 56-57.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>Supreme Court reconciled the two provisions, holding, \u201cWhen first appointing counsel [for multiple siblings] in a dependency matter, the court may generally appoint a single attorney to represent all the siblings. It would have to appoint separate attorneys if, but only if, there is an actual conflict among the siblings or if circumstances specific to the case\u2014not just the potential for conflict that inheres in all multisibling dependency cases\u2014present a reasonable likelihood an actual conflict will arise. If these specific circumstances exist, the court should appoint separate counsel at the outset rather than await an actual conflict and the possible disruption a later reappointment may cause. After the initial appointment, the court will have to relieve counsel from multiple representation if, but only if, an actual conflict arises.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 58.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The holding of <em>In re Celine R., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 45, was codified and expanded upon in California Rules of Court, rule 5.660(c), effective January 1, 2006.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rule 5.660(c) is titled, \u201cConflict of interest guidelines for attorneys representing siblings.\u201d The rule, insofar as relevant here, provides that \u201c[t]he court may appoint a single attorney to represent a group of siblings involved in the same dependency proceeding.\u201d (Rule 5.660(c)(1)(A).) The attorney has, however, \u201can ongoing duty to evaluate the interests of each sibling to assess whether there is an actual conflict of interest.\u201d (Rule 5.660(c)(2)(A).) Further, \u201c[i]f the court determines that an actual conflict of interest exists, the court must relieve an attorney from representation of some or all of the siblings.\u201d (Rule 5.660(c)(2)(E).) It is not necessary, however, for counsel to withdraw after appointment \u201cif there is merely a <em>reasonable likelihood </em>that an actual conflict of interest will develop.\u201d (Rule 5.660(c)(2)(C), italics added.) Accordingly, the juvenile court\u2019s disqualification of the Center in this case was proper only if an actual conflict existed between or among two or more of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Courts and dependency lawyers applying the standard set forth in Rule 5.660(c) and <em>In re Celine R., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 45, confront two problems. The first is determining whether the circumstances in a particular multisibling dependency case give rise to a conflict. In civil or criminal cases involving multiple representation, a conflict typically arises when the circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>a particular case present \u201ca substantial risk that the lawyer\u2019s representation of the client would be materially and adversely affected by . . . the lawyer\u2019s duties to another current client . . . .\u201d (Rest.3d Law Governing Lawyers, \u00a7 121; see <em>Jasmine, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.4th at pp. 843-844; see also <em>Flatt v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 275, 282, fn. 2 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 537, 885 P.2d 950] [\u201c \u2018a lawyer represents conflicting interests when, in behalf of one client, it is his duty to contend for that which duty to another client requires him to oppose\u2019 \u201d].) The difficulty faced by counsel representing minors in dependency proceedings\u2014particularly lawyers representing children who lack the maturity to understand the proceedings or to participate meaningfully in the representation\u2014is that the paramount duty of counsel for minors is not zealously to advocate the <em>client\u2019s </em>objectives, but to advocate for what the <em>lawyer </em>believes to be in the client\u2019s best interests, even when the lawyer and the client disagree. (See, e.g., \u00a7 317, subd. (e) [\u201cCounsel for the child shall not advocate for the return of the child if, to the best of his or her knowledge, that return conflicts with the protection and safety of the child\u201d]; <em>In re Josiah Z. </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 664, 673 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 472, 115 P.3d 1133] [\u201cThe best interests of the child are paramount\u201d]; <em>In re Alexis W. </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 28, 36 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 488] [\u201c \u2018The role of counsel for the child [in dependency proceedings] is not merely to act as a mouthpiece for the minor . . . .\u2019 Even were there no statutory or decisional precedent, we would find it self-evident counsel may not advocate a position he or she has reason to believe might endanger the child\u201d]; <em>In re Candida S. </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1240, 1253 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 521] [\u201cthe obligation of counsel for a dependent minor is to pursue whatever is in the minor\u2019s best interest. This may or may not be what the minor wishes\u201d]; <em>In re Richard H. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1351, 1368 [285 Cal.Rptr. 917] [\u201cthe preference of the minor is not determinative of his or her best interests\u201d]; <em>In re David C. </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 1189, 1207-1208 [200 Cal.Rptr. 115] [\u201cCertainly, counsel for the minor must take into consideration the child\u2019s wishes when determining what the child\u2019s best interests are. This does not mean that, after independent consultation, reflection and study, counsel for the minor cannot urge that the child\u2019s best interests would be fostered by termination of parental rights, contrary to the stated desires of the child. The role of counsel for the child is not merely to act as \u00e1 mouthpiece for the minor child\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">That counsel\u2019s paramount duty is to serve the minor\u2019s best interests, rather than the minor\u2019s wishes, is reinforced by the fact that appointed counsel for minors routinely serve in a dual role, as both the child\u2019s legal counsel and the child\u2019s guardian ad litem under the federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5101 et seq.; see \u00a7 326.5; rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>5.662(c) [\u201cAn attorney appointed under rule 5.660 will serve as the child\u2019s CAPTA guardian ad litem\u201d]; Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 17.16(b)(1) [\u201cthe Court shall appoint counsel for each child who is the subject of any dependency petition who shall also serve in the capacity of a [CAPTA] Guardian ad Litem for the child\u201d].) \u201c[T]he CAPTA guardian ad litem is a fiduciary whose role is to investigate the child\u2019s circumstances and advocate for her best interests.\u201d <em>(In re Josiah </em>Z., <em>supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 679; see also 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1340.14(g) (2007) [CAPTA guardian ad litem \u201cto represent and protect the rights and best interests of the child\u201d]; rule 5.662(d) [CAPTA guardian ad litem\u2019s duties are \u201c[t]o obtain firsthand a clear understanding of the situation and needs of the child\u201d and \u201c[t]o make recommendations to the court concerning the best interest of the child\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Because the primary duty of a dependency lawyer representing minor siblings is to advocate for the minors\u2019 best interests, it is conceivable that a dependency lawyer would <em>not </em>face a conflict in circumstances that would likely present a conflict in the civil or criminal context. For example, when two minor clients express different preferences regarding visitation, their joint attorney has a duty to consider their wishes and report their preferences to the juvenile court (\u00a7 317, subd. (e)), but the attorney has a duty zealously to advocate only the visitation policy that the attorney believes to be in both minors\u2019 best interests. (See <em>In re Candida S., supra, 7 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 1243, 1251.) Similarly, the fact that termination of parental rights and a permanent plan of adoption might have adverse financial consequences for one of two siblings does not present a conflict for the siblings\u2019 joint attorney, if adoption is in the best interests of both children. (See <em>In re Barbara R. </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 941, 953-954 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 687].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">Courts in other jurisdictions have held that, notwithstanding the conflicting views of the children, there is no conflict between them if their \u201cbest interests\u201d do not conflict. Thus, the Iowa Supreme Court held that no conflict arose when a single lawyer represented\u2014in a contested court proceeding\u2014both a 13-year-old girl who opposed the termination of her mother\u2019s parental rights, and her nine-year-old brother who favored termination and who implicated the mother in sexual abuse of the children. <em>(In Interest of J.P.B. </em>(Iowa 1988) 419 N.W.2d 387, 391-392.) \u201c[T]he very reason for contested custody proceedings,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201cis that the children involved are not yet mature enough to be self-determining.

Neither of those authorities, nor the CRPC (see CRPC rule 3-310(C)), attempt to draw the line demarking when \u201cpotential\u201d becomes \u201cactual.\u201d One authority has opined that an \u201cactual\u201d conflict is nothing more than a \u201cpotential\u201d conflict that has resulted in a breach of duty. (Freedman &amp; Smith, Understanding Lawyers\u2019 Ethics (2d ed. 2002) p. 266.) This is not the meaning of those terms as used in the California ethics rules or rule 5.660(c). We believe that under rule 5.660(c), a conflict becomes \u201cactual\u201d when an attorney\u2019s duties of loyalty, confidentiality, and zealous advocacy require the attorney to take or to refrain from taking some action to serve the \u201cbest interests\u201d of one minor client, but the attorney is unable to do so without violating a duty owed by the attorney to another client; or when the attorney is unable independently to evaluate the best interests of each minor client because of the minors\u2019 conflicting interests.

In <em>In re Barbara R., supra, </em>137 Cal.App.4th 941, one attorney was appointed to represent two siblings. One of the siblings was a registered member of an Indian tribe, subject to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq.), and entitled to receive \u201csignificant benefits\u201d from the tribe, including a $1,500 per month stipend in trust, free higher education, and housing on the reservation. (137 Cal.App.4th at pp. 944-945, 947, 952.) The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HSA) recommended a permanent plan of adoption for both siblings with the non-Indian child\u2019s paternal grandparents. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 945.) The Indian child\u2019s tribe objected to the adoption, and there was some indication that the Indian child would lose her tribal benefits if parental rights were terminated. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 947-949.) The juvenile court suggested that the parties provide an offer of proof specifying \u201c \u2018exactly what [the Indian child] is entitled to.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 949.) Counsel for the children objected and refused to stipulate to such an offer of proof, contending that \u201cthe existence of financial benefits was not relevant to the issues raised in a permanency hearing under section 366.26.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The juvenile court adopted HSA\u2019s recommendation of adoption and terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The mother appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the children\u2019s attorney was subject to a conflict. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 952.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">The Court of Appeal held that \u201cthere [was] no basis to allege a conflict of interest on the part of the minor\u2019s counsel\u201d because the children \u201cdid not have adverse interests.\u201d <em>(In re Barbara R., supra, </em>137 Cal.App.4th at p. 953.) \u201cA conflict arises where minor\u2019s counsel seeks a course of action for one child with adverse consequences to the other.

The minors\u2019 father appealed the juvenile court\u2019s order declaring the minors dependents of the court <em>(id. </em>at p. 1355), arguing, inter alia, that the juvenile court should have appointed separate counsel for the minors because DCS \u201ctook a position contrary to the section 319 presumption of family reunification,\u201d thereby creating \u201can actual conflict between DCS and the Minors . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1367.) The court of appeal disagreed. \u201cAppellant provides no authority,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201c. . . that a dependency petition which does not recommend family reunification automatically creates a conflict of interest on the basis that DCS\u2019s position is against the presumed position of a minor.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1368.) \u201cGiven the purpose of juvenile proceedings to look out for the best interests of the minor, we do not read into section 319 a presumption that family reunification must always be recommended or an implication that the failure to recommend family reunification automatically creates a conflict between DCS and a minor\u2019s best interests. After all, the preference of the minor is not determinative of his or her best interests.

The mother appealed the juvenile court\u2019s orders at the six-month review hearing, arguing, inter alia, that the juvenile court should have appointed separate counsel for each of the minors. The mother claimed that a conflict existed among the minors because \u201csome wanted to visit their siblings while others did not.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1251.) The appellate court held that the minors\u2019 different preferences relating to sibling visitation did not give rise to an actual conflict of interest requiring the appointment of separate counsel. The court stated, \u201cThe only evidence presented . . . here is that some of the children wanted visitation and others did not. However, the obligation of counsel for a dependent minor is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>pursue whatever is in the minor\u2019s best interest. This may or may not be what the minor wishes. Nothing would preclude counsel from informing the court that one child wants visitation and another does not. It would then be up to the court to determine whether there should be any visitation and, if so, with whom, the frequency and length of visitation. [Citation.] In the absence of any further facts, nothing in this record rises to the level of an actual conflict of interest requiring appointment of independent counsel.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">In <em>Carroll v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1423 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 891], the court considered whether the then newly enacted sibling-relationship exception to the statutory preference for adoption in section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(E) created an actual conflict among siblings when fewer than all of the siblings were adoptable. In that case, one attorney was appointed to represent seven siblings, all of whom were the subject of section 300 petitions filed by the HSA. HSA recommended adoption as the permanent plan for three of the siblings. HSA recommended guardianship for three other siblings, who hoped to reunify with their mother. The seventh child was significantly developmentally delayed, and the caretaker who was willing to act as guardian for three of her siblings asked that she be placed elsewhere. (101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1425-1426.) Three of the children, including two who were to be adopted, expressed their desire to preserve their relationships with their siblings. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1426-1427.) The attorney sought to withdraw from representing the seven siblings, arguing that the siblings\u2019 different interests would require her to counsel and advocate both <em>against </em>adoption as a permanent plan (to preserve the siblings\u2019 relationships) and/or adoption as a permanent plan (to serve the best interests of some of her clients). <em>(Ibid.) </em>The juvenile court denied the attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">The Court of Appeal issued a writ of mandate, directing the juvenile court to grant the attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw. The court held that \u201can actual conflict of interest arose among at least some members of the client group.\u201d <em>(Carroll </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 1428.) \u201c[T]he same attorney could not pursue [one sibling\u2019s] interests by opposing a permanent plan of adoption for [his sister] . . . and simultaneously independently evaluate whether [the sister\u2019s] best interests would be served by the stability provided by adoption.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">The California authorities thus support our view of what qualifies as an actual conflict in dependency proceedings, and recognize that the conflicting preferences of minor clients do not necessarily give rise to a disqualifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>conflict, for it is the attorney\u2019s role to make a reasonable, independent determination of the minors\u2019 best interests, notwithstanding the minors\u2019 preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">2. <em>Evidence Supports an Actual Conflict of Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">The juvenile court initially disqualified CLC Unit 1 on the basis of the so-called \u201csystemic\u201d or \u201cstructural\u201d conflict it perceived to be created by the Center\u2019s administrative reorganization, and stated its intention to appoint one lawyer to represent all four of CLC Unit l\u2019s former clients. Counsel for Nah. thereafter raised the issue of a conflict between Joshua and Justin, on the one hand, and Naes. and Nay., on the other hand. By the time the juvenile court issued its minute order, it changed its ruling to disqualify both CLC Units 1 and 2, and to appoint separate counsel for Joshua and Justin, on the one hand, and Naes. and Nay., on the other hand. The trial court did not specify the reasons for its altered ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">On appeal, we must indulge \u201c[a]ll intendments and presumptions ... to support [the lower court\u2019s order] on matters as to which the record is silent.\u201d <em>(Denham </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564 [86 Cal.Rptr. 65, 468 P.2d 193]; see <em>SpeeDee Oil, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 1143-1144.) Viewed together and in a light most favorable to the juvenile court\u2019s order, the circumstances at the time of the minute order disqualifying the Center imply that at least one of the grounds for disqualification was a finding by the juvenile court of an actual conflict between Joshua and Justin, on the one hand, and Naes. and Nay., on the other hand. (See rule 5.660(c)(2)(E); <em>In re Celine R., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 58 [disqualification of attorney for multiple siblings in a dependency proceeding must be based on an actual conflict].) Furthermore, even if the juvenile court erroneously relied on the so-called \u201cstructural\u201d conflict in making its disqualification order, we will nevertheless affirm if substantial evidence supports the disqualification. \u201cThere is perhaps no rule of review more firmly established than the principle that a ruling or decision correct in law will not be disturbed on appeal merely because it was given for the wrong reason. If correct upon any theory of law applicable to the case, the judgment will be sustained regardless of the considerations that moved the lower court to its conclusion.\u201d <em>(Belair v. Riverside County Flood Control Dist. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 550, 568 [253 Cal.Rptr. 693, 764 P.2d 1070]; see <em>In re Lucero L. </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1227, 1249-1250 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 56, 998 P.2d 1019] (plur. opn. of Mosk, J.) [applying substantial evidence standard to affirm juvenile court ruling made on erroneous legal basis].) Substantial evidence supports the disqualification in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">At the time of their detention, Joshua was seven and Justin was four; both were verbal and provided statements to DCFS social workers investigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>Zamer\u2019s injuries and potential abuse against the other children in the household. Justin was the only witness to Zamer\u2019s injury, other than the alleged perpetrator, Nah., and three-year-old Zamer himself. Joshua and Justin both identified Nah. as the person Zamer referred to as \u201c12.\u201d Zamer alleged that \u201c12\u201d pushed him in the bathroom, resulting in his broken leg, and had once shut him in a closet. In addition, the amended petition alleged that both Joshua and Justin were victims of abuse perpetrated by Nah., and both Joshua and Justin made statements to DCFS tending to implicate Nah. in such abuse. The interests of Joshua and Justin were directly adverse to those of Nah.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">The juvenile court found that Nah. was the presumed father of the girls, Naes. and Nay. At the time of their detention, Naes. was one year old and Nay. was four months old; both were preverbal. Neither displayed any signs of physical abuse when examined by physicians, and the only evidence of abuse directed against either of them was four-year-old Justin\u2019s statement, \u201cHe [Nah.] don\u2019t sock [Naes.] because she\u2019s a baby, but he pops her real hard.\u201d The amended petition did not allege that either Naes. or Nay. had been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Although DCFS had recommended against reunification services for Nah. and his daughters (Naes. and Nay.), there is no evidence that Feldman, the girls\u2019 CLC Unit 1 attorney, had determined at this early stage in the proceedings that reunification services were not in the girls\u2019 best interests. Further, at the time of the disqualification order, the allegations in the amended petition had not been adjudicated\u2014the case was on calendar for a contested jurisdictional hearing when the juvenile court made its disqualification order. Accordingly, the juvenile court had not yet determined whether reunification services between Nah. and his daughters were required by section 361.5.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The statements made by Joshua and Justin would be material to that determination. To advocate in favor of reunification services for Naes. and Nay., Feldman would have to dispute the accuracy or reliability of the statements made by Joshua and Justin, also Feldman\u2019s clients. Feldman had informed the juvenile court that he had received confidential information from Joshua and Justin. Further, the juvenile court could reasonably conclude that there was an actual conflict because Feldman could not professionally and independently <em>evaluate </em>each child\u2019s best interests when faced with this dilemma. As we have stated, the inability to evaluate independently the best interests of each minor client because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>minors\u2019 conflicting interests is an actual conflict. (See <em>Carroll v. Superior Court, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 1428.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Accordingly, because the matter was on calendar for a contested hearing in which the interests of Joshua and Justin, on the one hand, and Naes. and Nay., on the other hand, were, at that time, inconsistent, substantial evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s finding that CLC Unit 1 had an actual conflict. The juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the interests of Joshua and Justin were inconsistent with those of Naes. and Nay., and thereby posed \u201ca substantial risk that the [CLC Unit 1] lawyer\u2019s representation of [Joshua and Justin] would be materially and adversely affected by . . . the lawyer\u2019s duties to [Naes. and Nay.] . . . .\u201d (Rest.3d Law Governing Lawyers, \u00a7 121.) The juvenile court could thus reasonably conclude that CLC Unit 1 should be disqualified under rule 5.660(c)(2)(E) and <em>In re Celine R., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 45.

At the end of the November 1 hearing, however, the juvenile court relieved Baca from representing Joshua E., Sr., and appointed Baca to represent Joshua and Justin. By doing so, the juvenile court may have appointed an attorney to represent clients with interests at least potentially <em>adverse </em>to those of her then-existing client <em>in the same litigation, </em>without the informed written consent of each client, in violation of California Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 3-310(C). It is irrelevant that Baca\u2019s representation of Joshua E., Sr., was brief\u2014he might have imparted confidential information to Baca prior to the hearing, or in off-the-record conversations during the hearing. The Los Angeles Superior Court\u2019s local rules <em>require </em>counsel appointed for a parent in dependency proceedings to make certain inquiries at the party\u2019s first appearance. (Super. Ct.

We need not ascertain whether Baca actually obtained confidential information from Joshua E., Sr., because the communication of confidential information is presumed in such circumstances, and disqualification is automatic. A lawyer who represents clients with adverse interests in the same litigation automatically will be disqualified, as will a lawyer who switches sides during pending litigation, because both situations present an unacceptable risk that the lawyer\u2019s duties of loyalty and confidentiality will be compromised. <em>(City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Cobra Solutions, Inc, </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 839, 848 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 771, 135 P.3d 20].) Joshua E., Sr., is not a party to this appeal and has not sought review of the juvenile court\u2019s order appointing Baca, nor does appellate counsel for Joshua or Justin raise the issue.

The evidence in this matter was that in the case of <em>In re Charlisse C. </em>(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1554 [58 Cal.Rptr.3d 173], review granted July 18, 2007, S152822. Evidence developed during the <em>Charlisse C. </em>hearings demonstrated that the Children\u2019s Law Center of Los Angeles (the center), which was originally organized as three separate law firms, had failed to maintain the ethical walls in existence when its structure was approved by Division Three of this appellate district in <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1432, 1435-1445 [284 Cal.Rptr. 154]. During the proceedings in <em>Charlisse C, </em>in response to the extensive evidentiary showing of noncompliance with <em>Castro, </em>the juvenile court gave a tentative ruling that covers seven pages in the reporter\u2019s transcript and discusses both violations of substance and appearance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number><em>Charlisse C. </em>is a successive representation case where the center had previously represented the mother. (See <em>Flatt v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 275, 282-284 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 537, 885 P.2d 950]; <em>People v. Baylis </em>(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1054, 1064-1065 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 559].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">This case is materially different from <em>Charlisse C. </em>Here, the purported multiple representation involves <em>siblings </em>represented by a law firm that neglected to maintain the ethical walls mandated by <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at pages 1435-1445. The disqualification rules applicable here are substantively different from those that apply to the multiple representation of a parent and a sibling, as was the case in <em>Charlisse C. </em>In the case of siblings, multiple representation is permissible in the absence of actually conflicting interests. <em>(In re Celine R. </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 45, 58 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 432, 71 P.3d 787]; <em>Carroll v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1423, 1428-1430 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 891]; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 317, subd. (c).) Regardless of the evidence of noncompliance with the ethical walls mandated by <em>Castro v. Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at pages 1435-1445, no improper concurrent representation issue is present here because there is no evidence of actually conflicting interests between the youngsters. There was no evidence the children\u2019s attorneys, acting as counsel and guardians ad litem, will assert in any future hearing actually conflicting positions. Nor is there any evidence that in any prior hearing actually conflicting positions were asserted. No doubt, there may be potential conflicts of interest between the children; but that state of affairs cannot justify a disqualification order based on conflict of interest grounds in dependency cases. <em>(In re Celine R., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 58; <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1428-1430.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">Further, the juvenile court never found there was an <em>actual </em>conflict of interest nor ruled on that basis in issuing the disqualification orders. The basis of the juvenile court\u2019s exercise of discretion was its belief that its findings, which are under review by our Supreme Court in the <em>Charlisse C. </em>case, applied here. These extensive findings do not permit disqualification of a single attorney or law firm representing siblings in a dependency case\u2014they only permit disqualification in a successive representation scenario. Given that the juvenile court never exercised its discretion on the ground an actual conflict of interest existed, I do not believe we can uphold any part of its ruling on a ground never utilized by it. <em>(Olvera v. Olvera </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 32, 39 [283 Cal.Rptr. 271]; <em>Cramer v. Morrison </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 873, 887 [153 Cal.Rptr. 865]; <em>Zak </em>v. <em>State Farm etc. Ins. Co. </em>(1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 500, 506 [42 Cal.Rptr. 908]; see <em>Clothesrigger, Inc. </em>v. <em>GTE Corp. </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 605, 621 [236 Cal.Rptr. 605].)
