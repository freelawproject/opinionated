The district court imposed statutory damages of $6,000, as well as attorney\u2019s fees. Sherman argues on appeal that the district court erred in admitting some of plaintiffs evidence at trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-18\">First, Sherman argues that various credit card statements that were introduced and then used to authenticate the invoices for the purchase of the descrambling equipment were inadmissible, because these statements did not meet the business records exception to the hearsay rule. Because Sherman concedes in her brief on appeal that she \u201cfailed to object in court\u201d when these records were offered, our review is limited to whether the record evidences \u201cplain error affecting substantial rights that goes to the very essence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>case.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Branen, </em>17 F.3d 552, 556-57 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Sherman does not seriously dispute that these statements were \u201ckept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 803(6). Instead Sherman argues that the records were inadmissible because they were the business records of the credit card companies from which they were subpoenaed, rather than of the vendors that sold her the deserambling equipment. Such a distinction, however, does not affect the applicability of the business records exception. Nor does the mere fact that the credit card statements were provided to the plaintiff in response to a subpoena, standing alone, render them inadmissible documents prepared or compiled for use in litigation under <em>Palmer v. Hoffman, </em>318 U.S. 109, 114, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943). As Sherman has not shown that the records lack the \u201csufficient indicia of trustworthiness to be considered reliable,\u201d <em>Saks Int\u2019l, Inc. v. M/V \u201cExport Champion\u201d, </em>817 F.2d 1011, 1013 (2d Cir.1987), we see no error \u201cso egregious and obvious as to make the trial judge ... derelict in permitting it, despite the defendant\u2019s failure to object.\u201d <em>United States v. Tillem, </em>906 F.2d 814, 825 (2d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Second, Sherman argues that the plaintiff violated the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d) when it obtained sales records from the vendor that sold her the descrambling equipment, because those records contained her confidential credit card information. Those sales records, Sherman argues, should therefore not have been admitted. For a variety of reasons that we need not belabor here, the GLBA has no applicability to the case at hand. Moreover, even assuming the statute would apply, there is nothing in this record to suggest that the plaintiff obtained the sales records through means barred by the statute. Rather, as summarized by the district court, the sales records were lawfully obtained by the plaintiff as a result of the settlement of a prior lawsuit against the vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">We have considered all of Sherman\u2019s other contentions on appeal, and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
