His petition for review arises under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, which bars us from reviewing denials of discretionary relief under \u00a7 1229b (cancellation of removal) and \u00a7 1229c (voluntary departure). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). However, \u201c[w]e retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims, even when those claims address a discretionary decision.\u201d <em>Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1001, 1004 (9th Cir.2003). Because the IJ deprived Cardenas of his due process right to a full and fair hearing, we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\"><em>\u201cWe </em>review de novo due process challenges to immigration decisions.\u201d <em>Padilla v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 921, 923 (9th Cir.2003). \u201cDue process requires that an alien receive a full and fair hearing\u201d and be allowed to \u201cpresent personal testimony in [his] behalf.\u201d <em>Jacinto v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 725, 727-28 (9th Cir.2000). To prevail on a due process challenge, a petitioner must show not only that he was denied due process, but also that \u201csuch denial resulted] in prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">\n<em>Cancellation of Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">At the hearing, the IJ repeatedly prevented Cardenas from testifying in support of his application. For example, the IJ required Cardenas to choose whether his two-year old daughter, Violeta, would stay in the United States or return with him to Mexico. When Cardenas could not make such a critical decision at a moment\u2019s notice, the IJ precluded him from testifying about the hardship Violeta would suffer if separated from her father. However, the effect of a child\u2019s separation from her parents is relevant to the statutory inquiry into the possibility of an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D); <em>see also Reyes-Melendez v. INS, </em>342 F.3d 1001, 1007 (9th Cir.2003). By barring Cardenas\u2019s testimony, the IJ prejudicially denied him a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on the central issue in his application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Reyes-Melendez, </em>342 F.3d at 1009 (involving \u201can IJ error that precluded the development of a factual record by foreclosing the admission of testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">\n<em>Voluntary Departure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">At the removal hearing, the IJ narrowly limited the scope of Cardenas\u2019s testimony to his application for cancellation of removal, and only treated the application for voluntary departure as a minor procedural matter. For example, the IJ precluded Cardenas from testifying about his relationship with Violeta\u2019s half-brothers because the IJ ruled that they were not \u201cqualifying children\u201d under \u00a7 240A of the Immigration and Naturalization Act and, therefore, were irrelevant to Cardenas\u2019s application for cancellation of removal. However, this testimony was relevant to Cardenas\u2019s application for <em>voluntary departure. </em>By presenting evidence that he cared for his domestic partner\u2019s children, he was attempting to show his good moral character.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">The IJ\u2019s repeated refusal to allow Cardenas to present evidence establishing his good moral character is especially troubling given that the INS introduced evidence to the contrary. At the hearing, the INS accused Cardenas of intentionally making false statements on old tax returns. Although these alleged misrepresentations occurred before the five year statutory period for assessing moral character required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(l)(B), the IJ nevertheless concluded that Cardenas lacked good moral character. When Cardenas\u2019s counsel requested a continuance to discuss with Cardenas how to respond to the INS\u2019s allegations, the IJ denied the motion, stating that \u201cthere is no reason to continue.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The IJ then gave Cardenas <em>five minutes </em>to decide whether to withdraw his claims or accept the ruling and appeal to the BIA. When Cardenas\u2019s counsel stated that five minutes was not enough time, the IJ issued her ruling and terminated the hearing. The IJ\u2019s actions suggest that \u201cthe IJ behaved not as a neutral fact-finder interested in hearing the petitioner\u2019s evidence, but as a partisan adjudicator seeking to intimidate [the petitioner] and his counsel.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In light of the fact that the sole basis for the IJ\u2019s ultimate moral character determination was his alleged violation of federal tax law, the IJ\u2019s decision to preclude otherwise relevant evidence of Cardenas\u2019s good moral character likely \u201caffected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Because Cardenas was prejudiced by these violations of his due process right to present evidence in support of his application for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure, we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b666-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-22\">. \"When the BIA adopts an IJ\u2019s findings and reasoning, we review the IJ's opinion as if it were the opinion of the BIA.\u201d <em>Singh-Kaur v.
