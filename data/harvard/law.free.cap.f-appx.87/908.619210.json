He appeals, raising five issues. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-19\">First, Williams alleges that his \u00a7 922(g) conviction is unconstitutional under the reasoning of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). This court has expressly rejected such a claim. <em>United States v. Wells, </em>98 F.3d 808, 811 (4th Cir.1996). To the extent Williams argues that his conviction violates the Tenth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, we have also rejected these arguments. <em>See United States v. Bostic, </em>168 F.3d 718, 724 (4th Cir.1999) (Tenth Amendment); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>209 F.3d 319, 323 (4th Cir.2000) (Fifth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-20\">Second, Williams\u2019 instant federal prosecution, following his state prosecution by North Carolina for the same offense, does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because of the dual sovereignty doctrine. <em>Rinaldi v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 22, 28, 98 S.Ct. 81, 54 L.Ed.2d 207 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-21\">Third, we find that the Government did establish the interstate commerce element of the crime. The evidence revealed that both weapons at issue were manufactured outside the state of possession. <em>See United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 138 (4th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Nathan, </em>202 F.3d 230, 234 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-22\">Next, we find that Williams has failed to show that the district court erred by denying his motion for a new trial on the grounds of prosecutorial vindictiveness. Williams has failed to show that the prosecutor had a \u201cgenuine animus\u201d toward him, <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>262 F.3d 305, 314 (4th Cir.2001), and the Government clearly had probable cause to believe he committed the crime. <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. 456, 464, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-23\">Finally, we find no merit to Williams\u2019 claim that he was denied the right to a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>trial because there was conflicting testimony from the Government\u2019s witnesses. Williams\u2019 allegations amount to little more than minor discrepancies; the relevant facts of Williams\u2019 possession of the guns and his status as a felon are unblemished. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>55 F.3d 976, 979 (4th Cir.1995). This court does not make credibility determinations on appeal. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 868 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Williams\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
