We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny in part and grant in part the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s credibility determination \u201cunder a substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>See Mendoza Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 658 (9th Cir.2003). Therefore the BIA\u2019s decision to deny El-Himri\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of deportation and voluntary departure, which was based on an adverse credibility finding, must be upheld \u201c \u2018unless the evidence presented compels a reasonable factfinder to reach a contrary result.\u2019 \u201d <em>De Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The BIA based its adverse credibility finding on numerous material inconsistencies and omissions in El-Himri\u2019s testimony that were central to his asylum claims. Much of El-Himri\u2019s claim of persecution in both Jordan and Kuwait was predicated upon his association with Alithad, a student organization supporting Palestinian rights. Yet El-Himri refused to name that organization in response to direct questions on the asylum application and in other documents submitted in support of his applications. Although El-Himri was given the opportunity to explain his failure to identify Alithad, only his attorney offered the explanation that the name of the organization \u201cputs ... his immediate family in Kuwait and himself at risk.\u201d The BIA, rejecting the attorney\u2019s explanation for El-Himri\u2019s failure to identify the \u201cstudent organization,\u201d reasoned that \u201cif [El-Himri\u2019s] participation in [Alithad] was so notorious, it makes no sense for him to omit this organization,\u201d as then both Jordanian and Kuwaiti officials would already have been aware of his association with Alithad. It was only when El-Himri was told that his failure to identify Alithad by name would \u201cundoubtedly result in a denial of the relief\u2019 he had requested that he became willing to testify specifically as to his association with Alithad. The BIA concluded that El-Himri had \u201ceither created his story about Alithad or discovered the significance of this organization only at the time he testified.\u201d Thus, it found that El-Himri\u2019s testimony regarding \u201cthese central aspects\u201d of his asylum claim was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">El-Himri also claimed that the Jordanian authorities were interested in his activities and those of his family because of his uncle Fahed\u2019s supposed involvement with the Black September movement in 1970. The BIA found that El-Himri\u2019s testimony regarding the Jordanian government\u2019s interest in his uncle to be \u201cquestionable and ..., at best, an exaggeration of the truth.\u201d Based upon the \u201cscant information\u201d that El-Himri provided about his uncle, including his suspicion that Fahed, who had not been seen in 30 years, was killed by the Jordanian government, the BIA questioned why Jordanian authorities would still be interested in Fahed. Moreover, the BIA found the fact that the Jordanian government allowed El-Himri\u2019s entire family to obtain passports and renew them repeatedly seemed \u201cremarkable\u201d if the Jordanian authorities were intent on persecuting the El-Himri family because of Fahed\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Because El-Himri\u2019s claims of persecution were principally based upon his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>supposed association with Alithad and the Jordanian government\u2019s alleged interest in his uncle\u2019s activities, the statements that the BIA found to be insincere or exaggerated went to the heart of El-Himri\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000). As such, El-Himri\u2019s omissions and exaggerations regarding these central aspects of his claim provide substantial evidence in support of the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Since El-Himri has not demonstrated that the record presented \u201ccompel[s] the opposite conclusion,\u201d <em>Id., </em>we affirm the BIA\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">El-Himri\u2019s testimony was the sole basis upon which his claims for asylum and withholding of deportation rested. Because El-Himri was properly deemed not credible, no evidence supports his claim of past persecution or fear of future persecution in either Kuwait or Jordan. Thus the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying his applications. <em>See Berroteran-Melendez v. INS, </em>955 F.2d 1251, 1255 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Nor did the BIA abuse its discretion in denying El-Himri\u2019s petition for voluntary departure on the same basis as the IJ, who found El-Himri statutorily ineligible for voluntary departure based upon his false testimony to the court. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f); INA \u00a7 101(f). Substantial evidence does not compel a contrary result. <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">El-Himri is entitled to review of his claim under CAT. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16. Because CAT and asylum claims \u201care analytically separate,\u201d <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001), the BIA erred in failing to conduct the required separate analysis for El-Himri\u2019s CAT claim. Under <em>Kamalthas, </em>\u201c \u2018all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture shall be considered,\u2019 even apart from any prior findings in the asylum context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). The BIA must decide whether El-Himri \u201cpresented] evidence establishing \u2018substantial grounds for believing that he ... would be in danger of being subjected to torture\u2019 \u201d if he were deported to Jordan. <em>Id. </em>at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The petition therefore is DENIED in part, GRANTED in part, and REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b67-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
