Perales now appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-20\">Perales argues for the first time on appeal that the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), is unconstitutional because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate commerce and is thus an improper exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause. This argument is unavailing. \u201cThis court has repeatedly emphasized that the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not open to question.\u201d <em>United States v. De Leon, </em>170 F.3d 494, 499 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-21\">Perales also argues that the district court\u2019s inclusion of a written condition of supervised release prohibiting him from possessing a dangerous weapon must be stricken because it conflicts with the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence. This issue has already been decided adversely to Perales. <em>See United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 937-38 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-22\">Perales has shown no error in connection with his conviction and sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
