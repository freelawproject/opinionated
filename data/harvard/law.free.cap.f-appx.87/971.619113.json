California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Quintanilla has filed a response and a motion for appointment of new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-25\">Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue in this direct appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, Quintanilla\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-26\">Quintanilla\u2019s contention that his previous counsel was ineffective for not advising him to withdraw his guilty plea is not sufficiently developed in the record before us. Therefore, as to that contention only, Quintanilla\u2019s appeal is DISMISS ED without prejudice to his'ability to raise that contention in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1007-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
