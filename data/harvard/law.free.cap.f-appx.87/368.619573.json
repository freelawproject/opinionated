Carbajal contends that the district court erred in departing upward from a guideline sentencing range of 77 to 96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-23\">Carbajal argues that the district court made several erroneous factual findings. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court\u2019s factual findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>regarding the nature and extent of Carbajal\u2019s criminal history were not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>293 F.3d 863, 871 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 950, 123 S.Ct. 395, 154 L.Ed.2d 296 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Carbajal also argues that the district court\u2019s reasons for departure were not supported by the facts of the case. The district court correctly found that Carbajal\u2019s criminal history category significantly under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. Additionally, his criminal history category failed to adequately reflect Carbajal\u2019s likelihood for recidivism. Thus, whether the standard of review is abuse of discretion or <em>de novo, </em>the district court did not err in departing upward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The district court\u2019s reasons for departure, which included deterrence and the protection of the public, were acceptable. <em>See United States v. Ashburn, </em>38 F.3d 803, 807 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). The extent of the departure was reasonable and, at sentencing, the district court adequately articulated its reasons for the extent of the upward departure. <em>See United States v. Daughenbaugh, </em>49 F.3d 171, 175 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d <em>658, </em>662-63 (5th Cir.1993) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Carbajal argues that the district court did not give sufficiently specific written reasons for the extent of its upward departure. This argument lacks merit. In the written order of judgment, the district court adopted, by reference, as its reasons the factual findings and legal conclusions found in the presentence report and those made at sentencing. Thus, the district court did give specific reasons for the extent of the departure. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">.
