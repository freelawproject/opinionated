GonzalezApodaca contends that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) define separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>offenses. He argues that the prior conviction that resulted in his increased sentence is an element of a separate offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) that should have been alleged in his indictment. Gonzalez-Apodaca maintains that he pleaded guilty to an indictment which charged only simple reentry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). He argues that his sentence exceeds the two-year maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. The Court further held that the sentencing provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219. Gonzalez-Apodaea acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The Government has moved for a summary affirmance in lieu of filing an appellee\u2019s brief. In its motion, the Government asks that an appellee\u2019s brief not be required. The motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">AFFIRMED; MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
