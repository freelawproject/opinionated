After sentencing, the district court sent him back to the Volunteers of America community treatment center (VOA) where he had been residing as a condition of his pretrial release. He resided there for 55 more days until receiving an order from the Bureau of Prisons telling him where and when to surrender for service of his sentence. Miller later filed an action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 claiming that he is entitled to sentencing credit for the 55 days he spent at the VOA after sentencing. The district court refused, concluding that the time Miller spent at the treatment center was not creditable \u201cofficial detention\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">After being indicted for two federal firearms charges, Miller was taken into federal custody and ultimately released on bond. As a condition of his release, he was required to live at the VOA on \u201clock-down\u201d status. He remained there until sentencing, and after sentencing the district court \u201cremand[ed][him] to the custody of the marshal for transportation back to the VOA.\u201d Miller\u2019s sole argument is that he should be given credit for the time he spent at the treatment center after sentencing because it was \u201cofficial detention\u201d within the meaning of section 3585(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">Section 3585(b) grants sentencing credit for time spent in \u201cofficial detention.\u201d But the statute does not define the term, so when the Supreme Court was faced with interpreting it in <em>Reno v. Koray, </em>515 U.S. 50, 55, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995), the Court looked at a statute passed at the same time, the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141 <em>et seq. </em>The Court ultimately concluded that Congress intended \u201cofficial detention\u201d under section 3585(b) to be limited to confinement resulting from a formal detention order entered under the Bail Reform Act. <em>Reno, </em>515 U.S. at 57, 65. Under the Bail Reform Act a court must order a person either \u201creleased\u201d or \u201cdetained\u201d pending trial, imposition and execution of sentence, and appeal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141. Pretrial detention is allowed only after the court holds a hearing and finds that \u201cno condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3142(e). After a finding of guilt, there is a presumption for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>detention, but a court may decide to continue a defendant\u2019s release. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3143. This dichotomy between release and detention used in the Bail Reform Act applies equally to section 3585(b); only defendants \u201cdetained\u201d under the Bail Reform Act are in \u201cofficial detention,\u201d and those who are \u201creleased\u201d are not, even if the release is limited by restrictive conditions such as living in a VGA treatment center. <em>Reno, </em>515 U.S. at 62 (noting that although a defendant \u201creleased\u201d may be subject to the exact same conditions as one \u201cdetained,\u201d the distinction between the two statuses depends on the type of order entered by the court, not on the degree of restriction later placed upon the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Miller does not contend that the district court explicitly detained him pursuant to sections 3142 or 3143. All indications in the record suggest that his pretrial release was continued after he pled guilty and after he was sentenced. Miller argues in his petition that because he was placed in handcuffs and in a holding cell immediately following the sentencing hearing, and because the marshals brought him back to the VGA instead of letting him transport himself as he had in the past, he must have been in \u201cofficial detention\u201d after sentencing, regardless of the content of any written orders. But in <em>Reno </em>the Court explicitly rejected the idea that \u201cofficial detention\u201d is defined in terms of the degree that a person\u2019s liberty is curtailed. <em>Reno, </em>515 U.S. at 64 (\u201cTo determine in each case whether a defendant \u2018released\u2019 on bail was subjected to \u2018jail-type confinement\u2019 would require a fact-intensive inquiry into the circumstances of confinement.... [T]he phrase \u2018jail-type confinement\u2019 would remain sufficiently vague and amorphous so that much the same kind of disparity in treatment for similarly situated defendants would arise.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Miller also argues that he was in official detention following sentencing because, in his opinion, he was then subject to the control of the Bureau of Prisons. He relies on a sentence in <em>Reno: </em>\u201cUnlike defendants \u2018released\u2019 on bail, defendants who are \u2018detained\u2019 or \u2018sentenced\u2019 <em>always remain subject to the control of the Bureau.\u201d Id. </em>at 63 (emphasis in original). The meaning of this sentence is not entirely clear, but it cannot mean what Miller suggests. An interpretation that squares with the rest of the opinion is that the Court used the term \u201csentenced\u201d to mean \u201cserving a sentence.\u201d Miller\u2019s interpretation-that after the district court pronounces a sentence, any restraints on liberty must constitute \u201cofficial detention\u201d and entitle the defendant to sentencing credit-cannot be correct. That reading would be at odds with the facts and holding of <em>Reno. </em>The petitioner in <em>Reno </em>was seeking credit for time he spent in a VGA treatment center after sentencing, and the Court denied him credit for that time just as it denied him credit for the time he spent there before sentencing. <em>Reno </em>did not distinguish between time before and after sentencing in its analysis or holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Because Miller was \u201creleased\u201d as that term is defined under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3141 and 3143 during the 55 days for which he seeks credit, he was not in \u201cofficial detention\u201d during that time and has no entitlement to additional sentencing credit. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
