Accordingly, the appeal is submitted for decision on the appellant's brief and the record. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); Cir. R. 34(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b633-11\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">A conduct board at Wabash Valley Correctional Facility in Indiana found that John Lane-El had possessed two bags of marijuana. It rescinded 90 days of his earned-time credit and reduced his credit-earning class. He sought federal review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; the district court denied his petition. We have substituted as respondent the warden at Pendleton, Lane-El\u2019s current prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">A counselor found two bags of marijuana in a room that, the counselor asserted, could have been accessed only by inmates Lane-El and Robert Morris. Lane-El\u2019s defense to the charge was principally that additional inmates could have put the drugs there; his witnesses testified that the room is not a secure area. (Lane-El also testified that he had been attending religious services when the counselor found the drugs, but that was no alibi; the time evidence is found does not imply anything about when the offense occurred.) Yet a prison may impose discipline on the basis of \u201csome evidence,\u201d <em>see Superintendent of Walpole v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985), and finding drugs in a place within the prisoner\u2019s control is \u201csome evidence\u201d of wrongdoing even if the control was not exclusive. See <em>Hamilton v. O\u2019Leary, </em>976 F.2d 341, 345 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-15\">According to Lane-El, the prison discriminated on the ground of his race: he is black (he prefers \u201cMoorish\u201d), while Morris is white. The principal problem with the argument is that the record does not show any difference in treatment; and even if we infer from Lane-El\u2019s submission that Morris was not punished, the record is silent about the reasons. LaneEl does not tell us what defense Morris made; perhaps Morris showed convincingly that the drugs belonged to Lane-El. Without a demonstration that Lane-El and Morris were similarly situated except for race, not even a prima facie case of discrimination has been established. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Bass, </em>536 U.S. 862, 122 S.Ct. 2389, 153 L.Ed.2d 769 (2002); <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. 456, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">Lane-El\u2019s remaining contentions do not require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-17\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
