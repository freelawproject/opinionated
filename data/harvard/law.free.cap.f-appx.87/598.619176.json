Having carefully reviewed the record, <em>see Mittlestedt v. Apfel, </em>204 F.3d 847, 850-51 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">In her January 1996 applications, Chapman alleged disability from chemical allergies, a heart-valve problem, and other conditions. At a hearing an administrative law judge (ALJ) posed a hypothetical to a vocational expert (VE) based on his determination of Chapman\u2019s residual functional capacity (RFC). The VE responded that the hypothetical claimant could perform Chapman\u2019s past telephone-survey job, as well as the sedentary unskilled jobs of library aide, small-products assembler, ad-dresser, and telephone-quotation or mail clerk. The ALJ then determined that Chapman could perform her past job as a survey worker or telephone solicitor, and thus she was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">We reject Chapman\u2019s challenge to the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings, as the ALJ cited multiple valid reasons for finding her not entirely credible. <em>See Anderson v. Barnhart, </em>344 F.3d 809, 814 (8th Cir.2003) (ALJ may discount subjective complaints where inconsistencies appear on record as whole). Most of Chapman\u2019s present explanations for the record inconsistencies upon which the ALJ relied to discredit her were offered at the hearing or in her pre-hearing reports. <em>See id. </em>(\u201ctouchstone\u201d is that credibility is primarily for ALJ to determine).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">Chapman suggests that the ALJ ignored the records of Dr. Richard Wilker, her primary treating physician, in favor of the opinion of his partner, Dr. James Mansour, who saw her only a few times. However, the ALJ was not required to summarize all of the medical records, <em>see Wheeler v. Apfel, </em>224 F.3d 891, 895 n. 3 (8th Cir.2000), and more important, Dr. Wilker\u2019s records do not help Chapman. Most of the notations she references relate to her reports to Dr. Wilker, not to his findings; he only suspected fibromyalgia; and he does not state in his notes that he agreed with her decision to apply for disability. Further, even if Dr. Mansour was not Chapman\u2019s primary treating physician, his opinion was consistent with the findings of a consulting physician, an allergist, and treating cardiologists. <em>Cf. Holmstrom v. Massanari, </em>270 F.3d 715, 720 (8th Cir.2001) (treating physician\u2019s opinion will be granted controlling weight if it is well supported by accepted diagnostic techniques, and consistent with other substantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-17\">Chapman contends that the ALJ erred by discounting the opinion of Dr. George Kroker (an internist who is board certified in environmental medicine) as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the limitations imposed by her allergies. We disagree. At the time of the ALJ\u2019s decision Chapman had seen Dr. Kroker only twice; and as the ALJ noted, Chapman\u2019s reported symptoms were entirely subjective, and Dr. Kroker\u2019s opinion conflicted with that of the allergist. <em>See Pearsall v. Massanari, </em>274 F.3d 1211, 1219 (8th Cir.2001) (ALJ may reject opinion of any medical expert, where it is inconsistent with record as whole; it is ALJ\u2019s function to resolve conflicts); <em>Holmstrom, </em>270 F.3d at 720-21 (ALJ properly discounted treating physicians\u2019 opinions as to claimant\u2019s RFC, in part because they were based on relatively short-term treating relationships). Dr. Kroker himself stated that the tests upon which he relied were not well accepted in the medical community. <em>See Brown v. Shalala, </em>15 F.3d 97, 99-100 (8th Cir.1994) (discussing such tests, and noting that environmental-illness diagnosis must be based on medically acceptable diagnostic techniques).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Finally, Chapman complains that the ALJ\u2019s RFC findings did not take into account her severe reactions to only small amounts of allergens. Because we conclude that the ALJ properly discredited Chapman and properly discounted Dr. Kroker\u2019s opinion as to her RFC, we find that the RFC findings \u2014 which were consistent with the RFC opinions of other physicians \u2014 were supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Pearsall, </em>274 F.3d at 1217-18 (it is ALJ\u2019s responsibility to determine RFC based on medical records, observations of treating physicians and others, and claimant\u2019s own description of her limitations).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Chapman\u2019s remaining arguments provide no basis for reversal. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-13\">. The Honorable Ronald B. Longstaff, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
