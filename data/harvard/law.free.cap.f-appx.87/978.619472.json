Shepherd argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is an overly broad assertion of Commerce Clause power that unconstitutionally burdens the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Shepherd further argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) violates the Equal Protection Clause. Shepherd\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Darrington, </em>351 F.3d 632 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-23\">Shepherd also challenges his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction as a violation of the Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment. He argues that the Government did not produce evidence that the firearm was in or substantially affected interstate commerce. Shepherd concedes that these arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 &amp; n. 12 (5th Cir.2001), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1014-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
