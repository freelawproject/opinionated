We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of Sarabia\u2019s application, <em>Singh v. Ilchert, </em>63 F.3d 1501, 1506 (9th Cir.1995), conclude that she would have been ineligible for relief under former \u00a7 212(c), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-23\">Sarabia cannot rely on <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), to claim eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief because she was an aggravated felon who had served at least five years imprisonment. Nor is her argument that she actually served less than five years of her ten-year sentence when she applied for \u00a7 212(c) relief persuasive. Former \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s ineligibility provision does not distinguish between those periods of imprisonment served as a result of a base offense from time served as a result of any \u201cenhancement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-24\">To accept Sarabia\u2019s position that the service of the INS notice to appear \u201cstopped the clock\u201d for the purpose of calculating the five-year \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d bar under former \u00a7 212(c) would require us to rewrite the statute, which we decline to do. Congress knows how to create a stop clock provision and saw fit to enact one for the cancellation of removal remedy. It did not, however, provide any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>analogous authorization under the former \u00a7 212(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b716-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this Circuit, except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
