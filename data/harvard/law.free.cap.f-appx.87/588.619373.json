The district court denied Parker\u2019s motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>In 1992, while serving a 142-month federal sentence in California, Parker used a prison telephone to coordinate the sale of cocaine and heroin in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, area as well as inside the California prison. Parker was convicted of conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1), and sentenced to 420 months\u2019 imprisonment to run consecutively to the sentence he was already serving. Parker appealed, and we affirmed. <em>United States v. James, </em>40 F.3d 850 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">After changes to the sentencing guidelines became effective in November 2002, Parker moved to modify his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c). That provision authorizes a motion for a reduction in sentence when a subsequent amendment to the sentencing guidelines lowers a defendant\u2019s relevant sentencing range, as long as the reduction is consistent with the policies of the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); <em>United States v. Tidwell, </em>178 F.3d 946, 949 (7th Cir.1999). The applicable policy statement is found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and provides that a reduction in a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is authorized under \u00a7 3582(c) only if \u201cthe guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (e).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In his motion Parker did not point to a specific amendment entitling him to a sentence reduction, stating only that the relevant amendment went into effect in November 2002 and that it modified \u00a7 5G1.3. In his brief on appeal, however, Parker identifies the relevant provision as Amendment 599. But as the government correctly points out, Amendment 599 went into effect in November 2000 and modified U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, the offense guideline for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The government suggests that Parker simply made a \u201ctypographical error\u201d and intended to base his motion on Amendment 645, a November 2002 modification to the commentary to \u00a7 5G1.3. In his reply brief Parker agrees that Amendment 645 is at issue, so we will consider only whether Parker can receive a reduction in his sentence due to Amendment 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Amendment 645, however, is not applicable to Parker. Parker\u2019s consecutive sentence was imposed under \u00a7 5G1.3(a), which directs a court to impose a consecutive sentence where the offense was committed while the defendant was serving an undischarged term of imprisonment. Amendment 645, on the other hand, modifies \u00a7 5G1.3(b). Though Parker correctly notes that \u00a7 5G1.3(b) directs a court to impose concurrent sentences in certain circumstances, the provision applies only if \u00a7 5G1.3(a) does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">But even if Amendment 645 applied to Parker, he would still lose because Amendment 645 is not one of the amendments listed as retroactive in \u00a7 1B1.10(e). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (\u201cAmendments covered by this policy statement are ...: 126, 130, 156, 176, 269, 329, 341, 371, 379, 380, 433, 454, 461, 484, 488, 490, 499, 505, 506, 516, 591, 599, and 606.\u201d). Thus, the district court correctly concluded that it cannot be given retroactive application. <em>See Ebbole v. United States, </em>8 F.3d 530, 539 (7th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
