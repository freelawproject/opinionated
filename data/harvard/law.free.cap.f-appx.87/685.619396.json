Tin\u2019s amended habeas petition challenged the INS\u2019s denial of his application for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a. The district court dismissed Tiu\u2019s petition on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to review the INS\u2019 discretionary adjustment of status determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-22\">We have jurisdiction to review the final order of a district judge in a habeas corpus proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition <em>de novo. See Noriegar-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 874, 878 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-23\">The scope of habeas jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is limited to claims that allege constitutional or statutory error. Habeas corpus is not available simply to change the discretionary result reached by the INS. <em>See Gutierrez-Chavez v. INS, </em>298 F.3d 824, 828 (9th Cir.2002). \u201cHabeas is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>available to claim that the INS somehow failed to exercise discretion in accordance with federal law or did so in an unconstitutional manner[, but it] is not available to claim that the INS simply came to an unwise, yet lawful, conclusion when it did exercise its discretion.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 435, 439 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Tiu\u2019s habeas petition challenges the INS\u2019s denial of his application for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a. This is a discretionary decision that is not subject to judicial review, except in the context of a review of an order of deportation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(f)(4)(A). Tiu does not allege that the INS failed to exercise its discretion in accordance with federal law. Nor does he identify any constitutional deficiencies in the INS\u2019s process for determining adjustment of status eligibility. Instead of challenging the manner in which the INS reached its decision regarding adjustment of status, Tiu is challenging the merits of the INS\u2019s decision. Petitions for \"writ of habeas corpus that seek to change the discretionary result reached by the INS are outside of the jurisdictional scope of \u00a7 2241. <em>See Gutierrez-Chavez, </em>298 F.3d at 830-31.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b721-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\">.
