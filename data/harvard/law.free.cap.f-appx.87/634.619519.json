We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), as amended by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996). Because the BIA affirmed the decision of the IJ without discussion, we review the Id\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(iii); <em>Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir.2003). We review adverse credibility determinations under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The Id\u2019s reasoning was cogent \u2014 the Id pointed to a number of specific flaws in Noubaravatcharian\u2019s testimony: (1) Noubaravatcharian testified that she became an anti-war supporter in 1992, which contradicted the pro-war stance she took in her asylum application; (2) Noubaravatcharian was inconsistent about her level of activity with the Heheshe party; and (3) Noubaravatcharian was inconsistent as to when she first began to support the Heheshe party. Each of these inconsistencies goes to the heart of Noubaravatcharian\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal because they concern her fears of future prosecution in Armenia based on her anti-war stance, as well as her claims of past persecution for involvement with the Heheshe. Additionally, the Id believed that Noubaravatcharian\u2019s demeanor was evasive and non-responsive. Special deference is given to a credibility determination based on an applicant\u2019s demeanor. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999). The Id\u2019s adverse credibility finding is thus supported by substantial evidence and we deny Noubaravatcharian\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b670-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
