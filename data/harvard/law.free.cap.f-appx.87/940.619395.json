Gooden, Texas prisoner # 1151163, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). He argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint as barred by the two-year statute of limitations because he was not aware of his claim until July 29, 2000, when he was not released as scheduled. He argues that he was required to serve more than his five-year sentence because he did not receive credit for time he spent on probation from January 1993 through August 1, 1995; he raised this argument in grievances filed in 1996 and 1997. Because Gooden was aware of his claim in 1996 or 1997, but he did not file this civil action until May 24, 2002, the district court did not err in dismissing his action as barred by the two-year statute of limitations. <em>See Gartrell v. Gaylor, </em>981 F.2d 254, 257 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, Gooden\u2019s action is not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 as he has not shown that his sentences were reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by an authorized state tribunal, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See Heck v. </em>Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>Randell v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 300, 301 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">For the first time on appeal, Gooden raises claims that prison officials violated his rights under the Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments and under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241, 242, and 246. He also argues for the first time on appeal that he was denied access to the courts and that prison officials sprayed him with mace and refused to allow him to take a shower during the following 24 hours. This court will not consider claims raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">Gooden\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, it is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Gooden is cautioned that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Gooden\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
