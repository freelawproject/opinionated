For the first time on appeal, he argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Leija concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but he nevertheless seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review. He also challenges the provision of the written judgment that prohibits him from possessing a dangerous weapon, arguing that such provision conflicts with the district court\u2019s oral sentence. Because both of Leija\u2019s arguments are directly foreclosed by circuit precedent, we pretermit a determination whether Leija waived his arguments under the terms of the plea agreement. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal based on the waiver is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-21\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>see also United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must therefore follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation and citation omitted). Accordingly, Leija\u2019s argument that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional based on the decision in <em>Apprendi </em>is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-22\">If the district court orally imposes a sentence of supervised release without stating the conditions applicable to the supervision period, the written judgment\u2019s inclusion of conditions that are mandatory, standard, or recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines does not create a conflict with the oral pronouncement of sentence. <em>See United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 937-38 (5th Cir.2003). Possession of any \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d during the term of supervised release is a \u201cstandard\u201d condition; therefore, the district court\u2019s written judgment does not conflict with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence. <em>Id. </em>Leija\u2019s reliance on unpublished and non-binding authority to the contrary is unavailing. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 47.5.4; <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Montelongo, </em>263 F.3d 429, 433 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">AFFIRMED. MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
