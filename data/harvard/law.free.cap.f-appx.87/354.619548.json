To the extent that Ho is challenging the proceedings in the prior state court action, those claims are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court\u2019s judgment, and the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the allegations under the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine. Ho\u2019s attempts to challenge the propriety of the ruling in her first civil action by the federal district court is also improper. To the extent that Ho is repeating her challenges to her dismissal from the university\u2019s doctoral program, her claims are barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. See Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 165-66, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985); <em>Nilsen v. City of Moss Point, Miss., </em>701 F.2d 556, 560 (5th Cir.1983) (en banc). The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
