We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Roe\u2019s sole contention is that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence on the ground that'he possessed the handgun in connection with another felony, possession of crack cocaine. Section 2K2.1(b)(5) of the Sentencing Guidelines authorizes a four-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level for such conduct. Roe relies on his own hearing testimony, in which he denied having possessed the crack, and the fact that the initial version of the police report erroneously stated that the crack was found on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">\u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s determination of witness credibility [for sentencing purposes] for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 593 (5th Cir.2000). Moreover, \u201cthe defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the information the district court relied on is \u2018materially untrue.\u201d\u2019 <em>Id. </em>The <em>Ocana </em>court accepted the district court\u2019s credibility determinations even though there were inconsistencies in the government witnesses\u2019 testimony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">Roe contends that the district court clearly erred in finding that he discarded the crack while being chased by Police Detective Coleman. However, the initial police report written by Officers Vincent and Franklin does not invalidate the version of the facts presented by Detective C\u00f3leman and ATF Agent Davenport, because the former two officers were not present when Coleman retrieved the crack. Moreover, although Roe denies having possessed the crack, his brief does not advert to the agent\u2019s testimony that Roe confessed that he had possessed it to sell. Thus the district court\u2019s finding that Roe possessed crack in connection with his firearm possession, based principally on the government witnesses\u2019 testimony, is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b976-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
