Ruano sought to challenge the defendant\u2019s determination that Ruano was not entitled to a reopening of her disability claims under the terms of the settlement in <em>Stieberger v. Sullivan, </em>801 F.Supp. 1079 (S.D.N.Y.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Substantially for the reasons stated by the district court, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Ruano v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>2003 WL 192170 (S.D.N.Y. Jan.27, 2003). Although Ruano applied for Supplemental Security Insurance benefits in 1985 and 1987, Ruano concedes that, in both instances, she did not press her case to the Administrative Law Judge or Appeals Counsel level. As such, under the terms of the settlement, she is not entitled to a reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Ruano raises several additional arguments on appeal which we have considered, and find to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
