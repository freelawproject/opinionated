Fisher does not challenge the imposition of 78 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. Instead, he argues in a brief filed under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), that he should not be responsible for any funeral or burial expenses because he was not convicted of murdering the victim. Upon review of the record, it is apparent that he was not ordered to pay any funeral or burial expenses. Rather, the $5,630 in restitution the district court ordered Fisher to pay to the representative of the victim\u2019s estate \u2014 jointly and severally with three other individuals \u2014 included reimbursement only for grief counseling, lost wages, transportation, and the victim\u2019s coat. Fisher\u2019s argument on appeal is therefore unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-22\">We have reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>(1988), for any nonfrivolous issue, and we have found none. Accordingly, we affirm. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-15\">. The Honorable Donovan W. Frank, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
