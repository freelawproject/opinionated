On January 9, 2003, Herd was charged, in a five-count information, with using a communication facility to facilitate the commission of a federal narcotics offense, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). That day, Herd pled guilty to all five counts of the information. On May 27, 2003, the district court sentenced Herd to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a one-year term of supervised release to be served in the Southern District of New York, and a mandatory $500 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">On appeal, Herd argues that the district court abused its discretion by requiring him to complete his term of supervised release in the Southern District of New York, rather than in Vermont, his home state. Herd further argues that the district court erred by failing to articulate findings supporting its decision to require this \u201cunusual and severe\u201d condition of supervised release. Although we typically review the district court\u2019s sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>248 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir.2001), because Herd did not raise these objections at the sentencing proceedings, we review the district court\u2019s decision for plain error. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>352 F.3d 654, 663 (2d Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Crowley, </em>318 F.3d 401, 415 (defining \u201cplain error\u201d as that which is a \u201cclear or obvious deviation from current law that affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). We find that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision did not constitute plain error, as it was well within the court\u2019s discretion to impose a condition of supervised release, and that the decision did not affect Herd\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Herd argues that the district court\u2019s condition, requiring him to complete supervised release in the Southern District of New York, is unrelated to the goals of sentencing \u2014 deterrence, rehabilitation of the defendant and protection of the public \u2014 and is therefore improper. [Blue Kill] We find this argument unavailing, as the district court has explicit discretion to order Herd, as a condition of supervised release, to \u201cremain within the jurisdiction of the court,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563(b)(14), so long the discretionary condition \u201cis reasonably related\u201d to the goals of sentencing, and \u201cinvolves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(1), (2). The district court recognized that Vermont had been the site of Herd\u2019s prior drug and criminal activity, and concluded that the prospect of Herd\u2019s successful completion of a drug rehabilitation program would be compromised if he remained in Vermont during supervised release. The district court\u2019s decision to require Herd to reside in and undergo drug treatment in the Southern District during supervised release was clearly intended to further the goal of \u201cproviding] the defendant with needed ... medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). Moreover, the district court noted that, upon successful completion of in-patient drug treatment in the Southern District, it would consider transferring Herd to another district \u2014 presumably Vermont \u2014 for the remainder of his supervised release term. Under these circumstances, it is clear that the district court\u2019s efforts were reasonably related to achieving Herd\u2019s rehabilitation, and that Herd was not unduly prejudiced by the imposition of this condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Herd also argues that the district court did not articulate any reason or basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>imposing the condition requiring Herd\u2019s residence in the Southern District of New York during supervised release. [Blue 14] Contrary to Herd\u2019s contention, during the sentencing proceedings, the district court explicitly noted Herd\u2019s lengthy history of drug abuse and criminal activity in Vermont, which had been documented in the presentence report adopted by the court. [A 40] The court further noted that it would require Herd to reside in the Southern District during his period of supervised release in order avoid the possibility of recidivism and to facilitate its supervision of Herd\u2019s rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
