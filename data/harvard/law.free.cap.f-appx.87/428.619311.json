Guerra argues that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the mere movement of a firearm from one state to another does not constitute a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect on interstate commerce; and (2) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied because it does not require a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect on interstate commerce. Guerra raises these arguments solely to preserve them for possible Supreme Court review. As he acknowledges, his arguments are foreclosed by existing Fifth Circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 517-18 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Guerra also contends that a conflict exists between the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment because the written judgment contains a condition of supervised release prohibiting the possession of a dangerous weapon but, at the sentencing hearing, the court did not mention this prohibition. For the reasons set forth in <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 935-38 (5th Cir.2003), we conclude that the district court\u2019s omission of the dangerous-weapon prohibition during the oral pronouncement of sentence did not create a conflict with the sentence set forth in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
