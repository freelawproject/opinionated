The District Court sentenced Kitchen to 57 months imprisonment. Kitchen appeals the District Court\u2019s decision at sentencing to depart upward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.2 because of a significant physical injury sustained by a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Between March 2000 and October 2001, Kitchen purchased 19 separate firearms from licensed firearms dealers in the Philadelphia area and then illegally resold those firearms to different individuals. Kitchen resold multiple firearms to two individuals who Kitchen knew' to be drug dealers. On at least one occasion, Kitchen altered or obliterated the serial number from a firearm that he resold.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">On April 14, 2000, Kitchen purchased and illegally resold a 9 mm Bryco Arms semiautomatic pistol. Thirteen months later, that firearm was used by a motorist to shoot Julio Muniz in an apparent \u201croad rage\u201d incident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Muniz was shot multiple times in the abdomen and legs. Muniz suffered a shattered femur and severe tissue and nerve damage, and required extensive surgery to reconstruct one of his legs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">How the firearm used to shoot Muniz traveled from Kitchen\u2019s hands is unknown. The individual who shot Muniz did not obtain the firearm directly from Kitchen, and the record contains no evidence regarding the identity of the person to whom Kitchen originally sold that firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, Kitchen\u2019s convictions resulted in a base offense level of 14. Kitchen\u2019s offense level was adjusted upward (a) two levels because one of the firearms had an altered or obliterated serial number, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4); (b) four levels because there were between 8 and 24 firearms illegally sold, \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B); and (c) four levels because Kitchen distributed firearms to individuals whom he knew were involved in illegal drug sales, \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). Kitchen\u2019s offense level was adjusted downward three levels for acceptance of responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Because Kitchen had no criminal history, his offense level yielded a sentencing range of 37 to 46 months. Pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.2 and based on the injuries to Muniz, the District Court departed upward two levels for engaging in conduct that resulted in significant injury to another person, yielding a sentencing range of 46 to 57 months. The District Court sentenced Kitchen to the maximum 57 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">Kitchen appeals only the District Court\u2019s upward departure under \u00a7 5K2.2. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). As this is an appeal challenging a departure from the applicable guidelines range, we review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">A district court may \u201cimpose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable guidelines, if the court finds \u2018that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\u2019 \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)); <em>see also United States v. Philiposian, </em>267 F.3d 214, 219 (3d Cir.2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Sentencing Guidelines provide a list of \u201cencouraged factors\u201d upon which departure may be based. <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 94, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 (\u201cidentifying some of the factors that the Commission has not been able to take into account fully in formulating the guidelines\u201d). Section 5K2.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines identifies \u201csignificant personal injury\u201d as an encouraged factor for departure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">If significant physical injury resulted, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range. The extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the extent of the injury, the degree to which it may prove permanent, and the extent to which the injury was intended or knowingly risked. When the victim suffers a major, permanent disability and when such injury was intentionally inflicted, a substantial departure may be appropriate. If the injury is less serious or if the defendant (though criminally negligent) did not knowingly create the risk of harm, a less substantial departure would be indicated. In general, the same considerations apply as in \u00a7 5K2.1 [Death],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">Departures based on encouraged factors are authorized if the substantive offense Guideline does not already take the factor into account. <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">Kitchen concedes that the injuries suffered by Muniz are significant and were caused by the use of one of the firearms that Kitchen illegally resold. Nevertheless, Kitchen argues that the substantive guideline applicable to firearms offenses, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, already addresses the factors on which the District Court based its departure. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">Our cases establish that \u00a7 2K2.1 generally precludes departure based on the <em>potential </em>that illegally sold firearms will be used in future crimes. <em>United States v. Cicirello, </em>301 F.3d 135, 143-45 (3d Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Bass, </em>54 F.3d 125, 130-31 (3d Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Uca, </em>867 F.2d 783, 788-90 (3d Cir.1989). This is because \u201cthe guidelines regarding illegal gun activity already contain some presumption of intended unlawful use that is factored into the base offense level.\u201d <em>Cicirello, </em>301 F.3d at 144. But although \u00a7 2K2.1 generally addresses the <em>potential </em>for the criminal use of illegally sold firearms, that guideline does not account for <em>actual </em>injury inflicted with such weapons. Section 2K2.1 thus does not address the critical factor presented to the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Court in this case, namely, the significant physical injuries to Muniz. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3) (adjusting the offense level for robbery \u201c[i]f any victim sustained bodily injury\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 (\u201c[Pjhysical injury would not warrant departure from the guidelines when the robbery offense guideline is applicable because the robbery guideline includes a specific adjustment based on the extent of any injury.\u201d). We therefore agree with the District Court that Muniz\u2019s injuries take this case out of the \u201cheartland\u201d of \u00a7 2K2.1. U.S.S.G., Ch. 1, pt. A \u00a7 4(b) (\u201cThe Commission intends the sentencing courts to treat each guideline as carving out a \u2018heartland,\u2019 a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline describes.\u201d); <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 92-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Kitchen further argues that \u00a7 5K2.2 requires a \u201clegal nexus\u201d between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury that is the basis for departure, and that such a nexus is absent in this case. Kitchen explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af\">[N]o evidence exists the Appellant sold the handgun [that was used to shoot Muniz] to a known felon; no evidence exists the Appellant sold the handgun to the buyer of the handgun so that the buyer could engage in criminal activity; no evidence exists as to how many hands the handgun passed prior to the shooting thirteen (13) months later; no evidence exists the buyer of the handgun was the shooter; no evidence exists the Appellant was involved in, part of, or aware of the shooting of Mr. Muniz; and, the serial number of this handgun was no[t] obliterated indicating that neither the Appellant, the buyer, nor the ultimate possessor(s) of the handgun sought to conceal the identity of the handgun for any illegal purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Br. at 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">A careful reading of \u00a7 5K2.2 demonstrates that the nexus sufficient to support departure is broader than that advanced by Kitchen. Section 5K2.2 expressly applies where the injury is \u201cknowingly risked,\u201d as opposed to \u201cintended.\u201d Indeed, the Guideline applies - albeit with \u201ca less substantial departure\u201d-where \u201cthe defendant (though criminally negligent) did not knowingly create the risk of harm.\u201d \u201cCriminally negligent\u201d is defined elsewhere in the Sentencing Guidelines as referring to \u201cconduct that involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise under the circumstances, but which is not reckless.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.4 cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">We conclude that Kitchen was sufficiently culpable to warrant departure under \u00a7 5K2.2. As our decisions in <em>Cicirello, Uca, </em>and <em>Bass </em>make clear, the risk that illegal firearms will be used in future crimes lies at the core of the substantive firearms guidelines. Although this potential, standing alone, ordinarily is not a proper basis for departure, here that potential was realized. By engaging in the offense of conviction, Kitchen knowingly created and deliberately disregarded the risk that one or more firearms would be used to criminally injure another person.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We therefore agree with the District Court that Kitchen\u2019s illegal sale of a firearm recklessly initiated \u201cthe chain of circumstances that resulted in injury to Mr. Muniz.\u201d App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>66; <em>see United States v. Diaz, </em>285 F.3d 92, 101 (1st Cir.2002) (\u201cWe see no basis for foreclosing departure under \u00a7 5K2.1 when a defendant puts into motion a chain of events that risks serious injury or death, even when an intent to harm is entirely absent and the defendant was not directly responsible for the death.\u201d); <em>United States v. White, </em>979 F.2d 539, 544-45 (7th Cir.1992) (affirming departure under \u00a7 5K2.1 for defendant convicted of interstate transportation of a minor for the purpose of prostitution; defendant\u2019s offense knowingly risked the minor\u2019s death because it \u201c \u2018put into motion a scenario that had the inevitable tragic result that this one did\u2019 \u201d (quoting sentencing court)); <em>United States v. Ihegworo, </em>959 F.2d 26, 29-30 (5th Cir.1992) (affirming upward departure under \u00a7 5K2.1 for defendant convicted of distribution of heroin based on the accidental overdose of one of his customers; court held that defendant \u201c \u2018reasonably foresaw death or serious bodily injury as a result of the heroin he was distributing\u2019 \u201d (quoting sentencing court)).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Importantly, the District Court did take Kitchen\u2019s attenuated role in Muniz\u2019s injuries into account in determining the extent of the departure, which is not challenged on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Diaz, </em>285 F.3d at 101 (observing, in the context of \u00a7 5K2.1, that defendant\u2019s intent should bear on the extent of departure). The Government had moved for a six-level departure. Kitchen argued that, if a departure were granted, it should be limited to two levels because Kitchen\u2019s conduct was only indirectly related to Muniz\u2019s injuries. The District Court agreed, limiting the departure to two levels:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">There is no proof, though, that the person to whom he sold the guns, the one involved in the classroom and the one that shot Mr. Muniz, were sold to drug dealers, or that the persons who possessed them at the end were drug dealers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">The guns were not those with obliterated serial numbers. There\u2019s no evidence that the persons who possessed them were convicted felons.... [A]nd there\u2019s no evidence that the persons who possessed the guns at the end of the events pertaining to those guns were the persons who purchased the guns directly from Mr. Kitchen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">App. at 66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">Departure in this case was available under \u00a7 5K2.2 because the guidelines applicable to Kitchen\u2019s offense do not adequately account for the actual injuries suffered by Muniz. Furthermore, because Kitchen recklessly initiated a course of events that resulted in Muniz\u2019s injuries, departure was warranted in this case. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\">. We use the term \"road rage\u201d to describe the circumstances of the shooting of Muniz, as this term was used by both parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\">. Government authorities recovered two of the 19 firearms sold by Kitchen. The firearm used to shoot Muniz was seized on the day of the shooting. A second firearm-also a 9 mm Bryco pistol-was discovered along with 12 rounds of ammunition in a student's book bag at Spring Garden Elementary School in Philadelphia. No one is known to have been injured by this second firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-16\">.

As discussed above, Kitchen's sentence was enhanced for selling firearms to known criminals (in this case, known drug dealers) and for obliterating the serial number from one firearm. These enhancements, neither of which is challenged on appeal, reinforce our conclusion that Kitchen was aware of the possible downstream use of illegally resold firearms. Although the record contains no evidence that the firearm used to shoot Muniz was sold to a known felon, or that its serial number was removed, his conduct with respect to other firearms sales confirms his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>appreciation of the risk of significant physical injury resulting from his offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
