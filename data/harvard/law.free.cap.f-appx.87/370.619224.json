Appellant Fabian Shawl argues that the jury erred by awarding only $12,000 in general damages for pain and suffering. Shawl made the same argument before the district court in a Rule 59 motion arguing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>an increase in the general damages awarded by the jury. On April 7, 2003, the district court issued a written order denying Shawl\u2019s motion for additur. We review a district court\u2019s award of damages for clear error. <em>See Nichols v. Petroleum Helicopters, Inc., </em>17 F.3d 119, 121 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201c[M]ere disagreement with the district court\u2019s analysis of the record is insufficient ... we will not reverse a finding although there is evidence to support it, unless the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). After closely reviewing the record below, we find no clear error and agree with the district court\u2019s well-reasoned resolution of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
