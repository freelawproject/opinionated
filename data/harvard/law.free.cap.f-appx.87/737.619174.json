Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Michael T. Jim\u2019s appeal of the August 11, 2003 order of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, <em>Jim v. Principi, </em>No. 02-0707, 2003 WL 21962439 (Vet.App. August 11, 2003), for lack of jurisdiction or, in the alternative, to summarily affirm in part. Jim has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-20\">Jim appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims from a May 8, 2002 decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals that determined there was no clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a 1956 regional office (RO) decision that had denied service connection for multiple conditions. Jim argued that the RO committed CUE in 1956 by denying service connection for scoliosis and ankylosing spondylitis, and that the Board failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases why a diagnosis of osteoporosis did not give rise to an inference of ankylosing spondylitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-21\">With regard to Jim\u2019s CUE allegation concerning scoliosis, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims stated that this argument was presented \u201cfor the first time in his brief for this appeal, and there is no mention of this argument anywhere in the record on appeal.\u201d Accordingly, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims determined that it was \u201cjurisdictionally barred from hearing such a claim in the first instance.\u201d As to Jim\u2019s CUE challenge pertaining to ankylosing spondylitis, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims noted that Jim merely disagreed with how the facts were weighed or evaluated and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>in the absence of \u201cevidence that \u2018undebatable\u2019 error was made by the RO, the CUE claim is not valid,\u201d citing <em>Russell v. Principi, </em>3 Vet.App. 310 (1992) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims concluded that the Board provided an adequate statement of reasons or bases in deciding that there was no CUE in the 1956 RO decision. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims stated that \u201cdisagreement with a medical diagnosis or disagreement as to how the facts were weighed and evaluated is not a valid basis for a CUE claim.\u201d The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, holding that the Board\u2019s CUE decision was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d (38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7261(a)(3)(A)), and that Jim failed to show that the Board erred under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(d)(1) \u201cin its articulation of reasons or bases so as to warrant reversal or remand.\u201d Jim appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). This court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Jim\u2019s appeal does not satisfy any of the grounds for invoking this court\u2019s jurisdiction. In his informal brief, Jim concedes that the decision on appeal did not involve the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation and that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims did not decide a constitutional issue. Jim asserts that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims failed to properly weigh the evidence from certain x-rays and failed to afford him the benefit of the doubt. Applying the law of CUE to the facts, the Court of Appeals for Veterans. Claims repeatedly stated that Jim\u2019s disagreement as to how the facts (e.g., the x-rays) were weighed did not constitute a valid CUE claim. Accordingly, his challenge pertaining to the weighing of evidence falls outside of this court\u2019s jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims factual determinations pertaining to the sufficiency of Jim\u2019s CUE claim or application of the law of CUE to the facts are not within our jurisdiction. In these circumstances, this court lacks jurisdiction to review Jim\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">(3) The Secretary\u2019s alternative motion to summarily affirm in part is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
