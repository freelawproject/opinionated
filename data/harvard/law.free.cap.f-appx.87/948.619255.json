California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Broussard was advised of the motion and served with a copy of counsel\u2019s brief, but has not filed a response to the motion. Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities in this case, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b984-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
