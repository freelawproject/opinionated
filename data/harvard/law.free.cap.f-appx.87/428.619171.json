The court indicated that it was striking the plaintiffs\u2019 notice of removal because they had failed to file the necessary state-court papers, had failed to file individual notices of removal, and had failed to pay sanctions that had been imposed upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-16\">The plaintiffs now summarily argue that, in striking their notice of removal, the district court abused its discretion, committed \u201cjudicial error,\u201d entered a \u201cbiased and prejudicial ruling,\u201d and acted in an \u201cindividual capacity.\u201d They provide virtually no citations to the record or to relevant legal authority. They have not adequately briefed their challenges to the validity of the district court\u2019s order striking their notice of removal, and we will not consider their arguments. <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). The appeal is frivolous, and it is DISMISSED. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-19\">Plaintiff Lawrence\u2019s motion for substitution of parties is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-20\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
