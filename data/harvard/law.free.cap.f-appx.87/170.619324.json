Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Henry L. Kince\u2019s appeal of the July 7, 2003 order of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, <em>Kince v. Principi, </em>No. 01-653 (Vet.App. July 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>2003), because he has appealed from a nonfinal order. Kince opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">On March 8, 2001, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals issued two decisions relating to Kince\u2019s various claims. Kince appealed the Board\u2019s decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Briefing concluded on September 16, 2002. Thereafter, from November 2002 to June 2003, Kince submitted to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ten documents addressed to the Board or the RO, including correspondence and motions, which Kince concedes in his appellate brief to this court \u201cwere sent to the [Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims] inadvertently, and by error,\u201d and which were not \u201cpart of my pleadings to the [Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims].\u201d Upon review of these various documents, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims concluded that the submissions \u201care not contemplated by the Court\u2019s Rules. Additionally to the extent that they refer to matters remanded by the [Board], the Court lacks jurisdiction to review them.\u201d The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ordered \u201call pleadings and other materials received from [Kince] after the completion of briefing ... be returned to him unfiled. [Kince] is reminded that the Court will not accept any further pleadings not contemplated by its Rules.\u201d Kince appealed from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">This court generally refuses to review nonfinal decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>Williams v. Principi, </em>275 F.3d 136, 1363 (Fed.Cir.2002). The order from which Kince appeals is nonfinal and interlocutory. In reviewing Kince\u2019s opposition and brief, it appears that he is under the mistaken belief that the documents he concedes were not intended to be delivered to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims were used by that court to \u201cdeny my claim of CUE\u201d for lack of jurisdiction. However, that court\u2019s order does not in any way deal with the merits of, or its jurisdiction over, Kince\u2019s appeal. It only served to return papers Kince admits he never intended to submit to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims order is not final and Kince has not shown that interlocutory review by this court is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
