We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Markarian administratively exhausted his procedural due process claims by raising them in his brief to the BIA. <em>See Ladha v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 889, 903 (9th Cir.2000). To the extent the IJ questioned Markarian aggressively or harshly, the IJ\u2019s behavior did not rise to the level of a due process violation on the facts of this case. <em>See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1072 (9th Cir.2003). Futher, Markarian was not prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s pretermission of his father\u2019s testimony because the record indicates that Markarian\u2019s attorney did not plan to have petitioner\u2019s father testify. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because Markarian testified inconsistently about where he was persecuted by Armenian police. <em>See Chebchoub, </em>257 F.3d at 1043 (indicating that an inconsistency can support an adverse credibility finding if it goes to the heart of the claim). Accordingly, the IJ properly denied Markarian\u2019s claim for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Valderrama v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 1083, 1085 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b65-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
