Sav. Bank v. United States, </em>54 Fed. Cl. 120 (2002) <em>(\u201cCharter II\"). </em>Because we find that issue preclusion does not apply, we <em>reverse </em>the decision of the Court of Federal Claims and <em>remand </em>for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-19\">Charter acquired several failing thrifts in the 1980s with the expectation that the \u201csupervisory goodwill\u201d resulting from its acquisitions would be amortized over several years. On August 8, 1989, however, Congress enacted the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, Pub.L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183 (1989) (\u201cFIRREA\u201d), which \u201cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>hauled the structure of federal thrift regulation\u201d by, among other things, prohibiting the use of supervisory goodwill as an asset to satisfy capital requirements. <em>See Castle v. United States, </em>301 F.3d 1328, 1333 (Fed. Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Winstar Corp., </em>518 U.S. 839, 856, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996). FIRREA had a negative impact on Charter\u2019s business, leading it to file suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia for a declaratory judgment that the government had promised to exempt Charter from the application of any legislation (such as FIRREA) that would interfere with its ability to amortize supervisory goodwill. The district court issued a judgment in Charter\u2019s favor, <em>Charter Fed. Sav. Bank v. Dir., Office of Thrift Supervision, </em>773 F.Supp. 809 (W.D.Va.1991), but the Fourth Circuit reversed, <em>Charter Fed. Sav. Bank v. Dir., Office of Thrift Supervision, </em>976 F.2d 203 (4th Cir.1992) <em>(\u201cCharter </em>I\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Charter then filed the instant lawsuit against the government at the Court of Federal Claims, alleging breach of contract, breach of contract implied-in-law, frustration of contract and commercial impracticability, and unconstitutional taking of property. Specifically, Charter alleged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-5\">Charter and agencies of the United States, entered into valid and binding enforceable contracts in connection with plaintiff\u2019s supervisory acquisitions of [three thrifts].... Defendant materially breached these contracts by unilaterally revoking an essential term of that agreement, namely the right of Charter to treat supervisory goodwill as an asset for regulatory capital purposes that could be amortized over an extended period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The government moved to dismiss Charter\u2019s contract claims for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, arguing that the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Charter I </em>precluded Charter from relitigating issues of contract formation and breach. The Court of Federal Claims granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the contract claims and then dismissed the takings claim for lack of jurisdiction. According to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-8\">Charter cannot prove here the obligation or duty arising out of a contract with the Government to provide the regulatory goodwill treatment desired by Charter in the face of contrary future regulations because that very issue was decided against it by the Fourth Circuit: \u201cthe FHLBB did not contractually obligate itself (or its successor agencies) to permit Charter to use supervisory goodwill to meet capital requirements in the face of contrary new regulations.\u201d <em>Charter I, </em>976 F.2d at 204. Thus the essential issue in both cases \u2014 whether there was a supervisory goodwill contract containing the promise relied upon by plaintiff \u2014 was presented to both courts, and decided by the Fourth Circuit adversely to plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-9\"><em>Charter II, </em>54 Fed. Cl. at 128-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">Charter appeals from this decision, arguing first that issue preclusion does not apply because the issues in <em>Charter I </em>and <em>Charter II </em>are not identical in all respects, and second, in the alternative, that \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d merit an exception to the doctrine of issue preclusion. We have jurisdiction to consider Charter\u2019s appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3). We review <em>de novo </em>the decision of the Court of Federal Claims dismissing Charter\u2019s complaint. <em>See Lindsay v. United States, </em>295 F.3d 1252, 1257 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">We first address Charter\u2019s argument that issue preclusion does not apply be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>cause the issues in <em>Charter I </em>and <em>Charter II </em>are not identical in all respects. Specifically, Charter argues that the Fourth Circuit deliberately avoided the issue of contract formation and instead presumed that a contract existed but did not include the particular promise by the government to exempt Charter from future capital regulations. Thus, according to Charter, the Fourth Circuit never reached the issue raised in <em>Charter II </em>of whether the government promised to insure Charter against any losses caused by a regulatory change such as FIRREA. Charter further supports its position by noting that the Fourth Circuit did not have jurisdiction to decide, and thus did not decide, whether the government promised to insure Charter against financial losses caused by regulatory changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">We agree with Charter. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s specific holding in <em>Charter I </em>is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-6\">We reverse the district court\u2019s decision on the merits and hold that the FHLBB did not contractually obligate itself (or its successor agencies) <em>to permit Charter to use supervisory goodwill to meet capital requirements in the face of contrary new regulations. </em>Therefore, OTS may enforce FIRREA\u2019s supervisory goodwill requirements against Charter without consequence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-7\"><em>Charter I, </em>976 F.2d at 204 (emphasis added). In reaching this holding, the court stated that its \u201creview is limited to whether a contract existed between Charter and FHLBB (or its replacement agency, OTS); and, if so, <em>whether the contract provided that Charter could treat supervisory goodwill as capital during the entire specified amortization period. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210 (emphasis added). We interpret this statement to mean that the specific issue considered and decided by the Fourth Circuit was whether the government promised to <em>exempt </em>Charter from any regulatory changes. This issue is not the same one raised by <em>Charter II, </em>which is whether the government promised to <em>pay </em>for any financial losses caused by regulatory changes. Moreover, the Fourth Circuit deliberately did not decide the broader issue of whether there was any kind of contract at all between Charter and the government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-9\">Since our case involves no written expressions of intent to contract nor any written contracts between the parties, we are reluctant to rule that a contract exists. <em>However, we need not decide the contract issue because we find, in any event, that the FHLBB did not promise to exempt Charter from future capital regulations. </em>We can assume, then, without deciding, the existence of an implied contract between FHLBB (or OTS) and Charter and resolve the case on the issue of contract interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 211. Thus, the general issue of whether there was a contract between Charter and the government remains open, as does the narrower issue raised by <em>Charter II </em>of whether any such contract included a promise by the government to pay for financial losses caused by a regulatory change.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">Certainly there is language in the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion that indicates a broader scope to its decision. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 204 (\u201cAt issue here is whether enforcement of the strict capital requirements of the recently enacted [FIRREA] abrogates prior agreements permitting use of supervisory goodwill as capital.\u201d) and <em>id. </em>at 210 (\u201cOTS may enforce FIRREA\u2019s supervisory goodwill requirements against Charter without consequence.\u201d). Nevertheless, the holding of the Fourth Circuit, twice stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>is quite clear: \u201cWe follow these cases and hold that the FHLBB <em>did not promise Charter continued use </em>of supervisory goodwill as regulatory capital in the face of a contrary regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 210 (\u201cWe reverse the district court\u2019s decision on the merits and hold that the FHLBB did not contractually obligate itself (or its successor agencies) <em>to permit Charter to use supervisory goodwill to meet capital requirements in the face of contrary new regulations. </em>\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">Given the Fourth Circuit\u2019s statement of its holding and its framing of the specific issue it was considering, we conclude that the issue decided by the Fourth Circuit in <em>Charter I </em>is not identical to the issues raised by <em>Charter II. </em>Moreover, to the extent it may be ambiguous what issues were actually decided by the Fourth Circuit, any such ambiguity should be resolved in Charter\u2019s favor. <em>See, e.g., Kearns v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>94 F.3d 1553, 1557 (Fed.Cir.1996) (stating that \u201cprecedent weighs heavily against denying litigants a day in court unless there is a clear and persuasive basis for that denial\u201d); <em>Eureka Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Am. Cas. Co., </em>873 F.2d 229, 233 (9th Cir. 1989) (\u201cCollateral estoppel is inappropriate if there is any doubt as to whether an issue was actually litigated in a prior proceeding.\u201d); <em>Memphis-Shelby County Airport Auth. v. Braniff Airways, Inc. (In re Braniff Airways, Inc.), </em>783 F.2d 1283, 1289 (5th Cir.1986) (\u201c[I]f reasonable doubt exists as to what was decided in the first action, the doctrine of res judicata should not be applied.\u201d); <em>McNellis v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>364 F.2d 251, 257 (2d Cir.1966) (\u201c[A] reasonable doubt as to what was decided in the first action should preclude the drastic remedy of foreclosing a party from litigating an essential issue.\u201d). We therefore conclude that issue preclusion does not apply in this case. <em>See Mother\u2019s Rest., Inc. v. Mama\u2019s Pizza, Inc., </em>723 F.2d 1566 (Fed.Cir.1983) (stating the requirements for issue preclusion). Because we have determined that issue preclusion does not apply, we do not reach Charter\u2019s alternative argument that we should make an exception in this case to the rules of preclusion. Thus, the decision of the Court of Federal Claims dismissing Charter\u2019s complaint is reversed and the case is remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
