Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-19\">A defendant\u2019s counsel provides ineffective assistance only where \u201cthat counsel\u2019s representation [falls] below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Although \u201cthis court has expressed a baseline aversion to resolving ineffectiveness claims on direct review,\u201d it has done so when, as here, \u201ctheir resolution is beyond any doubt or to do so would be in the interest of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Khedr, </em>343 F.3d 96, 99-100 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-20\">Khedr\u2019s counsel considered moving for severance and deliberately decided against doing so, informing the court \u201cthat such a motion [would have been] groundless.\u201d In any event, Khedr was not prejudiced because even had Khedr\u2019s counsel submitted this motion, the district court would not have erred in denying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-21\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
