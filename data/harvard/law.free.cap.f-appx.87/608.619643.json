Kenny, an account representative for a brokerage firm, violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by misrepresenting material facts to two individual investors and by aiding and abetting schemes to defraud two insurance companies. The SEC also found Kenny and his registered investment advisory firm, Nicholson Kenny Capital Management (NKCM), breached then-fiduciary duty to one of the insurance companies by failing to disclose a conflict of interest. Based on the findings, the SEC imposed sanctions on Kenny and NKCM. Kenny and NKCM petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">Kenny and NKCM first argue the SEC committed error in finding that they committed fraud, aiding and abetting, and breach of fiduciary duty violations of the securities laws. We reject these contentions because we are satisfied the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions are supported by substantial evidence on the administrative record as a whole. Kenny and NKCM next challenge the SEC\u2019s decision to bar Kenny from association with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser and to revoke NKCM\u2019s registration as an investment adviser. Applying the factors articulated in <em>Steadman v. SEC, </em>603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir.1979), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>450 U.S. 91, 101 S.Ct. 999, 67 L.Ed.2d 69 (1981), the SEC concluded these sanctions are in the public interest because the multiple violations were \u201cegregious,\u201d because Kenny by his conduct \u201cshows no appreciation of the responsibilities of a securities professional,\u201d and because \u201cKenny\u2019s continued involvement in the securities business presents opportunities for future violations.\u201d The sanctions are harsh. But after careful review of the record, we conclude the SEC articulated compelling reasons for imposing them and therefore did not abuse its substantial discretion to choose appropriate sanctions. <em>See Lowry v. SEC, </em>340 F.3d 501, 504-07 (8th Cir.2003); <em>Rizek v. SEC, </em>215 F.3d 157, 160-63 (1st Cir.2000). We reject petitioners\u2019 addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>tional arguments for the reasons stated in the SEC\u2019s opinion and affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
