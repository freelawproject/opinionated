We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1); we review the Id\u2019s decision as the final agency action, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7); <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 851 (9th Cir.2003); and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">As an alternative ground for his decision, the Id assumed that he had the authority absent the consent of the INS to grant Navarro permission to withdraw his application for admission. In light of Navarro\u2019s adverse immigration history, however, the Id decided not to exercise its discretion to grant the requested relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(a)(4). Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, we lack jurisdiction to review the Id\u2019s discretionary decision to deny relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). <em>See, e.g., Falcon Carriche, </em>350 F.3d at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The Id did not err when it denied Navarro\u2019s motion for cancellation of removal. Navarro is inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act because (1) he lacks proper documentation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I); and (2) he is an alien previously ordered removed under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(b)(1) who again seeks admission to the United States within five years of the date of such removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(I). The pending 1-130 petition filed by his spouse on his behalf, which has yet to be approved, does not provide a basis for cancellation of removal. <em>Cf. Agyeman v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 871, 879 &amp; n. 2 (9th Cir.2002) (even an approved 1-130 only establishes eligibility for adjustment of status; the agency must still decide to accord the status).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Navarro\u2019s petition for review is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
