With respect to their claim under D.C.Code \u00a7 31-2406(c) reasons are stated in the attached memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-22\">MEMORANDUM</p>\n<p id=\"b222-23\">Appellants argue that the applicable policy exclusion \u2014 providing no coverage for any person using a vehicle without a reasonable belief that he was entitled to do so (\u201creasonable belief exclusion\u201d) \u2014 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>preempted by the District of Columbia Compulsory No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 31-2401 to - 2413 (\u201cNo-Fault Act\u201d), specifically the following section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">Third-party personal liability coverage shall provide that any liability of an insured to pay for injury arising from an accident within or outside the District of Columbia, in accordance with applicable law, shall be paid by the insurer up to the amount established in the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtT\">D.C.Code \u00a7 31-2406(c); see also \u00a7 31-2402(10) (\u201cThe term \u2018insured\u2019 means a named insured or any other person insured in an insurance policy, with the exception of those persons specifically excluded by endorsement on the insurance policy.\u201d); \u00a7 31-2403(c)(1) (incorporating District of Columbia statutory coverage requirements into auto insurance policies). Relying on <em>Smalls v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>678 A.2d 32 (D.C.1996), appellants argue that because the reasonable belief exclusion allows Aetna to deny coverage in the circumstances specified (lack of a reasonable belief in entitlement), even where the insured is found liable to an injured third-party, the exclusion is preempted by \u00a7 31-2406(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Smalls </em>is misplaced. That case involved an insurer\u2019s attempt to limit third-party coverage to a particular class of <em>victims, </em>denying coverage to the insured and any members of the insured\u2019s household. See <em>Smalls, </em>678 A.2d at 36. Similarly, the statutory findings note that \u201cApproximately 50% of the <em>victims </em>do not satisfy the prerequisites to compensation under the present law.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 31-2401(a)(2)(A) (emphasis added). <em>Smalls </em>says nothing about an insurer\u2019s ability to exclude coverage for named insureds on the basis of the <em>insured\u2019s behavior, </em>and similarly the statutory findings make no reference to any problem with policy exclusions based on behavior of insureds, see D.C.Code \u00a7 31-2401(a)(A)-(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Yet under appellants\u2019 reading of the statute and of <em>Smalls, </em>all ordinary policy exclusions would become invalid; once someone is named in an insurance policy, the insurance company would be liable for the statutory minimum amount of third-party liability coverage under all circumstances. Cf. <em>Smalls, </em>678 A.2d at 36 (finding household exclusion clause \u201cinvalid only to the extent\u201d of any conflict, and that, so long as the minimum requirements of \u00a7 31-2406(c) are met, limits on further liability are not inconsistent with the Act). It seems highly improbable that the District of Columbia legislature intended such a dramatic change to customary insurance practices. Appellants\u2019 reading would, for example, override exclusions of liability for an insured\u2019s deliberate misconduct, which are ubiquitous, and which constrain the moral hazard that liability insurance may produce. See Eric Mills Holmes <em>&amp; </em>Mark S. Rhodes, <em>Holmes\u2019s Appleman on Insurance 2d </em>\u00a7 3.6, at 371-384 (2d ed.1996). On the other hand, Aetna\u2019s reading of \u00a7 31-2406(c) allows the contract to exclude indemnity for certain types of insured party behavior, but assures that a victim who prevails in court against the insured will not be denied access to a minimum level of coverage merely because of his identity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
