Counsel for Fields has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but presenting one issue for this Court\u2019s review. Fields was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-24\">Counsel suggests that the district court did not comply with the dictates of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Fields\u2019s plea. Fields did not object during the plea colloquy, nor did he move to withdraw his guilty plea. Accordingly, Fields\u2019s allegations are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 122 S. Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 527 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 899, 123 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002). To meet the plain error standard, (1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain, meaning obvious or clear under current law; and (3) the error must affect substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even if these criteria are met, an error will not be noticed unless it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 736. In light of the thorough plea colloquy by the district court, we conclude that the court did not violate Rule 11 in accepting Fields\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record for reversible error and have found none. Therefore, we affirm Fields\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
