Davis filed a purported 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition to challenge this sentence. The district court determined that Davis\u2019s purported 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition was best classed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it. Davis now appeals that dismissal. Given the benefit of liberal construction, his argument to this court may fairly be construed as alleging that he is entitled to bring a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because he is actually innocent of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In reviewing the denial of habeas relief, the district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). Davis has not shown that the district court erred in construing his pleading as an unauthorized 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion that should be dismissed. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
