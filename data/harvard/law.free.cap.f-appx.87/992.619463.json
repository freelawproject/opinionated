Boundy\u2019s motion to file a response to Dolenz\u2019s reply brief is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">Dolenz argues that Boundy filed his motion to voluntarily dismiss his complaint because he had received an adverse ruling on his motion for a summary judgment in his favor and was attempting to avoid an unfavorable result in the proceedings. Dolenz contends that Boundy would have not succeeded in his <em>qui tam </em>action because he was not an original source under the False Claim Act and did not have standing to bring the action. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(3)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">We review a Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2) dismissal without prejudice for abuse of discretion. A motion for voluntary dismissal should be granted \u201cunless the non-moving party will suffer some plain legal prejudice other than the mere prospect of a second lawsuit.\u201d <em>Elbaor v. Tripath Imaging Inc., </em>279 F.3d 314, 317 (5th Cir.2002). Dolenz has not shown that he will suffer plain legal prejudice from the dismissal \"without prejudice. <em>See id. </em>at 317-19; <em>Manshack v. Southwestern Elec. Power Co., </em>915 F.2d 172, 174 (5th Cir.1990). His arguments in his appellate brief challenging Boundy\u2019s standing as an original source are without merit. <em>See U.S. ex rel. Laird v. Lockheed Martin Engineering and Science Services Co., </em>336 F.3d 346, 352-55 (5th Cir.2003). We do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>Peavy v. WFAA-TV, Inc., </em>221 F.3d 158, 179 (5th Cir.2000). Also, Dolenz may re-urge his challenge to Boundy\u2019s standing as an original source if Boundy refiles his <em>qui tam </em>action. We do not address his other issues on appeal given the current status of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1029-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
