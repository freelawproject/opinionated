The district court sentenced him to 78 months in prison and a four-year term of supervised release. Phillips now appeals the judgment of the district court. He argues that the district court erred in basing his sentence in part upon crack cocaine that was found inside of the apartment where he was arrested. He contends that the district court failed to make findings concerning the scope of the criminal venture that he allegedly entered. He further argues that the record does not support a finding that he entered into a criminal venture that included the crack cocaine that agents found in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-23\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Sharpe, </em>193 F.3d 852, 873 (5th Cir.1999). When a sentencing court is considering liability for relevant conduct vis-a-vis a joint criminal venture, \u201cthe court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-24\">Phillips\u2019 argument to this court has merit. Phillips is correct insofar as he argues that the district court did not make specif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>ic findings concerning the scope of any criminal venture he may have joined. Moreover, the record does not support a conclusion that Phillips agreed to take part in any joint criminal venture. A <em>fortiorai, </em>the record likewise does not support a conclusion that Phillips agreed to a joint venture involving the crack cocaine that was found in the apartment. The indictment, the factual basis offered in support of the plea, and the presentence report simply do not show that Phillips entered into any criminal venture with others. Rather, these documents show only that Phillips conducted two transactions with a confidential informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">The record does reflect that there are several other criminal cases that are related to the instant case. The record does not, however, provide details as to these cases. It is thus impossible to determine what, if any, relationship those cases and the defendants concerned therein have to the instant case and Phillips. Consequently, the record does not support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Phillips entered into a joint criminal venture that encompassed the crack cocaine that agents found at his apartment when he was arrested. The record thus does not support the district court\u2019s decisions to hold Phillips liable for* this crack cocaine and to use this crack cocaine in calculating Phillips\u2019 sentence. Accordingly, Phillips\u2019 sentence is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1038-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
