This is the second time this matter has been before us on appeal. <em>See Bresko v. John, </em>31 Fed.Appx. 56 (3d Cir.2002). Because the facts of this case were detailed in the previous appeal, we provide only a brief procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">Bresko filed his complaint in the District Court on August 16, 2000. At that time, Bresko\u2019s criminal proceeding was still pending in the state court. The District Court dismissed his complaint, abstaining from considering his claims against Rosini based on <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), due to the pending nature of the state criminal prosecution. The District Court also held that Bresko\u2019s claims against Detective John were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), which prohibits the prosecution of a \u00a7 1983 claim which might call into question a plaintiffs conviction. After the District Court dismissed the complaint and before this Court decided the first appeal, the District Attorney agreed to a <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the original charges against Bresko in exchange for his pleading <em>nolo contendere </em>to one charge of simple assault and one charge of simple assault by physical menace. Because <em>Younger </em>abstention was no longer appropriate, and because Bresko could properly raise the argument that his criminal prosecution was no longer called into question as barred by <em>Heck, </em>this Court vacated the District Court\u2019s dismissal in light of the conclusion of the state criminal prosecution, and we remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">On remand, the District Court determined that Bresko\u2019s claims against Detective John did not allege a Fourth Amendment violation and, therefore, that John was entitled to qualified immunity. It further held that District Attorney Rosini was entitled to absolute immunity from Bresko\u2019s claims because all alleged activities \u201cwere intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\u201d <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). The District Court dismissed Bresko\u2019s amended complaint in its order of January 6, 2003. Bresko filed a timely notice of appeal on January 30, 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">In order to recover under \u00a7 1983, Bresko must show that Detective John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>\u201cengaged in conduct that deprived him of \u2018rights, privileges, or immunities\u2019 secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Russo, </em>212 F.3d 781, 786 (3d Cir.2000). Bresko claims that his arrest by Detective John was \u201cpretextual, false without probable cause and based upon material omissions to the issuing magistrate\u201d and thus in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. An arrest is violative of the Fourth Amendment where it is not supported by probable cause. <em>Orsatti v. New Jersey State Police, </em>71 F.3d 480 (3d Cir.1995). Probable cause exists where the \u201cfacts and circumstances [are] sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the [suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>Sharrar v. Felsing, </em>128 F.3d 810, 818 (3d Cir.1997) (citing <em>Gerstein v. Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 111, 95 S.Ct. 854, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975)). Additionally, where an arrest is made pursuant to a warrant, as it was here, the plaintiff must show that \u201ca reasonably well-trained officer in petitioner\u2019s position would have known that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause and that he should not have applied for the warrant.\u201d <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 356, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986). Stated another way, Bresko may show that a false arrest took place by proving that John obtained the warrant by (1) \u201cknowingly and deliberately, or with a reckless disregard for the truth, ma[king] false statements or omissions that create[d] a falsehood\u201d when he applied for a warrant and (2) that \u201csuch statements or omissions are material, or necessary, to the finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>212 F.3d at 787. Bresko cannot meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The District Court appropriately determined that, taking all the allegations of the complaint as true, Bresko failed to establish a constitutional violation by Detective John. Detective John received information from Desiree Burns that Bresko had allegedly raped her. She provided a detailed statement of the alleged rape. This was sufficient to establish probable cause to obtain a warrant. Bresko does not allege that John withheld information known to him at the time or made false statements to the issuing Judge. Bresko claims, however, that John should have done more investigation before applying for the arrest warrant. The issue \u201cfor Fourth Amendment purposes, ... is not whether the information on which police officers base their request for an arrest warrant resulted from a professionally executed investigation.\u201d <em>Orsatti, </em>71 F.3d at 484. Instead, it is simply whether probable cause existed. We conclude that it did. As explained in <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), \u201c[i]f no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.\u201d Because Bresko fails to establish a Constitutional violation, the District Court properly dismissed his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Bresko also claims that District Attorney Rosini violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by initiating the rape prosecution and continuing to pursue it in the face of a lack of evidence. Bresko also alleges that Rosini failed to abide by an earlier cooperation agreement despite the fact that Rosini had no reasonable expectation that Bresko would be convicted. The District Court appropriately determined that Rosini is entitled to absolute immunity from Bresko\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">It is well established that prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity from suits under \u00a7 1983 for conduct related to the initiation and presentation of the state\u2019s case. <em>Imbler, </em>424 U.S. at 431, 96 S.Ct. 984. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>decision whether to enter into a plea agreement or to pursue a trial is strictly within the discretion of the prosecutor. <em>Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, </em>509 U.S. 259, 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606, 125 L.Ed.2d 209 (1993); <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971) (plea bargaining is an essential component of our legal system); <em>Brooks v. George County, Miss., </em>84 F.3d 157, 168 (5th Cir.1996) (decision to enter a motion of <em>nolle prosequi </em>entitled to absolute immunity). Rosini is therefore entitled to absolute immunity for his decisions regarding plea bargains.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We will therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Bresko\u2019s amended complaint against Detective John and District Attorney Rosini.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-16\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343(a)(3), (a)(4). We have jurisdiction over Bresko's appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-16\">. Because a written plea agreement was submitted to and approved by the Northumberland County Court of Common Pleas, Bresko's request for injunctive relief is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
