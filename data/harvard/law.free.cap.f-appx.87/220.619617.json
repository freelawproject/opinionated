The first, entered on October 9, 2002, denied Hynard\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted a cross-motion for summary judgment filed by the IRS. The second, entered on March 17, 2003, denied Hynard\u2019s motion for reargument. Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-18\">1. This Court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Young v. County of Fulton, </em>160 F.3d 899, 902 (2d Cir.1998). In doing so, this Court is required to construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and to draw all reasonable inferences in its favor. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Maguire v. Citicorp Retail Servs., Inc., </em>147 F.3d 232, 235 (2d Cir.1998). Summary judgment is appropriate only where \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-19\">For the reasons substantially stated in the district court\u2019s October 9, 2002 decision, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-20\">2. This Court reviews appeals from the denial of a motion for reargument or reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>See Branum v. Clark, </em>927 F.2d 698, 704 (2d Cir.1991). The district court\u2019s denial of Hynard\u2019s motion for reargument was not an abuse of discretion. Local Civil Rule 6.3 requires a petitioner to submit a memorandum in support of such a motion that clearly describes any \u201cmatters or controlling decisions\u201d that the \u201c[district] court has overlooked.\u201d Hynard\u2019s memorandum simply restated the claims raised in his prior papers, all of which had been properly considered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Hynard also fails to demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice from the omission of deponent Rifkin\u2019s identity in the IRS\u2019s initial disclosures. Rifkin\u2019s role was limited to explaining documents already submitted by Hynard and the IRS, and the district court relied neither substantially nor exclusively on Rifkin\u2019s testimony. Hynard\u2019s claims concerning alleged flaws in his own deposition are likewise meritless. Hynard was permitted to supplement or clarify his testimony at the end of the deposition. Further, he used errata sheets to make extensive corrections to his deposition transcript, which were submitted to the district court with his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
