To obtain leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Clark must demonstrate both financial eligibility and that he will present a non-frivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-25\">Clark\u2019s motion to modify his sentence is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). That section permits a defendant to move for modification of his sentence if the sentencing range relied upon by the district court is subsequently lowered by an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The amendment relied upon by Clark was enacted almost four years before he was sentenced. Consequently, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-26\">Because Clark has failed to show that he will raise a non-frivolous issue on appeal, his motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED. <em>See Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-27\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
