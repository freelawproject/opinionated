The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed a 24-month term of imprisonment and a 36-month term of supervised release in light of Cam\u2019s two Grade C violations for failing 13 drug tests within 10 months and failing to appear for other drug tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Although the sentence is greater than the recommended range in the sentencing guidelines, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7B1.4 (2003), the guidelines are only advisory policy statements in the area of supervised release. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7A1. The district court may in its discretion, limited only by statute, impose a sentence outside the range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>283 F.3d 966, 968 (8th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>180 F.3d 920, 922 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Upon review for abuse of discretion, <em>Holmes, </em>283 F.3d at 968, we conclude that the district court considered the appropriate factors in determining the sentence, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Touche, </em>323 F.3d 1105, 1107 (8th Cir.2003), and that the sentence it imposed was reasonable in light of Cam\u2019s mental health history and the special needs regarding the treatment of his drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\">. The Honorable Richard G.
