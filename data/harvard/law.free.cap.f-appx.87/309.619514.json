Angelone, </em>330 F.3d 630, 633 (4th Cir.2003); <em>Veney v. Wyche, </em>293 F.3d 726, 730 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">Howard\u2019s claims accruing more than two years before he filed suit are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. As to these claims, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Howard v. Smith, </em>No. 7:03-CV-00144 (W.D.Va. Apr. 29, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-16\">Turning to Howard\u2019s remaining claims, we cannot conclude \u201cbeyond doubt\u201d that Howard\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim. <em>See Gordon v. Leeke, </em>574 F.2d 1147, 1151 (4th Cir.1978). Howard asserts that he was housed on the second tier notwithstanding his clubbed foot, which made traversing the stairs hazardous. He also contended that after a fall in which he broke or dislodged a bone, the prison doctor did not examine him for eleven days, and the examination consisted only of viewing Howard through a window in his cell door. Liberally construing Howard\u2019s complaint, we find that he has alleged that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to an objectively serious medical need sufficient to preclude summary dismissal under \u00a7 1915A. <em>See Johnson v. Quinones, </em>145 F.3d 164, 167 (4th Cir.1998) (providing standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-17\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order as to the timely filed claims and remand for further proceedings. We express no opinion as to the proper ultimate disposition of Howard\u2019s claims. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-13\"> Although a dismissal without prejudice is ordinarily not an appealable order, <em>see Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993), the applicable statute of limitations period has passed. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-243(a) (Michie 2000). Thus, the order is effectively a final order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
