Clements contends that California Vehicle Code \u00a7 2800.2 creates an unconstitutional mandatory presumption. The California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was not contrary to clearly established Federal law, and thus we affirm. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-25\">1. Mandatory Presumption</p>\n<p id=\"b92-26\">Jury instructions relieving the state of the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, every element of the charged offense violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>Carella v. California, </em>491 U.S. 263, 265, 109 S.Ct. 2419, 105 L.Ed.2d 218 (1989) (citing <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970); <em>Francis v. Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 309, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985); <em>see also Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39 (1979)). In accordance with California Vehicle Code \u00a7 2800.2(b), Clements\u2019 jury was instructed that \u201ca willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property includes, but is not limited to, driving while fleeing or attempting to elude a pursuing peace officer during which time either three or more [\u2018point\u2019] violations ... occur, or damage to property occurs.\u201d Cal. Veh.Code \u00a7 2800.2(b) (2003). In the face of the claim that this statute amounts to an unlawful presumption, the California Court of Appeal determined that \u201c[subdivision (b) of [Vehicle Code \u00a7 2800.2] does not make commission of three or more traffic \u2018point\u2019 violations an element of the offense; rather, it provides that commission of three traffic \u2018point\u2019 violations is one method of proving the pursued vehicle was driven with a willful and wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d The court also cited to <em>People v. Sewell, </em>for the proposition that subdivision (b) does not interfere with the jury\u2019s directive to evaluate the key elements of the crime, but rather it \u201cmerely described a couple of nonexclusive acts that constitute driving with willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d <em>People v. Sewell, </em>80 Cal.App.4th 690, 695, 95 Cal.Rptr.2d 600 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">As the Court explained in <em>Carella, </em>the threshold question with respect to a presumption is whether it is mandatory. <em>Carella, </em>491 U.S. at 265, 109 S.Ct. 2419. A presumption is mandatory if \u201creasonable jurors [are] require[d] ... to find the presumed fact if the State proves certain predicate facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In this case, there is no indication that the jurors were required to presume willful and wanton disregard for others if the State proved that Clements incurred three or more \u2018point\u2019 violations while fleeing from the police. Subsection (b) is merely a definition or description of what qualifies as willful and wanton conduct, rather than a mandate that the jury presume malice given a set of predicate facts. <em>See People v. Pinkston, </em>112 Cal.App.4th 387, 392-93, 5 Cal.Rptr.3d 274 (2003). The jury instructions, therefore, did not create a mandatory presumption, and thus the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was not contrary to clearly established Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b92-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
