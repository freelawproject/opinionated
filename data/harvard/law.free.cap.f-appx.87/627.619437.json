On de novo review, <em>Benton v. Barnhart, </em>331 F.3d 1030, 1035 (9th Cir.2003), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">1. Substantial evidence, including the medical evidence, the state agency\u2019s analysis, and Plaintiff\u2019s activities, supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">2. At the fourth step of the sequential analysis, the ALJ found that Plaintiff could perform light work. The ALJ found that Plaintiff was capable of satisfying each of the requirements for the performance of light work. The ALJ expressly adopted findings as to functional capacity, made by a state agency\u2019s examiner who opined that Plaintiff can lift and carry 10 pounds frequently. This sufficed as a predicate finding that Plaintiff could lift and carry 10 pounds frequently. \u201cMagic words\u201d are not required of an ALJ. <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 755 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">3. In addressing residual functional capacity, the ALJ did consider Plaintiffs sinusitis. The ALJ expressly concluded that the sinus condition was a non-severe impairment. The ALJ found, in other words, that exposure to irritants and vibrations did not significantly limit Plaintiffs ability to do basic work activities. The record evidence supports this finding. The ALJ was not required to include a wow-significant limitation in stating Plaintiff\u2019s residual functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">4. The hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert was adequate. The vocational expert clearly understood that the ALJ was asking about a person who could perform only light work and who had additional restrictions. For example, the vocational expert stated that the person could return to past work \u201cwhich was a light, unskilled job that would fit your hypothetical.\u201d The ALJ was not required to include conditions that permissibly were found <em>not </em>to constitute limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b665-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
