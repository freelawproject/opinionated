Daniel M. Friedman, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge for the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Henry Ekeh appeals his conviction for knowingly making a false statement in a passport application, claiming that the trial court erred in (1) denying him a <em>Franks </em>hearing and (2) denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained in the search of his apartment. He argues that the search warrant was defective because it was overly broad and lacked probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">I <em>Franks </em>Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a <em>Franks </em>hearing, and conclude that the district court did not err in denying Ekeh a hearing. <em>U.S. v. Reeves, </em>210 F.3d 1041, 1044 (9th Cir.2000). Under <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>the Fourth Amendment requires a hearing where (1) \u201cthe defendant makes a substantial prehminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.\u201d 438 U.S. 154, 155-156, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">While Ekeh has pointed out some minor immaterial inconsistencies between the facts as stated in the affidavit, and as stated elsewhere, he has not made a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing\u201d that the affiant made these statements \u201cknowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Court said in <em>Franks, </em>the \u201cchallenger\u2019s attack must be more than conclusory---- There must be allegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth, and those allegations must be accompanied by an offer of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">Additionally, even if we were to conclude that Ekeh made such a showing, the affiant\u2019s alleged misstatements are not necessary to a finding of probable cause in this case. <em>See Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674. Casting aside the alleged false portions of these statements, there remains enough credible information in the affidavit to support a magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause. The affiant was involved in an ongoing investigation into criminal fraudulent activities. In a prior search, resulting in a felony arrest of Stephen Ajayi, documents bearing Ekeh\u2019s name were found. Then Ajayi was tracked to Ekeh\u2019s apartment building by a telephone employee as part of an investigation into his use of cloned cell phones. The affiant then interviewed the apartment managers and determined that Ajayi had been staying in Ekeh\u2019s apartment. This is not a case where an investigator was conducting a search on anything less than probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-18\">II Defective Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">\n<em>Overbreadth of the Search Warrant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A06\">Because Ekeh did not sufficiently plead or preserve this argument, we will not address its merits. <em>Greenwood v. F.A.A., </em>28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cWe review only issues which are argued specifically and distinctly in a party\u2019s opening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>brief. We will not manufacture arguments for an appellant, and a bare assertion does not preserve a claim.\u201d (internal citations omitted)); <em>see also Arpin v. Santa Clara Valley Transp. Agency, </em>261 F.3d 912, 919 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201c[W]e will not consider arguments that are raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d). Ekeh\u2019s arguments on appeal, and in his Motion to Suppress at trial, were merely bare assertions, undeveloped and unsupported by authority.</p>\n<p id=\"AKd\">\n<em>Probable Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">A magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause is reviewed for clear error. <em>See U.S. v. Collins, </em>61 F.3d 1379, 1384 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see also Reeves, </em>210 F.3d at 1045. As discussed above with regard to the <em>Franks </em>hearing analysis, there were sufficient facts in the affidavit to warrant a probable cause finding. Thus, the magistrate did not clearly err in determining that there was \u201ca fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime\u201d would be found in Ekeh\u2019s apartment. <em>Id. </em>at 1384.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b97-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
