He was sentenced to 121 months of imprisonment. He now appeals, arguing that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred in failing to grant his request for a downward departure to 108 months of imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-24\">Rios-Melendres was convicted of a crime that requires the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846. The district court may impose a sentence below the mandatory minimum in two circumstance: where the government makes a substantial assistance motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) or where the defendant is eligible for safety-valve treatment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). The government did not make a motion for a downward departure, and Rios-Melendres was not eligible for safety-valve treatment because he had four criminal history points, yielding a category III,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and because he did not disclose all relevant information to the government. So, the district court could not have imposed a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-25\">Although it could have departed downward to a sentence of 120 months, the district court denied as not justified by the facts Rios-Melendres\u2019 motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 based upon his family circumstances.
