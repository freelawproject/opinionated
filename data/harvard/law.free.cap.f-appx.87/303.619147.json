Tuck appeals from his conviction following his conditional guilty plea for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). He was sentenced to thirty-seven months in prison. On appeal, Tuck challenges: (1) the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress several firearms recovered from his vehicle; and (2) the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>denial of a reduction in his sentence under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1 (2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Factual findings underlying a motion to suppress are reviewed for clear error and legal determinations are reviewed de novo. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 691, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). Guided by these standards, we find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that the police officers did not infringe Tuck\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Section 2K2.1(b)(2) of the Guidelines provides for a reduction in sentence when the firearms in question are possessed by a disqualified person \u201csolely for lawful sporting purposes or collection.\u201d Defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to a specified sentencing reduction, and we review the court\u2019s determination for clear error. <em>See United States v. Abdi </em>342 F.3d 313, 317 (4th Cir.2003). We conclude the district court did not err in denying a \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) reduction in sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Tuck\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
