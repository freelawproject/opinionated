We review the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>removal for substantial evidence. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir.2002). We will reverse the BIA\u2019s decision only if the petitioner\u2019s evidence is \u201cso compelling\u201d that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find evidence of past persecution or a fear of future persecution. <em>Singh, </em>301 F.3d at 1111 (citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Guale\u2019s request for voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f) (2003); <em>Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003). Because we find that the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Guale\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims was supported by substantial evidence, and because we lack jurisdiction to review Guale\u2019s request for voluntary departure, we deny Guale\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision that Guale failed to demonstrate past persecution on any one of the protected statutory grounds because the record does not compel the conclusion that Guale was detained by Ethiopian authorities on the basis of his ethnicity or political opinion. <em>See Chand v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring applicant to demonstrate past persecution was \u201con account of\u2019 a statutorily protected ground). Similarly, the record, particularly the Department of State\u2019s May 1997 Ethiopia Country Report, does not compel the conclusion that Guale has a reasonable fear of future persecution on the basis of his ethnicity or political opinion. <em>See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir.2003) (requiring applicant to provide credible, direct, and specific evidence that supports a reasonable fear of future persecution). Because Guale has failed to demonstrate he is eligible for asylum, he has also failed to demonstrate he is eligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Santos, </em>332 F.3d at 1255. For these reasons, we deny Guale\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b722-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
