NELSON, KOZINSKI, and MCKEOWN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b658-31\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-32\">Sakhone Phimmasone appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Social Seeu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>rity Commissioner\u2019s determination that Phimmasone was not entitled to disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) did not err in Step 3 of the five-step procedure for determining disability benefits because Phimmasone failed to offer evidence that he met or equaled any of the listed impairments, 12.02, 12.04, or 12.05. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1; <em>see also Roberts v. Shalala, </em>66 F.3d 179, 182 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The ALJ did err in Step 4, which requires a calculation of the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (RFC). The ALJ made no mention whatsoever of Dr. Read\u2019s comments regarding Phimmasone\u2019s inability to work. The ALJ cannot disregard the testimony of an examining physician without providing specific and legitimate reasons for doing so. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In addition, the ALJ erred by failing to offer specific and cogent reasons for his rejection of Phimmasone\u2019s subjective pain testimony. Phimmasone\u2019s repeated head injuries and numerous doctors\u2019 diagnoses constituted objective medical evidence that established a basis for his symptoms. Yet the ALJ explicitly dismissed Phimmasone\u2019s functional allegations without offering any specific, cogent reasons for his finding that they lacked credibility. <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">In addition to disregarding Phimmasone\u2019s pain testimony, the ALJ also mischaracterized much of Phimmasone\u2019s testimony on other, related matters. The ALJ\u2019s characterization of Phimmasone\u2019s testimony regarding his own emotional state, as well as his own ability to manage his children and the household, are not supported by the testimony in the record. <em>Compare </em>ER 156 <em>with </em>ER 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Finally, the ALJ concluded that Phimmasone could perform work requiring a GED level of 1 in language, but he stated during the hearing that Phimmasone \u201cis not a language 1 from what I can see.\u201d ER 144. There is no evidence in the record that Phimmasone could read any English words at all, let alone read at a rate of 95-120 words per minute, as is required for level 1. Therefore, the ALJ erred by proceeding with the unsupported assumption that Phimmasone had a language capability of level 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court and REMAND to the Commissioner for further proceedings at Step 4, and if necessary, Step 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-14\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b658-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
