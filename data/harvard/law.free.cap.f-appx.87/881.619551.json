He appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in assigning one criminal history point for a prior eighteen-month sentence of probation for fleeing to elude police,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1(c), 4A1.2(e)(1) (2002), and that the court failed to recognize its authority to depart downward pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s., to make Morton eligible for the safety valve provisions, USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6), 5C1.2. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-21\">Under \u00a7 5C1.2, a defendant may be sentenced below a mandatory minimum sentence if he meets five criteria, the first of which is that he may not have more than one criminal history point \u201cas determined under the sentencing guidelines.\u201d USSG \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l). Application Note 1 explains that, \u201c \u2018[m]ore than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>guidelines,\u2019 ... means more than one criminal history point as determined under \u00a7 4A1.1 (Criminal History Category).\u201d Morton\u2019s offense level was 23 and he had two criminal history points, which placed him in criminal history category II and resulted in a guideline range of sixty months (the mandatory minimum sentence) to sixty-three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Morton sought to convince the district court that his prior sentence for fleeing to elude police should be excluded from the criminal history calculation under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2) because it was similar to certain minor offenses listed there that are never counted. The district court disagreed, finding that the offense was more like those listed under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l), misdemeanor and petty offenses that are counted only in certain circumstances. One such circumstance is that the sentence was a term of probation of at least one year. \u201cFlee to elude\u201d is not listed, but offenses similar to the listed offenses are also to be counted unless they are excluded because of the brevity of the sentence. The court found that one criminal history point was properly awarded for the eighteen-month sentence of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Morton also requested a downward departure to criminal history category I under \u00a7 4A1.3, which he maintained would eliminate one of his criminal history points and made him eligible for a sentence under the safety valve. The district court determined that a departure would not alter Morton\u2019s criminal history score, declined to depart, and imposed a sentence of sixty months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">We first conclude that the district court did not err in counting Morton\u2019s sentence for fleeing to elude. Morton argues that fleeing to elude should be considered a minor traffic offense that is less serious than the offenses listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) because it is conduct that is prohibited under the Maryland Transportation Code rather than the criminal code. However, a first violation of \u00a7 21-904 of the Maryland vehicle law is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $1000 or imprisonment for not more than a year. Md.Code Ann. (Transp.) \u00a7 27-101(p) (2002). Thus, it is more than a minor traffic infraction, which would be punishable by a civil penalty. The district court did not err in deciding that fleeing to elude police is an offense that is similar to those offenses listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). Because Morton received a sentence of probation for more than one year, the sentence was correctly counted. The rule of lenity does not apply because \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l) is not ambiguous; it merely requires the district court to determine whether a particular state offense is similar to the listed offenses. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>218 F.3d 877, 881 (8th Cir.2000) (to determine which offenses are similar to those listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c), court considers plain meaning of \u201csimilar\u201d and compares resemblance and character of offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Second, Morton argues that the district court wrongly decided that a departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 would not reduce his criminal history points and thus would not make him eligible for a sentence below the mandatory minimum pursuant to \u00a7 5C1.2 or the two-level reduction under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6). However, Application Note 1 to \u00a7 5C1.2 states that, \u201c \u2018More than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines\u2019 ... means more than one criminal history point as determined under \u00a7 4A1.1 (Criminal History Category).\u201d Following the commentary, other circuits that have addressed the issue have all held that a departure to criminal history category I does not alter the computation of a defendant\u2019s criminal history points and that a defendant whose correctly determined criminal history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>score includes more than one point is not eligible for a sentence under the safety valve provision. <em>United States v. Penn, </em>282 F.3d 879, 881 (6th Cir.2002) (safety valve provision limited to defendants who have no more than one criminal history point as calculated under \u00a7 4A1.1 regardless of whether district court departs under \u00a7 4A1.3); <em>Webb, </em>218 F.3d at 881-82; <em>United States v. Owensby, </em>188 F.3d 1244, 1246 (10th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>158 F.3d 1291, 1294 (D.C.Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>121 F.3d 628, 630 (11th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Resto, </em>74 F.3d 22, 28 (2d Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Valencia-Andrade, </em>72 F.3d 770, 774 (9th Cir.1995). We find these decisions persuasive. The district court correctly determined that a departure would not make Morton eligible for the safety valve provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Morton also contends that the district court failed to acknowledge its authority to depart downward under \u00a7 4A1.3 on the ground that criminal history category II overstated his criminal record. Generally, the district court\u2019s decision not to depart is only reviewable on appeal if the district court based its decision on a mistaken belief that it lacked legal authority to depart. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>188 F.3d 230, 238-39 (4th Cir.1999). The record discloses that the district court was not in any doubt about its authority to depart under \u00a7 4A1.3, but decided that there was no point in considering a departure because a departure would not lower the number of Morton\u2019s criminal history points and thus would not benefit him. In this it was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">We therefore 'affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b918-14\"> This incident apparently occurred in an area under federal jurisdiction as Morton was charged with several state offenses arising from the accident and prosecuted in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 (2000) (assimilated crimes). He was convicted only of \"flee to elude.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann. (Transp.) \u00a7 21-904 (2002). Although Morton characterizes his offense as fleeing on foot, it is not clear from the information in the presentence report or the sentencing transcript whether he fled on foot or in a vehicle, both of which are prohibited under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
