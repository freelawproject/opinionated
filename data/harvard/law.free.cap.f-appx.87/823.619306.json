We find that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence, and will remand to the BIA for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-25\">Senoga is a native of Uganda, born there on May 17, 1975. His father was a wealthy landowner affiliated with the Uganda\u2019s People\u2019s Congress (\u201cUPC\u201d), a political organization opposed to the ruling party in Uganda.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1986, when Senoga <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>was a child and away at boarding school, soldiers came to his father\u2019s house, accused his father of plotting to overthrow the government, beat him, cut off his ear, and took him away, never to be heard from again. Thereafter, two of Senoga\u2019s siblings left Uganda for the United States and Canada; both returned to Uganda briefly, but left soon thereafter when harassed by the government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Senoga\u2019s three other brothers remain in Uganda: two are believed to be in jail, and the other, Senoga\u2019s half-brother, is a child living with other relatives. Senoga\u2019s mother remains in Uganda because the government has taken away her travel documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">On December 20,1997, soldiers returned to Senoga\u2019s home looking for guns, and interrogated him about rebel meetings. They kicked him in the groin, slapped him, and arrested him and two of his brothers as suspected rebel collaborators. While detained, Senoga claims that soldiers beat him, shocked him with electrical devices attached to his hands,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> grasped and hurt his genitals with pliers, sodomized him with a rod, stabbed him in the leg, and made him sleep on a concrete floor with no mattress or blanket. They questioned him repeatedly, and asked him to identify individuals who allegedly attended meetings in his house, none of whom he could identify.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Senoga does not know for how long he was detained, but was told it was three to four months. In April 1998, he was put on a bus to be transferred to another location. While en route, Senoga claims he heard a loud explosion at the back of the bus, which caused it to overturn. He lost consciousness, and when he came to, found himself in the bus, which was off the road and in a wooded area. He climbed through a window, and had no idea whether anyone else on the bus, including the two armed guards, three other prisoners, and driver, was dead or alive. He walked for about a day until he came to a barn, where he found clothes and slept. He then continued to walk until he came to Uanamagambo, where an acquaintance, the Reverend Wamala, lived. Reverend Wamala took Senoga in, and drove him to Wamala\u2019s parents\u2019 house, some 80 miles away, to keep him out of sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Mrs. Wamala nursed Senoga back to health, and Wamala obtained a visa for Senoga to come to the United States. Senoga arrived in the United States on December 1, 1998. He claims that Wamala paid $1,000 for his plane ticket, but he has no plans to repay him and has not contacted him for fear that Wamala\u2019s phone might be tapped. Senoga\u2019s brother, Nathan, claims that he made the arrangements for Senoga\u2019s visa, and that he paid for the plane ticket, but did not tell Senoga that he had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">On December 30, 1998, Senoga applied for asylum and withholding of removal, recounting his arrest, torture, and escape, and his fear that he would be arrested and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>detained if he returned to Uganda. On April 13,1999, the asylum officer who completed Senoga\u2019s Assessment to Refer found him to be not credible. On April 20, 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) issued a Notice to Appear, charging that Senoga was removable, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), for remaining in the United States, without authorization, beyond the expiration of his temporary visa.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Senoga conceded removability, but renewed his application for asylum and withholding of removal. After a hearing, the IJ, on December 20,1999, denied his application, accepting part of Senoga\u2019s story and discrediting part of it. Senoga appealed to the BIA, which, on December 3, 2002, adopted, without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision. Senoga argues to us that the BIA\u2019s application of the streamlining rule was inappropriate, and that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not based on substantial evidence. We have jurisdiction to review the final order of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a); in this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Mulanga v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 123, 131 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The Attorney General may, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) &amp; (b)(1), grant asylum to an alien if he determines that the alien is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), which defines a refugee as \u201cany person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">To establish eligibility for asylum on the basis of past persecution, Senoga must show: \u201c(1) one or more incidents rising to the level of persecution; (2) that is \u2018on account of one of the statutorily-protected grounds; and (3) is committed either by the government or by forces that the government is either unable or unwilling to control.\u201d <em>Mulanga, </em>349 F.3d at 132 (citing <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272). A showing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Mulanga, </em>349 F.3d at 132; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). That presumption can be rebutted if the INS establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that, <em>inter alia, </em>conditions in Uganda have changed so as to make Senoga\u2019s fear no longer reasonable. <em>Mulanga, </em>349 F.3d at 132; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A). Whether Senoga has demonstrated past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>a factual determination reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Mulanga, </em>349 F.3d at 131 (citing <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Senega\u2019s asylum application is deemed to constitute, at the same time, an application for withholding of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.3(b); <em>Mulanga, </em>349 F.3d at 132. The Attorney General may not, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), remove an alien to a country if he decides that \u201cthe alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d Senoga must show a \u201cclear probability\u201d\u2014 i.e. that it is more likely than not \u2014 that his life or freedom would be threatened if he is deported. <em>Mulanga, </em>349 F.3d at 132. This standard is more exacting than that for asylum applications; therefore, if Senoga fails to establish a well-founded fear of persecution for asylum purposes, his application for withholding of removal necessarily fails. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 469-70 (3d Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The burden of proof is on Senoga to establish his eligibility for asylum and for withholding of removal. He must do so by means of credible testimony, <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272, and his credibility, \u201cby itself, may satisfy his burden, or doom his claim.\u201d <em>See Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 247 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Our scope of review in immigration cases is \u201cextremely narrow.\u201d Findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), and we review those facts under the deferential \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272; <em>see also Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 214, 216 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Awolesi v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 227, 231 (3d Cir.2003). \u2018\u201cWe will uphold the findings of the BIA to the extent that they are supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole, and will reverse those findings only if there is evidence so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude as the BIA did.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mulanga, </em>349 F.3d at 131 (quoting <em>Kayembe v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 231, 234 (3d Cir.2003) (citing <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272)); <em>see also Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">Adverse credibility determinations are findings of fact, and must also be based on substantial evidence. <em>Dia, </em>353 F.3d at 247-48. If based on speculation or conjecture, rather than on evidence in the record, these determinations are reversible. <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272. Minor inconsistencies will not support an adverse credibility determination; inconsistencies that involve the \u201cheart\u201d of the applicant\u2019s case will. <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272. In sum,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ako\">we must ask whether the determination is supported by evidence that a reasonable mind would find adequate. We look at an adverse credibility determination to ensure that it was appropriately based on inconsistent statements, contradictory evidences, and inherently improbable testimony ... in view of the background evidence on country conditions .... Where an IJ bases an adverse credibility determination in part on \u201cimplausibility\u201d as the IJ did here, such a conclusion will be properly grounded in the record only if it is made against the background of the general country conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-9\"><em>Dia, </em>353 F.3d at 249 (internal quotations omitted). Although we defer to the IJ on credibility questions, \u201c \u2018[djeference is not due where findings and conclusions are based on inferences or presumptions that are not reasonably grounded in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, </em>331 F.3d 195, 205 (1st Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>The IJ concluded that Senoga had not shown that there is a reasonable probability, much less a clear probability, of persecution, because he did not believe part of Senoga\u2019s story. For example, the IJ deduced from the 1998 United States Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Uganda (published in 1999), the Uganda Country Profile for Asylum Adjudicators (published in August 1997), and the testimony of the witnesses that conditions in Uganda stabilized subsequent to the arrest of Senoga\u2019s father, and that, given the intervening years, there is no longer interest in harming Senoga\u2019s family. In this connection, he observed that, although the Ugandan government has already extracted large amounts of land from Senoga\u2019s family, the family still owns its house and enough land to support the mother. The IJ found it implausible that the Ugandan government would not simply confiscate this land if it wished to continue to harm Senoga\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">But the IJ did not come to this conclusion \u201cagainst the background of the general country conditions,\u201d as <em>Dia </em>requires, and particularly the ongoing human rights situation in Uganda. The 1997 Country Profile, and 1998, 1999, and 2000 country reports<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> each indicate that the Ugandan government\u2019s human rights record remains poor, and, although there have been improvements in several areas, there continue to be numerous, serious problems, including the use of excessive force, the use of torture to force confessions, extrajudicial killings, and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The IJ did not give this background information adequate weight and his personal opinion that Senoga could not possibly still be in danger was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Other parts of Senoga\u2019s testimony, and parts of the testimony of his sister and brother, were similarly rejected by the IJ, but rejected not based on the specific, cogent reasons that our cases require, but based on speculation or conjecture.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For example, the IJ found the story of Senoga\u2019s escape \u201cso incredible that it pushes the barrier of believability.\u201d He could not believe that after the explosion on the bus, Senoga never asked what happened to the armed guards and other prisoners. We, however, are unsure why the IJ thought it so unreasonable that a prisoner who has been tortured for months and has escaped, would, when given the opportunity to flee, not stop to inquire about his captors and fellow prisoners. The IJ also found it hard to believe that, after walking for a day without any idea where he was, Senoga \u201cmiraculously encountered\u201d Reverend Wamala, who then assisted him. The IJ, however, did not explain any basis for his somewhat sarcastic rejection of this part of Senoga\u2019s story and did not discuss Senoga\u2019s testimony that when he asked where he was, and was told, he realized he knew someone there, Reverend Wamala. An IJ must articulate a foundation for his or her disbelief. <em>See, e.g., Mulanga, </em>349 F.3d at 137-38 (noting, in dicta, that IJ must do more to articulate a foundation for her disbelief regarding alien\u2019s escape than to say the proffered explanation \u201clacks common sense\u201d). The IJ did not do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>The IJ also found it shocking that Senoga has not contacted Reverend Wamala since leaving Uganda, and does not intend to repay him for the plane ticket. He concluded that Senoga\u2019s apparent ingratitude was actually an indication that his story was concocted, and that these answers were \u201cfrom the hip.\u201d The IJ does not, however, mention Senoga\u2019s testimony that he does not know Wamala\u2019s phone number and he does not credit Senoga\u2019s fear that Wamala\u2019s phone might be tapped. We do not think that, without more, Senoga\u2019s failure to contact Wamala adequately supports the IJ\u2019s rejection of this part of Senoga\u2019s story. We also have difficulty with the IJ\u2019s finding that Nathan\u2019s testimony that he, and not Wamala, paid for the ticket explains why Senoga did not contact Wamala, i.e. Senoga had no reason to thank or repay Wamala because Senoga made up the whole story. But the IJ does not explain why he dismisses Nathan\u2019s testimony that Nathan did not tell Senoga that he paid for the ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The IJ also noted that Senoga claims to have had no contact with his mother, although Nathan speaks to her by phone three times a year. The IJ did not explain how this has any bearing on the asylum application, and, if it did, the IJ should have mentioned the testimony of Senoga\u2019s sister, Penina, that she is afraid that if she contacts her mother, she will be putting her mother\u2019s life in danger. We note that Penina also testified that, according to Mends, her mother\u2019s situation has not improved, with soldiers still coming to ask for guns and land, and accusing her of associating with rebels. This testimony surely bolsters both Penina\u2019s reluctance to call her mother and Senoga\u2019s fear of persecution, yet it was not discussed by the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">We also wonder why the IJ did not believe that Senoga\u2019s family has not definitively determined whether two of his brothers are still in jail, and did not believe that there could be conflicting reports as to their whereabouts. We also wonder, in any event, what bearing this has on Senoga\u2019s asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The IJ also emphasized that Penina\u2019s and Nathan\u2019s returns to Uganda \u2014 in 1991 and 1992, respectively \u2014 demonstrate that they felt it safe to return, and that they left only because they \u201cstirred up trouble\u201d \u2014 Penina by hiring a private investigator, and Nathan by suing the government. The IJ found that their quick departures from Uganda do not support the claim that the family was under constant threats and harassment from 1986 to 1997. Again, it is unclear to us why Penina\u2019s and Nathan\u2019s trips call Senoga\u2019s credibility into question. Moreover, although they may have thought it safe to return to Uganda, they both quickly learned that the government still closely guards any explanation of what happened to their father and used force to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Finally, the IJ was convinced that Penina\u2019s decision not to apply for asylum during her five years in Canada demonstrates that she is an economic, not a political, refugee. Again, we do not understand what basis, other than mere speculation, the IJ has for this finding, and he ignores her testimony that she chose not to apply for asylum in Canada because she was afraid that if she did, she would be deported. We also do not see how relevant this finding is to Senoga\u2019s application, other than by implicitly suggesting that Senoga\u2019s situation must be identical to Penina\u2019s. Equating the two siblings, if that is what the IJ did, flies in the face of the unrefuted testimony about Senoga\u2019s detention and torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">In sum, we believe that the IJ\u2019s findings \u201cdo not flow in a reasoned way from the evidence of record and are, at times, arbitrary and conjectural in nature.\u201d <em>Dia, </em>353 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>F.3d at 250. While the evidence is not so clear as to compel us to order that Senega\u2019s application for asylum or withholding of removal be granted, there must be \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d as to why Senoga is not to be believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Thus, we will grant the petition to review, vacate the BIA\u2019s order, and remand to the BIA for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-26\">. The extent of Senoga\u2019s father's affiliation with the UPC remains unclear. Senoga's sister, Penina, testified that their father contributed money to the UPC. Senoga\u2019s brother, Nathan, testified that their father was a \"chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>supporter\" and a member of the UPC, but never held any official post.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-7\">. In late 1989, Penina left Uganda and went to Canada. She returned to Uganda in 1991 and hired an investigator to try to find out what had become of her father. The investigator was arrested, Penina was interrogated by soldiers, and she returned to Canada, coming to the United States in 1994. Nathan came to the United States in 1990. He returned to Uganda in 1992 and attempted to sue the government for confiscating his family\u2019s property, but left shortly thereafter when the government harassed and threatened him and his lawyer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b860-13\">. The parties state in their briefs, and the IJ stated in his decision, that the wires were attached to Senoga\u2019s genitals. Senoga testified, however, that they were attached to his hands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b861-8\">. There is some confusion as to this expiration date. The visa itself states that it expires on November 18, 1999. The Notice to Appear states that Senoga was authorized to remain in the United States until December 1, 1998, even though that is the same day that he entered the country.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">. Although we ordinarily review the BIA's opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s opinion when the BIA has not rendered its own opinion, but has instead adopted the opinion of the IJ. <em>See, e.g., Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b861-13\">. Otherwise, Senoga can demonstrate that he has \" \" 'a well-founded fear of future persecution by showing that [he] has a genuine fear, and that a reasonable person in [his] circumstances would fear persecution if returned to [his] native country.' \" \" <em>Mulanga, </em>349 F.3d at 132 (quoting <em>Abdulrahman v.

Because we remand to the BIA, we need not address Senoga\u2019s argument that streamlining was inappropriate here. We note, however, that, as we recently held, streamlining in general is neither inconsistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act, nor is it violative of an asylum applicant's due process rights. <em>See Dia, </em>353 F.3d at 234-45.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
