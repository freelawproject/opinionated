That court held, under Arkansas law, that (1) Mrs. Miller was a licensee, (2) Wal-Mart\u2019s duty to Mrs. Miller was to refrain from willful or wanton conduct, and (3) no evidence existed that Wal-Mart\u2019s behavior was willful or wanton. On appeal, plaintiffs contend the district court erred by concluding that Mrs. Miller was a licensee, and that summary judgment was inappropriate because genuine issues of material fact exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-19\">Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, \u201cdrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant.\u201d <em>Hiner v. Deere &amp; Co., </em>340 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (10th Cir.2003) (bracket omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-20\">After careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs, the record, and Arkansas law, we conclude that the district court correctly decided this case. We therefore AFFIRM that court\u2019s judgment for substantially the same reasons as stated in its order dated March 13, 2002.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-17\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
