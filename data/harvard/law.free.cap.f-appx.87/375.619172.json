Montefusco, federal prisoner #04259-082, appeals from the dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for habeas corpus relief. Montefusco challenges his 1997 deportation hearing, contending that his deportation proceedings were fundamentally unfair because the Immigration Judge failed to advise him of his eligibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>for discretionary relief under former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The transitional rules of the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) \u201capply to removal proceedings that commence before April 1, 1997[,] and conclude more than thirty days after September 30, 1996.\u201d <em>Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 386 (5th Cir.2001). Under the pre-IIRIRA law that was incorporated into the transitional rules, district courts were deprived of subject-matter jurisdiction to review orders of deportation after the alien was deported. <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 491-92 (5th Cir.2000); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c)(1994)(repealed 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We find no gross miscarriage of justice in Montefusco\u2019s 1997 deportation proceeding and his subsequent deportation. <em>See Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 492-93. Accordingly, the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Montefusco\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, and we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal on that alternate basis. <em>See Emery v. Johnson, </em>139 F.3d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
