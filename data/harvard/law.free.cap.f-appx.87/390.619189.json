His claims fail because there is no protected liberty interest in early release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e). <em>See Rublee v. Fleming, </em>160 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Venegas v. Henman, </em>126 F.3d 760, 765 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201c[t]he loss of the mere opportunity to be considered for discretionary early release is too speculative to constitute a deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying McDaniel\u2019s petition, and its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
