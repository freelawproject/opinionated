(Applied) hired Michael Chen as a Software Engineer on August 28, 2000. Very shortly thereafter, Applied discovered problems with his performance, ultimately leading to his departure on April 29, 2001. Chen participated in Applied\u2019s Voluntary Separation Plan (VSP), pursuant to which he signed a general release of claims. In exchange for $33,000 severance pay, Chen gave up his right to any and all claims, known and unknown, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the face of his explicit and unequivocal release of claims, Chen nonetheless filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and eventually this lawsuit alleging discrimination based on race and national origin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-21\">Chen appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for summary judgment, its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>grant of summary judgment to Applied, and its award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Applied. He also makes a myriad of unsubstantiated and meritless claims with respect to the judge of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">Even if Applied\u2019s answer was untimely filed, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Chen\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on default.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. In re Dierschke, </em>975 F.2d 181, 183 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Chen argues that Applied was not entitled to summary judgment because (1) he signed the release under duress, (2) he did not receive consideration for the release, (3) the release is void, and (4) his claims are not covered by the release. First, Chen\u2019s allegation that he felt he had to sign the release in order to have a chance at continued employment is insufficient to establish duress. The release stated in plain language that he was releasing all claims as a condition of his severance payment, that he had 45 days to review the release, and that he was advised to consult an attorney before signing it. <em>See Williams v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>23 F.3d 930, 935 (5th Cir.1994). Second, Chen\u2019s claim that the money he received was wages, rather than consideration for the release, is not supported by the record. The Earnings Statement accompanying the check listed the money as \u201cVSP Pay,\u201d and Chen has submitted no affidavit or other competent summary judgment evidence that it was intended as normal wages. Third, Chen signed and returned the release within the 45-day limitation, so it is not void. The time spent by Applied in its inter-office mail delivery is not relevant to Chen\u2019s date of delivery. Fourth, Chen\u2019s claim of discrimination in Applied\u2019s refusal to rehire him is based on false promises he contends were made to him to induce him to sign the release. This claim is based on a promise allegedly made before the release and is therefore prohibited by it. The district court properly granted summary judgment to Applied based on the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">Applied was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs based on the release. Applied\u2019s entitlement to the fees and costs comes from the contractual provision in the release requiring Chen to pay all attorney\u2019s fees and costs of any suit he brings against Applied in violation of the release. Thus Chen\u2019s arguments based on the standards to be used in awarding attorney\u2019s fees in civil rights lawsuits are inapposite. The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining the proper amount of the fees. <em>See Davis v. City of Abbeville, </em>633 F.2d 1161, 1163 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">Chen claims for the first time on appeal that the district court should have recused himself. Requests for recusal not raised until appeal are waived. <em>See Andrade v. Chojnacki, </em>338 F.3d 448, 454 (5th Cir.2003). Chen\u2019s allegations of bias have no support, and he has not shown plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1032-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1032-22\">. Chen also asserts that he was discriminated against based on age, but he did not include this claim in his complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">. Applied disputes whether its answer was untimely filed, but this question is irrelevant to resolution of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
