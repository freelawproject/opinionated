Castillo\u2019s motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">Afforded liberal construction, Castillo argues that the district court failed to grant him an out-of-time appeal. He also asserts conclusionally that 1) the magistrate judge conducted his trial without consent, 2) the magistrate judge failed to recuse himself, and 3) he was denied the assistance of counsel. These claims have not been adequately briefed and are deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Castillo has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. He has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Castillo is CAUTIONED that the dismissal of this appeal counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b968-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
