Rangel-Orduna (\u201cRangel\u201d) pleaded guilty to being found in the United States after deportation following his conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). The district court sentenced Rangel to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Rangel argues, for the first time on appeal, that the sentencing provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Rangel also argues that a conflict exists between the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment; the written judgment contains a condition of supervised release prohibiting the possession of a dangerous weapon, which the court did not mention at sentencing. For the reasons set forth in <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 937-38 (5th Cir.2003), we conclude that the district court\u2019s omission of the dangerous-weapon prohibition during its oral pronouncement of sentence did not create a conflict with the sentence set forth in the written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b974-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
