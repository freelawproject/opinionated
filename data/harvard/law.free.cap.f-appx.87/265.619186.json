Campbell, </em>461 U.S. 458, 459-460, 103 S.Ct. 1952, 76 L.Ed.2d 66 (1983); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(c) (2002). Under the Act and implementing regulations, the claimant bears the burden of establishing disability. <em>Id.; </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">To be eligible for benefits, a claimant must demonstrate not only that she has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, but that such impairment is so severe that it prevents her from engaging in any substantial gainful activity that exists in the national economy. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A); <em>see also Campbell, </em>461 U.S. at 460, 103 S.Ct. 1952; <em>Adorno v. Shalala, </em>40 F.3d 43, 46 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-16\">The term \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d (\u201cRFC\u201d) is defined in the regulations as the most an individual can still do after considering the physical and/or mental limitations affecting her ability to perform work related tasks. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.945 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-17\">The Commissioner\u2019s findings regarding an individual\u2019s capacity for performing light work must be supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Substantial evidence is less than a preponderance of evidence and more than a mere scintilla; substantial evidence \u201cdoes not mean a large or considerable amount of evidence, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (quotations and citation omitted). If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>evidence can justify a refusal to direct a verdict where the case is before a jury, there is \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Olsen v. Schweiker, </em>703 F.2d 751, 753 (3d Cir.1983) (citation omitted). \u2018We will not set the Commissioner\u2019s decision aside if it is supported by substantial evidence, even if we would have decided the factual inquiry differently.\u201d Hart<em>ranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) considered the examinations Spencer received by James Richardson, M.D., Patricia A. Simpson, L.S.W., a licensed social worker, Larry D. Smith, Ph.D., a state agency psychologist, Richard M. Hahn, M.D., Michael Niemiec, D.O. and George P. Naum, III, D.O. The ALJ elicited vocational expert testimony at the administrative hearing. The ALJ asked the vocational expert whether work existed in the national economy for a hypothetical person with Spencer\u2019s age, education and work experience; who had the RFC for light exertional work, requiring no climbing of ladders, ropes or scaffolds, no more than occasional stairs, ramps, or balancing; and only occasional stooping, crouching or crawling; no close concentration or attention to detail for extended periods of time, no fast paced assembly line work; and no more than rare changes in the work setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The expert testified that the hypothetical person could perform the jobs of library clerk, general office clerk, kitchen worker and cleaner, which existed in significant numbers in the local and national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">We are satisfied that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision that Spencer was capable of performing light work with modifications and was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">In deciding that Spencer had the RFC for the light work, the ALJ considered the opinion of Dr. Hahn that Spencer could perform sedentary work and the opinion of Dr. Naum that Spencer was disabled. The ALJ appropriately determined, however, that more weight should be accorded to the objective evidence and assessment of the state agency position expressed by Dr. Niemiec than to the opinions of consultive examiners, Dr. Hahn and Dr. Naum. Jones <em>v. Sullivan, 954 </em>F.2d 125, 129 (3d Cir.1991) (holding that an ALJ may rely upon a non-examining physician\u2019s opinion when it is consistent with the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">The ALJ did determine that Spencer had a severe mental impairment and included all of Spencer\u2019s limitations that were supported by the record in his hypothetical questions to the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">We have considered all contentions raised by the parties and conclude that no further discussion is necessary. The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
