Santo claims that because his participation as a street seller of heroin in the instant criminal conspiracy was minor, he was substantially less culpable than the average participant in the conspiracy. The District Court disagreed and denied the two-level downward adjustment. Because we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Santo\u2019s contribution to this conspiracy as a street seller does not qualify him for entitlement to a two-level downward adjustment, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">Between February 1992 and March 1994, Santo and many others participated in the Nissan Heroin Organization, a narcotics distribution organization that sold heroin from a street corner in Philadelphia. Santo participated in some of these drug sales during a three-month period early in the conspiracy. By pleading guilty to participation in this conspiracy, Santo accepted responsibility for selling approximately 735 grams of heroin on the <em>corner </em>during the day shift during the three-month period of his participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">There is no dispute that Santo\u2019s participation in this conspiracy was rather limited, and that his role was less important than the government originally believed. Because Santo played a more limited role in this rather large conspiracy, the Probation Officer did not seek an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 for an aggravating role as an \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">Insofar as Santo\u2019s plea agreement obligated him to render substantial assistance to the government, he adhered to that condition. According to the government, he provided useful cooperation. However, Santo violated the conditions of bail twice by leaving the jurisdiction and returning home to the Dominican Republic. When last arrested on March 19, 2002 in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, he had been a fugitive for approximately five years. Charges of illegal entry are pending against him in that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">Santo originally agreed to cooperate with the authorities. However, he forfeited his chances of being considered for a motion for a downward departure for substantial assistance to authorities, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, by becoming a fugitive from justice. Due to Santo\u2019s unusual combination of cooperation and absconding, the Probation Officer and the government recommended both a three-level reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, and a two-level increase for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Prior to sentencing, defense counsel proposed an additional two-level downward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Santo\u2019s role in the offense was minor. Denial of that motion is the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Contrary to Santo\u2019s contention, the District Court did not conclude that Santo was ineligible for the adjustment for being a minor participant in the criminal conspiracy as a matter of law. Instead, the District Court properly considered Santo\u2019s participation under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. In particular, the District Court noted that the guidelines \u201cprovide[ ] a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant,\u201d and made a factual determination on that basis. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 Application Note 3. Prior to deciding whether Santo was entitled to a downward adjustment in his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, the District Court entertained argument on the issue from both defense counsel and counsel for the government. After evaluating Santo\u2019s participation in the conspiracy, the District Court concluded: \u201cI just don\u2019t think that fits this defendant, who was a street seller. So I will not honor the defense request on this matter.\u201d App. 198a.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Where the District Court has denied a downward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 based primarily upon a legal interpretation of the sentencing guidelines, we exercise plenary review. Where the sentencing court\u2019s decision is based upon a factual determination, our review is for clear error. <em>United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 237 (3d Cir.1998) (\u201cWe employ a mixed standard of review when considering whether a defendant was entitled to a downward adjustment as a minor participant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The Sentencing Guidelines afford sentencing courts discretion to adjust a defendant\u2019s sentence if his participation in the offense was minor. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) (\u201cIf the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 2 levels.\u201d). The district courts are allowed broad discretion in applying this section, and their rulings are left largely undisturbed by the courts of appeal. <em>United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 238 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">We have set forth three factors that are relevant to the determination of the applicability of a minor role adjustment: \u201c(1) the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise; (2) the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to the other participants; and (3) the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>250 F.3d 811, 819 (3d Cir.2001) (citation omitted). Evaluating these factors, aided by defense counsel\u2019s argument, the District Court was not persuaded that Santo\u2019s role was minor. We are not convinced that the District Court\u2019s factual finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">There was abundant evidence that Santo was an integral part of the conspiracy. This conspiracy was responsible for distributing 18.75 kilograms of heroin over a period spanning two years. For the first three months of the conspiracy, Santo sold 735 grams of heroin directly to customers, collected their money, and transferred it to other members of the organization. He also assisted in setting up drug transactions between customers and other members of the organization. He spoke directly to the customers, obtained the heroin necessary to complete the transaction, provided the heroin to a seller, and received money for the sale. In this capacity, San-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>to\u2019s participation in the criminal conspiracy was integral, and he was fully aware of the various roles of his co-conspirators. As illustrated below, such active, integral participation in the conspiracy is sufficient to justify the District Court\u2019s factual finding that Santo did not play a \u201cminor\u201d role as contemplated in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Each member of the Nissan Heroin Organization had a separate and distinct role, each integral to the existence and success of the organization. The leaders or managers of the organization were responsible for supplying the heroin to the corner and collecting funds from their shift bosses. The shift bosses were responsible for directing the sellers to the customers, secreting the heroin held for sale, re-supplying the street sellers, and receiving money from the sellers, ultimately transferring it to the leaders or managers. Assistant shift bosses were responsible for secreting the heroin held for sale, re-supplying the street sellers, and receiving money from the sellers. The street sellers were responsible for the street level sales of heroin to the organization\u2019s customers. The conspiracy could not have thrived, as it did for more than two years, without the contributions of each of these participants. Therefore, in his particular role as a street seller in this particular conspiracy, Santo played an integral role.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">By analogy, we have previously affirmed a District Court\u2019s denial of a downward adjustment for a minor role, where the defendant was far less involved in the drug conspiracy than was Santo. <em>United States v. Carr, </em>25 F.3d 1194 (3d Cir.1994) <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1086, 115 S.Ct. 742, 130 L.Ed.2d 643 (1995). In <em>Carr, </em>the defendant repeatedly transported large sums of proceeds from illegal drug deals to a foreign destination, but claimed to be merely a traveling companion to the actual courier. During one trip, Carr was stopped, searched, and found to have $180,000 in marked bills in his possession. The money was hidden in coffee cans in his carry-on luggage, which was in his possession at all times. Carr was convicted, and the District Court denied his request for a two-level reduction for being a minor participant. In affirming the District Court\u2019s denial of Carr\u2019s request, we reaffirmed our conclusion in <em>United States v. Headley, </em>923 F.2d 1079, 1084 (3d Cir.1991), that \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s participation in a drug operation was limited to that of courier is not alone indicative of a minor ... role.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">After careful review of the record and thorough examination of the parties\u2019 arguments, the sentence imposed by the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b857-10\">BECKER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AjG\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">The majority\u2019s opinion is persuasive that the record would support a finding that Santo is not entitled to an adjustment for minor role. But the District Court\u2019s ratio decidendi is encapsulated in its pronouncement that: \u201cI just don\u2019t think that fits this defendant, who was a street seller.\u201d In my view, the District Court has made a legal determination that a street seller will never be entitled to a minor role adjustment, which contravenes our opinion in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>342 F.3d 296 (3d Cir.2003), where we held that the District Court should not make legal determinations that certain categories of criminals (there the least-knowledgeable mule, here the street seller) are not entitled, as a matter of law, to a downward adjustment for minor role. I would vacate and remand for further consideration in light of <em>Rodriguez, </em>which had not yet been decided at the time of Santo\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
