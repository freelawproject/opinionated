The District Court sentenced the Appellant to seventy months imprisonment, which was at the lowest end of the sentencing guideline range for his crime and criminal history. Garcia filed a notice of appeal, <em>pro se, </em>and we appointed Arza R. Feldman, Esq., to assist with the appeal. Attorney Feldman filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel indicated that there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-23\">We have carefully reviewed the Appellant\u2019s brief, along with the responsive brief of the United States and other matters of record. Garcia did not file a <em>pro se </em>brief. We conclude, after our own review of the entire record, that the District Court did not err. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-24\">The motion of defense counsel to withdraw will be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
