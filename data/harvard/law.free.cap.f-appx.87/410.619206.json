Anderson contends that the trial court was without jurisdiction because the Government failed to establish that his offense resulted in a \u201ccommercial injury\u201d and so affected interstate commerce. Because the Government did not make such a showing, he contends, the Government lacked \u201cstanding\u201d to prosecute him.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Anderson contends that he should be permitted to pursue this claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 proceeding under the Savings Clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because this claim is based upon a novel legal theory. Anderson does not contend that the claim he wishes to assert is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense. Nor has he shown that his claim was foreclosed previously by circuit precedent. Accordingly, he has not carried his burden of showing that his claim may be asserted under the Savings Clause. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). The appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
