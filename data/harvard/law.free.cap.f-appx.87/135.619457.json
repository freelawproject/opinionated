The district court sentenced Defendant to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), which subjects a person \u201cwho violates section 922(g) ... and has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony\u201d to a minimum of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. He now appeals his sentence. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">Defendant\u2019s indictment and presentence report listed the following convictions for violent felonies: burglary, on February 2, 1968; sexual penetration and false imprisonment, on September 30, 1977; aggravated assault, on September 28, 1985; and escape from jail, on December 15, 1985. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (defining \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that \u2014 (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary or ... otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d); <em>United States v. Moudy, </em>132 F.3d 618, 620 (10th Cir.1998) (holding that a felony escape, violent or not, is necessarily a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 924(e), given the threat of injury it poses to others). Besides finding that \u00a7 924(e) applied, the district court also determined that Defendant was an armed career criminal under \u00a7 4B1.4 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which designates a person subject to an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e) as an \u201carmed career criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-17\">Defendant directed defense counsel to file a notice of appeal on his behalf, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ground that the district court incorrectly determined that he was a career criminal under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Specifically, Defendant contends that the district court should not have counted his prior convictions for (i) criminal sexual penetration, because he had served his time for that conviction and completed a post-incarceration probation; and (ii) escaping from jail, because that should not count as a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Defense counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief indicating his belief that the case affords no non-frivolous issues for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although <em>Anders </em>entitles the defendant to raise additional points in response to counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, Defendant has made no such filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Agreeing with counsel that Defendant\u2019s claims are frivolous, we GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b172-14\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
