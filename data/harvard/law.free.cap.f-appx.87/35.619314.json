NELSON, and SILVERMAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b73-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Jorge Velasco petitions for review of the denial by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) of his application for relief from deportation pursuant to the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and we deny the petition. Because the facts are familiar to the parties, we do not recite them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">We conclude that reinstatement of Velasco\u2019s 1988 deportation order was proper under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5). Velasco does not deny that notice may have been received at the address he had provided to the INS and has not established that the INS sent no notice. Velasco bore the obligation to inform the INS of any address change.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His failure to do so does not preclude the application of \u00a7 1231(a)(5), neither does reinstatement of the deportation order in these circumstances constitute a due process violation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-17\">We also conclude that the BIA correctly rejected Velasco\u2019s petition for CAT relief. Velasco did not show that it was \u201cmore likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to\u201d El Salvador.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, he failed to establish that \u201cgross, flagrant, or mass violations of human rights\u201d exist in El Salvador; thus, his case does not fall under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3)(iii). Additionally, the IJ and BIA ignored no specific evidence of torture, and \u00a7 208.16(c)(3)(iv) is not applicable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-18\">The BIA correctly rejected Velasco\u2019s due process challenges to the IJ\u2019s refusal to allow Velasco to present additional evidence. The district court provided Velasco with a more than \u201creasonable opportunity to present evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His failure to present adequate evidence cannot be blamed on the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-19\">Similarly, the BIA properly held that the IJ did not err in refusing to grant Velasco a fourth continuance to seek counsel. The IJ did \u201ceverything [she] reasonably could to permit [Velasco] to obtain counsel,\u201d granting three continuances for Velasco to seek representation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[I]n the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>context of immigration proceedings ... the decision to grant or deny continuances is in the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Finally, we conclude that the INS did not violate Velasco\u2019s right to confidentiality in the CAT proceedings. Velasco has presented no evidence that a disclosure of the kind prohibited by 8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.6 was made. While an officer informed the Salvadoran Interpol office that Velasco was in immigration proceedings, the information revealed nothing regarding the nature of Velasco\u2019s application for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-10\">.
