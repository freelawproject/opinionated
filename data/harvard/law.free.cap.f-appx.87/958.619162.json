He argues that the \u201caggravated felony\u201d enhancement found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is unconstitutional in view of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but states that he is raising it. to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>see also United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-23\">Torres-Perez argues that the supervised release condition which prohibits him from possessing dangerous weapons conflicts with the district court\u2019s oral - pronouncement of the sentence and must be deleted. The Sentencing Guidelines recommend that all defendants who have been convicted of a felony be prohibited from possessing any dangerous weapon during the term of supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.3(d)(1). \u201cIf the district .court orally imposes a sentence without stating the conditions applicable to this period of su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>pervision, the judgment\u2019s inclusion of conditions that are mandatory, standard, or recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines does not create a conflict with the oral pronouncement.\u201d <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 935-38 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b994-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
