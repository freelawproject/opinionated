The Government argues that Barrientes\u2019s only issue on appeal, the denial of his suppression motion, was waived by the entry of an unconditional guilty plea. However, review of the transcript of the rearraignment hearing shows that Barrientes has preserved his right to appeal the denial of the suppression motion because there is a clear indication of Barrientes\u2019s intention to plead conditionally, of his intention to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress in particular, and the acquiescence of the Government and the district court in the conditional plea. <em>See United States v. Wise, </em>179 F.3d 184, 187 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-22\">Barrientes argues that his suppression motion should not have been denied because the search warrant was supported only by a \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavit. The averments in the affidavit were not wholly conclusory but contained sufficiently detailed information from which the magistrate could independently determine probable cause. <em>See United States v. Pofahl, </em>990 F.2d 1456, 1474 n. 18 (5th Cir.1993). The officer corroborated several pieces of the anonymous informant\u2019s information, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>demonstrating the informant\u2019s reliability. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>818 F.2d 345, 348 (5th Cir.1987). There was no requirement that all of the informant\u2019s tips be corroborated by subsequent police investigation in order to be considered credible. <em>See United States v. Blount, </em>123 F.3d 831, 836 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Because the affidavit in support of the search warrant was not \u201cbare bones,\u201d the good-faith exception applied, and the district court did not err in denying Barrientes\u2019s suppression motion. <em>See United States v. Cisneros, </em>112 F.3d 1272, 1278 (5th Cir.1997). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
