He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 57 months, three years supervised release, and to make restitution of $218,287.16. In determining Mr. Durante\u2019s offense level, the district court, after both the government and defense counsel conceded the point, (Tr. at 44) made a finding that the victim of Mr. Durante\u2019s embezzlement, the New Mexico Tribal Health Authority (\u201cNMTHA\u201d), qualified as a financial institution for purposes of a six-level enhancement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for substantially jeopardizing the safety and soundness of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>financial institution under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(12)(B). Ill R. at 54. Although Mr. Durante objected to the enhancement, he did so only on the grounds that the safety and soundness of the victim was not substantially jeopardized. I R. 2 at 1; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 11. Both Mr. Durante and the government now agree that the guideline does not apply and that the district court committed plain error in relying upon the parties\u2019 representation that the guideline applied. We agree with the parties based upon our independent review that the NMTHA was not a financial institution. <em>See United States v. Duran, </em>133 F.3d 1324, 1329 (10th Cir.1998). We therefore remand so the district court may vacate Mr. Durante\u2019s sentence and resentence him.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">From January to September 2002, Mr. Durante embezzled approximately $218,287.16 from NMTHA while employed as CFO of that organization. NMTHA was an organization created in September 2000 in hopes of becoming a licensed managed care organization which would provide Medicaid reimbursable health care services to Native Americans in New Mexico. The application notes to \u00a7 2B1.1 define a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d quite broadly to include \u201cany health, medical, or hospital insurance association,\u201d which would include \u201cassociations that undertake to provide ... other benefits <em>(e.g., </em>medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers of persons.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 1. However, it is uncontroverted that NMTHA was not to provide medical insurance or similar benefits, but rather only reimbursable health care services. For this reason, \u00a7 2B1.1 is inapplicable. The district court\u2019s ruling on the applicability of the guideline constituted plain error which affected Mr. Durante\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Whitney, </em>229 F.3d 1296, 1308 (10th Cir.2000). Though the district court\u2019s ruling is certainly understandable based upon the parties\u2019 concession, the case must be remanded so the district court may vacate the sentence and resentence in accordance with this order and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b724-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-24\">. Although U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(12)(B) (Nov. 2002) provides for a four-level enhancement, if the resulting offense level is less than 24, that offense level is increased to 24. Hence, the effect of applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(12)(B) was a six-level enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
