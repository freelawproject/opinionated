The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of 121 months followed by concurrent supervised release terms of 3 and 4 years. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising as issues whether the district court erred in sentencing Flamenco when it denied a downward departure and refused to find him eligible for a drug-treatment program, and erred at trial when it made adverse evidentiary rulings and refused to give certain jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-19\">The district court stated that it would not exercise its discretion to grant a downward departure based on Flamenco\u2019s deportable-alien status; that decision is unreviewable, <em>see United States v. Lim, </em>235 F.3d 382, 385 (8th Cir.2000). A careful review of the trial transcript shows that the district court\u2019s conclusion that Flamenco\u2019s offense was a serious drug trafficking offense precluding a departure for aberrant behavior under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.20 is correct. Flamenco cannot meet the requirement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(5). We conclude the district court did not err in leaving the drug-treatment determination to the Bureau of Prisons, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b); did not abuse its discretion in any of its evidentiary rulings, <em>see United States v. Claxton, </em>276 F.3d 420, 422 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review); and did not err in denying Flamenco\u2019s requests for jury instructions, <em>see United States v. Lalley, </em>257 F.3d 751, 755 (8th Cir.2001) (instructions as a whole must fairly and adequately submit issues to jury; court will reverse only if error affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-20\">Following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-16\">.
