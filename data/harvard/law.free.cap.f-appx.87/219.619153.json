We assume familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of appellate issues and hold as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-21\">Our review of a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is <em>de novo. See Kuhali v. Reno, </em>266 F.3d 93, 99 (2d Cir.2001). Upon our review of the record and of the arguments of the parties, we conclude that the district court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-22\">First, Sanni challenges the decision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) to deny his request for parole. As the district court correctly found, however, the federal courts lack jurisdiction to review such discretionary determinations of the INS in the context of a \u00a7 2241 motion. <em>See Sol v. INS, </em>274 F.3d 648, 651 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-23\">Second, Sanni contends that his detention by the INS violates his right to due process. The district court correctly held that such a claim has no merit because Sanni\u2019s detention at present results from his challenge to an INS deportation order. <em>See Doherty v. Thornburgh, </em>943 F.2d 204, 211 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-24\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
