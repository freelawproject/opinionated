Acuna contends that the Board abused its discretion in denying the motion as untimely because its untimeliness was caused by ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999) (reviewing the Board\u2019s denial of motion to reopen for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-21\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s refusal to reopen proceedings where the motion to reopen was untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (c)(2) (2003). In addition, we conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that Acuna failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance. <em>See Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 637, 1988 WL 235454 (BIA 1988); <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir.1989) (\u201cTo prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>counsel at a deportation proceeding, an alien must show not only ineffective representation, but also prejudice to him which occurred as a result of that ineffectiveness\u201d). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
