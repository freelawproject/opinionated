The district court sentenced Moore to a total of 106 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and a $700 special assessment. Moore\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), discussing the propriety of the district court\u2019s two level enhancement pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2002), but concluding that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Moore was notified of his right to file an additional brief, but failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">By counsel, Moore challenges the enhancement of his offense level for perjury at trial. Moore\u2019s trial testimony was a direct attempt to rebut the evidence against him, including that offered by Special Agent Tom Lesnak of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the contents of an audio tape which recorded illegal narcotics transactions between Moore and a government informant. At trial, Moore denied selling any drugs to the informant and further denied admissions he made following his arrest that he sold drugs to the informant and that he was a user of illegal drugs. We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court\u2019s enhancement of Moore\u2019s sentence was made in accordance with the mandates of <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 95, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993), and was proper. There was ample evidence to support the district court\u2019s determination that Moore\u2019s testimony was false, material, and was not due to confusion, mistake, or a faulty memory. <em>Id. </em>at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have thoroughly examined the entire record for any potentially meritorious issues; we find none. There were no irregularities in the pre-trial or trial process, and we find that Moore was sentenced upon a proper application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines and consistent with statutory and constitutional law. Accordingly, we affirm Moore\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
