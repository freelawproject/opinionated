He appeals, claiming that the district court erred in admitting expert testimony from a law enforcement official that included an opinion as to Alexander\u2019s intent, allegedly in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 704(b). Because he failed to object at trial, we review this claim only for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). To establish plain error, Alexander must show: (1) there was an error; (2) the error was plain or clear under current law; (3) the error affected substantial rights so as to prejudice him; and (4) the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We find that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-23\">An expert witness may testify about an established practice among drug dealers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>provided that he does not speak directly to the guilt or innocence of the accused. <em>See United States v. Conyers, </em>118 F.3d 755, 758 (D.C.Cir.1997). We find that the officer\u2019s testimony here did not offer an opinion as to Alexander\u2019s intent. He testified only that the evidence presented (quantity, packaging, and a digital scale) was inconsistent with personal use. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s admission of the expert\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 587-88 (4th Cir.1994) (holding that admission of expert testimony that twenty-one \u201chits\u201d of crack cocaine were \u201ccertainly possessed with the intent to distribute\u201d was not plain error). Nor do we find that the expert\u2019s testimony was unduly prejudicial under Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Alexander\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
