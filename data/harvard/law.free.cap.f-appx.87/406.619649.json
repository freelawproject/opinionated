The district court held that it lacked jurisdiction to compel the state court clerk to docket the submission. Carbin contends that the district court should have allowed him to amend his petition to request relief under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). He also asserts that the refusal to docket the motion is a denial of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-22\">Although conceding that the state court subsequently ruled on the motion that he seeks to have docketed, Carbin asserts that the state court was without jurisdiction to enter judgment given the pendency of this federal appeal. This argument is without merit. In light of the state court\u2019s dismissal of the writ of error, Carbin\u2019s request to compel the state court clerk to docket the writ is moot, and his appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
