Alvarez has filed a petition for rehearing and for rehearing en banc following our dismissal of his appeal based upon our conclusion and the district court\u2019s finding that his notice of appeal was untimely filed. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>73 Fed.Appx. 623 (4th Cir.2003) (per curiam). Alvarez asserted on reconsideration in the district court that because no separate entry of judgment followed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion on August 6, 2001, the time period for filing a notice of appeal never began to run. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58, <em>Quinn v. Haynes, </em>234 F.3d 837, 843 (4th Cir.2000). The district court granted reconsideration and found Alvarez\u2019s notice of appeal timely as to the August 6 order.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we granted Alvarez\u2019s petition for panel rehearing and denied his petition for rehearing en banc. We now deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">The district court\u2019s order denying relief under \u00a7 2255 is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller</em>\u2014El <em>v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Alvarez has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-18\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-11\"> Both this court and the district court previously concluded that Alvarez\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely as to the district court's order of November 16, 2001, denying his motion for reconsideration. Because the separate document rule does not apply to post-judgment motions, we dismiss as untimely the appeal of the November 16 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
