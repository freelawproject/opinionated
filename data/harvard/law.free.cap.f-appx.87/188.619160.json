R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">ORDERED that that the appellant\u2019s motions to grant protection, to remove electronic monitoring devices, for an order to summon, and for appointment of counsel be denied. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b224-18\">FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed. Because \u201cstrict adherence\u201d to Sec. 1608(a) is required to accomplish effective service upon a foreign state, <em>see Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, </em>30 F.3d 148, 154 (D.C.Cir.1994), the district court correctly granted the motion to dismiss appellee the United Arab Emirates. The district court was also correct in granting the motion to dismiss appellees Al-Qubaisi and AI-Shamsi. When the district court relies on the absence of a response as a basis for treating a motion as conceded pursuant to LCvR7(b), this court will honor the enforcement of the local rule. <em>See Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, </em>117 F.3d 571, 577-78 (D.C.Cir.1997) (citing <em>Geller v. Randi, </em>40 F.3d 1300, 1304-05 (D.C.Cir.1994)). The district court properly dismissed the action against appellee Alami as well, as no proof of service or explanation for the lack of service was filed within 120 days of the action\u2019s commencement. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m); <em>Smith-Bey v. Cripe, </em>852 F.2d 592, 593 (D.C.Cir.1988). Appellant\u2019s argument that she should be excused from the consequences of her counsel\u2019s failure to effect proper service on appellees or respond to the motion to dismiss has no merit, as parties are generally considered bound by the acts of their lawyers, whom they have voluntarily chosen to represent them. <em>See Link v. Wabash R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 633-34, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b224-19\">FURTHER ORDERED that the motion to strike appellant\u2019s appendix and motion for leave to file appellees\u2019 appendix be dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
