Torres appeals her conviction for interfering with inter-state commerce in violation of the Hobbs Act,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (1994), in the wake of her guilty plea pursuant to a plea agreement with the United States. Torres contends her conviction cannot stand, as the source and total amount of funds stolen from the business engaged in interstate commerce in question are insufficient to implicate the Hobbs Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-22\">The Government moved to dismiss Torres\u2019 appeal based upon the waiver of appellate rights contained in her plea agreement, which stated she waived \u201cher right to appeal any sentence within the maximum provided in the statute(s) of conviction ... on any ground what-ever.\u201d (JA 33). However, because Torres waived only \u201cher right to appeal any sentence,\u201d not the conviction itself, we deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss. See <em>United States v. Mader, </em>251 F.3d 1099, 1103 (6th Cir.2001) (holding materially identical provision did not waive defendant\u2019s right to appeal validity of plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-23\">Even so, we affirm Torres\u2019 conviction. We have previously found that \u201cthe jurisdictional predicate of the [Hobbs] Act \u2018may be satisfied though the impact upon commerce is small, and it may be shown by proof of probabilities without evidence that any particular commercial movements were affected.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>990 F.2d 119, 125 (4th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Brantley, 111 </em>F.2d 159, 162 (4th Cir.1985)). Moreover, the depletion of the assets of a busi-ness engaged in interstate commerce is all that is necessary to satisfy the interstate commerce nexus of the Hobbs Act, <em>United States v. Bengali, </em>11 F.3d 1207, 1212 (4th Cir.1993), and robbery of as little as $160 is not so trivial as to automatically place certain segments of that criminal activity beyond the scope of the Hobbs Act, <em>United States v. Zeigler, </em>19 F.3d 486, 491 (10th Cir.1994). Accordingly, although we deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss her appeal, we affirm Torres\u2019 conviction, and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>ment would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b868-19\"> While Torres was also convicted of bank fraud, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 (1994), she does not assign error with respect to that conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
