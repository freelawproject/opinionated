Bakken\u2019s State Farm policy has a $30,000 per person limit and State Farm deducted from its payment $15,000 that Bakken had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>recovered in a settlement with the UIM\u2019s insurance carrier and $11,498.27 that Bakken\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation carrier had paid on Bakken\u2019s behalf, primarily for medical costs. Bakken filed a class action suit in San Diego Superior Court that challenged State Farm\u2019s set-offs. State Farm removed Bakken\u2019s class action to federal district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction and moved to dismiss. The district court dismissed Bakken\u2019s claims with prejudice and entered judgment; it did not certify a class. Bakken appeals the dismissal of her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">A district court does not have diversity jurisdiction unless the amount-in-controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Even where the parties do not challenge jurisdiction on appeal, the court has an obligation to ensure that jurisdiction exists. <em>Matheson v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co., </em>319 F.3d 1089, 1090 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that the parties\u2019 agreement that jurisdiction existed was irrelevant).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">To establish that the amount-in-controversy was satisfied in this case, State Farm\u2019s notice of removal relied on Bakken\u2019s assertion that \u201c[a]s a result of [State Farm\u2019s alleged unfair business practices], State Farm has effectively deprived Plaintiff and the Class members of at least tens of millions of dollars in policy benefits.\u201d However, only the claims of named class members count toward the amount-in-controversy requirement. <em>Gibson v. Chrysler Corp., </em>261 F.3d 927, 940-41 (9th Cir.2001) (noting that unnamed class members are not even party to the suit until after class certification). Similarly, Bakken\u2019s request for disgorgement of State Farm profits on behalf of all class members may be counted toward the amount-in-controversy only to the extent of the value of Bakken\u2019s individual claim against State Farm. <em>See In re Ford Motor Co./Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., </em>264 F.3d 952, 962 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that unless a plaintiff class presents a claim in which they all have a \u201ccommon and undivided interest,\u201d the total amount of disgorgement cannot be counted toward the amount-in-controversy).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Bakken\u2019s complaint also requests attorneys\u2019 fees. However, \u201cwhen there is no direct legal authority for an attorney\u2019s fee, a request for a fee cannot be included in the computation [of] the jurisdictional amount.\u201d <em>Galt G/S v. JSS Scandinavia, </em>142 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir.1998) (quoting 14A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 3712 at 178 (1985)). Attorneys\u2019 fees are not available for claims brought under California unfair business practice law, which is Bakken\u2019s central cause of action. <em>Walker v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>98 Cal. App.4th 1158, 121 Cal.Rptr.2d 79, 94 (2002) (\u201cThe unfair competition law does not provide for attorney fees, and relief is generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">The limit on Bakken\u2019s State Farm policy is $30,000. She concedes that State Farm properly deducted at least $9,000<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that State Farm has already paid her approximately $3,500. The remaining value of her claim is approximately $17,500. Bakken is the only named plaintiff; there is no common class fund at issue; and Bakken\u2019s individual claim for damages does not satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. For these reasons, we hold that the district court did not have diversity jurisdiction over Bakken\u2019s claim. We dismiss this appeal and remand to the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>court to vacate its dismissal with prejudice and to remand the case to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED and REMANDED with Instructions to Vacate and to REMAND to State Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b710-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\">. Bakken argues that State Farm was entitled to either one of the set-offs under the policy, but not both.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
