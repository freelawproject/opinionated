Watson pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>guilty to unlawfully possessing a machine gun. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> declined to depart downward from the Sentencing Guidelines, and sentenced Watson to 18 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, Watson\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), suggesting that the district court abused its discretion in denying a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">We find that the district court understood its authority to depart, and thus its discretionary decision not to do so is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Rodriguez, </em>220 F.3d 940, 942 (8th Cir.2000). We also have carefully reviewed the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-15\">. The Honorable Richard E.
