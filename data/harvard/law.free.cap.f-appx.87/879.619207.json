The district court initially sentenced Shirley to life in prison on Count One and a concurrent 240 months in prison on Count Two. On appeal, this court determined that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), it was plain error for the court to sentence Shirley to life in prison under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2003). We affirmed Shirley\u2019s convictions and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">On remand, the district court sentenced Shirley to 318 months in prison on Count One and a concurrent twenty-four months in prison on Count Two. Shirley appeals, alleging that the district court erred by denying him a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility and in determining the drug quantity attributable to him as relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">Shirley contends that the district court erred in refusing to grant him a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 (2001). We review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual finding that a defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct. <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999). Because the sentencing court \u201cis in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility,\u201d the guidelines specifically provide that the court\u2019s determination \u201cis entitled to great deference on review.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">One factor the court must consider is whether the defendant \u201ctruthfully admit(s) the conduct comprising the offenses of conviction.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 1(a). The commentary further states that \u201cthis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.\u201d USS6 \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Shirley would not admit the conduct that comprised the elements of the offense in Count One at the guilty plea hearing, resulting in rejection of his guilty plea and requiring the court to order a trial and the government to prove its case at trial. Furthermore, he continued to deny his participation in a conspiracy with his codefendants as late as his second sentencing hearing and expressed remorse for th\u00e9 first time at his second sentencing hearing. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in refusing to grant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Shirley also argues that the district court erred when it determined the drug quantity attributable to him as relevant conduct, because he claims that the court made no findings about the scope of his agreement with his codefendants or the reasonable foreseeability of their actions. The district court\u2019s determination of the drug quantity attributable to a defendant is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999). In determining drug quantity, a district court must consider whether the government established the amount by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>76 F.3d 596, 604 (4th Cir.1996). \u201cA defendant convicted of conspiracy should be sentenced not only on the basis of <em>his </em>conduct, but also on the basis of conduct of coconspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy that was known to the defendant or reasonably foreseeable to him.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>986 F.2d 86, 90 (4th Cir.1993) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court expressly found that the quantity of drugs attributed to Shirley was within the scope of the agreement and was reasonably foreseeable to him. We find that the district court did not clearly err in its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">For these reasons, Shirley\u2019s sentence is affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
