Amon of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b234-16\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">In April 2001, Frank Schwamborn was charged by indictment with racketeering racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud, mail fraud, mail and wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, and interstate transport of a stolen check. The alleged criminal activity of defendant and his co-conspirators involved the Genovese organized crime family, alleged to be a sophisticated and structured criminal organization that operates within the Eastern District of New York and other parts of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-18\">On November 15, 2002, three days before his trial was scheduled to begin, defendant pleaded guilty to the full indictment. In return for the plea, the Government agreed to support a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-19\">After entering his plea but prior to sentencing defendant expressed to his attorney an interest in withdrawing the plea. Upon obtaining other counsel-who currently serves as his appellate counsel-defendant moved to withdraw, contending that the plea was neither knowing nor voluntary and that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty. The District Court held a hearing at which defendant\u2019s trial counsel testified. By memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>and order dated May 23, 2003, the District Court denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">At defendant\u2019s sentencing proceeding, the District Court heard argument from both sides on the calculation of defendant\u2019s sentence, and the Court had as well the benefit of defendant\u2019s written objections to the calculation in the presentence report and the Government\u2019s memorandum of law in opposition to those objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), the Court granted a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, based on defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court denied defendant\u2019s request for an additional one-point reduction applicable where the defendant has \u201ctimely notified] authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a), the District Court increased defendant\u2019s offense level by four points for defendant\u2019s role in the offense as an organizer or leader in criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When defendant objected-arguing that the District Court was improperly relying on testimony of one of defendant\u2019s co-conspirators given in the trial of another co-conspirator-the District Court offered a <em>Fatico </em>hearing to allow defendant to challenge the District Court\u2019s findings. Defendant declined a hearing and the District Court maintained its position that defendant\u2019s role in the offense warranted a four-point enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">As a result of these and other sentencing adjustments, defendant was subject to a sentence of 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the District Court sentenced him to 55 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">On appeal, defendant challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, maintaining his contentions that the plea was not knowing and voluntary and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in relation to the plea. He also presses his appeal on the ground that he received ineffective assistance because his trial counsel failed to inform him of the terms of a plea agreement offered by the Government in October 2001 that was more favorable to him than his actual sentence. Defendant con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>tends that the record contains the relevant facts of his ineffectiveness claim such that we are permitted to review the claim on direct appeal, and the Government agrees. Finally, defendant appeals two sentencing determinations: (1) the District Court\u2019s application of the two-point, rather than a three-point, adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a); and (2) the District Court\u2019s application of the four-point enhancement for defendant\u2019s role as an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">We review the District Court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hernandez, </em>242 F.3d 110, 112 (2d Cir.2001). As to the District Court\u2019s sentencing determinations, we review the factual findings for clear error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Tian, </em>339 F.3d 143, 156 (2d Cir.2003)(role in the offense); <em>United States v. Cox, </em>299 F.3d 143, 148 (2d Cir.2002) (acceptance of responsibility). We review the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions on defendant\u2019s role in the offense <em>de novo, see Tian, </em>339 F.3d at 156, and the Court\u2019s evaluation of defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility is entitled to great deference, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 5; <em>see also, e.g., Cox, </em>299 F.3d at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We agree with the parties that the record before us permits our review of defendant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim. Having considered the material submitted by them and heard oral argument of counsel, we conclude, for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court, that plaintiff did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel and that he knowingly and voluntarily entered his plea. We also conclude that-in light of the full record before the District Court, which included the Government\u2019s memorandum addressing defendant\u2019s role as an organizer or leader, and in light of defendant\u2019s decision to forego a <em>Fatico </em>hearing-the Court did not err in assessing defendant a four-point enhancement for his role in the offense. Finally, we conclude that the District Court acted reasonably in refusing to grant defendant an additional one-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\">.
