We have reviewed the administrative record and find no error in the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Woldemariam was firmly resettled in Italy and is thus ineligible for asylum. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), (D) (2000); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi) (2000); <em>Mussie v. INS, </em>172 F.3d 329, 331-32 (4th Cir.1999). As the firm resettlement bar applies here, Woldemariam\u2019s contentions that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution and challenges to the IJ\u2019s findings that the fear is not objectively reasonable are misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-25\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-26\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
