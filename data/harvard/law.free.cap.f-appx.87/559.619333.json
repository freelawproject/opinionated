Although the respondent appeared at the trial before the Administrative Law Judge (the \u201cALJ\u201d), it did not file exceptions with the Board from the ALJ\u2019s decision. Likewise, it has not filed a response to the Board\u2019s application to this court. Under these circumstances, we conclude the Board is entitled to the relief sought. <em>See NLRB v. Tri-State Warehouse &amp; Distributing, Inc., </em>677 F.2d 31 (6th Cir.1982) (order) (in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, a Board decision and order is entitled to summary enforcement if no objections are filed with the Board); <em>NLRB v. Innkeepers of Ohio, Inc., </em>596 F.2d 177 (6th Cir.1979) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">It therefore is ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the Board\u2019s decision and order in Case No. 7-CA-44733 is hereby enforced. The respondent, Gaukler Storage Company, its officers, agents, successors and assigns, shall abide by the provisions set forth in said decision and order. (See Attachments).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The Respondent, Gaukler Storage Company, of Pontiac, Michigan, its officers, agents, successors, and assigns, shall</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">1.
