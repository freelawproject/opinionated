His sentence included 235 months of imprisonment, 5 years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. He now appeals, contending that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred by denying his motions for continuance, for dismissal, and for acquittal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-23\">On the day trial was to begin, Cardenas-Gutierrez moved for a continuance to secure the appearance of his uncle, \u201cRomero,\u201d whom Cardenas-Gutierrez claimed to have been traveling to see when he was arrested in Nebraska. At the time of his arrest, Cardenas-Gutierrez said that his uncle lived in New Jersey, but was unable to provide a last name, city of residence, or telephone number. Cardenas-Gutierrez did not specify in his motion what relevant testimony his uncle, whose whereabouts he claimed to have just discovered, would give. We review a denial of a motion to continue for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Vesey, </em>330 F.3d 1070, 1071-72 (8th Cir.2003). No abuse of discretion is shown here, for Cardenas-Gutierrez failed to \u201cmake some plausible showing of how [the] testimony would have been both material and favorable to his defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 867, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Following the government\u2019s case-in-chief, and again following the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, Cardenas-Gutierrez moved for judgment of acquittal, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. Having reviewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, <em>United States v. Smith, </em>104 F.3d 145, 147 (8th Cir.1997), we conclude that a reasonable juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Cardenas-Gutierrez possessed and intended to distribute the methamphetamine found in the car. <em>United States v. Buford, </em>108 F.3d 151, 153 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Finally, Cardenas-Gutierrez argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for new trial. The only mention of such a motion was the district court\u2019s immediately corrected mischaracterization of defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal. Cardenas-Gutierrez in fact made no motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-17\">. The Honorable Laurie Smith-Camp, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
