Def. Commissary Agency, </em>No. AT-0752-00-0746-I-1, 93 M.S.P.R. 305 (M.S.P.B. Nov.22, 2002). In this court, Powell has not advanced assignments of error, either legal or factual, <em>see Milmark Servs., Inc. v. United States, </em>731 F.2d 855, 859 (Fed.Cir.1984) (\u201c[A court] address[es] only the specific findings of fact challenged by appellant and the legal arguments we are able to discern from its brief.\u201d), and we see none. That is not to say that any single act, such as miscutting meat, would be sufficient to sustain the adverse action. But on the papers before us, we cannot say the board\u2019s decision is deficient, and we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
