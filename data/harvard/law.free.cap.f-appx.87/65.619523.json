We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2253 and 1291, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s ruling denying a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>See Alcala v. Woodford, </em>334 F.3d 862, 868 (9th Cir.2003). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record even if it differs from the rationale of the district court. <em>Id. </em>A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate: (1) that counsel\u2019s aetions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance, and (2) that the defendant was prejudiced by reason of counsel\u2019s actions. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-90, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">Roberts\u2019 claim fails because he cannot show that his trial counsel\u2019s actions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance. Roberts\u2019 petition alleges that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the prosecutor asked Roberts on cross-examination at least thirty times whether previous witnesses were lying when their testimony conflicted with Roberts\u2019 direct testimony. The California Court of Appeal found that this claim failed on <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>competence prong because the prosecutor\u2019s questions were admissible under California evidence law. <em>People v. Roberts, </em>No. A079998, slip op. at 11-12 (Cal.Ct.App. May 19, 1999) (unpublished). As there was no basis for Roberts\u2019 attorney to object under California law, her performance was not outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">Roberts also argues, by analogizing to cases involving direct federal criminal appeals, that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were nonetheless patent error and that a competent attorney should have still objected. However, Roberts does not cite, and we could not And, any Supreme Court cases that hold that even in light of the state court\u2019s determination that questions posed to a defendant on cross-examination did not violate state evidence law, nonetheless it was incompetent for counsel to not object. <em>Cf. Crotts v. Smith, </em>73 F.3d 861, 866 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient under <em>Strickland </em>for failing to object to \u201cexactly the kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>propensity-based inference that Cal.Evid. Code \u00a7 1101(a) was designed to exclude\u201d). Indeed, even the cases Roberts relies on, which allege <em>direct claims </em>of prosecutorial misconduct for asking questions similar to those at issue here, do not tie that error to a specific constitutional right. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Richter, </em>826 F.2d 206, 208 (2d Cir.1987) (citing two New York state cases in support of its conclusion that \u201c[p]rosecutorial cross-examination which compels a defendant to state that law enforcement officers lied in their testimony is improper\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Because Roberts cannot point to any cases decided by the Supreme Court that support his claim that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient under <em>Strickland, </em>the California Court of Appeal\u2019s rejection of Roberts\u2019 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was neither \u201ccontrary to\u201d nor an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b102-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-16\">.
