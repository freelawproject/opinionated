Perez argues that the district court erred by applying a four-level leadership enhancement to his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a). Perez admits that he led one participant in the criminal activity, but argues that he did not lead any of the other participants. Perez further contends that leading one participant in a criminal activity that includes five or more participants is insufficient to support a four-level leadership enhancement. Perez concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Okoli </em>20 F.3d 615, 616 (5th Cir.1994), but asserts that <em>Okoli </em>was incorrectly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">The district court\u2019s application of the four-level leadership enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 was not erroneous because Perez led at least one participant and the criminal activity involved five or more participants: <em>See Okoli </em>20 F.3d at 616. As there have been no superceding <em>en banc </em>or Supreme Court decisions contrary to <em>Okoli </em>this panel cannot overrule the holding in <em>Okoli. See Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999). Because <em>Okoli </em>is controlling, we do not reach Perez\u2019s argument that he only led one of the participants in the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b998-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
