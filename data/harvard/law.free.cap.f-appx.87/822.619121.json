While we have carefully considered Rill\u2019s argument that his good faith effort to appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court excused any procedural default, we find that it is not supported by our jurisprudence. We affirm the District Court order denying the habeas petition because Rill did not properly exhaust his claims in the Pennsylvania courts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-20\">Rill claims that he made a good faith effort to present his appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and that he procedurally defaulted because of his ineffective appellate counsel. Even if this Court accepted such an argument, however, Rill has never given a sufficient explanation as to why he did not file a petition under Pennsylvania\u2019s Post-Conviction Relief Act. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9545. If Rill had done so, the PCRA Court could have heard his ineffective appellate counsel claim, see <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em>566 Pa. 553, 782 A.2d 517 (2001), and reinstated his appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, <em>see, e.g., Commonwealth, v. Lantzy, </em>558 Pa. 214, 736 A.2d 564, 571-572 (1999); <em>Boofer v. Lotz, </em>797 A.2d 1047, 1049 fn. 4 (Pa.Commw.Ct., 2002)(\u201cUnder the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546, an inmate may file such a petition with the court of common pleas to restore the inmate\u2019s right to appeal\u201d), which would then have had a full and fair opportunity to hear Rill\u2019s federal claims. <em>See Evans v. Court of Common Pleas, Delaware County, Pa., </em>959 F.2d 1227, 1230 (3d Cir.1992) <em>cert. dismissed, </em>506 U.S. 1089, 113 S.Ct. 1071, 122 L.Ed.2d 498 (1993). Rill did not file the PCRA petition and is now time-barred from doing so. His last filing in the Pennsylvania courts was his petition <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, but we have already found such a filing to be an inadequate mode of exhausting claims. <em>See, e.g., Caswell v. Ryan, </em>953 F.2d 853 (3d Cir.1992)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-21\">For these reasons, the order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
