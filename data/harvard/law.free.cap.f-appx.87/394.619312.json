He argues that: (1) he exhausted the administrative remedies that were available to him; (2) the district court erred in determining the date on which the time for filing a timely administrative remedy request began to run; and (3) the district court erred in relying on records from his disciplinary appeal in determining when the time for filing a timely administrative remedy request began to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-22\">Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), prisoners must exhaust available administrative remedies before seeking 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 relief in federal court. <em>Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir.1998). A review of the record reveals that Harrison failed to timely file an administrative remedy request and, therefore, failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866-67 (5th Cir.2003). His argument that the district court was precluded from reviewing the records of his disciplinary appeal is without merit. Because Harrison\u2019s claims lack arguable merit, his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-23\">DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
