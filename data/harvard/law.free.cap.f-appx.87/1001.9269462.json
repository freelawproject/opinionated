Appellant Kaufman cannot overcome the plain text of the Bankruptcy Code, which conditions payment of attorneys\u2019 fees of a creditor on that creditor\u2019s entitlement to receive expenses from \u201cmaking a substantial contribution\u201d to the Chapter 11 case. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b)(3)(D). Section 503(b)(4) accordingly affords an attorney \u201creasonable compensation for professional ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>vices\u201d rendered for \u201can entity whose expense is allowable under paragraph (3) of this subsection.... \u201d The statute, as the district and bankruptcy courts noted, is clear. No case law cited by Kaufman abridges this clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">The decisions of the district and bankruptcy courts, which are supported in a number of other ways only on the assumption that this language is somehow not controlling, are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"APYj\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
