The presentence report recommended an enhancement for obstruction of justice based on Gant\u2019s threatening of a witness after he was released on bond. At Gant\u2019s initial sentencing hearing, he mentioned requesting a polygraph examination when he was arrested for harassing the witness. At the conclusion of his testimony, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-21\">THE COURT: Now, you keep bringing up this thing about telling the officers after you were arrested that you wanted to take a polygraph to see whether you were at her house that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-22\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-23\">THE COURT: Is that what you told them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-24\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-25\">THE COURT: Is that what you still want to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-26\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-27\">THE COURT: You want to take a polygraph?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-28\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-29\">THE COURT: Do you understand if you take a polygraph or if you refuse to take a polygraph, I will not hold it against you in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-30\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-31\">THE COURT: Is the Government</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-32\">agreeable to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-33\">MS. HOWARD: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-34\">MR. NESSLER: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-35\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s give him a polygraph on that. We\u2019ll postpone this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-36\">At the final sentencing hearing, no mention was made of the polygraphs and there were no objections made to the presentence report. The district court sentenced Gant to 210 months imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-37\">Gant claims that the district court violated his Fifth Amendment rights when it inquired whether Gant wanted to take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>polygraph examination and postponed his sentencing hearing. Gant concedes that he failed to object at sentencing; thus, this court\u2019s standard of review is for plain error only. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, 507 </em>U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). To reverse for plain error, this court must: (1) identify an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>1 F.3d 1430, 1434-35 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">We find no error. The record clearly shows that Gant volunteered to take a polygraph exam, contrary to his assertion that the district court \u201cforced\u201d him to take the test. Moreover, the results were never introduced into evidence, and there is no indication in the record that the district court knew the results of either test.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Gant\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
