The district court sentenced Rodriguez-Hernandez to 18 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-22\">Rodriguez-Hernandez argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. Rodriguez-Hernandez concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but he asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-23\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-24\">Rodriguez-Hernandez also argues that there is a conflict between the written and oral judgments. The written judgment contains a condition of supervised release prohibiting the possession of a dangerous weapon; the oral pronouncement of sentence did not mention this provision. For the reasons outlined in <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 935-38 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>Cir.2003), we conclude that the district court\u2019s omission of the dangerous weapon prohibition during the oral pronouncement of sentence did not create a conflict with the sentence set forth in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
