Office of Personnel Mgmt., </em>No. DA-831E-01-03321-2 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 28, 2002). Because this court lacks jurisdiction to hear Ms. Jupiter\u2019s appeal, this appeal is <em>dismissed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Ms. Jupiter timely appealed the OPM decision denying her application for disability retirement benefits to the MSPB. The MSPB administrative judge conducted an extensive review of the OPM decision as reflected in the comprehensive February 28, 2002 decision. The administrative judge determined that Ms. Jupiter established neither that she met the necessary criteria for disability retirement nor that she was not qualified for reassignment. Ms. Jupiter now appeals the MSPB administrative judge\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(c), this court is limited to review of OPM disability benefit decisions in which there has been \u201ca substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.\u201d <em>Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Mgmt., </em>470 U.S. 768, 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985). In this appeal, Ms. Jupiter only challenges the factual findings of the MSPB, as discussed above. Where, as here, the appellant\u2019s challenge is not within the <em>Lindahl </em>scope of review, this court lacks jurisdiction. Accordingly, Ms. Jupiter\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
