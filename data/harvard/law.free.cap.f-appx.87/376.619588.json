Omisore challenges his December 1996 deportation hearing, contending that his deportation proceeding violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses because the Immigration Judge at the time of the deportation proceeding interpreted the immigration statutes as depriving him of the discretion to grant a waiver of deportation, rendering the proceeding fundamentally unfair. He argues that <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), should be applied retroactively despite his actual deportation. He states that he was wrongly classified as an aggravated felon and that he is actually innocent of the offense that resulted in his deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Omisore does not allege facts to support his statements that he was wrongly classified or actually innocent. <em>See id. </em>He has failed to brief those issues for appeal. <em>See United States v. Wilkes, </em>20 F.3d 651, 653 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The transitional rules of the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) \u201capply to removal proceedings that commence before April 1, 1997[,] and conclude more than thirty days after September 30, 1996.\u201d <em>Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 386 (5th Cir.2001). Under the pre-IIRIRA law that was incorporated into the transitional rules, district courts were deprived of subject-matter jurisdiction to review orders of deportation after the alien was deported. <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 491-92 (5th Cir.2000); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c)(1994)(repealed 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">We find no gross miscarriage of justice in Omisore\u2019s 1996 deportation proceeding and his subsequent deportation. <em>See Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 492-93. The district court therefore lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Omisore\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
