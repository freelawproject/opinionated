R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">Randall E. Moore, William B. Scott, and Carl R. Hanley appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motions, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, to vacate, set aside or correct their sentences. Appellants argue that their counsel on direct appeal provided ineffective assistance by failing to argue, based on a recent Ninth Circuit opinion, that the sentencing court should have applied a clear and convincing evidence standard in assessing their sentencing enhancements, not a preponderance of the evidence standard. Appellant Scott additionally argues that the district court in his habeas proceeding erred by not holding an evidentiary hearing or otherwise expanding the record to determine if his trial counsel was ineffective because he slept during the trial. We review the denial of appellants\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion <em>de novo. Doganiere v. United States, </em>914 F.2d 165, 167 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, appellants must show (1) that their counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that this deficient performance prejudiced their defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Even if we assume that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to mention <em>United States v. Hopper, </em>177 F.3d 824, 832 (9th Cir.1999), constituted deficient performance, appellants\u2019 sentencing argument cannot meet the second prong of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">In each case, the district court stated in deciding the \u00a7 2255 motion that he would have decided the sentencing enhancement issue the same way applying the higher standard of proof. Appellants have not \u201caffirmatively prove[d]\u201d otherwise. <em>United States v. Fry, </em>322 F.3d 1198, 1201 (9th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693, 696). They point to nothing in the record demonstrating that the pertinent factual determinations were sufficiently close that it is reasonably likely that their sentences would have been different had the district court used the clear and convincing standard. Instead, appellants simply declare in their briefs the unsubstantiated conclusion that, \u201c[h]ad the higher standard of proof been applied at sentencing, it is reasonably probabl[e] that the result would have been different,\u201d while providing no analysis whatever of the evidence before the sentencing judge to demonstrate why the standard of proof would have mattered. <em>Fry </em>is therefore dispositive. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of appellants \u00a7 2255 motion with respect to appellants\u2019 ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Appellant Scott also argues the district court erred when it summarily dismissed his \u00a7 2255 motion as it pertains to the allegation that his counsel slept during the trial without first holding an evidentiary hearing. The district court\u2019s decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Frazer v. United States, </em>18 F.3d 778, 781 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The language of \u00a7 2255 creates a presumption that the district court will conduct an evidentiary hearing before deciding the merits of the motion, the court need not grant a hearing if the record conclusively shows that no relief is warranted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\"><em>Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, </em>the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Rule 8, Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United States District Courts (2003) (\u201cIf the motion has not been dismissed at a previous stage in the proceeding, the judge, after the answer is filed and any transcripts or records of prior court actions in the matter are in his possession, shall, upon a review of those proceedings and of the expanded record, if any, determine whether an evidentiary hearing is required. If it appears that an evidentiary hearing is not required, the judge shall make such disposition of the motion as justice dictates.\u201d). When the judge deciding the \u00a7 2255 motion is the same judge who presided over the trial, he may supplement the record with his own recollections of and notes from the proceedings. <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74 n. 4, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977); <em>see also </em>Rule 4(a), Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United Stated District Courts (2003) (\u201cThe original [\u00a7 2255] motion shall be presented promptly to the judge of the district court who presided at the movant\u2019s trial and sentenced him.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">In this case, the district court judge deciding the \u00a7 2255 motion was the same judge who presided over Scott\u2019s trial. When deciding the \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court looked at the record, supplemented the record with his own recollections of the trial, and held that Scott was not entitled to any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Petitioner points to no evidence indicating that the sleeping caused his attorney to fail to take any action during the trial he would otherwise have taken. In other words, Scott has made no showing of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Despite Scott\u2019s failure to demonstrate specific prejudice, he can prevail by showing that his attorney slept during substantial portions of the trial, a circumstance that is prejudicial <em>per se. Javor v. United States, </em>724 F.2d 831, 833-34 (9th Cir.1984). Counsel for one of Scott\u2019s codefendants stated in a declaration that Scott\u2019s attorney slept during portions of the trial, but did not say whether those portions were substantial. The trial judge relied on his own observations for the conclusion that Scott\u2019s attorney did not sleep for a substantial portion of the trial, stating that he did not observe Scott sleeping although he looked at him frequently. The affidavit of Scott\u2019s own trial attorney suggests, however, that if trial counsel had slept through substantial portions of the trial, the district court judge may not have noticed. In his affidavit, Scott\u2019s trial counsel emphatically denied that he slept during the trial but stated that he \u201cdoes have a habit of removing his glasses, wiping his eyes and keep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ing his eyes closed for a lengthy time\u201d \u2014 a practice that, if noticed by the judge, would surely appear to be sleeping. The fact that the judge did not notice this behavior, which according to Scott\u2019s attorney could have occurred over a \u201clengthy time,\u201d suggests that Scott\u2019s counsel could have slept for substantial portions of the trial without the judge having noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">This case is not, therefore, one in which \u201cthe judge\u2019s recollection of the events at issue ... enable him summarily to dismiss a \u00a7 2255 motion....\u201d <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74 n. 4, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Because the record does not \u201cconclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,\u201d the district court abused its discretion by not conducting a hearing sufficient to flush out the pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b705-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b707-7\">LEAVY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A25\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Moore and his co-defendants Hanley and Scott were the principal owners and officers of a telemarketing company. All three, along with a fourth co-defendant Fry, were indicted for carrying out a fraudulent telemarketing scheme. Each defendant was represented by separate counsel. After a five-week trial, a jury returned guilty verdicts against all defendants on all counts. Hanley, Moore, and Scott were sentenced to 120 months. Fry was sentenced to 46 months. All appealed their convictions and sentences, which were affirmed by this court. <em>United States v. Hanley, </em>190 F.3d 1017, 1034 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">I concur in the holding that the district court did not err in denying Scott\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion regarding the ineffective assistance of counsel claims pertaining to sentencing. I dissent from the holding that the district court abused its discretion in denying an evidentiary hearing on Scott\u2019s claim that his attorney, Mr. Wommer, slept through portions of the trial and thereby denied Scott effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">Scott filed two affidavits in support of his request for a hearing. The affidavits are from the trial attorneys for each co-defendant Moore and Hanley. If each and every word of these affidavits is true, Scott would not be entitled to relief under <em>Javor v. United States, </em>724 F.2d 831, 833-34 (9th Cir.1984). Mr. Sgro (Hanley\u2019s attorney) states: \u201cThat Affiant had witnessed Mr. Wommer sleeping during portions of the trial.\u201d Ms. Fatowe (Moore\u2019s attorney) makes <em>no </em>mention in her affidavit of Mr. Wommer\u2019s sleeping during <em>any </em>portion of the trial. In their two affidavits, Mr. Sgro and Ms. Fatowe make several general statements regarding Mr. Wommer\u2019s apparent lack of interest, lack of trial preparation, and short cross-examinations. Mr. Sgro and Ms. Fatowe state that Mr. Wommer sat at their counsel table with a single sheet of paper, while they managed numerous boxes of exhibits. Neither attorney informs us how Scott was hurt by his counsel\u2019s performance. Moreover, neither attorney tells us that their <em>own </em>clients were hurt by Mr. Wommer\u2019s allegedly deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">Effectiveness of counsel is not measured by how many files counsel carries or the length of cross-examination. Scott, who was the company\u2019s treasurer in charge of financial matters, ended up being found guilty of the same conspiracy as that involving both Mr. Sgro\u2019s client and Ms. Fatowe\u2019s client. Scott received exactly the same sentence as that imposed upon his two co-defendant officers. If Mr. Wommer failed to Uve up to his obhgations to Mr. Sgro and Ms. Fatowe as a member of the defense counsel \u201cteam,\u201d Mr. Sgro and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Ms. Fatowe should have made that claim on behalf of their own clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Absent any showing of prejudice, Scott is entitled to relief <em>only </em>if he can demonstrate that his attorney slept through a \u201csubstantial\u201d portion of his trial. <em>Javor, </em>724 F.2d at 838-34; <em>see also United States v. Petersen, 111 </em>F.2d 482, 484 (9th Cir.1985). The strongest and best evidence that Scott proffers is <em>one </em>passive statement by Mr. Sgro that he \u201chad witnessed Mr. Wommer sleeping during portions of the trial.\u201d There is no assertion anywhere in the record that Mr. Wommer slept during a <em>substantial </em>or <em>significant </em>portion of the trial. Mr. Sgro does not identify any portion or segment of the trial during which the alleged sleeping occurred, nor does he suggest that any event (such as witness testimony, an objection, or a motion) occurred during the time he \u201chad witnessed\u201d Mr. Wommer sleeping. If Scott is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on a lone assertion as weak as this one, then any defendant would be entitled to an evidentiary hearing regarding the sleeping of his counsel upon an equally weak assertion from an attorney, a co-defendant, or perhaps the defendant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In deciding a \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court is required to give a claim \u201ccareful consideration and plenary processing, including full opportunity for presentation of relevant facts.\u201d <em>Shah v. United States, </em>878 F.2d 1156, 1159 (9th Cir.1989) (citations omitted); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. A district court has the discretion to deny an evidentiary hearing and rely on the record, which may be supplemented by the judge\u2019s own notes and recollection of the trial, and also common sense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Here, the district judge presided over the five-week trial and the sentencing of the defendants. The trial judge concluded, based upon his own recollections that: \u201cthe alleged sleeping episodes could not have occurred during a substantial portion of the trial.\u201d In addition to the trial transcript showing substantial participation by Mr. Wommer and the district judge\u2019s recollections, the court considered the affidavits from Mr. Wommer denying that he slept during the trial, and the two affidavits from Mr. Sgro and Ms. Fatowe. The district court had sufficient information to exercise its discretion soundly in deciding to deny an evidentiary hearing. <em>Shah, </em>878 F.2d at 1159-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to remand for an evidentiary hearing on Scott\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
