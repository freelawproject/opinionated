We agree with the district court that Mr. Larson has not shown he is entitled to coram nobis relief, because he unsuccessfully raised on direct appeal and in prior 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions the Fourth Amendment and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims that he raises here. <em>See Azzone v. United States, </em>341 F.2d 417, 419-20 (8th Cir.) (per curiam) (coram nobis petitioner not entitled to review of issues that were considered and resolved either on direct appeal or in \u00a7 2255 motion), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 U.S. 943, 85 S.Ct. 1782, 14 L.Ed.2d 706 (1965); <em>cf. United States v. Camacho-Bordes, </em>94 F.3d 1168, 1172-73 (8th Cir. 1996) (coram nobis relief is \u201c \u2018substantially equivalent\u2019 \u201d to habeas relief, and abuse-of-the-writ principle applies to coram nobis cases (quoted source omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-21\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-14\">.
