Vannoy filed suit alleging that Saks induced him into accepting early medical retirement by making oral promises that Vannoy would obtain future employment with Saks. The district court dismissed Vannoy\u2019s claims, rejecting his promissory estoppel claim and concluding that the alleged oral contract was barred by Mississippi\u2019s statute of frauds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Vannoy first began working with McRae\u2019s Department Store, the predecessor-in-interest to Saks, in 1980. He worked for the companies for approximately nineteen years, eventually attaining the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer. His employment contract expired on April 1, 1998, and shortly thereafter, in early 1999, Vannoy\u2019s health began to deteriorate. Appellee James Coggin, the President and CEO of Saks, informed Vannoy that Saks could provide him with a severance package if he accepted medical retirement. According to Vannoy, Coggin also made oral promises that Vannoy would be called back to work in some capacity as a consultant for Saks.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Vannoy eventually decided to accept the medical severance package, in part because of Coggin\u2019s promise that he would receive future employment with Saks. Under the retirement package, Vannoy received his full yearly salary of $224,000 in 1999, $100,000 per year in 2000 and 2001, his 1998 bonus, various stock options, and health insurance until age 65. The financial terms of the retirement package were set forth in a series of letters between Vannoy and Saks, but Coggin\u2019s alleged oral promises to provide future employment were not mentioned in any writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Following his retirement, Vannoy had several meetings with Coggin, during which Coggin repeated his promises of future employment. For example, Coggin reassured Vannoy that he would \u201cmake good on his promise\u201d of continued employment with Saks; that he was working on a position for him; that he could work for as long as he wanted with Saks; and that he would \u201cend up making more money\u201d as a consultant than he did as Senior Vice President.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">In January 2002, Vannoy concluded that Saks did not intend to provide him future employment when Coggin refused to meet with him. He filed suit shortly afterward. Relying on the doctrine of promissory estoppel, Vannoy alleged that Saks and Cog-gin induced him to his detriment to accept a medical retirement package by making oral promises of future employment. He sought to recover wages and other damages lost as a result of his retirement. The district court rejected his arguments, granting summary judgment to Saks and Coggin.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate when the summary judgment evidence shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties agree that Mississippi law governs the interpretation of Vannoy\u2019s contract and promissory estoppel claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Vannoy argues that he relied on Cog-gin\u2019s promises of future employment to his detriment, and urges that the doctrine of promissory estoppel compels Saks to stand by its commitments. He argues that the district court incorrectly weighed his employment status to determine that promissory estoppel did not apply. He also argues that the court erred in concluding that promissory estoppel could not overcome the requirements of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Mississippi has long recognized that promissory estoppel can render an otherwise non-enforceable promise enforceable in order to prevent injustice. To prevail on a claim of promissory estoppel under Mississippi law, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a promise on which the plaintiff reasonably relied to his detriment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Vannoy cannot satisfy this standard because he cannot demonstrate that his decision to terminate his employment constituted a sufficient detriment to justify imposition of promissory estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">Even if Vannoy\u2019s decision to retire was induced by Coggin\u2019s promises of unspecified future employment, his claim of promissory estoppel fails under Mississippi law. The Mississippi Supreme Court has clearly and consistently held that \u201c \u2018a change of job ..., by itself, is insufficient to trigger invocation of the promissory estoppel doctrine.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Bowers Window and Door Company, Inc. v. Dearman, </em>for example, the court rejected the plaintiffs efforts to enforce an oral employment contract based on promissory estoppel, even though the defendant\u2019s promises of future employment had induced the plaintiff to surrender his current position.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Like the plaintiff in <em>Bowers, </em>Vannoy did not relinquish any rights by retiring in May 1999. He does not dispute that he was an employee-at-will and was not entitled to receive retirement benefits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He could be discharged by Saks at any time for \u201ca good reason, a wrong reason, or no reason.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, Vannoy, like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>plaintiff in <em>Bowers, </em>cannot rely on promissory estoppel to enforce Coggin\u2019s promises of future employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">For similar reasons, he cannot escape the application of Mississippi\u2019s statute of frauds. Section 15-3-1 of the Mississippi Code requires that \u201cany agreement which is not to be performed within the space of fifteen months from the making thereof\u2019 cannot be enforced unless the agreement is in writing. Vannoy does not dispute that Coggin\u2019s alleged oral promises were never embodied in any writing, even though the other terms of his retirement package were contained in letters and other documents. Although promissory estoppel can override the writing requirement in appropriate cases, Vannoy has not demonstrated sufficient detriment to justify overriding the statute of frauds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Finally, even if Vannoy could demonstrate sufficient detriment, Coggin\u2019s promises of future employment in this case are simply too vague and indefinite to support application of promissory estoppel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Beyond Coggin\u2019s vague claims that Vannoy would \u201cend up making more money,\u201d there was no discussion of salary, hours, responsibilities, or starting date. Indeed, Coggin never even specified what position Vannoy would fill, referring only vaguely to a consulting or training position. Under the circumstances, Coggin\u2019s alleged promises were simply too vague to support a promissory estoppel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
