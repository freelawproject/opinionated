We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-25\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-26\">Because we write only for the benefit of the parties we address only those facts particularly relevant to our analysis and conclusion. In 1993, Appellee Barbara Scorsone, the wife of a Union member and covered person under the Union\u2019s health plan (the health plan, its board of trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>and administrators are collectively referred to as \u201cthe Fund\u201d), began experiencing drooping in her eyelids. Between 1993 and 1999, Scorsone saw a bevy of doctors in order to address this medical issue, its possible causes and several complications she believed were related to it. In 1999, Scorsone began seeing Dr. Ralph Mauriello, an opthamologist specializing in plastic surgery. Mauriello had, prior to treating Scorsone, performed ptosis repair surgery on Scorsone\u2019s brother for a similar problem involving drooping eyelids. After seeing Scorsone, Mauriello determined that she could also be aided by this surgery. Scorsone elected to proceed with the surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">On July 6, 1999, Mauriello sent a letter to the Fund advising it of Scorsone\u2019s election to undergo the surgery and several diagnostic test results supporting the surgery. In addition, Mauriello advised the Fund that due to Scorsone\u2019s dry eye she would undergo the surgery for her two eyes sequentially. At the conclusion of this letter, Mauriello thanked the Fund \u201cin advance for [its] approval for this surgery.\u201d In response to this letter Mauriello was provided with pre-notification numbers for each surgery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">On August 23, 1999, Mauriello performed surgical ptosis repair on Scorsone\u2019s left eye and on November 11, 1999 he performed the surgery on her right eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">After the first surgery, the Fund sent Scorsone\u2019s claim regarding the ptosis repair to its third party claims management company for peer review. The information provided to this company, which in-eluded Mauriello\u2019s July 6, 1999 letter and several medical reports from the doctors Scorsone had seen between 1993 and 1999, was forwarded to Dr. Peter Laino for peer review. By letter dated August 31, 1999, Laino, an associate professor of opthamology, offered his opinion that the ptosis repair recommended by Mauriello was \u201cill conceived\u201d medically and that \u201c[c]osmetically it may be desireable [sic] but that is a separate consideration.\u201d (App.263.) Based on this letter, the Fund decided that the procedure was cosmetic and, for that reason, denied Scorsone\u2019s claim. On December 28, 1999, after both surgeries had been conducted and Mauriello had been partially paid,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Scorsone received a denial of benefits letter from the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">In response to the denial letter, Scorsone submitted additional information to the Fund through her husband and Mauriello. This information included a letter from her husband regarding the benefits of the surgery and a letter from Mauriello explaining that the surgery was medically necessary, and not done for cosmetic reasons. Mauriello also included the surgical operative record and photographs of Scorsone\u2019s eyes. The Fund did not forward this additional material to Laino. Instead, the Fund denied Scorsone\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">Scorsone filed suit seeking, among other relief, compensatory damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. Because her claims fell under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act\u2019s (\u201cERISA\u2019s\u201d) pre-emptive umbrella it was removed to the District Court. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461. After denying the Union\u2019s motion for summary judgment and conducting a bench trial, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>found in favor of Scorsone and awarded her both compensatory damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Initially, the Union argues that the District Court erred in conducting a bench trial on Scorsone\u2019s claims. The Union claims that because the District Court was only permitted to consider the evidence presented to the Fund it should have looked only at the documentary evidence and acted improperly in conducting a bench trial. The Union is incorrect that conducting a bench trial was beyond the limits of the District Court\u2019s review. While it is true that the District Court could consider only the information that was available to the Fund when it made its decisions, <em>Mitchell v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>113 F.3d 433, 440 (3d Cir.1997), this does not imply that the District Court was prevented from conducting a bench trial to determine what that information was. Through the use of a bench trial and live testimony, the District Court was able to more fully understand what the Fund relied upon in denying Scorsone\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The heart of the Union\u2019s appeal is that the District Court erred by finding that the Fund acted arbitrarily and capriciously by denying Scorsone\u2019s claim for her surgical ptosis repair. When an ERISA plan gives the administrator discretion to award benefits and construe the terms of the plan a court reviews the administrator\u2019s actions only to determine if they were arbitrary and capricious. <em>Abnathya v. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., </em>2 F.3d 40, 44-45 (3d Cir.1993). The parties do not dispute that this plan gave the Fund\u2019s administrators such discretion. Thus, we, like the District Court, are limited to determining whether the Fund\u2019s denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">According to the Union, the Fund properly relied upon the opinion of Laino in denying Scorsone\u2019s claim and such reliance was well within its discretion. We disagree. As the District Court noted, if Laino had received all the information Scorsone and Mauriello provided to the Fund during their appeal and affirmed his initial opinion, then the Fund\u2019s denial of Scorsone\u2019s claim would likely be within its discretion. Instead, the Fund failed to supply Laino with this additional information and decided to simply deny Scorsone\u2019s claim without obtaining a medical opinion that considered this new evidence. At trial, a Fund administrator who had no medical training stated that she determined that the information supplied in response to the Fund\u2019s initial denial was not new and, therefore, Scorsone\u2019s appeal was turned down without further consultation with Laino or any other medical professional. As the District Court noted, this is not a case of the Fund favoring the opinion of one doctor over the opinion of another. <em>See, e.g., Abnathya, </em>2 F.3d at 47-48 (explaining that the Sixth Circuit has held that ERISA plan administrators may, within their discretion, rely on a single independent medical evaluation to deny benefits and holding that reliance on two such medical evaluations was \u201cclearly not unreasonable\u201d). Instead, this is a case where the Fund, without requesting the opinion of a doctor or other medical professional, denied Scorsone\u2019s appeal of the denial of her claim in the face of medical evidence and a medical opinion submitted by Mauriello that supported the payment of that claim. By failing to forward this information on to Laino so that he could consider it in reference to his initial opinion and, instead, simply discounting the new information and affirming the denial of Scorsone\u2019s claim, the Fund acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. <em>See, e.g., Lain v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>279 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>F.3d 337, 342 (5th Cir.2002) (holding that a plan\u2019s denial of a claim for benefits in the face of medical evidence supportive of that claim is an abuse of discretion when that denial is not founded on \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d). Accordingly, the District Court was correct in both denying the Union\u2019s motion for summary judgment and finding in favor of Scorsone after the bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Finally, the Union claims that the District Court erred by awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to Scorsone. In ERISA cases, a District Court is permitted to award attorneys\u2019 fees after it determines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">1) the offending parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">2) the ability of the offending parties to satisfy an award of attorneys\u2019 fees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">3) the deterrent effect of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the offending parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">4) the benefit conferred on members of the pension plan as a whole; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-10\"><em>Ursic v. Bethlehem Mines, </em>719 F.2d 670, 673 (3d Cir.1983). We review the District Court\u2019s decision regarding attorneys\u2019 fees for abuse of discretion. <em>McPherson v. Employees\u2019 Pension Plan of Am. Re-Ins. Co., </em>33 F.3d 253, 256 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">It is clear that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees. The District Court applied each of the <em>Ursic </em>factors to the facts and adequately analyzed those factors. In particular, the District Court found that the Fund\u2019s actions were culpable, the Fund was able to satisfy the fee award and the Fund\u2019s participants would be benefitted by the deterrent effect such an award would have on the Fund. The District Court\u2019s analysis was sound and its award of fees was well within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">For the foregoing reasons we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment in favor of Scorsone, its use of a bench trial and its award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">. During the bench trial, representatives of the Fund were clear that they do not engage in pre-approval of procedures. Instead, the Fund wishes to be notified of upcoming procedures and only after they are completed and billed does it determine whether the procedures are covered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-12\">. The Fund explained that partial payments made to Mauriello were in error. Whether this is accurate is not relevant to our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
