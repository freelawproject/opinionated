Jalomo contends that the district court erred by denying his motions to withdraw his guilty plea, suppress evidence, and dismiss his indictment. He contends that his 1996 deportation proceeding violated the Due Process Clause because the immigration judge erroneously informed him that he was not eligible for discretionary relief from deportation. Jalomo also contends, for the first time on appeal, that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Jalomo concedes that his contentions are foreclosed by this court\u2019s case law, but he raises them to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">An immigration judge\u2019s error in not informing an alien of eligibility for forms of discretionary relief does not violate the alien\u2019s right to due process. <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 230-31 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1135, 123 S.Ct. 922, 154 L.Ed.2d 827 (2003). The district court did not err by denying Jalomo\u2019s motions to withdraw the plea, suppress evidence, and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). We must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation and citation omitted). Accordingly, Jalomo has not established error, plain or otherwise, with respect to his conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
