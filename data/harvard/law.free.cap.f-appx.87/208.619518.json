Reed, </em>No. 96-CV-2292, 2001 WL 92225, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 880 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 2001). The injunction barred Reed from using the name \u201cThe Platters\u201d except as permitted by the terms of a 1987 Stipulation of Settlement (\u201cStipulation\u201d) entered into by Reed and The Five Platters, Inc. in the Southern District of Florida. <em>See id. </em>at *64-66, 2001 WL 92225. The Stipulation included an escape clause reserving Reed\u2019s ability to claim rights to \u201cThe Platters\u201d name \u201cin the event that a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>with all appeals being exhausted that provides that The Five Platters, Inc. has no right in the name \u2018The Platters.\u201d\u2019 <em>See Marshak, </em>229 F.Supp.2d at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">While Reed\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s February 1, 2001 decision was pending, the Ninth Circuit issued a summary order in <em>Five Platters, Inc. v. Powell, </em>7 Fed.Appx. 794 (9th Cir.2001), which implicated the rights of The Five Platters, Inc. to the mark, \u201cThe Platters,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 795, and might trigger the escape clause. On June 12, 2001, we affirmed by summary order, but only with respect to the injunction because no final judgment had been entered in the case. <em>See Marshak v. Reed, </em>13 Fed.Appx. 19, 20 (2d Cir.2001). With respect to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s order, we \u201cexpress[ed] no opinion regarding <em>Powell\u2019 </em>s effect on the parties\u2019 rights once all appeals in that matter have been exhausted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">On July 11, 2001, the district court ordered cancellation of Reed\u2019s service mark to \u201cThe Platters.\u201d <em>See Marshak v. Reed, </em>No. 96-CV-2292, 2001 WL 799571, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10429 at *10-13 (E.D.N.Y. July 11, 2001). Reed appealed again. We then vacated the district court\u2019s decision and remanded the case for reconsideration, directing that \u201cthe district court should consider Powell\u2019s impact [on the escape clause] ... in the first instance.\u201d <em>Marshak v. Reed, </em>34 Fed.Appx. 8, 10 (2d Cir.2002). On remand, the district court held that <em>Powell </em>did not trigger the escape clause in the Stipulation. <em>See Marshak, </em>229 F.Supp.2d at 185. Reed appealed for the third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. Mario v. P &amp; C Food Markets, Inc., </em>313 F.3d 758, 763 (2d Cir.2002). We affirm for substantially the reasons stated by the district court in its February 1, 2001 and November 1, 2002 orders. <em>See Marshak, </em>2001 WL 92225, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 880; <em>Marshak, </em>229 F.Supp.2d 179. We have considered Reed\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
