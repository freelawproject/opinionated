Garaufis, <em>District </em>Judge), denying his petition for a writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>habeas corpus. We review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. See Brown v. Artuz, </em>283 F.3d 492, 497 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) \u00a7 104(3), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (2000), requires us to defer to a state court\u2019s adjudication of the merits of a claim. Here, the Appellate Division denied on the merits Grant\u2019s claim, which now forms the basis of his habeas petition, that the trial court\u2019s admission of his post-arrest statement to rebut the testimony of Gina Edwards, a defense alibi witness, violated his Fifth Amendment rights. <em>See People v. Grant, </em>256 A.D.2d 418, 682 N.Y.S.2d 232, 233 (N.Y.App.Div.1998) (stating that Grant\u2019s statement \u201cwas properly offered to counter the defense alibi witness\u2019s claim\u201d and that Grant\u2019s \u201cremaining contention is without merit.\u201d). Therefore, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), a writ of habeas corpus may not issue with respect to this claim, \u201cunless the adjudication of the claim ... (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The statement at issue was made by Grant in response to custodial interrogation undertaken by Detective Michael Sanicola on May 13, 1995. At trial, Sanicola testified that before questioning Grant, he advised Grant \u201c[i]n summary\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">I informed him he had the right to remain silent; that he did not have to answer any questions; he had a right to an attorney; if he could not afford an attorney one would be provided for him; and that if he decided to talk ... to me, that he could stop at any time he wanted to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">On cross, defense counsel asked Sanicola seriatim whether he recited Grant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights \u201cfrom [his] head\u201d or whether he used a \u201crights form.\u201d Sanicola replied that he did not recite the rights from <em>memory </em>but rather read them from \u201cthe back of [his] activity log memo book.\u201d In light of this testimony, it would not have been unreasonable for the Appellate Division to have concluded that Sanicola provided Grant with a complete <em>Miranda </em>warning, notwithstanding Sanicola\u2019s failure to mention on direct that he had advised Grant that anything Grant said could have been used against him in a court of law. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>778 F.2d 925, 930-31 (2d Cir.1985) (assuming that the requirements <em>of Miranda were </em>satisfied where agents testified that they read the defendant the \u201cstandard interrogator advice of rights form\u201d); <em>People v. Gonzalez, </em>55 N.Y.2d 720, 447 N.Y.S.2d 145, 431 N.E.2d 630, 630-31 (1981) (holding that the suppression court was warranted in concluding that the interrogating officer properly stated the constitutional preinterrogation warnings in light of the officer\u2019s testimony that he read the defendant his rights from a blank police department arrest report form). If the statement was not <em>Miranda </em>defective, then its admission to rebut Edwards\u2019 testimony did not implicate Grant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
