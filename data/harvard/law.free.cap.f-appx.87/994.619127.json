We agree with the district court that the plain language of the indemnity agreement included in the Sale Contract and Warranty Deed entered into between Olin and the Port covering the sale of the property from Olin to the Port compels this result. The investigation and remediation costs at issue here fall squarely within the contractual provision obligating the Port to \u201cindemnify and defend [Olin] ... and hold [Olin] harmless from any and all claims with respect to any actual and/or alleged ... damage to any property arising out of or related to, [or] in connection with the Property including the landfill, and from contaminants emanating from the landfill.\u201d Although the LDEQ\u2019s claims are technically for reimbursement, investigation, and remediation, the claims arose because of damage to the property. The broad language \u201cwith respect to\u201d encompasses claims that are premised on property damages, such as the claims at issue in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Olin Corp. v. Yeargin Inc., </em>146 F.3d 398, 408-09 (6th Cir.1998) (holding that, under Tennessee law, an indemnification agreement covering \u201call loss, damage, liability, claims, demands, costs, or suits\u201d for \u201cproperty damage\u201d and \u201cpersonal injury\u2019 included claims under CERCLA and other environmental statutes resulting from the release of hazardous substances).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1030-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">. Our conclusion in this respect is bolstered (although it need not be) by the pains Olin took to be sure that the Port understood the various hazardous chemicals that Olin had placed in the landfill, by the \u201cAs Is\u201d nature of the sale, and by the fact that CERCLA predated the sale transaction by three years, all of which suggest that the parties specifically contemplated possible environmental liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
