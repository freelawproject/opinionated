We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Angulo-Dominguez v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th <em>Cir.2002). </em>We have jurisdiction to review habeas claims alleging constitutional or statutory error in the deportation process. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; <em>Gutierrez-Chavez v. INS, </em>298 F.3d 824, 828-30 (9th Cir.2002). The parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, so we recount it here only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">The Immigration Judge ordered Trailov removed <em>in abstentia </em>when he failed to appear for a hearing on whether discretionary relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182c (repealed 1996), would be granted. An alien who is ordered deported <em>in absentia </em>may have the deportation order rescinded upon a motion to reopen if the failure to appear was caused by \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). The decision of whether to grant a motion to reopen is discretionary, however. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b). The BIA\u2019s decision of whether to reopen a case <em>sua sponte, </em>moreover, is subject to the BIA\u2019s unfettered discretion. <em>Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002). The IJ\u2019s decisions not to grant Trailov\u2019s motion and not to reopen his case <em>sua sponte </em>did not involve Trailov\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief or any matters of statutory or constitutional interpretation. Nor did the BIA\u2019s decision to affirm the IJ. Rather, these decisions merely involved exercises of discretion, which we lack jurisdiction to review in habeas.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-17\">Contrary to Trailov\u2019s assertion, <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), is not a relevant change in the law. Under <em>St. Cyr, </em>Petitioner was entitled only to a hearing on whether discretionary relief under INA \u00a7 212(c) would be granted. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271. The IJ provided such a hearing, but Trailov did not attend it. That Trailov was ordered removed after not attending the hearing did not involve a violation of his statutory or constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-18\"><em>St. Cyr </em>also leads us to reject Trailov\u2019s argument that the dismissal of his habeas petition would violate his constitutional right to meaningful habeas review. There, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the Court stressed that habeas should remain available to answer pure questions of law. 533 U.S. at 307-08, 121 S.Ct. 2271. This case presents no such question.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Finally, Trailov has waived his summary affirmance and equal protection claims because he did not brief them. <em>See Ceja v. Stewart, </em>97 F.3d 1246, 1252 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Because Trailov\u2019s habeas petition poses no statutory or constitutional questions, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b719-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
