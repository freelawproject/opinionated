The district court sentenced him to thirty months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-21\">Villarreal-Medina asserts that the written judgment of conviction must be reformed to delete a condition of supervised release that prohibits his possession of a dangerous weapon. He asserts that this condition is a special condition of supervised release that conflicts with the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-26\">Villarreal-Medina\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 938 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
