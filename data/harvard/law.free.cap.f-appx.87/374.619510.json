On appeal, Gomez asserts that he was not required to exhaust administrative remedies because: (1) he was seeking monetary damages, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>were not available from the administrative process; (2) he should be excused from fulfilling the exhaustion requirement due to the fact that his administrative grievance was erroneously denied as untimely; and (3) he fulfilled the exhaustion requirement by submitting informal complaints to various prison officials. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) <em>de novo. See Powe v. Ennis, </em>177 F.3d 393, 394 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Gomez\u2019s first two arguments lack merit under applicable precedent. <em>See Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 740-41, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001) (exhaustion is required even where money damages are sought); <em>id. </em>at 741 n. 6, 121 S.Ct. 1819 (\u201cwe will not read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements\u201d). His third argument relies solely upon <em>Wyatt v. Leonard, </em>193 F.3d 876, 878 (6th Cir.1999), which is not applicable to the instant case because, unlike in <em>Wyatt, </em>the instant alleged constitutional violation did not occur prior to passage of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Gomez also contends that the district court erred by dismissing his instant lawsuit without conducting a Spears<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing. Because additional factual development would not have aided Gomez in fulfilling the exhaustion requirement, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing his lawsuit without conducting a <em>Spears </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\">. <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
