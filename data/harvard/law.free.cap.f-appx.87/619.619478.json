Probable cause exists when \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances known to the arresting officers, a prudent person would have concluded that there was a fair probability that [the defendant] had committed a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 640 (9th Cir.2002) <em>(quoting United States v. Garza, </em>980 F.2d 546, 550 (9th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Its existence is gauged \u201c \u2018at the moment the arrest was made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Orin v. Barclay, </em>272 F.3d 1207, 1218 (9th Cir.2001) <em>(quoting Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964)). Together, the officers\u2019 discovery on Rincon-Perez\u2019s lawn of a motocross bike matching the victim\u2019s description and the victim\u2019s unequivocal eyewitness identification within 35 minutes of the crime, provided, at the time they effectuated his arrest, sufficient grounds for the officers\u2019 belief that there was a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>probability that Rincon-Perez had committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We find unavailing the claim that the victim\u2019s eyewitness identification was constitutionally infirm. In evaluating the validity of an eyewitness identification for probable cause purposes, we engage in a sequential, two-part inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">(1) Did the officers employ an identification procedure so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of misidentification? <em>And if so, </em>(2) did the witnesses exhibit sufficient indicia of reliability to protect the integrity of their identifications?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\"><em>Grant v. City of Long Beach, </em>315 F.3d 1081, 1086 (9th Cir.2002) (emphasis added). That Rincon-Perez was standing between two police officers when the victim identified him and that the victim believed him to be in custody at the time she identified him fail to render the identification impermissibly suggestive. <em>See, e.g., Yong Ho Choi v. Gaston, </em>220 F.3d 1010, 1013 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>84 F.3d 1206, 1210 (9th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>772 F.2d 482, 492 (9th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Kessler, </em>692 F.2d 584, 586 (9th Cir.1982). Because the victim\u2019s eyewitness identification was not impermissibly suggestive, we need not address the reliability of her identification. <em>Bagley, </em>772 F.2d at 493; <em>see also United States v. Davenport, </em>753 F.2d 1460, 1463 n. 2 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Although Rincon-Perez\u2019s prolonged detention was unfortunate, we also reject the argument that the police unconstitutionally failed to investigate potentially exculpatory evidence uncovered at the scene of the crime. Once probable cause has been established, the police are neither required to \u201cinvestigate independently every claim of innocence,\u201d nor compelled \u201cby the Constitution to perform an error-free investigation of such a claim.\u201d <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 145-46, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">Even assuming for the sake of argument that the police were obliged to perform further investigatory work, they were not responsible for Rincon-Perez\u2019s incarceration pending trial. <em>See Webb v. Sloan, </em>330 F.3d 1158, 1165 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cThe Nevada Supreme Court has noted that \u2018the matter of the prosecution of any criminal case is within the <em>entire control </em>of the district attorney.\u2019 <em>Cairns v. Sheriff, Clark County, </em>89 Nev. 113, 508 P.2d 1015, 1017 (1973) (per curiam) (emphasis added). Thus, in Nevada, principal district attorneys \u2018are final policymakers for the local government in a particular area, or on a particular issue.\u2019 <em>McMillian v. Monroe County, </em>520 U.S. 781, 785, 117 S.Ct. 1734, 138 L.Ed.2d 1 (1997). <em>Specifically, Nevada district attorneys are final policymakers in the particular area or particular issue relevant here: the decision to continue to imprison and to </em>prosecute.\u201d) (first emphasis in original) (internal citations edited)). Finally, we note that the allegedly exculpatory evidence identified by RinconPerez proved only, at best, that Francisco Garcia had at some undetermined point been present on the burgled property-not that Rincon-Perez was innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">Because \u201cno constitutional right[s] would have been violated were [RinconPerez\u2019s] allegations established, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001).
