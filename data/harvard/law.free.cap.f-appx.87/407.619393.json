Finding that Larrew\u2019s RICO claim was inextricably intertwined with his claim alleging that his divorce decree was invalid, the district court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em><footnotemark>**</footnotemark> doctrine. Larrew\u2019s motion for disqualification of the judges of this court based on their alleged membership in the ABA is DENIED. <em>See In re City of Houston, </em>745 F.2d 925, 929 n. 8 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In his opening brief on appeal, Larrew argues only that the district court erroneously dismissed the ABA as a party defendant because he had not properly and timely effected service of process. By failing to brief the issue whether the district court correctly dismissed his action under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, Larrew has abandoned that issue. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379, 1386 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Thus, the judgment of the district court dismissing Larrew\u2019s RICO action is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">We GRANT the SBT\u2019s motion and award the SBT its reasonable costs expended on this appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 39(a)(2). The SBT is directed to file a verified bill of costs and an affidavit of reasonable expenses with the Clerk of Court within 14 days after entry of judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.
