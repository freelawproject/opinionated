The jury specifically found Cal\u00edais intentionally and knowingly made physical contact with the officer and the officer suffered bodily injury as a result. Cal\u00edais appeals asserting there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that Callais\u2019s conduct caused the officer\u2019s injuries. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and giving the Government the benefit of all reasonable inferences, we conclude a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that when Cal\u00edais punched the officer in the face, it caused the officer abrasions that amounted to bodily injury. The evidence included testimony by the officer and another officer who witnessed the altercation. Cal\u00edais also contends the Government failed to prove he intentionally caused the officer\u2019s injury. The Government was not required to prove intent to injure, however. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>310 F.3d 554, 556 (7th Cir.2002). We thus affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-24\"> The Honorable Lyle E.
