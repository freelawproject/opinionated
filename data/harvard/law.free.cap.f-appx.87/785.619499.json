Curto\u2019s appeal from the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-23\">Plaintiff Patricia J. Curto (\u201cCurto\u201d), <em>pro se, </em>challenges the dismissal of her claims in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (Scullin, <em>C.J.) </em>in its Memorandum-Decision and Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>der filed April 23, 2003. The Memorandum-Decision and Order dismissed all of Curto\u2019s claims arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (\u201cFERPA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232(g), based on the release of her academic records before and during her <em>pro se </em>litigation in federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The underlying claims that gave rise to Curto\u2019s original litigation were appealed to this Court by Curto and disposed of by this Court in a summary order. <em>Curto v. Smith, </em>87 Fed.Appx. 788, No. 03-6086, 2004 WL 287290 (2d Cir. Feb. 12, 2004). Familiarity with the facts of Curto\u2019s original litigation is presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The claims in this appeal were referred to in the district court\u2019s Memorandum-Decision and Order as <em>\u201cCurto IV. </em>\u201d In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding that the nondisclosure provisions of FERPA \u201ccreate no rights enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d <em>Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, </em>536 U.S. 273, 290-91, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002), we affirm the dismissal of Curto\u2019s claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and FERPA against Nelson Roth, Valerie Cross, Cornell University, Donald Smith, the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine, Susan Stevens Suarez, Linda Allen Mizer, Hunter Rawlings III, Katherine Edmondson, and Lisa Clark. For the same reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of similar claims by Curto against Rod Paige, Leroy Rooker, and the U.S. Department of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">We affirm the dismissal of Curto\u2019s \u00a7 1983 and FERPA claims against Robert B. Mills, Robert King, and the State University of New York for substantially the same Eleventh Amendment considerations stated by the district court in its Memorandum-Decision and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">We have reviewed the other arguments raised by Curto in the appeal and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s dismissal of these claims is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
