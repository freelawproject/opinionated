After allowing Pointer to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP), the district court dismissed his complaint prior to service, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). The court reasoned that the complaint was frivolous because of its similarity to Pointer\u2019s previous IFP complaint that had been dismissed as frivolous, and that the claims were barred by the principles of res judicata. Further, the district court certified that an appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). Pointer appeals. We have reviewed the record de novo, <em>Moore v. Sims, </em>200 F.3d 1170, 1171 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam), and affirm the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47A(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
