In June 1995, Deuschle and that predecessor firm signed a Consulting Agreement whereby Deuschle agreed to share with Godwin \u201cthe contingent fee in this matter to the extent of one-third (%rd) thereof\u2019. This Consulting Agreement referred to a proposed letter of engagement (Fee Agreement) with the class action plaintiffs; that letter was attached to the agreement signed by God-win.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">That attached letter was a memorandum of the Fee Agreement between the class action plaintiffs and Deuschle. It stated that Deuschle would receive \u201c[f]orty percent (40%) of gross recovery regardless of amount and regardless of whether secured by settlement or collection of final judgment\u201d. The Fee Agreement noted further that Godwin\u2019s predecessor firm had been retained as a consultant in exchange for \u201cone third fl\u00e9rd) of any contingency fee received by [Deuschle]\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-18\">Subsequently, however, Deuschle amended several times the Fee Agreement with the class action plaintiffs, without notice to Godwin. Essentially, these changes deducted costs from the calculation of Deuschle\u2019s fee, thereby substantially re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ducing the total amount of the fee; and Deuschle agreed eventually to accept a flat fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The class action settled in November 1999 for $1.75 million. Godwin claims it is owed $233,333.33 fl\u00e9 of 40% of $1.75 million); Deuschle, that, pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, it owes Godwin only % of the $268,000 fee it received <em>Qk </em>is $89,333.33). The district court awarded Godwin $233,333.33, based on its conclusion that the Fee Agreement provided that Godwin receive % of 40% of the gross recovery and it had been incorporated by reference into the Consulting Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We generally review decisions to alter or amend judgment under Rule 59(e) for abuse of discretion. <em>Midland West Corp. v. FDIC, </em>911 F.2d 1141, 1145 (5th Cir.1990). To the extent that the ruling was a reconsideration on a question of law, however, review is <em>de novo. Tyler v. Union Oil Co., </em>304 F.3d 379, 405 (5th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s refusal to alter or amend the judgment rests in part on its conclusion that the Fee Agreement was incorporated by reference into the Consulting Agreement; therefore, our review is arguably <em>de novo. </em>In any event, the result is the same under either standard. Jurisdiction is based on diversity, and the district court\u2019s decision that Texas law governs has not been challenged. Therefore, we look to Texas contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Deuschle contends: our primary concern should be to give effect to the intent of the parties; and the clear intent of the Consulting Agreement was for Godwin to receive % of the fee Deuschle received. While this may be true of the Consulting Agreement alone, it referred to the Fee Agreement; both agreements were attached and submitted together for God-win\u2019s approval. For incorporation by reference under Texas law, \u201c[t]he language used is not important provided the document signed by defendant plainly refers to another writing\u201d. <em>Owen v. Hendricks, </em>433 S.W.2d 164, 166 (Tex.1968). The Consulting Agreement stated: \u201cConsistent with our conversation, you will find enclosed a copy of the proposed letter of engagement by the Plaintiffs.... \u201d Therefore, the Consulting Agreement incorporated the Fee Agreement by reference; these two documents must be read together to ascertain the parties\u2019 intent. <em>Wolfe v. Speed Fab-Crete Corp. Int\u2019l, </em>507 S.W.2d 276, 278 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Fort Worth 1974, no writ).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The Fee Agreement provides that Deuschle would receive \u201c[fjorty percent (40%) of gross recovery\u201d and that \u201cone-third (%rd) of any contingency fee received by [Deuschle]\u201d would go to Godwin. Specific provisions control over general ones, <em>Forbau v. Aetna Life Ins., </em>876 S.W.2d 132, 133 (Tex.1994); and \u201c40% of gross recovery\u201d is more specific than of any contingency fee\u201d. Therefore, the intent of the parties was for Godwin to receive % of 40% of the amount recovered in the class action. Godwin was not notified of the subsequent changes to the Fee Agreement; therefore those changes are irrelevant. <em>Safeway Managing Gen. Agency for State and County Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Cooper, </em>952 S.W.2d 861, 867 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo 1997, no pet.) (holding that a party cannot make unilateral modifications to a contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Deuschle further asserts that the district court erred in considering parol evidence to support its conclusion. Based on the foregoing, both the holding of incorporation by reference and the damage award to Godwin are correct, irrespective of the parol evidence. Therefore, we do not reach this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
