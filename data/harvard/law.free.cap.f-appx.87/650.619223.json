We have juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>diction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">I. <em>Phillips\u2019 Motions to Dismiss the Indictment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Many of Phillips\u2019 arguments assert that the district court erred when it refused to dismiss the indictment against him. Phillips based several of his arguments on an estoppel theory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court correctly concluded that Phillips\u2019 claim of reliance upon the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 letter rested on factual issues that were best left to the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The district court appropriately concluded that Phillips failed to show that the court should dismiss the indictment because the federal prosecution was a sham for the state prosecution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, Phillips\u2019 claims based upon successive prosecution also fail. The federal agencies conducted substantial investigation prior to the termination of the state proceedings. Furthermore, the state did not pay for the federal prosecution, and its personnel were not in charge of the federal prosecution. Although state personnel testified in the federal prosecution, this shows nothing more than \u201cclose coordination\u201d between two sovereigns, which is constitutionally acceptable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-17\">In addressing Phillips\u2019 due process argument,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the district court correctly concluded that the CWA \u201cprovide[d] adequate notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that his contemplated conduct [was] illegal.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Phillips should have known that his conduct might be prohibited. The CWA defines \u201cpollutant\u201d broadly to include materials like dredged spoil (i.e., dredged earth), rock, and sand, which are not inherently harmful.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Phillips, as a real estate developer, is expected to apprise himself of the reach of the law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further, because the CWA includes a <em>mens rea </em>of \u201cknowingly\u201d for criminal violations, Phil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>lips must make a more robust showing that he did not have adequate notice that this conduct was illegal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that the district court appropriately refused to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">II. <em>Phillips\u2019 Pretrial Interview Request</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Phillips also contends that the district court erred by concluding that it had no power to order witnesses to submit to pretrial interviews with Phillips\u2019 counsel. Contrary to Phillips\u2019 suggestion, the court did not base its decision on a lack of power. Instead, it concluded that Phillips failed to show prosecutorial misconduct. Witnesses have a right to refuse to grant interviews.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the absence of any showing of prosecutorial misconduct,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the district court correctly refused to override the witnesses\u2019 choice not to talk to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">III. <em>Phillips\u2019Impeachment Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Phillips failed to preserve his claim that the district court improperly precluded him from impeaching witnesses. He made no offer of proof to clarify the proposed line of questioning.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the district court did not have an opportunity to make an informed judgment. Because Phillips has not shown plain error,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we hold that Phillips failed to preserve this claim and we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">IV. <em>Phillips\u2019 Jury Instruction Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">Phillips also asserts several claims regarding the district court\u2019s jury instructions. We address one of these claims in the accompanying opinion in this case. Phillips\u2019 remaining jury instruction claims all fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-18\">First, the court\u2019s jury instructions did not present a risk of a non-unanimous verdict. Even assuming that unanimity was required on all of the points Phillips contends, he did not show there was a risk of jury confusion under the facts of his case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For example, the district court gave both a specific and a general unanimity instruction, and the court provided the jury with a chart showing the date, place, and pollutant alleged for each count. Thus, the district court\u2019s instructions reduced any risk that the jury would render a non-unanimous verdict.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Second, Phillips argues, relying upon <em>Staples v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that the <em>mens rea </em>required for CWA criminal violations is more than a knowing discharge of a pollutant. Phillips\u2019 reliance upon <em>Staples </em>in this context is precluded by our decision in <em>United States v. Weitzenhoff,</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which rejected the application of the <em>Staples </em>analysis in construing the CWA <em>mens rea </em>requirement.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A reasonable jury could conclude that Phillips knew the fact of and the content of the discharge. Even assuming that the court\u2019s jury instructions could allow a conviction without a finding that Phillips knew the factual nature of the discharge,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the testimony in this case rendered any error harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Third, the district court correctly refused to instruct the jury that the Government must prove that Phillips\u2019 discharges caused a degradation of aquatic resources. The CWA does not require proof of environmental harm.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Fourth, Phillips argues that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the statutory requirements for a criminal violation of the CWA. Phillips\u2019 arguments fail because the court\u2019s instructions did not</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">misstate the law and were certainly not an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b687-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\">.

Savage, </em>67 F.3d 1435 (9th Cir.1995), is misplaced. The <em>Savage </em>indictment was duplicitous, charging two separate crimes from two statutory subsections in each count. <em>Id. </em>at 1439. The instructions required the jury to find the elements of both offenses to convict on any one count. <em>Id. </em>at 1439 &amp; n. 4. Accordingly, the instructions did not raise a risk of non-unanimity because by \"combining the two offenses ... the government had ... imposed an additional burden on itself.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1440. However, an indictment charging a defendant with violating the CWA by discharging multiple pollutants does not charge two different statutory offenses. <em>See United States v. DeFilippis, </em>637 F.2d 1370, 1374 &amp; n. 7 (9th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. UCO Oil Co., </em>546 F.2d 833, 838 (9th Cir.1976). Therefore, <em>Savage </em>is not applicable to this case.
