The investigation stemmed from allegations that Turlington, a correctional officer, was having sexual relations with female inmates. The investigation confirmed that Turlington had 30 sexual encounters with six different inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-24\">Turlington contends that the district court erred in departing upward to a sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. Turlington argues that the district court\u2019s justification for the upward departure, that U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.2 and 3D1.4 would assign one unit for each sexual encounter, as opposed to one unit per victim, and that the resulting guideline range did not adequately reflect the seriousness of the crimes, was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-25\">Whether the standard of review is abuse of discretion or de novo, the district court did not err in its grouping analysis under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4. <em>See United States v. Bell, </em>351 F.3d 672, 675-77 (5th Cir.2003); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4. Moreover, the district court gave acceptable reasons for departing, and the extent of the departure was reasonable. <em>See United States v.
