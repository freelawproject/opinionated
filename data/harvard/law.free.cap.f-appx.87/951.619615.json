He argues that the district court plainly erred in characterizing his prior state felony conviction for simple possession of marijuana as an aggravated felony within the context of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1948, 155 L.Ed.2d 864 (2003), but wishes to preserve the issue for further review. <em>Caicedo-Cuero </em>determined that simple drug possession qualifies as an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). 312 F.3d at 706-11. Thus, the district court did not plainly err in treating Villa-Negrete\u2019s pri- or state conviction for simple possession of marijuana as an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-20\">Villa-Negrete also argues for the first time on appeal that a prior state felony conviction for simple possession is not a drug trafficking crime and not an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) or 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by current\" Fifth Circuit law, citing <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1146, 122 S.Ct. 1105, 151 L.Ed.2d 1001 (2002), and <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). Thus, the district court did not plainly err in applying the eight-level adjustment to his offense level based on his prior state felony drug conviction. <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943) does not affect the binding precedential value of <em>Rivera </em>and <em>Hinojosa-Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-22\">Villa-Negrete argues, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>visions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are elements of the offense, not sentence enhancements, making those provisions unconstitutional. Villa-Negrete concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and he raises it for possible review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Toms, </em>523 U.S. at 235. We must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b988-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
