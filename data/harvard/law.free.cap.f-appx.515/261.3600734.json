Torres argues that the sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-26\">Revocation sentences generally are reviewed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011). However, because no objections were made at the revocation hearing, this court\u2019s review of Torres\u2019s revocation sentence is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Torres argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. Torres argues that a sentence within the advisory guideline range would have been sufficient considering that his violations were not drug related and reflected only his continuing struggle to control his anger during an argument. However, the district court expressly \u201cconsidered the policy statements contained within Chapter 7 of the sentencing guidelines manual and [found] their application to be inadequate.\u201d Although the district court did not expressly refer to \u00a7 3553, it was aware of Torres\u2019s history and characteristics in that it presided over his first revocation proceeding. Furthermore, the district court\u2019s comments regarding Torres\u2019s \u201csmart aleck\u201d attitude reveal its determination that a guidelines sentence would not adequately deter Torres\u2019s propensity for failing to follow the rules and would not sufficiently protect the public. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C). Therefore, Torres has not shown that the district court failed to consider the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 261. Torres\u2019s sentence of 24 months, to be followed by a lifetime of supervised release, is within the statutory maximum revocation penalty and does not constitute error, much less plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Torres also argues that the Double Jeopardy Clause was violated when the district court increased his supervised release term from five years to life. As he acknowledges, however, this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>559 F.3d 368, 371 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
