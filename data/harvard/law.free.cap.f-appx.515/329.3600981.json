He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of a sentence reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based upon the amendment to the Guidelines implementing the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-23\">Phillips maintains that he was entitled to a sentencing reduction, and he urges that the district court erred in giving excessive weight to \u201cnegative factors,\u201d such as his criminal history, instead of focusing on his positive post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts. He asserts that the district court improperly balanced the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and that, had it properly balanced them, it would have reduced his sentence to the low end of the modified range, 155 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-24\">We review the decision to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). In determining whether to reduce a sentence, the court first determines whether a sentence modification is authorized and to what extent. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Next, the court must consider any applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and determine whether any reduction is warranted. <em>Id. </em>at 2692.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-27\">The district court implicitly determined that Phillips was eligible for a reduction, <em>see United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011), but concluded that a reduction was not warranted in the light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the circumstances of his case. Having concluded that Phillips was eligible for a reduction, the court was under no obligation to reduce his sentence. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1 (B)(i-iii)). The court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Phillips\u2019 post-sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>fencing conduct. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73; \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1 (B)(i)-(iii). No abuse of discretion has been shown. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
