He received, <em>inter alia, </em>168 months\u2019 imprisonment. He asserts the factual basis for his guilty plea did not establish: his intent to join a narcotics conspiracy; or his knowledge that the conspiracy involved a minimum of 50 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Because Jurado did not challenge the sufficiency of the factual basis in district court, review is for plain error only. <em>United States v. Trejo, </em>610 F.3d 308, 313 (5th Cir.2010). For reversible plain error, Ju-rado must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Jurado has not shown the district court plainly erred in finding a sufficient factual basis to support his guilty plea and the sentence imposed. The record as a whole shows he knowingly and voluntarily participated in an agreement to violate the drug laws. <em>See Trejo, </em>610 F.3d at 317. As for the drug quantity, the factual basis was sufficient to establish Jurado knew the offense involved more than 50 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Jurado has not shown any error in the district court\u2019s assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence to support his plea. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Moreover, he fails to contend he would not have pleaded guilty but for the deficiencies of the factual basis, as required by <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
