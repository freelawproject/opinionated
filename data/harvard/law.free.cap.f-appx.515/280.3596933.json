Plaintiff filed suit alleging an excessive force claim under \u00a7 1983 and state law claims for battery, excessive force, failure to perform duties in a safe and reasonable manner, and torture. The district court awarded summary judgment to Defendants on the basis of qualified immunity. Plaintiff appeals. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">The traffic stop and subsequent events were captured by Deputy Sturdivant\u2019s dashboard camera. The traffic stop was conducted by Sturdivant. After Sturdi-vant and Stogner pulled over to the side of the road, both men exited their vehicles and proceeded to converse amicably. Sturdivant noticed a small plastic bag in Stogner\u2019s hand. When Sturdivant inquired about the bag and asked Stogner to release it, Stogner denied he was holding anything and resisted efforts to show his hand and then to be handcuffed. After about six minutes, Officer Melerine and another officer arrived at the scene, where Melerine helped Sturdivant restrain Stog-ner on the ground. The officers finally handcuffed him. A fourth officer who had arrived noticed that Stogner was not breathing. The officers attempted to remove the plastic bag from Stogner\u2019s mouth, administered CPR, and called for an ambulance. Stogner was transported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The bag contained methamphetamine. The evidence is that Stogner had cardiomegaly (an over-sized heart) and 95% narrowing of his left anterior descending coronary artery; that 4,400 nano-grams per millileter of metamphetamine were found in Stogner\u2019s blood during an autopsy, which is approximately 4,000 ng/ml more than necessary to induce violent and irrational behavior; and that Stogner\u2019s pre-existing heart conditions and the metamphetamine abuse contributed to Stogner\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The issue on appeal is whether Sturdi-vant and Melerine are entitled to qualified immunity. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Hillman v. Loga, </em>697 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.2012). As a general rule, summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute to any material fact.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). Where the officer pleads qualified immunity in good faith, the burden then shifts to the plaintiff, who \u201cbears the burden of negating the defense and cannot rest on conclusory allegations and assertions but must demonstrate genuine issues of material fact regarding the reasonableness of the officer\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Michalik v. Hermann, </em>422 F.3d 252, 262 (5th Cir.2005). In order to meet her burden, the plaintiff must show that \u201cthe officers\u2019 actions were objectively unreasonable, in light of clearly-established law at the time, and in light of the information the officers possessed.\u201d <em>Wagner v. Bay City, Tex., </em>227 F.3d 316, 321 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cQualified immunity thus protects an official whose conduct was objectively reasonable, even if the conduct infringed upon a constitutional right of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Having reviewed the dashboard video, we agree with the district court\u2019s reasoning and thus conclude that Sturdivant\u2019s and Melerine\u2019s actions were not objectively unreasonable. The crux of Plaintiffs argument is that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether and how her husband resisted arrest. Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendants\u2019 actions were in themselves legally permissible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, her central complaint is that Defendants\u2019 actions were not commensurate with her husband\u2019s actions because her husband did not actively resist arrest and, relatedly, did not pose a physical threat to the officers; thus, she contends that Defendants\u2019 actions were objectively unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>However, the dashboard video demonstrates otherwise. Stogner repeatedly refused to comply with Sturdivant\u2019s requests to \u201cspit [the bag] out\u201d and to place his hands behind his back. Sturdivant struggled to restrain Stogner, a relatively large man, against the hood of his patrol car and on the ground. At no point from the beginning of Sturdivant\u2019s initial request to release the plastic bag until the end of the struggle did Stogner attempt to comply with Sturdivant; indeed, Sturdivant had to exert considerable force to keep Stogner even minimally still. We cannot conclude from this evidence that Sturdivant\u2019s conduct was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Likewise, the video does not show that Melerine acted with objective unreasonableness in attempting to restrain Stogner. At the moment that Melerine arrived, Sturdivant had not succeeded in handcuffing Stogner, and Sturdivant and Stogner were still engaged in a struggle. Mele-rine\u2019s application of force to Stogner\u2019s body was not clearly unreasonable in light of that struggle.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that Sturdivant\u2019s and Melerine\u2019s actions were not objectively unreasonable, and thus the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. This conclusion also decides Plaintiffs state law claims, all of which require unreasonable conduct. Plaintiff acknowledges this result, stating in her appeal brief that \u201cthe state law claims against Deputy Sturdiavnt and Officer Melerine arise from the same set of facts\u201d as that of the \u00a7 1983 claim, and thus resolution of the \u00a7 1983 claim preordains resolution of the state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Accordingly, the district court properly awarded summary judgment to Defendants Sturdivant and Melerine on Plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim and her state law claims. We emphasize that we agree with the district court that Stogner\u2019s death is unfortunate, but \u201cgiven Mr. Stogner\u2019s intransigence in the face of Sturdivant\u2019s lawful requests, the Court cannot deny Deputy Sturdivant [and Officer Melerine] the qualified immunity [they are] entitled to under the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-5\">. For instance, although it is arguable whether a choke-hold was ever used on Stogner (the video shows Sturdivant wrapping his arms around Stogner\u2019s neck to prevent him from swallowing the plastic bag), choke-holds in themselves are not legally impermissible. <em>See Wagner, </em>227 F.3d at 324 (5th Cir.2000) (holding choke-hold not objectively unreasonable where suspect physically resisted arrest). Likewise, application of force to the throat to prevent destruction of evidence is not in itself legally impermissible. <em>See United States v. Harrison, </em>432 F.2d 1328, 1330 (D.C.Cir.1970) (holding police did not act with undue force or brutality by grabbing defendant by the throat to prevent him from swallowing an envelope with ten heroin capsules).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\">. Throughout her appeal briefs, Plaintiff argues a distinction between \"passive resistance\u201d and \"active resistance,\u201d the latter presumably encompassing instances when a suspect physically strikes an officer. Plaintiff cites no authority for why \u201cactive resistance\u201d is a prerequisite for the reasonableness of officers\u2019 conduct in circumstances such as these, and we are not convinced that this distinction alters the outcome. Similarly, we are not convinced that Stogner's presenting a physical threat to officers was a prerequisite for the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 conduct, especially where he was otherwise resisting arrest and where the officers were lawfully permitted to prevent the destruction of evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
