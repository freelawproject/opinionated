(\u201cWal-Mart\u201d) in her suit for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. McLeod also appeals the denial of her motion for sanctions for spoliation of evidence. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">Briefly stated, McLeod\u2019s complaint asserted that she was wrongfully accused of stealing $2000 from the Wal-Mart store where she worked as an assistant manager. These facts, viewed in the light most favorable to McLeod, are pertinent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wal-Mart discovered that a loan bag<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> containing $2000 was missing. After reviewing surveillance videos, the store\u2019s Asset Protection Coordinator, Selma Lamb, identified only two employees who had accessed the locked podium where the missing loan bag had been kept. One of the two employees was McLeod.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">The district court summarized the contents of the video this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-12\">The footage is taken from a considerable distance and the Plaintiffs back largely obstructs a clear view of what her hands are doing. However, the footage does show the Plaintiff shortly before her shift ends: (1) alone at the CSM podium; (2) facing the CSM podium and bending over in the vicinity of where the drawers were located; (3) straightening herself upright; (4) turning toward the carousel behind her ..., where she had earlier placed a stack of broken-down register boxes; (5) retrieving the stack of boxes and then turning and moving them back to the top of the CSM podium; and (6) lifting the entire stack of broken-down boxes off the CSM podium and walking away towards the back of the store where the baler<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">No surveillance cameras were located in the room with the baler, but McLeod testified that she carried the broken-down register boxes to the back of the store and put them in the baler.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">In trying to locate the missing loan bag, Lamb wanted to search the cardboard bales stacked in the store\u2019s parking lot. Lamb used video surveillance to narrow her search to only those bales that were moved to the parking lot <em>after </em>McLeod put the boxes in the baler. As it turned out, only one bale was moved to the store\u2019s parking lot that night. When Lamb cut that bale open, she found the empty loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>bag among some broken-down register boxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Wal-Mart reported the theft to the police. McLeod was arrested and indicted for theft by taking, but the criminal case against McLeod was eventually dismissed. McLeod filed this suit against Wal-Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"AjA\">\n<em>Spoliation Sanctions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The surveillance tape \u2014 the one Lamb used to identify the bale generated after McLeod\u2019s shift \u2014 was recorded over in the normal course of business. McLeod filed a motion for spoliation sanctions based on the destruction of this video evidence. The district court denied the motion, concluding that the video had no practical importance to McLeod\u2019s case, that McLeod suffered no prejudice, and that Wal-Mart had not acted in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">We review a district court\u2019s decision about spoliation sanctions under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Flury v. Daimler Chrysler Corp., </em>427 F.3d 939, 943 (11th Cir.2005). In determining whether spoliation sanctions are warranted, courts consider five factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-7\">(1) whether the [party seeking sanctions] was prejudiced as a result of the destruction of evidence; (2) whether the prejudice could be cured; (3) the practical importance of the evidence; (4) whether the [spoliating party] acted in good or bad faith; and (5) the potential for abuse [if the evidence is] not excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 945. The fifth factor is not applicable to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The deleted video was not pertinent to McLeod\u2019s claims for false arrest, malicious prosecution, or intentional infliction of emotional distress. The parties agree that the video would have shown a Wal-Mart employee \u2014 other than McLeod \u2014 transporting the pertinent bale on a push cart to a loading area. Neither McLeod nor the missing loan bag were visible on the video. Probable cause to suspect McLeod of theft arose from another video: the video of her conduct at the podium, plus that the missing loan bag was later found in a bale among the same type of box that McLeod had placed in the baler. The missing video was not a key.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">In addition, to the extent that the deleted video \u2014 which was taken from <em>inside </em>the general merchandise area \u2014 established a temporal link between McLeod\u2019s conduct and the bale in which the missing loan bag was ultimately found, video surveillance from <em>outside </em>the general merchandise area (which was produced during discovery) established the same timeline. Thus, the deleted video had no practical importance to McLeod\u2019s case, and McLeod suffered no prejudice from its destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">McLeod argues that Wal-Mart acted in bad faith by failing to comply with her criminal lawyer\u2019s discovery requests. But McLeod\u2019s criminal lawyer requested surveillance footage from only specific locations in the store, which did not include the <em>inside </em>of the general merchandise area. Nothing evidences that Wal-Mart acted in bad faith in failing to preserve the pertinent video.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">Because each factor weighs against the granting of spoliation sanctions, we see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of McLeod\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">\n<em>Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\">To state a claim for either false arrest or malicious prosecution, McLeod must show \u2014 among other things \u2014 that Wal-Mart acted without probable cause. <em>See Desmond v. Troncalli Mitsubishi, </em>243 Ga. App. 71, 532 S.E.2d 463, 467 (2000) (noting that defendant is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution if plaintiff fails to demonstrate that defendant acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>without probable cause). \u201cIn determining whether probable cause existed, the question is, not whether plaintiff was guilty, but whether defendants had <em>reasonable cause to so believe </em>\u2014 whether the circumstances were such as to create in the mind of defendants a <em>reasonable belief </em>that there was probable cause for the arrest and prosecution.\u201d <em>Gibbs v. Loomis, </em>259 Ga.App. 170, 576 S.E.2d 589, 592 (2003) (emphasis in original). \u201cThe probable cause inquiry thus focuses on \u2018whether the facts <em>as they appeared at the time of instituting the prosecution </em>were such as to lead a person of ordinary caution to entertain a belief that the accused was guilty of the offense charged.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Only two Wal-Mart employees\u2014 one of whom was McLeod \u2014 had access to the missing loan bag. A surveillance video showed McLeod stacking broken-down register boxes on top of the podium where the missing loan bag was kept. Video footage also showed McLeod carrying the stack of broken-down boxes to the back of the store where McLeod testified she put them in the baler. The empty loan bag was then found among broken-down register boxes in a bale of cardboard boxes generated after McLeod visited the baler. In the light of these undisputed facts, Wal-Mart had reasonable cause to believe that McLeod was responsible for the theft. McLeod cannot show that Wal-Mart acted without probable cause. <em>See id. </em>No genuine issue of material fact exists; summary judgment was proper as to McLeod\u2019s claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Summary judgment was also proper on McLeod\u2019s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. To state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, McLeod must show, among other things, that Wal-Mart\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. <em>See Phinazee v. Interstate Nationalease, </em>237 Ga.App. 39, 514 S.E.2d 843, 844-45 (1999). \u201cLiability has been found only where the conduct has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">Nothing about Wal-Mart\u2019s investigation of the theft or Wal-Mart\u2019s reporting of the theft to police was extreme, outrageous, or utterly intolerable. <em>See, e.g., Southland Propane, Inc. v. McWhorter, </em>312 Ga.App. 812, 720 S.E.2d 270, 276-77 (2011) (concluding that an employer\u2019s conduct was not extreme and outrageous when the employer accused an employee of misappropriating funds and forgery, fired the employee, and reported the alleged crimes to the police). \u201cComments made within the context of one\u2019s employment may be horrifying or traumatizing, but [they] are generally considered a common vicissitude of ordinary life.\u201d <em>Abdul-Malik v. AirTran Airways, Inc., </em>297 Ga.App. 852, 678 S.E.2d 555, 560 (2009). \u201cThe same is true of false accusations of dishonesty in the workplace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because no genuine issue of material fact exists, Wal-Mart was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-10\">.
