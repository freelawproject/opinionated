The presentence investigation report concluded that he was a career offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (Nov.2005). Because Jules was a career offender and the offense carried a maximum life sentence, the PSR recommended a base offense level of 37. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A). Jules received no other enhancements or reductions, making his total offense level 37. As a career offender, Jules\u2019 criminal history category was VI. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.1. The result was a guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. The district court sentenced Jules to 360 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Jules, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), contending that Amendment 750 to the sentencing guidelines reduced his guidelines range. The district court denied that motion, concluding that Jules was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was sentenced as a career offender. This is Jules\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the [career offender] sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. While Amendment 750 reduced the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses, it did not alter the sentencing range upon which Jules\u2019 sentence was based because he was sentenced under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. For that reason, <em>Moore </em>controls here.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">Jules contends that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 lowered his mandatory minimum, which in turn affected his offense level under the career offender guideline. The Fair Sentencing Act, however, cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because it is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). Moreover, the Fair Sentencing Act does not apply retroactively to defendants like Jules who were sentenced before its enactment in 2010. Id.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-8\">. Jules also contends that the district court erred by not considering the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because Jules\u2019 guidelines range was not lowered by Amendment 750, the district court did not have discretion to lower his sentence, and it therefore could not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
