He brought this lawsuit seeking damages for his misfortune. The magistrate judge has explained by order dated March 1, 2012, why the lawsuit lacks legal merit, and the district judge has adopted that report and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-23\">Mr. Watson\u2019s problem is that he has only his statements and views of the law to support his claims. There is no evidence of an actual employment contract or breach as required by the law and no legal support for the other claims. The magistrate judge\u2019s reasons should be accepted by him, and this court must affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
