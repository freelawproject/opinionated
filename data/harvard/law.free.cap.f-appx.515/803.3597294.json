Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), because his previous counsel was ineffective for failing to inform him, or misinforming him, of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-24\">After the parties filed their briefs on appeal, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Chaidez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 1107-08, 1113, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013), also a <em>coram nobis </em>case where the petitioner sought the retroactive applicability of <em>Padilla </em>to her conviction. In <em>Chaidez, </em>the Court held that <em>Padilla </em>announced a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure, and was not retroactive to defendants whose convictions became final before its issuance. <em>Chaidez, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1113. In light of <em>Chaidez, </em>Aguila cannot seek, as he does here, <em>coram nobis </em>relief on the ground that <em>Padilla </em>retroactively applies to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>conviction. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying his <em>coram, nobis </em>petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-19\">. Aguila explicitly referenced in his notice of appeal the District Court's February 2012 order denying his writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>but incorrectly described that order as one also dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and <em>audita querela </em>motions. Because his intent, as evidenced by the record, was only to appeal the denial of his <em>coram nobis </em>petition, we lack jurisdiction to consider the dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 and <em>audita querela </em>motions. <em>See Osterneck v. E.T. Barwick Indust., Inc., </em>825 F.2d 1521, 1528-29 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
