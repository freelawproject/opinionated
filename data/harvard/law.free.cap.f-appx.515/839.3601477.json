The district court determined that Tucker was not entitled to a sentence reduction because he had been sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant is not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir. 2012). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment if a defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines retroactively lowered the sentencing range applicable to crack cocaine offenses by revising the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-19\">The record here shows that Tucker was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. Tucker\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 was 24 and his criminal history category was VI. Because he qualified as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, his base offense level increased to 32. Tucker received a 3-point offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, yielding a final offense level of 29. Thus, his guideline sentencing range was 151 to 188 months. At sentencing, the district court adopted the pre-sentence report\u2019s calculations, including Tucker\u2019s designation as a career offender, but granted a downward variance because of the \u201csmall amount of drugs involved\u201d in the offense. Tucker was sentenced to 139 months of imprisonment. After sentencing, the government filed a motion to reduce the sentence under Fed. R.Crim.P. 35 based on Tucker\u2019s substantial assistance. The district court granted the motion and reduced Tucker\u2019s sentence to 83 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-20\">Because Tucker\u2019s sentence was based on the sentencing range determined under \u00a7 4B1.1, Amendment 750 had no effect on the applicable sentencing range and Tucker is ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012). The district court\u2019s grant of a downward variance and sentence reduction do not alter this conclusion. There is no indication that the district court rejected Tucker\u2019s classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>as a career offender or that it based Tucker\u2019s sentence on the guideline range that would have applied absent the career offender designation. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1329-30 (11th Cir. 2008). Instead, the district court simply granted a variance from the career offender guideline range based on the circumstances of the offense and then further reduced the sentence based on Tucker\u2019s substantial assistance. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Tucker\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
