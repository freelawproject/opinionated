After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Griffin and two codefendants were charged by superseding indictment with multiple drug-related offenses. Griffin agreed to plead guilty to a single count of distributing crack cocaine within 1,000 feet of a public housing location and to using a person under the age of 18 to commit and to assist in avoiding detection or apprehension for that offense, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 860(a) and (c). Griffin admitted that on several occasions, a confidential informant purchased crack from him within close proximity to different public housing facilities. During one purchase, Griffin used a five-year-old child to avoid suspicion and hide the location of the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">At the change-of-plea hearing, Griffin stated that he understood the charges against him and the terms of the plea agreement, and that he was satisfied with his counsel. The plea agreement contained a waiver-of-appeal provision, in which Griffin agreed he could not directly appeal or collaterally challenge his sentence unless it exceeded the advisory guidelines range or if the government appealed. The court explained the waiver-of-appeal provision at the hearing, and Griffin indicated that he understood it.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The probation officer calculated Griffin\u2019s advisory guideline range as 92 to 115 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on an adjusted offense level of 23 and a criminal history category VI. Prior to sentencing, Griffin advised the court that his attorney violated his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by acting in bad faith. Griffin alleged that he suffered from depression and that his attorney and the government coerced him into pleading guilty by promising him that the government would file a motion for a reduction in sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. But, according to Griffin, they never intended to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">At sentencing, the court addressed Griffin\u2019s allegations, noting that he had expressed satisfaction with counsel during the change-of-plea hearing and that he had stated that no one had coerced him into pleading guilty. Griffin testified that counsel had told him that his depression was not a legal defense and that the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion would reduce his sentence. When confronted with his statements from the plea hearing, Griffin admitted that he lied at the change-of-plea hearing. Nevertheless, Griffin informed the court that he did not want to withdraw his plea and he confirmed that he was guilty. Griffin\u2019s counsel testified that he had advised Griffin that the government had discretion to file the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. None of the other witnesses who testified could corroborate Griffin\u2019s testimony about the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Although the court concluded that counsel had not done anything improper, it appointed new counsel and took the matter of Griffin\u2019s depression under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">The probation officer revised the sentencing calculation to add an enhancement for obstruction of justice based on Griffin\u2019s perjury during the prior hearing. The application of the enhancement also rendered Griffin ineligible for the acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. The revised adjusted offense level was 28, which yielded a guideline range of 140 to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment. Griffin filed objections to the new calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">At sentencing, the court confirmed that Griffin did not wish to withdraw his guilty plea. Griffin then objected to the perjury enhancement, arguing that any statements he made were in the context of his request for new counsel and thus were made without the benefit of counsel. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>overruled the objections, applying the enhancement not on the basis of Griffin\u2019s admission that he lied, but rather based on Griffin\u2019s statement that the government had promised him a 5K1.1 reduction. The court sentenced Griffin to 157 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was the middle of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Griffin now appeals, raising three issues. First, he argues that he was denied counsel during a critical stage of the proceedings, and he was sentenced more harshly because of statements he made to the court when he had no counsel. Alternatively, he argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel during a critical stage. Second, he argues that the district court erred by increasing his offense level for alleged obstruction of justice and by failing to reduce his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. He asserts that his sentence appeal waiver does not bar these challenges. Third, he argues that the district court violated his right against double jeopardy by convicting him of three crimes, two of which were lesser-included offenses of the third, and that he received multiple punishments for the same offense. We address each point in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">We review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Villarreal, </em>613 F.3d 1344, 1349 (11th Cir.2010). Where a defendant fails to raise a claim in district court, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Davila, </em>664 F.3d 1355, 1358 (11th Cir.2011). To establish plain error, a defendant must show that there was (1) error, (2) that was plain, (3) that affected his substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">The Sixth Amendment provides that in all criminal prosecutions, \u201cthe accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. Once the right to counsel attaches, the accused is entitled to counsel during any \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the post-attachment proceedings. <em>Rothgery v. Gillespie County, </em>554 U.S. 191, 212, 128 S.Ct. 2578, 171 L.Ed.2d 366 (2008). A petitioner claiming that he was denied counsel at a critical stage must show that he was \u201cactually or constructively ... denied counsel by government action.\u201d <em>Hunter v. Moore, </em>304 F.3d 1066, 1071 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 696 n. 3, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">The Sixth Amendment also guarantees every criminal defendant the right to <em>effective </em>assistance of counsel. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Nevertheless, we \u201cwill not generally consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised on direct appeal where the district court did not entertain the claim nor develop a factual record.\u201d <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>595 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). The preferred means for deciding a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is through a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion \u201ceven if the record contains some indication of deficiencies in counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1328-29 (citing <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003)). We will, however, consider those claims on direct appeal \u201cif the record is sufficiently developed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Here, it is unnecessary to decide whether Griffin properly raised in the district court his argument that he was denied counsel at a critical stage, because under any standard of review, his argument lacks merit. His attorney was pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>ent and represented him up until the district court decided, without finding any wrongdoing by his attorney, that it would appoint new counsel. Moreover, Griffin has not shown that he was denied counsel by government action, because neither the court nor the prosecutor did anything to prevent his attorney from objecting to questions or from consulting with him at any time. <em>See Hunter, </em>304 F.3d at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">We do not address Griffin\u2019s argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because such claims are more properly brought in a \u00a7 2255 motion where, as here, the record was not sufficiently developed. <em>Patterson, </em>595 F.3d at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s imposition of an obstruction-of-justice sentencing enhancement, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the factual findings to the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Doe, </em>661 F.3d 550, 565 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1648, 182 L.Ed.2d 242 (2012) (addressing enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>627 F.3d 839, 844 (11th Cir.2010) (addressing reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">A defendant is subject to a two-level sentence enhancement where he \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,\u201d and the conduct related to his \u201coffense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or ... a closely related offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Examples of covered conduct include committing perjury and providing materially false information to a judge. <em>See id. </em>comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"ATM\">A defendant may receive a two-level reduction in his offense level \u201cif the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Sawyer, </em>180 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.1999). We will not set aside a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment unless the facts in the record clearly establish that the defendant accepted responsibility. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1022-23 (11th Cir.2005). Although a guilty plea constitutes significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility, it may be outweighed by conduct that was inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility, and a defendant is not entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1 as a matter of right. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.3). Furthermore, if the defendant\u2019s conduct resulted in an obstruction enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1, then that \u201cordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>comment (n.4). But there may be extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 may apply. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in applying the obstruction-of-justice enhancement. The district court found that Griffin lied to the court when he testified that his attorney and the government\u2019s attorney promised that he would receive the benefit of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Reviewing the records from the change-of-plea hearing, the court noted that it had informed Griffin that the sentence was at the court\u2019s discretion and Griffin confirmed that no one had made any promises to him to induce his plea. In light of these facts, the court found that Griffin could not have had a good faith belief that the attorneys promised him a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 5K1.1. The court explained that Griffin\u2019s misrepresentations rendered it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>necessary to hold multiple hearings, appoint new counsel for Griffin, and delay the proceedings. In this case, we cannot conclude that the court erred by applying the two-point enhancement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Doe, </em>661 F.3d at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">We also cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred when it determined that Griffin was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1. Even though he pleaded guilty and reiterated his guilt several times throughout the proceedings, he also lied to the court and misrepresented what the attorneys in the case told him about sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment (n.4). He also filed a motion to withdraw his plea, which he later informed the court he did not wish to do. At one point, he asked the court if he could change his plea to \u201cno contest.\u201d Although there are circumstances in which a defendant may receive an enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 and a reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1, we cannot say that the court erred when it concluded this was not one of those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">We normally review a double jeopardy challenge <em>de novo. United States v. Smith, </em>532 F.3d 1125, 1126 (11th Cir.2008). Generally, a guilty plea waives all non jurisdictional challenges to a conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1127. Where a defendant fails to raise a double jeopardy claim in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>Smith, </em>532 F.3d at 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause guarantees that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. This guarantees against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>United States v. Bobb, </em>577 F.3d 1366, 1371 (11th Cir.2009). Only the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense is relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Generally, when a defendant has violated two different criminal statutes, the Double Jeopardy Clause protects him from being convicted under both when the statutes prohibit the same act or when one act is a lesser-included offense of the other. <em>Id. </em>at 1371-72. \u201cThe proper remedy for convictions on both greater and lesser included offenses is to vacate the conviction and the sentence of the lesser included offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>131 F.3d 951, 954-55 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">The relevant statutes at issue in this case are 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b), 860(a), and 860(c). Under \u00a7 841(a)(1), it is unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to distribute a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Section 841(b) establishes the penalties for violating \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 841(b). Under \u00a7 860(a), any person who violates \u00a7 841(a)(1) by distributing a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a housing facility owned by a public housing authority is subject to twice the maximum punishment authorized by \u00a7 841(b). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 860(a). Finally, \u00a7 860(c) provides that any person at least 21 years of age who knowingly and intentionally uses a person under 18 years of age \u201cto violate this section\u201d or uses a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>person under 18 years of age \u201cto assist in avoiding detection or apprehension for any offense under this section ... is punishable by a term of imprisonment, a f\u00edne, or both, up to triple those authorized by section 841 of this title.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 860(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">We have held that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 860 constitute the same offense for double jeopardy purposes. <em>United States v. Freyre-Lazaro, </em>3 F.3d 1496, 1507 (11th Cir.1993). In addition, \u00a7 841(a)(1) is a lesser-included offense of \u00a7 860, and \u00a7 860 should apply in lieu of \u00a7 841(b) when the offense occurs within 1,000 feet of a school. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u00a7 860 \u201cis a substantive criminal statute, not a mere sentence enhancer for section 841(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>200 F.3d 1344, 1347 (11th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Here, Griffin failed to raise his double jeopardy argument in district court, and under plain error review, his argument fails. The district court did not find Griffin guilty in separate counts for the same offense. Rather, the court adjudicated him guilty of only one count, and imposed only one sentence. It appears that all of the statutes were included in the same count of the indictment, and again in the judgment, because \u00a7 860(c), standing alone, does not state all of the elements of the offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860(c). The district court provided all of the sections to provide context for the criminal conduct. This does not create multiple punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm Griffin\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-11\">. We grant Griffin's petition for rehearing, vacate our previous opinion, and substitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>this opinion in its place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">. We reject Griffin\u2019s argument that he should not be held to have obstructed justice because he was without counsel at the time he made the false statements to the court. The court applied the enhancement not based on Griffin\u2019s admission that he lied, which occurred when he claims he was without counsel. Rather, the court based the enhancement on Griffin\u2019s statements that he had been promised a reduction under \u00a7 5K1.1, which Griffin could not have made in a good faith and which occurred while Griffin was counseled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
