JONES, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"AGj\">Pursuant to this panel\u2019s order that all subsequent appeals in this litigation be referred to us, the State of Texas here challenges the district court\u2019s denial of its motion to recover about $60,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees from the appellee abortion providers. This panel has already upheld against the appellees the critical features of the State\u2019s new regulatory efforts concerning abortion clinics. <em>Tex. Med. Prov. Performing Abortion Servs. v. Lakey, </em>667 F.3d 570, 572 (5th Cir.2012). Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">About $2,500 of this amount is sought only on the basis of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b), which allows a prevailing defendant in a civil rights case to recover attorneys\u2019 fees if the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Fox v. Vice, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2205, 2213, 180 L.Ed.2d 45 (2011) (quoting <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978)). The State tries to demonstrate that most of the appellees\u2019 vagueness challenges to the new regulations met this test, and indeed, the trial court earlier explained that many of these claims did not have \u201carguable merit or otherwise warrant discussion.\u201d In its opinion on the motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, however, the court did not find these claims frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. The court is correct. Lack of merit does not equate to frivolity, etc., according to the admittedly asymmetrical reasoning that underlies courts\u2019 reluctance to shift fees against civil rights plaintiffs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">As we read the State\u2019s briefs, the bulk of the attorneys\u2019 fee request (about $58,000) is sought principally pursuant to the courts\u2019 inherent power to sanction willful abuses of the judicial process. <em>See Roadway Exp., Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 766-67, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 2464, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980). The abuse here alleged consists of counsel\u2019s statements that they dismissed several remaining challenges to the Texas regulations following the decision by this court precisely because of the identity of the panel that would hear future appeals. Thus, appellees could allegedly refile a case to raise the same claims and engage in \u201cpanel shopping.\u201d Yet the State accuses counsel of no bad faith, and the district court found their strategy realistic and in good faith. The short answer to this charge is that if courts treated as a willful abuse of process every self-serving statement of counsel at the expense of a judge or judges, there would be no end to sanctions motions. The voluntary dismissal of appellees\u2019 additional weak claims was allowed by the Federal Rules and was not appealed by the State in an effort to seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>conditions. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2). The State cites no similar precedent to justify the relief it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">The district court\u2019s judgment denying attorneys\u2019 fees from appellees is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-15\">. The State also asserts that because appellees had no right to raise third-party constitutional claims, the withdrawn claims were groundless and frivolous according to \u00a7 1988, but this argument was not raised in the trial court and is waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
