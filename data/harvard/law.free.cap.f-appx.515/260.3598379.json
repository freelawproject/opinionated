He contends that his offense level should have been reduced by two levels for his minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-17\">Whether Garza was a minor participant is a factual determination that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005). We do not evaluate his participation with reference to the broader criminal enterprise of which he was a part but only in relation to the conduct for which he was held accountable. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001). Even if Garza may have played a relatively minor role in the broader drug distribution conspiracy, he was sentenced only for a single seizure of cocaine at a stash house over which he was keeping lookout. The district court did not commit a clear error by declining to award Garza a minor role reduction for his role in that offense. <em>See id. </em>The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
