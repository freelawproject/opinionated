We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-20\">To evaluate procedural reasonableness, we consider, among other things, whether the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or failed to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>See United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cIn consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court does not need to discuss or state each factor explicitly. An acknowledgment the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-21\">Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally reasonable, we examine whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1091. We reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the <em>case.\u201d United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(ien </em>banc) (quotation omitted). The sentencing court commits such an error of judgment where it imposes a sentence that does not achieve the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1189. The district court must impose a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, deter criminal conduct, protect the public, and provide needed educational or vocational training, or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable Guidelines range, pertinent policy statements from the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need for restitution. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). The weight accorded to each of these factors is within the district court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Considering these standards, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion. First, we cannot say that Aguilar-Ortiz\u2019s sentence was proeedurally unreasonable because the district court acknowledged on the record that it considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Second, we cannot say Aguilar-Ortiz\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable. The district court\u2019s emphasis on the need to deter Aguilar-Ortiz from further criminal conduct, particularly in light of his several illegal reentries into the United States, did not render his sentence unreasonable because the weight given to any particular factor is generally left to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-22\">. Aguilar-Ortiz also pled guilty to one count of being in the United States illegally, and was sentenced to 6-months imprisonment, to be served concurrently.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
