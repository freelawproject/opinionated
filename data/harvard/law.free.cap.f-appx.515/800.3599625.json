At sentencing, Ayala faced a United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) range of 262 to 327 months imprisonment, based on a total offense level of 39 and a criminal history category of I. He also faced a mandatory minimum term of 10 years imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B). The government filed a motion to reduce Ayala\u2019s sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for having provided substantial assistance to the government prior to his sentencing. The district court granted this motion, and sentenced Ayala to 131 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-15\">While serving his sentence, Ayala continued to provide assistance to the government. In September 2011, the government rewarded this cooperation by filing a motion under Rule 35(b) requesting that Ayala\u2019s sentence be reduced by an additional 55 percent to reflect his \u201csubstantial assistance in the prosecution of others.\u201d After a hearing, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion in part, reducing Ayala\u2019s sentence by an additional 31 months (or 23.7 percent) to 100 months imprisonment, with credit for time already served. In making its determination, the district court weighed the government\u2019s \u201cextraordinary request\u201d against the \u201cgravity\u201d of Ayala\u2019s offense, the fact that his initial sentence was based, in part, on a supervisory enhancement, the leniency of Ayala\u2019s original sentence, and the need for fairness in sentencing. Ayala then filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the district court relied on improper factors in reaching its Rule 35(b) determination, which the district court denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-17\">Ayala raises two issues on appeal. First, he reiterates his claim that the district court relied on improper factors in refusing to grant the full reduction in his sentence that the government requested. Second, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration of its order reducing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-18\">A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a Rule 35(b) motion is a discretionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>one that generally may not be appealed. <em>United States v. Manella, </em>86 F.3d 201, 203 (11th Cir.1996) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742). A limited exception to this general rule exists where the petitioner asserts that the district court\u2019s order as to the Rule 35(b) motion \u201cimposed [a sentence] in violation of law.\u201d <em>See id. </em>In such instances, our review is <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Ayala\u2019s first argument is that the district court\u2019s order partially granting the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion resulted in an illegal sentence because the court based its revised sentencing determination \u201con factors other than Mr. Ayala\u2019s post-sentence substantial assistance, including [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors such as his role in the offense and the amount of narcotics involved.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This argument is squarely foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See Manella, </em>86 F.3d at 204 (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that \u201cthe court erred when it considered other factors that militated against a [Rule 35(b) ] reduction in his case,\u201d including \u00a7 3553 factors, because \u201c[njothing in the text of the rule purports to limit what factors may militate <em>against </em>granting a Rule 35(b) reduction\u201d or \u201cfactors that may militate in favor of granting a smaller reduction\u201d). Thus we are bound to reject this argument. <em>United States v. Sneed, </em>600 F.3d 1326, 1332 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201c[A] prior panel\u2019s holding is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting <em>en banc.\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Ayala\u2019s second argument \u2014 that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration\u2014 amounts to an attack on the merits of the district court\u2019s Rule 35(b) determination. Because the scope of our review does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>extend to the merits of the district court\u2019s ruling on the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion, we are unable to consider this challenge. <em>See Manella, </em>86 F.3d at 203; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-5\">. Ayala also argues that the district court misapplied Rule 35(b) because its decision was based on \u201cthe court\u2019s personal 'policy' on substantial assistance,\u201d and because the court \"erroneously combined [his] pre-sentence substantial assistance with his post-sentence substantial assistance in arriving at a total reduction [it] thought appropriate,\u201d <em>cf. Murphy v. United States, </em>634 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir.2011) (indicating that \"Rule 35(b) permits a district court ... to reduce a sentence to reflect a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance rendered <em>after </em>the entry of judgment\u201d). We do not decide the merits of either of these claims, however, because we do not interpret the trial judge's comments to mean what Ayala suggests. Ayala\u2019s argument regarding the court's \"personal 'policy' \u201d is drawn from the Rule 35(b) hearing, where the court stated \"when I see a request of this magnitude, it is really counter to the Court's policy on these subjects.\u201d In context, we read this statement to encompass the totality of factors the court considered in ruling on the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion, \"including the seriousness of [Ayala's] offense and the need for the sentence imposed to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment.\u201d <em>See Manella, </em>86 F.3d at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Ayala's claim regarding the district court\u2019s \"erroneous[] combin[ation]\u201d of his pre- and post-sentence assistance is based on the wording of the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration. In that order, the court noted that Ayala received a substantial assistance reduction of 131 months based on his pre-sentence assistance, and an additional reduction of 31 months based on his post-sentence assistance, for a \"total reduction of 162 months off his original low end guidelines range of 262 months.\u201d Contrary to Ayala\u2019s assertion, this language merely recounts the sentence reductions Ayala received.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-9\">. We are not persuaded by Ayala's suggestion that the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>-U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010), undermined <em>Manel-la. Dillon </em>dealt with the narrow range of circumstances in which a district court can modify a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to a retroactive amended guideline and mentions Rule 35(b) only by way of analogy. <em>See id. </em>at -U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. at 2692. <em>Dillon </em>did not address the proper factors to be considered by a district court in applying Rule 35(b). <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
