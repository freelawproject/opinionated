Steele is currently serving a total sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, imposed after Steele pleaded guilty in 2003 to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base (crack) in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and three counts of distribution of crack in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-23\">Prior to sentencing, Steele\u2019s guideline range was 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, but Steele faced a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment because of his prior drug convictions, pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because the statutorily mandated sentence was greater than Steele\u2019s guideline range, the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of life became Steele\u2019s guideline sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-24\">The government filed a motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), which the district court granted, ultimately sentencing Steele to 300 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-25\">In October 2011, Steele filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to modify his sentence. In his \u00a7 3582 motion, he requested that the district court reduce his sentence in light of: (i) Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels corresponding to some crack offenses in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1; and (ii) the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), Pub.L. No. 111-120,124 Stat. 2372, which lowered the statutory mandatory minimum sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>tences for some crack offenses. The district court denied Steele\u2019s motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">We \u201creview de novo a district court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment if a defendant was sentenced \u201cto a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). If that total sentence was based on something other than offense-level calculations, however, a guideline amendment would not impact his total sentence, and he would be ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1076 (11th Cir.2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We first note that Steele does not argue on appeal that he was eligible for a reduction in sentence under Amendment 750 or \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B). Therefore, any claims in this respect are deemed waived. <em>See Sepulveda v. US. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per cu-riam). Moreover, we recently held in <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>11th Cir.2013, 712 F.3d 535, 2013 WL 978695 (No. 11-15933, March 14, 2013), that \u201cwhen a defendant\u2019s sentence is based on a statutory minimum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) that is above the applicable guideline range, Amendment 750 does not lower that guidelines sentence, and the defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 2013 WL 978695 at *3 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Our decision in <em>Hippolyte </em>also forecloses Steele\u2019s remaining argument: that the FSA, enacted in 2010, applies retroactively to his 2003 sentence. In <em>Hippolyte, </em>we explained that the statutory mandatory minimums that applied were the ones that were in place when the defendant was sentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 542, 2013 WL 978695 at *5. There is simply \u201cno evidence that Congress intended [the FSA] to apply to defendants who had been sentenced prior to the August 3, 2010 date of the Act\u2019s enactment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, because the FSA does not apply to Steele\u2019s case, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-8\">. We note that the fact that Steele is serving a 300 month sentence as the result of the government's motion for a downward departure does not change the mandatory minimum\u2014 life imprisonment \u2014 under which he was sentenced. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (\"Further, we believe that a downward departure from this mandatory minimum does not constitute a waiver or dispensing of this new 'guideline range.' \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
