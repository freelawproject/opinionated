Regarding the limitations ruling, Prado contends: his action is not time barred because it is subject to the ten-year limitations period applicable to claims brought under the Alien Tort Claims Act and the Torture Victim Protection Act; and the limitations period for his claim did not begin to run until 2007 when he learned the identities of the individuals involved in his 2003 arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Because Prado fails to address <em>res judi-cata, </em>he has abandoned that issue. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993). As a result, the dismissal stands on that basis. Accordingly, the alternative, statute-of-limitations ground for dismissal need not be reached. <em>E.g., Capital Concepts Props. 85-1 v. Mut. First, Inc., </em>35 F.3d 170, 176 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Prado\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal, plus the district court\u2019s dismissing under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), count as two strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Prado is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will be unable to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
