R. Civ. P. 41(b). We review the dismissal for an abuse of discretion. <em>McCullough v. Lynaugh, </em>835 F.2d 1126, 1127 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-26\">In the district court, Quaak argued that he was not trying to file an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, instead he was simply \u201cgiving notice\u201d to the State of Texas, perhaps an allusion to the notice required under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 101.101. On appeal, although he argues that the dismissal was erroneous, Quaak simultaneously renews his contention that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>he has not yet filed a formal lawsuit, only a pleading notifying the defendants of his intent to sue them at some point in the future. He conclusionally asserts that, by its dismissal order, the district court has conspired with the defendants to violate his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">By asserting that he does not yet intend to file a civil rights lawsuit, Quaak admits his failure to comply with the district court\u2019s show cause order directing him to withdraw the suit if he did not seek to pursue an action at this time. Quaak has thus failed to show an abuse of discretion on the district court\u2019s part. <em>See </em>Fed. R.CivP. 41(b); <em>McCullough, </em>835 F.2d at 1127. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Quaak\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
