Baez Perez argues his sentence, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range, was substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-24\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing for reasonableness, we first consider whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>Cir.2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The abuse of discretion standard \u201callows a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). We ordinarily expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of proving that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Baez Perez\u2019s sole argument that his sentence is substantively unreasonable relies on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court upheld a district court\u2019s decision to grant a downward variance based on the district court\u2019s finding that the 100:1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine in the Sentencing Guidelines was disproportionate and unjust. 552 U.S. at 93, 111, 128 S.Ct. at 565, 576. Noting that the Sentencing Commission \u201cdid not take account of \u2018empirical data and national experience\u2019 \u201d in formulating the crack cocaine guideline provisions and had itself subsequently criticized the crack/powder disparity as \u201cdisproportionately harsh,\u201d the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude ... that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109-10, 128 S.Ct. at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Relying on <em>Kimbrough, </em>Baez Perez contends that the district court was <em>required </em>to impose a sentence below his advisory guidelines range of 210 to 262 months because the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), which was used to determine his base offense level, creates a similar sentencing disparity between \u201cmethamphetamine (actual)\u201d and methamphetamine mixtures.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Section 2Dl.l\u2019s drug quantity table requires ten times the weight of a methamphetamine mixture to result in the same offense level as \u201cmethamphetamine (actual).\u201d <em>See generally </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). For example, to receive an offense level 38, the offense must involve 15 kilograms of methamphetamine or 1.5 kilograms of methamphetamine (actual). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Note (B) to the drug quantity table explains that the term \u201c \u2018Methamphetamine (actual)\u2019 refer[s] to the weight of the controlled substance, itself, contained in the mixture or substance\u201d and instructs the district court, \u201c[i]n the case of a mixture or substance containing ... methamphetamine,\u201d to \u201cuse the offense level determined by the entire weight of the mixture or substance, or the offense level determined by the weight of the ... methamphetamine (actual), whichever is greater.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), n. (B). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>The net effect of Note (B) is to increase the offense level for methamphetamine traffickers whose offenses involved purer methamphetamine mixtures.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">In Baez Perez\u2019s case, the drug quantity table set his offense level at 34 based on the total weight of the methamphetamine mixture (2,227 grams) and at 38 based on the weight of the \u201cmethamphetamine (actual)\u201d (1,763 grams). Baez Perez does not dispute that the district court properly used an offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) and Note (B), to calculate his advisory guidelines range. Instead, Baez Perez argues that, like in <em>Kimbrough, </em>the 10:1 ratio between methamphetamine mixture and methamphetamine (actual) in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)\u2019s drug quantity table creates an \u201cunwarranted\u201d sentencing disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Baez Perez does not, however, point to any evidence that the disparity here is unwarranted. Baez Perez incorrectly claims that \u201cthe Guidelines are basically silent as [to] why\u201d purer methamphetamine mixtures are assigned higher offense levels. In fact, the commentary to \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) explains why purer drug mixtures may call for longer sentences. Specifically, the commentary notes that an upward departure may be warranted for drug mixtures of unusually high purity, except that an upward departure is not appropriate for methamphetamine mixtures because the drug quantity table already \u201cprovides for the consideration of [the] purity\u201d of methamphetamine mixtures. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 26(C). The commentary goes on to explain that drug purity \u201cis probative of the defendant\u2019s role or position in the chain of distribution\u201d and \u201c[s]ince controlled substances are often diluted and combined with other substances as they pass down the chain of distribution, the fact that a defendant is in possession of unusually pure narcotics may indicate a prominent role in the criminal enterprise and proximity to the source of the drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>More importantly, though, Baez Perez has not shown that the drug quantity table\u2019s 10:1 mixture-to-pure methamphetamine ratio has been subject to the kinds of criticism discussed in <em>Kimbrough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">In any event, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the drug quantity table\u2019s 10:1 mixture-to-pure methamphetamine ratio is not supported by empirical evidence, this fact alone would not make Baez Perez\u2019s sentence unreasonable. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>\u201cthe Supreme Court held that the lack of empirical evidence was one factor that a district court could consider in exercising its <em>post-Booker </em>right to depart from the guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 870 (11th Cir.2010) (emphasis omitted). In short, <em>Kimbrough </em>merely <em>permits </em>a district court, in its discretion, to vary from a guidelines range if it finds a lack of empirical support, but it does not <em>require </em>it to do so. <em>See Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. at 109-10, 128 S.Ct. at 575; <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1201 n. 15 (stating that under <em>Kimbrough </em>\u201ca district judge has the authority to deviate from the Guidelines in a particular crack cocaine case because the Guidelines range for these offenses ... did not take account of empirical data and national experience\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Under these circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion when it imposed a 210-month sentence, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-16\">. Defendant Baez Perez does not argue that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable or raise any procedural error at his sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b891-12\">. Because Baez-Perez did not raise his <em>Kim-brough- </em>style challenge at sentencing, the government urges us to review it only for plain error. We need not address this contention because Baez Perez\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable even under the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
