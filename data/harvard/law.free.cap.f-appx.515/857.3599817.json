He argues the term is substantively unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-26\">Tatum was convicted in 1996 of an embezzlement conspiracy. In 1998, we vacated Tatum\u2019s original sentence, <em>United States v. Tatum, </em>138 F.3d 1344 (11th Cir. 1998), and the district court scheduled re-sentencing. Unbeknownst to the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>however, Tatum had absconded months before. He remained at large until he was arrested in Panama in 2003. When he at last appeared at his resentencing hearing, Tatum received 14 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by 3 years\u2019 supervised release. He did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">In April 2004, Tatum began supervised release. But by November of that year, he had once again absconded, this time to Colombia. Although a warrant for his arrest issued in 2005, Tatum remained a fugitive until 2012 when he voluntarily surrendered to authorities in Colombia. The United States Probation Office then petitioned the district court for revocation of Tatum\u2019s supervised release based on his unauthorized travel, failure to report, and failure to notify probation of changes in residence and employment in 2004 and 2005.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The allegations subjected Tatum to a guidelines range of 5 to 11 months\u2019 imprisonment and a new term of up to 5 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">At his revocation hearing, Tatum admitted the alleged supervised-release violations. The district court revoked Tatum\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to 11 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by 25 months\u2019 supervised release. Tatum objected to the reasonableness of the supervised-release term, citing his extensive military service, which included service in Vietnam. The district court overruled the objection, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">We review for an abuse of discretion the reasonableness of a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release. <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>607 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2010). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court....\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">Tatum contends that the district court abused its discretion by failing to adequately consider his military service. He emphasizes that, while serving in combat in Vietnam, he was captured and tortured by enemy forces, an experience that caused enduring physical and psychological challenges. And he cites <em>Porter v. McCollum, </em>558 U.S. 30, 130 S.Ct. 447, 175 L.Ed.2d 398 (2009), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), for the proposition that, as a veteran, he deserves leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">Although Tatum\u2019s courageous sacrifice is undoubtedly worthy of consideration, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in concluding that his service was \u201cnot an excuse\u201d for his transgressions. Here, the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, finding that the sentence imposed reflected the seriousness of Tatum\u2019s conduct, promoted respect for the law, protected the public, and acted as a deterrent. The court, as a result, imposed a within-guidelines term of supervised release. We ordinarily expect a within-guidelines sentence to be reasonable, although it is not automatically so. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). And the decision to impose a within-guidelines term of supervised release in this case does not conflict with <em>Porter, </em>in which the Supreme Court simply held that counsel\u2019s failure to pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>ent mitigating evidence of a defendant\u2019s background was a basis for an ineffective-assistance claim. 558 U.S. at 37-41, 42-44, 130 S.Ct. 447. The same is true for <em>Kimbrough, </em>in which the Supreme Court simply noted with approval the use of a defendant\u2019s military service as a mitigating factor at sentencing. 552 U.S. at 110, 128 S.Ct. 558. The district court in this case considered Tatum\u2019s military service but found other \u00a7 3553(a) factors weighed more heavily, a decision well within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>See Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743. Considering Tatum\u2019s tendency to wander, the district court\u2019s decision to impose a 25-month supervised-release term was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\">. Although Tatum's term of supervised release had expired long before 2012, the district court retained revocation jurisdiction because the 2005 warrant alleged supervised-release violations before expiration of the term. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
