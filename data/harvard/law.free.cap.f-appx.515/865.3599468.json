Viera\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-21\">The district court did not err by denying Viera\u2019s motion. Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering Viera\u2019s sentencing range. Because the district court had held Viera responsible for 50 kilograms of cocaine, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) (establishing a base offense level of 36 for 50 kilograms or more of cocaine). Viera challenges the amount of cocaine attributed to him, but the district court could not disturb its earlier finding about drug quantity when considering Viera\u2019s motion to reduce. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562-63 (11th Cir.1997). Viera also argues that he is entitled to relief under <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), in which a plurality of the Supreme Court held that a district court may grant a reduction of sentence when the defendant was sentenced based on a plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 2691-95. Unlike the defendant in <em>Freeman, </em>a jury found Viera guilty of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base. Based on the quantity of drugs attributed to Viera, his base offense level is unaltered by Amendment 750, and his sentencing range remains unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-24\">We AFFIRM the denial of Viera\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
