He filed the motion to reopen more than four years after the in absentia order of removal was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">While Sanchez\u2019s signature appears on the Notice to Appear containing the time, date, and location of his removal hearing, he denies receiving personal service of the notice because he does not recall receiving it. He asks this court to excuse his forgetfulness because he was nervous and fearful at the time, having fled violence in El Salvador and having recently crossed the border between Mexico and the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen under \u201ca highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009). Under that standard, we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision as long as it is not capricious, without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The BIA\u2019s conclusion that Sanchez received personal service of the Notice to Appear was supported by the record, including Sanchez\u2019s own signature on the Government\u2019s copy of the Notice to Appear. <em>See Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 358. The BIA thus did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen based on Sanchez\u2019s claims of lack of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">We also find no abuse of discretion in the determination that the motion to reopen was not authorized under \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Sanchez effectively concedes that his claims for asylum and withholding of removal were not based on changed country conditions in El Salvador, asserting that it \u201cwould be hard to imagine\u201d that conditions in El Salvador \u201ccould get much worse\u201d because the conditions \u201care already so deplorable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">Sanchez\u2019s remaining arguments provide no legal basis for overcoming the statutory untimeliness of his motion to reopen. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C), (c)(7)(C)(ii). To the extent he challenges the decision not to reopen the proceeding sua sponte under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b), we lack jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 250 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">The denial of Sanchez\u2019s motion to reopen was not \u201ccapricious, without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 358. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
