The case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for the defendant. Hutchins moved for Rule 50 judgment as a matter of law and the district court denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-18\">On appeal, Hutchins maintains that the jury verdict is unsupported by the evidence, also challenging a number of the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. After carefully reviewing the briefs, the record, and applicable law, we conclude that Hutchins\u2019s appeal is meritless. Hutchins\u2019s age- and race-discrimination claims were fully developed before the district court. The jury rendered a defensible verdict and the district court did not abuse its discretion in any of its evidentiary rulings. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
