Hvizdak, the 2007 Richard C. Hvizdak Separate Trust, and RCH Trust Holdings T, LP, appeal the district court\u2019s award of $434,036.90 in attorney\u2019s fees to Shenzhen Development Bank Co. (SDB). Appellants originally brought an action against SDB and other defendants alleging fraud, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, and conspiracy to commit fraud. The district court granted summary judgment, and we affirmed. <em>See 2002 Irrevocable Trust for Richard C. Hvizdak v. Huntington Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>428 Fed.Appx. 924 (11th Cir.2011). The district court then granted SDB\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Florida Statute Section 675.111(5), which mandates the award of \u201c[r]easonable attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses of litigation ... to the prevailing party in an action in which a remedy is sought under this chapter.\u201d Appellants concede that SDB is a prevailing party under the statute, but argue that because their amended complaint contained no specific request for injunctive relief pursuant to chapter 675, the present case does not involve \u201can action in which a remedy is sought under\u201d chapter 675 and the award of attorney\u2019s fees was improper. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 675.111(5). We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">We review the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs only for abuse of discretion, analyzing questions of law de novo and reviewing questions of fact for clear error. <em>Atlanta Journal &amp; Constitution v. City of Atlanta Dep\u2019t of Aviation, </em>442 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2006). Af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>ter careful review of Appellants\u2019 brief and the record,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we discern no abuse of discretion in the award of attorney\u2019s fees to SDB. Appellants\u2019 initial complaint sought an injunction under section 675.109, and Appellants obtained a temporary restraining order under section 675.109. Moreover, although Appellants amended complaint did not specifically invoke chapter 675 as the basis of relief, Appellants\u2019 theory of liability throughout this litigation has been letter-of-credit fraud as defined by section 675.109 of the Florida Statutes. Because section 675.109\u2019s letter-of-credit fraud was the key legal theory underlying Appellants\u2019 claims below, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that this case involves \u201can action in which a remedy is sought under [chapter 675],\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 675.111(5), and that SDB was therefore entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as the prevailing party therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-14\">. SDB did not file an appellee\u2019s brief in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
