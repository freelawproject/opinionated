The District Court dismissed Millbrook's action, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The Court of Appeals held that, while the FTCA waives the United States' sovereign immunity for certain intentional\n   torts by law enforcement officers, it only does so when the tortious conduct occurs in the course of executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest. Petitioner contends that the FTCA's waiver is not so limited.

See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. L. 93-253, \u00a7 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20Stat.%2050\">\n    88 Stat. 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Known as the \"law enforcement proviso,\" this provision extends\n   the waiver of sovereign immunity to claims for six intentional torts, including assault and battery, that are based on the \"acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers.\" \u00a7 2680(h). The proviso defines \" 'investigative or law enforcement officer' \" to mean \"any officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20Stat.%2050\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 18, 2011, Millbrook filed suit against the United States under the\n   FTCA, asserting claims of negligence, assault, and battery. In his complaint, Millbrook alleged that, on March 5, 2010, he was forced to perform oral sex on a BOP correctional officer, while another officer held him in a choke hold and a third officer stood watch nearby. Millbrook claimed that the officers threatened to kill him if he did not comply with their demands. Millbrook alleged that he suffered physical injuries as a result of the incident and, accordingly, sought compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Government argued that the FTCA did not waive the United States' sovereign immunity from suit on Millbrook's intentional tort claims, because they fell within the intentional tort exception in \u00a7 2680(h). The Government contended that \u00a7 2680(h)'s law enforcement proviso did not save Millbrook's claims because of the Third Circuit's binding precedent in\n   <em>\n    Pooler v.

The portion of the Act relevant here provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   . . . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights:\n   <em>\n    Provided,\n   </em>\n   That, with regard to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government, the provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim arising ... out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On its face, the law enforcement proviso applies where a claim both arises out of one of the proviso's six intentional\n   torts,\n   and is related to the \"acts or omissions\" of an \"investigative or law enforcement officer.\" The proviso's cross-reference to \u00a7 1346(b) incorporates an additional requirement that the acts or omissions giving rise to the claim occur while the officer is \"acting within the scope of his office or employment.\" \u00a7 1346(b)(1). The question in this case is whether the FTCA further limits the category of \"acts or omissions\" that trigger the United States' liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plain language of the law enforcement proviso answers when a law enforcement officer's \"acts or omissions\" may give rise to an actionable tort claim under the FTCA. The proviso specifies that the conduct must arise from one of the six enumerated intentional torts and, by expressly cross-referencing \u00a7 1346(b), indicates that the law enforcement officer's \"acts or omissions\" must fall \"within the scope of his office or employment.\" \u00a7\u00a7 2680(h), 1346(b)(1). Nothing in the text further qualifies the category of \"acts or omissions\" that may trigger FTCA liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A number of lower courts have nevertheless read into the text additional limitations designed to narrow the scope of the law enforcement proviso. The Ninth Circuit, for instance, held that the law enforcement proviso does not apply unless the tort was \"committed in the course of investigative or law enforcement activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Orsay, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1135. As noted, the Third Circuit construed the law enforcement proviso even more narrowly in holding that it applies only to tortious conduct by federal officers during the course of \"executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    Pooler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1560483\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/787/868/\">\n    787 F.2d, at 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Court-appointed\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   ) similarly asks us to construe the proviso to waive \"sovereign immunity only for torts committed by federal officers\n   acting in their capacity as 'investigative or law enforcement officers.' \" Brief for\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   5. Under this approach, the conduct of federal officers would be actionable only when it \"aris[es] out of searches, seizures of evidence, arrests, and closely related exercises of investigative or law-enforcement authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1560483\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/787/868/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   None of these interpretations finds any support in the text of the statute. The FTCA's only reference to \"searches,\" \"seiz[ures of] evidence,\" and \"arrests\" is found in the statutory definition of \"investigative or law enforcement officer.\" \u00a7 2680(h) (defining \" 'investigative or law enforcement officer' \" to mean any federal officer who is \"empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law\"). By its terms, this provision focuses on the\n   <em>\n    status\n   </em>\n   of persons whose conduct may be actionable, not the types of activities that may give rise to a tort claim against the United States. The proviso thus distinguishes between the acts for which immunity is waived (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   assault and battery), and the class of persons whose acts may give rise to an actionable FTCA claim. The plain text confirms that Congress intended immunity determinations to depend on a federal officer's legal authority, not on a particular exercise of that authority. Consequently, there is no basis for concluding that a law enforcement officer's intentional tort must occur in the course of executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest in order to subject the United States to liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nor does the text of the proviso provide any indication that the officer must be engaged in \"investigative or law enforcement activity.\" Indeed, the text never uses the term.\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   contends that we should read the reference to \"investigative or law-enforcement officer\" as implicitly limiting the proviso to claims arising from actions taken in an officer's investigative or law enforcement\n   <em>\n    capacity\n   </em>\n   . But there is no basis for so limiting the term when Congress has spoken directly to the circumstances in which a law enforcement\n   officer's conduct may expose the United States to tort liability. Under the proviso, an intentional tort is not actionable unless it occurs while the law enforcement officer is \"acting within the scope of his office or employment.\" \u00a7\u00a7 2680(h), 1346(b)(1). Had Congress intended to further narrow the scope of the proviso, Congress could have limited it to claims arising from \"acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers\n   <em>\n    acting in a law enforcement or investigative capacity\n   </em>\n   .\" See\n   <em>\n    Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675555\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/214/#p227\">\n    552 U.S. 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675555\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/214/#p227\">\n    128 S.Ct. 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675555\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/214/#p227\">\n    169 L.Ed.2d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). Congress adopted similar limitations in neighboring provisions, see \u00a7 2680(a) (referring to \"[a]ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government ...\n   <em>\n    in the execution of a statute or regulation\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added)), but did not do so here.
