Held, that the loss of rents cannot be treated as part of the damages which the plaintiff is entitled to recover, since that loss was not such a probable result of the breach of the contract by the defendant as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b649-9\">Held, further, that the mere knowledge by the defendant of the fact that the elevator was to be used in an office building does not indicate that the parties contemplated a loss of rents as an element of the damage likely to be caused by a breach so as to constitute to any extent a basis of the contract, and bring the case within the rule that where the special circumstances under which the contract is made are communicated to the other party, the damages resulting from the breach, under the circumstances, may be recovered.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b649-10\">Held, further, that even if the loss of rents was within the contemplation of the parties as a probable result of a breach of the contract, such loss is too remote, uncertain and conjectural in this case to be considered in estimating the damages.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b649-11\">When an established business

This rental of the separate offices represents in reality the profits of running an office building, and are remote and purely speculative and contingent. <em>Woods </em>v. White, 66 Md. 61; <em>Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Baltimore Tar Co., </em>65 Md. 73.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-6\">The danger of departing from the rule of damages in such cases, as laid down in the <em>Arctic Ice Company's case, </em>77 Md., and the impossibility of establishing any rational and just substitute rule, which will prevent the jury in some cases from finding an excessive verdict, could not be better illustrated than by showing the practical injustice and wrong done in this very case. Under the Court\u2019s rulings on the evidence and the prayers the jury found a verdict of $2,635 more consequential damages for loss of rent than the building could earn under extraordinarily favorable conditions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>If there had been a delay in installing the elevator thereby preventing the building being used at all the measure of damages would have been, not what the separate offices with light and heat and janitor services would have rented for, but the fair rental value of the building as an empty building; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Gatch, </em>13 Md. 314.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-4\">That in agreeing to furnish an elevator for $1,600, the defendant never contemplated being liable for an alleged loss of rentals of offices amounting to $7,000, is manifest on the face of things. It is obvious, it is submitted, that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant imagined, when the contract for the installation of the elevator was made, that the $1,600, to be paid for the elevator included any payment for the assumption of this enormous risk; in short to furnish an elevator <em>and </em>a guaranty of rent. <em>Globe Refining Co. </em>v. <em>L.

They had no right to aggravate and increase their damages at the appellant\u2019s expense by continuing to use an elevator which their experts declared was defective, until sometime during October, 1906, although they had long before been advised by their own experts Pierson and Adams, to remove the defendant\u2019s elevator and install a new one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-6\">If a glazier in breach of his contracts fails to place a pane in a man\u2019s parlor window, the owner of the house should himself have a new pane of glass put in it; he can not let the window stay out of repair and then recover from the wrong doer for the injury which a rain storm does to his furniture. Natural justice and the law both require a person injured by another\u2019s breach of contract to do all he reasonably can to minimize the damages. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>105 U.

In making this claim it disregards in toto that firmly established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>rule of special damage, known as the second rule in the leading case of <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Baxendale, 9 </em>Exch. 354, and frequently quoted and reiterated by this Court, and by the Courts of all States and countries to which the common law has spread. The rule amounts to this. When a contract is made under special circumstances and those circumstances are communicated by one of the contracting parties to another, the dam-' ages resulting from the breach of the contract which they would reasonably contemplate are the amount of the injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under such special circumstances. <em>Arctic Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Md. Ice Co., </em>79 Md. 107; <em>Webster v. Woolford, </em>81 Md. 331.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-4\">This law of special damage is well expounded in the recent case of <em>Machine Co. v. Compress Co., </em>105 Tenn. 204. \u201cIf it appear by surrounding circumstances that the contract was\" entered into and known by both parties to be entered into, to enable one of them to serve or accomplish a particular purpose, whether to secure a special gain, or to avoid an anticipated loss, the liability of the other for violation and the amount of damages will be fixed with reference to the effect of breach in hindering that object. The proof of such circumstances makes it manifest -that such damages were within contemplation of the parties. Looking alone to the'contract\u2014 silent as to such circumstances \u2014 such damages appear to arise very remotely and collaterally to the undertaking violated. But when the contract is considered in connection with the extrinsic facts-there is established a natural and proximate relation of cause and effect between the breach and the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-5\">The complete rule of damage is well set forth in <em>Boutin v. Rudd, </em>27 C. C. A. 529, in which special losses resulting from a failure to tow a schooner were recovered the Court saying, such recovery should include both the consequences naturally following from the breach and such consequences as seem natural only in the light of special circumstances communicated to the defendant at the time of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-6\">In <em>New York Mining Co. </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>130 U. S. 622, the purchaser of machinery which turned out to be defective recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ered as part of his special damages, the wages paid his workmen during their enforced idleness, caused by the defective machinery; and by way of counter claim the purchaser recovered a verdict of $10,500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-4\">The cases are innumerable in which special consequences, within the terms of the contract and within the reasonable contemplation of the parties, are construed as warranting special damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-5\">In <em>Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Colliday, </em>25 Md. 1, 17\u201418, the special circumstances were that the advantageous use and disposal 6 the plaintiff\u2019s house, depended upon its being supplied and equipped with gas. . It was easily in contemplation that the house, with such advantages, would command a certain rent which would be materially diminished by being deprived thereof. This Court held the rental depreciation \u201ca proper a nd fair element in the estimate of damages. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-6\">In <em>Furstenberg </em>v. <em>Fawsett, </em>61 Md. 187, 191, the contract broken was for the purchase of certain standing timber, to cut and haul it away. Not only was the seller allowed to recover the difference between the contract price and the market price, but this Court added, \u201cthere is another element of damage that must not be overlooked. It is safe to say that one -of the inducements on the part of the plaintiff to enter into this contract, and that one of the objects in contemplation of both parties to it was to have the land cleared for cultivation within two years (the time for the operation of the contract). The necessary result of a failure thus to clear it was to deprive the plaintiff of the use of it, for a time at least as arable, tillable land, and for such deprivation he is clearly entitled to such damage as the jury upon proper evidence shall find he has actually sustained thereby.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-7\">In <em>Colvin </em>v. <em>Oil Company, </em>66 S. C. 66, 67, the stock of cotton seed, spoiling in a factory, retarded by machinery proving defective, was held to be one of the items of special loss recoverable from the vendor of the machinery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-8\">In <em>Laufer </em>v. <em>Boynton Furnace Co., </em>84 Hun. 311, on account of defective heating plant, flowers in greenhouse died; this loss was held recoverable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>In re Nimrod, </em>141 Fed. 215, damages were allowed recovered for loss of the use of a tug boat to which defective machinery has been supplied by the defendant, of course the cost of replacing the bad machinery was also allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-4\">A case having all the elements of the one at bar is that of <em>Dixon, Wood &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Phillips Co. </em>169 Pa. 168, where there was a failure to provide a proper generator tank melting furnace, the Court held that the measure of damage should embrace. 1. Amount expended to complete. 2. Expenses incurred and material lost <em>so long as it was reasonable to operate it in ascertaining whether it would operate successfully. </em>3. Expenses in preserving tank and material in it, while making changes. 4. Fair compensation for the use of the plant while deprived of its use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-5\">The absolute undertaking on the part of the appellant was to place in the office building, <em>an elevator in running order. </em>Right in point is <em>Accumulator Co. </em>v. <em>Dubuque St. Ry. Co., </em>64 Fed. (C. C. A.) 79. . \u201cThe rule is well settled that damages recoverable of a manufacturer for breach of a warranty as to machinery which he contracts to furnish <em>and place in operation for a known purpose </em>are not confined to the differences between the machinery as warranted and as it proves to be, but include such consequential damages, as are the direct, immediate and probable result of the breach.\u201d Supported by <em>Swain </em>v. <em>Schiefflein, </em>134 N. Y. 471, 473.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-6\">Two parallel cases to the one at bar to which particular attention is asked, are 1. <em>Barkley Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Hascall, </em>123 Ind. 509, the Court holding, \u201cwhere a furniture company contracts with a hotel keeper to sell and deliver to him certain articles of furniture necessary to furnish rooms and to set them up ready for use by a day named, and fails to perform his contract until after that time, hotel keeper can recover for the loss of the use of the rooms, as they were to be furnished, such being fairly considered to have been within the contemplation of the parties at the time of the contract. \u201d 2 <em>Hextor </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>63 N. Y. 566. Here the owner of a'hotel leased it for a term of years, and covenanted to erect an addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>tion to it, by a specified time. In this he defaulted. The lease was made with reference to the use of the new structure, and \u201can allowance to the plaintiff of the rental value of the rooms in the new building during the tim\u00e9 he was deprived of them by the defendant, based upon a consideration of the use to which they were applied, and which was contemplated by both parties when the .lease was executed, affords the plaintiff only a just indemnity,-and subjects the defendant to no greater liability than it may fairly be supposed he intended to assume when the covenant was made.\u201d See also lower Courts opinion in 39 N. Y. Super. 109. Another similar case is <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Lanier House Co., </em>75 Ga. 582. The appellant contends that our showing of a loss of rentals is simply an attempt to claim mere speculative and contingent profits, and so not cognizable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-4\">- The familiar case of <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Gatch, </em>13 Md. 333, disposes of all this. \u201cWhether they (damages) are of the one character or the other <em>(i. e., </em>those reasonably resulting or those accidental) must depend upon the nature of the transaction, and in cases of building contracts on the objects and uses for which the structure may be designated. The reason stated for discarding expected profits, as an element in the estimation of the loss, is that the party charged is not pre - sumed to have made his contract with reference to such results unless the special circumstances are communicated to him at the time; but when they are such as he ought to have contemplated, as reasonable and probable result of his breach, they will affect the measure of damages in favor of the complaining party.\u201d \u201cIt is a necessary presumption that the plaintiff knew that his work was intended for use and profit, by rent or otherwise, and that in contracting to complete the mill by a certain day, he acted with reference to these purposes as important to the defendant, and that he contemplated the loss of such profit as a reasonable and a probable result of a failure on his part.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-5\">Further the items of rentals for these segregated rooms which were rendered unavailable by appellant\u2019s default could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>in no event come under the \u201cspeculative profits\u201d class. \u2022 Th\u00e9 rentals are the \u201cremuneration for the employment\u201d . of the building as mentioned on p. 108, 79 Md., <em>Ice Co. case. </em>'</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-4\">\u201cWhenever profits are spoken of as not a subject of damages it will be found that something contingent upon future bargains, or speculations or states of the market are referred to.\" <em>R. R.

This building was completed and occupied about the first of April, 1905. On the 7th day of October, 1904, the parties to this appeal entered <em>into </em>a contract by which the appellant, the Winslow Elevator and Machine Company, in consideration of the sum of sixteen hundred dollars, agreed to furnish and erect in a workmanlike and substantial manner in said office building one electric combined passenger and freight elevator in accordance with certain specifications set out in the contract. The elevator was to be furnished and in working order according to these specifications by the fifteenth day of January, 1905, subject to limitations of strikes, lock outs, accidents, and other unavoidable causes. Incorporated in this contract was this guarantee: \u201cWe guarantee all the labor and material furnished to be of the best grade and free from defects, and will replace defective apparatus within two years, provided an inspection proves such claim; and also that the apparatus will work to its rated capacity and will do its work when kept clean, dry and in good condition, provided you employ competent attendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">On January 14th, 1907, the appellees sued the appellant in the Superior Court of Baltimore City for a breach of the contract. The declaration contains the six common counts, and one special count, which alleged the breach for which the suit was brought to be that the appellant did not erect the elevator in a good and workmanlike manner in accordance with the proposal and specifications embraced in the contract. The count further averred that as a result of the unsafe and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>defective; construction of the elevator and its unsatisfactory-operation and working the plaintiff \u201clost large sums of money by the loss of tenants in the said building, who removed therefrom, and from others who refused to rent the offices in said building by reason of the general complaint of said elevator due to its improper, defective and dangerous construction, and sustained much other loss and damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">To the six common counts the appellant pleaded the general issue plea, and traversed the seventh plea. Issue was joined, and the case proceeded to trial before a jury, resulting in a verdict and judgment for the appellee for the sum of seven thousand dollars. From this judgment the appeal now before us was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\u25a0 The testimony appearing in the record is very conflicting. But it is not necessary for us to discuss it at length, or to decide upon which side of the case is found the weight \u00f3r pre \u2022 ponderance of evidence. The defendant insisted that it had performed all its obligations under the contract, and it offered evidence, if the jury had found it to be true, to have justified a verdict in its favor. On the other hand, the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs proved the breach alleged in the declaration. It was exclusively the province of the jury to decide upon the weight and sufficiency in fact of the evidence, and as they accepted the evidence of the plaintiff as to the defective workmanship and construction of the elevator we are bound by their finding upon these questions, and therefore, a minute examination of the evidence, in. the absence of any question as to its legal sufficiency, becomes unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">There is only one question in the case, and that is: Were the plaintiffs entitled to recover for the loss of rents claimed in the declaration? According to the evidence of Mr. Hoffman the direct loss sustained in the purchase of a new elevator, for repairs, &amp;c., was $1,565. The jury, therefore, allowed $5,435, for loss of rents.- The evidence, some of which was taken subject to exception, showed that the building, was one of the first erected'after the fire in February, 1904, and that there was then a great demand for offices, and that rents were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>high. The building has forty-five office rooms, and one large room on the first floor which was at first rented for $3,000 per year, but was subsequently reduced to $2,000. It is also shown that .following the completion of other office buildings rents began to decline, and the plaintiffs were obliged in consequence to make material reductions in the rent. There were forty-five offices in the building, and upon each Mr. Hoffman fixed a certain rental value. According to this schedule of prices the estimated yearly income from these rooms was $10,800, or $900 per month. Before the building was completed seven or eight offices had been rented, and Mr. Hoffman was diligent in his efforts to rent all the rooms. There was evidence tending to show general complaint about the elevator; that in some instances reduction in rents was made on account of the bad elevator service; and that this bad service was a great objection to tenants, and to others who might otherwise have rented offices in the building. Much of the testimony on the question as to what extent the elevator did in fact prevent people, who would have otherwise rented, from becoming tenants is inconclusive and conjectural, and we have been unable to find any reasonably definite evidence upon which the jury could have found such a great loss of rents. This circumstance strikingly demonstrates the necessity of applying the correct r\u00fale for the measurement of damages in cases like the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">In the leading case of <em>Hadley </em>v. Baxendale, 9 Exch. 341, Baron Alderson stated the rule of damages in cases for breach of contract to be this: \u201cWhen two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, <em>i. e., </em>according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or, such as may reasonably be supposed to <em>have been in the contemplation of both parties </em>at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it. Now, if the special circumstances under which the contract was actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>\u2022made, <em>were communicated </em>by the plaintiff to the defendant, \u2022and thus known to both parties, the damage resulting from the breach of such contract which they would reasonably contemplate would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under these special circumstances so known and communicated. But, on the other hand, if these special circumstances were wholly unknown to the party breaking the contract, he, at the most, could only be supposed to have had in his contemplation the amount of injury which would arise generally, and in-the great multitude of cases not affected by any special- circumstances, for such a breach of contract. For had the special circumstances been \u25a0known, the parties might have specially provided for the breach of contract by special terms as to the damages in that case, and of this advantage it would be very unjust to deprive them.\u201d The Court granted anew trial in that case upon the ground that, \u201cthe Judge ought to have told the jury that upon the facts then before them, they ought not to take the loss of profits into consideration at all in estimating the damages.\u201d The second branch of this rule, like the famous judgment of Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>1 Cranch, 137, which declared that an Act of Congress contrary to the Constitution was void, was an <em>obiter dictum </em>\u2014 still it has been consistently followed in later cases, and, as said by Judge Pearce in the <em>Western Union Telegraph Company </em>v. <em>N. Lehman &amp; Bro., </em>105 Md. 44, \u201cremains the law of England, and has been generally approved in this \u25a0 country, and has been too often recognized in this State to be departed from, even if we were so disposed.\u201d It was approved in the <em>United States Telegraph Company </em>v. <em>Gildersleeve, </em>29 Md. 233; the <em>Maryland Ice Company </em>v. <em>Arctic Machine Manufacturing Company, </em>77 Md. 103; <em>Webster v. Woolford, </em>81 Md. 329, and in the recent case of <em>Russell v. Stoops, </em>106 Md. 138, decided May 17th, 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In <em>Webster v. Woolford, supra, </em>Judge Robinson said that \u2018\u2018the first part of the rule as thus laid down applies to cases in which the damages are the direct and natural result of the breach of the contract, and which the law presumes to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>been in contemplation of both parties. The latter part of the rule applies in cases where special damages are claimed under special circumstances made known by the plaintiff to the defendant at the time the contract was made; and in such cases the plaintiff is entitled to recover such damages as may reasonably be supposed to have been in contemplation of both parties in view of the circumstances thus disclosed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ahg\">It must be admitted that the loss of rents cannot be recovered upon the ground of interruption, or destruction of the plaintiff\u2019s business, because there was no established business to be injured or destroyed. It is well settled that before a recovery can be had upon this ground it must appear that the business, which is claimed to have been injured,, was an established one, and that it had been conducted successfully for such a length of time that the profits thereof could be ascertained with reasonable certainty. But \u201cwhen anew business, or enterprise is floated, and damages by way of profits-are claimed for its interruption, or prevention they will be denied for the reason that such business is an adventure, as distinguished from an established business, and its profits are speculative, and remote, existing only in anticipation.\u201d 13 <em>Cyc. </em>59. Damages for losses sustained for injury to business may be recovered in that class of cases to which the cases of <em>Werner </em>v. <em>Otto, </em>40 Md. 16, and <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Price, </em>45 Md. 123, belong.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Nor is it contended that the loss of rents claimed can be-recovered under the first part of the rule in <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Baxendale, </em>because obviously such losses are not the. direct and natural result of the breach alleged. They are special, or consequential damages for which recovery is sought under the second part of that rule which is expressly relied upon by the appellees. In the statement of this rule it will be observed that general language is used, and it has been found: that its application to the facts of particular cases has given, rise to questions of great nicety and difficulty. While the-rule has been universally recognized, the instances of its application present some confusion. It is true that in this case: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the appellant knew at the time he made the contract that the elevator was to be installed in an office buildiug; but it would seem to be clear, both upon reason and authority, that <em>mere knoivledge </em>of that fact would not be sufficient to render it liable for the special losses claimed in this suit. To fix such a liability upon it upon that ground alone, and in this case there is no other upon which it can rest, would be a startling and dangerous proposition. Under such a rule the plumber, the gas fitter, the stair builder, or the machinist who defaulted in his contract to do certain work upon any of the great office buildings might be held liable for enormous special damages simply because he knew his contract had referehce to such a building. Certainly no support can be found in <em>Hadley </em>v. Baxendale, for such a position, and we have discovered none elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Where a recovery is asked under the. second part of the rule stated in that case, which-constitutes an exception to the general rule upon the measure of damages, the evidence must show that the \u201cspecial circumstances, being in view of both parties to the contract, constituted its basis.\u201d The rule is never applied unless the evidence warrants the conclusion that the contract was, to some extent, based upon the special circumstances out of which the injury arose. To apply this rule the evidence must show that \u201cthe knowledge must be brought home to the party nought to be charged under such circumstances that he must know that 'the person he contracts with reasonably believes that he accepts the contract with the special condition.\u201d <em>British Columbia Saw Mill Company </em>v. <em>Nettleship, </em>L. R. 3 C. P. 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In the <em>Globe Refining Company </em>v. <em>The Landa Cotton Oil Company, </em>190 U. S. 540, special damages were sought to be recovered for a breach of contract, in which, upon the facts, there were much stronger reasons than in this case for the application for the rule for which the appellee here contends. In that case the defendant had defaulted in his contract to deliver certain tanks of crude oil to the plaintiff. By the terms of the contract the oil was to be delivered <em>f. 0. b. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>buyer's tanks at seller's mill. </em>The plaintiff sought to recover, as part of his damages, the cost of transporting tanks to the defendant\u2019s mill to receive the oil, and also for' loss of the use of the tanks, &amp;c., upon the ground that these losses were in the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made. But it was held that these losses could not be recovered. In the course of its opinion the Court said: \u201cThe old law seems to have regarded it as technically in the election of the promisor to perform, or pay damages; <em>Bromage </em>v. <em>Gunning, </em>1 Rolle, 368; <em>Hulbert v. Hart, </em>1 Vern. 133. It is true that, as people when contracting contemplate performance, not breach, they commonly say little or nothing at all as to what shall happen in the latter event, and the common rule had been worked out by common sense, which has established what the parties would have said if they had spoken about the matter. But a man can never be absolutely certain of performing any contract when the time of performance arrives, and in many cases, he obviously is taking a risk of an event, which is wholly, or to an appreciable extent beyond his control. The extent of the liability in such cases is likely to be within his contemplation, and whether it is or not should be worked out on terms which fairly may be presumed he would have assented to if they had been presented to .his mind. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AC_\">There is nothing in the contract, or in the evidence, that would make the appellant responsible for these special losses. It would be most unreasonable to presume that he would have assented to the contract upon such a condition, and it does not appear that the plaintiffs believed at the time that the appellant assumed liability for such losses. But assuming <em>ex gratia, </em>that the contract is one which falls within the rule contended for, the losses claimed could not be recovered, because they are too uncertain and contingent. We must apply to damages such as are sued for in this case the same principles which govern in cases where profits are sought to be recovered for a breach of contract. The real thing claimed here is the income, or profit which the owners might have received from the rent of the building had the defendant performed the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>There are cases in which such damages have been recovered; and cases in which such a recovery has been denied. The distinction between the two groups, or classes of cases, which is broad and obvious, was clearly stated by Chief Justice Nelson in <em>Masterton </em>v. <em>Mayor of Brooklyn, </em>7 Hill, 61. The principle of that case has- been generally approved by the Courts. . It was adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>P., W. B. R. R. Co. v. Story, </em>13 Howard, 307, and is the settled rule in this State. <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Gatch, </em>13 Md. 334; <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Price, </em>45 Md. 123; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. v. Brydon, </em>65 Md. 198; <em>Shaefer </em>v. <em>Wilso?t, </em>44 Md. 268, and many other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In <em>Lanahan </em>v. <em>Heaver, </em>79 Md. 419, <em>Judge </em>McSherry states the rule to be that \u201cwhenever it is purely problematical whether any profits would be realized at all, by reason of contingencies which might never happen, <em>or where the profits have reference to depe7ide?it or collateral engagements entered into on the faith of the performance of the principal co7itract, </em>there, without regard for any uncertainty as to mere amounts, probable profits cannot be recovered, because too speculative, indefinite and remote.\u201d This principle is in.no manner affected by the second part of the rule in <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Baxendale, supra. </em>In <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Mount, </em>36 N. J. L. 269, the Court said: \u201cIt must not be supposed that, under the principle of <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Baxen</em>dale, mere speculative profits, such as might be conjectured to have been the probable results, of an adventure which was. defeated by the breach of the contract sued on, the gains, from which are entirely conjectural, with respect to which no-means exist of ascertaining, even approximately, the probable results, can,, under any circumstances, be brought within the range of damages recoverable. .The cardinal principle in relation to the damages to be compensated for on the. breach of a contract, that the plaintiff, must establish the quantum of his loss by evidence from which the jury will be able to estimate the extent of his injury, will exclude all such elements-of injury as incapable of being ascertained by the usual rules of evidence to a reasonable certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>When the claim of the plaintiffs for the recovery of lost rent is considered in the light of these rules it certainly must be denied. What rent they might have received from the building was not only dependent upon collateral engagements with persons who might rent the rooms, but upon many other considerations, such as location, desirability of rooms, the amount of rent asked, light and air, competition of other buildings, the number of tenants, the ability of the owners to keep the rooms occupied, and the general character of the management of the building. There are so many elements of uncertainty which enter into and affect the question that, any estimate of loss could be little short of a guess. The special damages sued for in this case are so uncertain and incapable of reasonable ascertainment that they cannot be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">It follows that the Court erred in refusing to strike put the testimony referred to in the first and second bills of exception, and in granting the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer. The portion of that prayer which allows a recovery for loss of rents is alone objectionable, the other part is conceded to be correct. We find no error in the ruling upon the defendant\u2019s prayers. Its fourth and fifth prayers announce correct principles of law, but are inapplicable to the facts of the case. Its sixth and seventh prayers do not express as clearly and\u2019accurately the measure of damages, as applied to the facts, as does the earlier part of the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer, and that part of the prayer may be taken upon the retrial of the case as expressing the true measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"><em>Judgment reversed and new trial </em>awarded, <em>the appellees to pay the costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
