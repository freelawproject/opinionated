That after the arrival of the ship at <em>L? Orient, </em>and the freight had been _ earned, <em>F. </em>being indebted to the plaintiffs, <em>Tripler 8f Craig, </em>in the sum of 10,000 dollars, on the 10th of <em>September, </em>1813, assigned to them the ship or proceeds thereof, and the surplus freight, after paying <em>L., </em>&amp;c. That relying on this assignment, <em>T. 8f C. </em>had assumed to pay out of the proceeds, remaining over and above their debt, a debt due from <em>F. </em>to the <em>City Bank, </em>amounting to 6000 dollars. That soon after this last assignment, to wit, on the 18th of <em>December, </em>1813, <em>F. </em>executed another assignment to <em>T. 8f C., </em>reciting the former assignment of the 10th of <em>September, </em>the objects of which had been executed, and that <em>T. 8f C. </em>had been paid the 10,000 dollars by <em>F., </em>and that they had since lent <em>F. </em>other sums of money; to secure the payment of which, and of other sums to be lent and advanced, <em>F. </em>assigned the said ship and the homeward freight, and all the interest of <em>F. </em>in the same, in whose hands soever the same might he. This assignment was absolute, with the usual power of attorney. The defendant <em>O. </em>was master of the ship during the voyage, and continued to be master, until she was captured on her homeward voyage. That at the time of the last Assignment, <em>T. 8f C. </em>had paid <em>F. </em>1,200 dollars, and had since paid him 1,400 dollars, and <em>F. </em>now owed <em>T.

That <em>L. </em>was informed of the two last assignments to <em>T. 8f C. </em>and of their advances and responsibilities for <em>F.; </em>but had given such orders as induced <em>O. </em>to act as if <em>T. fy C. </em>had no interest in the ship and freight.That <em>0. </em>remitted 14,000 dollars of the outward and homeward freight to <em>L. </em>in bills of exchange which are retained as due to <em>L. </em>and 0.

That he, 0., took command of her, on the 12th of November, 1812, and was employed by <em>F. </em>as owner; that he acted as master under <em>F. </em>until after his arrival in <em>France. </em>That, on the 25th of February, 1813, he received a <em>letter </em>from L., dated the 23d of December, 1812, inclosing a copy of a bill of sale of the ship, freight, and proceeds, to <em>L.; </em>and, also, a power of attorney from <em>L. </em>to act for him. That, from that time, he considered <em>L. </em>as the owner, and acted as agent of <em>L. </em>in respect to the ship, freight, and proceeds, and in conformity to the letters and instructions of <em>L. </em>That the proceeds of the outward freight were received by him as the agent of <em>L. </em>And he insisted, that he was accountable only to <em>L. </em>for his agency. That he would not have accepted the agency, distinct from his office as master of the ship, had he supposed that either of the plaintiffs, and not the defendant <em>L.. </em>was interested in the property. That he was first informed of the two assignments to <em>T. fy C. </em>on his arrival at <em>New-York, </em>in <em>October, </em>1814. That by his agreement with <em>F., </em>he acted only as \"master; and the farther interest and concern of <em>F. </em>were intrusted by him to a supercargo, <em>D. </em>Sheldon, who acted as supercargo and agent of <em>F. </em>until <em>0. </em>received the letters of <em>L., </em>with the bill of sale and power of attorney, with instructions as to the proceeds of freight, &amp;e. The defendant <em>O. </em>further stated in his answer the contents of the letters of <em>L., </em>of the 23d and 29th of <em>December, </em>1812, and 20th of <em>January, </em>1813, and of his instructions, and of all the transactions by him as agent. That in the letter of the 29th of <em>December, </em>1812, <em>L. </em>stated that the bill of sale was on account of the failure of <em>Fanning 8f Coles, </em>and for the purpose of paying custom-house bonds, and to save friends. That, in <em>October, </em>1813, he received a letter from <em>L. </em>dated the 16th of <em>August, </em>1813, saying, that he took the ship and freight as security for about 6^000 dollars, and to cover a demand of <em>Carey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>of about 1500 dollars, and feared he should lose all, unless the property was insured in <em>France. </em>That, in Qc<em>tober, </em>1814, the defendant and <em>L. </em>rendered to each oth<em>er </em>e their respective accounts, of all their transactions and concerns, on which there was a balance due to the defendant 0. of 1,028 dollars and 86 cents.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A97o\">\n<em>September 28th</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"A7j\">June 22d and 23d.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-5\">Evidence was taken in the cause, which was brought ta a hearing, as to the defendant <em>0., </em>in <em>June </em>last.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b483-6\"><em>Riggs </em>and Baldwin, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b483-8\"><em>T.

This assignment is the only foundation of their claim, and it is not admitted by the answer. We must recur to the resulting trust of <em>Fanning, </em>as the only existing right shown on the part of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">The bill of sale from <em>Fanning </em>to <em>Lord, </em>was absolute upon its face, and no resulting trust appears. Nor is there proof of the express agreement charged in the bill. The evidence, that the bill of sale was intended to be qualified and not absolute, appears from the two letters of <em>Lord </em>to <em>Olcott, </em>of the 29th of <em>December, </em>1812, and the 16th of <em>August </em>1813. In the one, he says, that the bill of sale arose from the failure of <em>Fanning, </em>and others, and was <em>for </em>the purpose of paying custom-house bonds, and to save friends; and in the other he states, that he took the ship and freight as security for about 6,000 dollars, and to cover a demand of one <em>Carey </em>for 1,500 dollars-. These were. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>representations entirely contrary to the statement in the bill of the agreement between <em>Fanning </em>and <em>Lord, </em>made on the delivery of the bill of sale. Nor do the two accounts given in the letters correspond with each other, and they were mentioned to <em>Olcott </em>rather incidentally, and without any full, precise, and satisfactory explanation of the trust: They were not intended to form any rule or guide to <em>OlcoWs </em>conduct, and he could only look to <em>Lord, </em>as the owner. The authentic evidence which he had of any right or title in the property, xvas the bill of sale and the letter of attorney; and he could not, and did not, recognise any other title, interest, or authority. A resulting trust, mentioned in this incidental and obscure manner, and especially when attended with the clear title and positive acts and instructions of <em>Lord </em>as oxvner, did not probably, attract any attention from Olcott; and he says, in his answer, that he considered <em>Lord </em>as the sole owner, and as having the exclusive interest, and that he would not have accepted of any agency for any other person, distinct from that of master of the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\">On his return to the <em>United States, </em>in <em>October, </em>1814, he duly accounts to and with <em>Lord; </em>and the question is, whether he is bound to account also to <em>Fanning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">It does not appear to me, that <em>Olcott </em>could with safety or propriety, have dealt xvith any other person than <em>Lord. </em>He had no business of concern with the dealings between <em>Lord </em>and <em>Fanning, </em>and the loose hints communicated to him by <em>Lord </em>vvere of no use. It would be equally dangerous and inconvenient, in the business and affairs of the xvorld, to deny, that <em>Olcott </em>could not definitively and safely account with <em>Lord, </em>under the circumstances of this, case. If there had been fraud and collusion, charged, and proved between him and <em>Lord, </em>in the settlement, to the prejudice of the known rights of others, it would have presented a very different question. But no such allegation or proof exists; <em>Fanning </em>must look to <em>Lord, </em>and cannot look bey ond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Mm, for an account of the management and proceeds of the property assigned to him in trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">It is stated to have been held in <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Downes, </em>(2 Ch. <em>Cas. </em>121.) that where a trustee made a letter attorney to <em>S. </em>to manage and receive the rents and profits of. land, and <em>S. </em>afterwards accounted to the trustee for his agency, he was, after the death of the trustee, and on a bill by the <em>cestuy que trust, </em>directed to account to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">That case is so destitute of all facts and circumstances requisite to a clear' understanding of the principle and the application, that it can scarcely be regarded as an authority. It may be, that there was a collusion between the trustee and the agent, or that the agent had notice from the principal not to account with the trustee, or that the trust had expired at the time. It is impossible to be maintained, that if an agent duly and fairly accounts with his, immediate and authorized principal, that he is bound, in all cases, to account over again to the person standing behind his immediate principal. This would be a doctrine not to be endured; there must have been something in the case cited which does not now appear, and which gave if a special direction. Lord <em>Eldon, </em>in <em>Beaumont </em>v. <em>Boultbee, </em>(7 <em>Vesey, </em>605. 610. 617.) laid down this rule, that an account settled between an under and an upper agent, without vouchers, and upon mere confidence, was not to be considered as settled against the. principal, without allowing him the liberty to surcharge and falsify those accounts. But, in that case, it appeared that the under steward, (as he was termed,) was employed both by the upper steward and the principal, and the liberty given to the principal went no farther than to <em>surcharge and falsify ; </em>and that was founded on the extraordinary and unusual mode of accounting which had been adopted in that case. Under such checks and limitations, there can be no doubt. that the party ought to account again to the person who . has the ultimate interest. But when no special circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>stances appear, and there is no fraud, then I apprehend the general rule to be otherwise, and that it was truly de - ' clared in <em>Clavering\u2019s </em>case. <em>(Prec. in Ch. </em>535.)</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">The plaintiff in .that case was entitled to several collieries of value, and his guardians or trustees, during his minority, had appointed the defendant an agent to manage the same, with a salary which they had increased as they saw occasion. He passed his accounts regularly with the trustees or guardians, every half year; and they, from time to time passed and allowed those accounts. The plaintiff being of age, filed his bill, not only against the trustees or guardians, but the agent, to have a general account. The agent pleaded the accounts themselves, and the plea was held good, for he was but a servant to the trustees; and as they had authority, to employ him, they had the same to discharge him and allow his accounts, and he had nothing at all to do with the plaintiff; that if it were otherwise, none would ever be concerned in an infant\u2019s affairs, and the plaintiff would suffer no sort of mischief by it; for he was at full liberty to go through the whole account against the guardians or trustees, and they were only and immediately responsible to him, and would be so for the embezzlements of the servants they employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">In the cases referred to, the character of the trustee, and the relationship between him and the principal, was, no doubt, distinctly known and declared. But in the present case, <em>Fanning </em>had clothed <em>Lord </em>with the absolute legal title, and held him out to the world, and suffered him to deal with others, as the real and absolute owner. Upon every just and safe principle, the settlement between <em>Olcott </em>and <em>Lord </em>ought to be absolute; it ought not to be opened by <em>Fanning; </em>nor the defendant <em>Olcott </em>called on to account <em>de novo </em>with him, except upon the ground of fraud and collusion, and that is not the ground taken in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>I am, accordingly, of opinion, that the bill, as to the defendant <em>Olcott, </em>be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Bill dismissed, accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
