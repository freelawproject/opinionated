That the said suit is still pending in this court, except so far as it may have abated by the death of <em>C.

C. </em>Roosevelt, would form part of the record, and the defendants have-the benefit thereof, in their defence, as his personal representatives; whereas the present is a new original bill-of the plaintiffs, which takes no notice of the former bill and answer, &amp;c. but seeks a discovery and account from these defendants, as executors, as though the former bill had not. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>been filed, nor the answer of the said <em>C.

The statute (1 N. <em>R. L. </em>488.) does not require or permit the suit to be abated iff case of the death of onet of the defendants. Perhaps the plaintiff may, in certain cases, be entitled to elect between a new bill and a bill of revivor, according to the <em>dictum </em>in the cases referred to, but it would not be reasonable in this case, after the defendants had answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Leave to amend the bill, on payment of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
