The defendant ought to set forth his title affirmatively, that the court may determine whether the suit ought to be stayed, until the title is established at law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-10\">IN 1772, <em>Henry Livingston, </em>of the island of <em>Jamaica, </em>devised an esiate in that island to his four nephews, <em>Philip L., P. P. L., Walter L., </em>and the defendant, in fee, as tenants in common. The testator died in <em>February, </em>1772, having appointed the four devisees his executors. <em>P P. L. </em>proved the will, and managed the estate for the proprietors, until his death, in 1789, having, however, previously disposed of his share of the estate to <em>Robert C. </em>Livingston, in fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-11\">After the death of <em>P. P. L., </em>the defendant took upon himself the management of the estate, and appointed agents to superintend it, and to receive the\" profits ; arid the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>portions of the nett profits were, for several years, regularly received by the proprietors. <em>R. C. L. </em>died in 1794; <em>Walter L. </em>in 1798, and <em>Philip L. </em>in 1809, leaving the de= fendant the sole surviving devisee and- executor. Since the death of <em>Philip L., </em>the defendant has prevented the plaintiffs, who are the legal representatives of the other three tenants in common, from receiving their respective shares of the profits of the estate, and has refused to exhibit any account thereof, pretending that he is entitled to the whole estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-3\">The bill was filed, to compel him to render an account, and to pay to the plaintiffs their several proportions of the proceeds of the estate, and for general relief, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-4\">The defendant, without answering the bill, pleaded, that inasmuch as the title to the estate may be involved in the controversy, and which\" can only be tried by the laws of <em>Jamaica, </em>he ought not to be sued in this court for the matters set forth in the bill, and. submitted whether he was bound to answer it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-5\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-7\"><em>T, A.

He cited 1 <em>Atk. 525. 543. </em>1 <em>Vesey, 232. 234. 446. 3 Vesey, 352. Amb.428. </em>1 <em>Madd.

He ought to answer and set forth the nature of his exclusive title, and what the laws of <em>Jamaica </em>are. <em>(Penn </em>v. <em>Baltimore, </em>1 Vesey, 444.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b58-9\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"A2BZ\">This case is not brought within the principle contended for by the defendant\u2019s counsel.- The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>,'jili charges that the plaintiffs are seised in fee of their respective shares of the estate in the island of <em>Jamaica, </em>and that they have, until lately, received their proportion of the income of the estate, which has been for a long time under the management of the defendant, and that he now neglects or refuses to account, under some pretence of right or title to the whole estate. The mere suggestion of such pretence is not sufficient to defeat the plaintiffs\u2019 right to an account. If the defendant has any title, in exclusion of the plaintiffs, he must set it forth affirmatively, and it will then be in time to discuss the question, whether the suit ought to stay, until the title is established by the local tribunals in the island of <em>Jamaica. </em>The bill avers a seizin in fee by the plaintiffs, as tenants in common, and that the exclusive title set up by the defendant in conversation, is mere pretence; and so I shall intend it to be, until the title is shown to this court</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Pica overruled, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b59-5\">a) <em>Vide M\u2019Intyre </em>v. <em>Mancius, </em>ante, page 40.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
