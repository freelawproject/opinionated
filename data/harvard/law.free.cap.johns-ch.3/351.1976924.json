The bill then detailed, at length, the transactions and conduct of the defendant, &amp;c. and stated, that the plaintiff, before and since 1809, was a resident at <em>Schenectady, </em>and had no opportunity from personal in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>spection, of becoming acquainted with the acts of the tie-fend ant.

That the defendant sued the plaintiff at law, in <em>January, </em>1816, in an action of covenant on the agreement, and assigned breaches in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>his declaration; that the plaintiff pleaded, and gave notice of special matters of defence; that the issue was joined in <em>July, </em>1816; that the Supreme Court ordered a reference of the cause, and the plaintiff nominated one of the referees; that in <em>October </em>term, 1816, another referee was appointed, in the stead of the one chosen by the plaintiff; and in <em>May </em>term, 1817, other referees were appointed, one of whom was nominated by the plaintiff That on the 7th of <em>August, </em>the cause was regularly noticed for a hearing on the 28th of <em>August, </em>before the referees. That the referees met on that day, and heard the proofs and allegations of the defendant; that no person appeared on the part of the plaintiff; and the referees reported in favour of the defendant for 2,500 dollars, damages, and delivered their report to him; that about three or four hours after the report was delivered, the injunction obtained in this cause was served.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"AeJT\">\n<em>May 18</em>\n</p>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-3\">That on the hearing before the referees, the defendan. gave in evidence a true account of the moneys for which all the timber he had taken from the lands of the plaintiff, was sold, &amp;c.; a true account of the expenses in and about the same, &amp;c.; the original covenant between the parties;, the lease to <em>J. </em>S.; the order of the plaintiff, forbidding the defendant to take timber after the lease; the seisureby <em>J.

This court cannot award a rehearing before the referees. If the plaintiff wanted \u00e1 .discovery to aid him in his defence at law, he ought to have applied sooner; that he had been guilty of gross negligence, and if the referees heard the cause <em>ex parte, </em>it was \u201e owing to the wilful and inexcusable default of the plaintiff, who had due and regular notice of the time and place of hearing before the referees. That this is not the case for a <em>set-off, </em>as the claim of the defendant was for uncertain and unliquidated damages, arising <em>ex delicto. </em>This court could not assess the damages. There could be no set-off here in such a case, any more than at law; but the principles of set-off were the same at law, as in equity; that no unliquidated damages could be set-off.

That this is a case of <em>mutual claims, </em>under a <em>partnership </em>agreement, arising from the acts of the parties relative to the subject matter of the <em>partnership. </em>It is a case of <em>partnership account, </em>and the breaches of the articles of partnership must be ascertained on a reference to a master, or by an issue. The uncertainty of the damages on the breaches of the partnership contract, is no objection to, the jurisdiction of the court. <em>Partnership </em>dealings are the proper subjects of equitable interference, and a court of law will not direct an account to be taken between partners.

That the plaintiff did not make his defence before the referees,.and that the recovery is unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">3. That his demands against the defendant ought to be liquidated and admitted, by way of set-off against that recovery. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">3. That the demands of the parties all arise out of partnership articles, and ought to be heard together, and adjusted in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">1. The bill was not strictly a bill of discovery, for it had a prayer for relief, and yet the necessity of a discovery would seem to have been the cause and chief object of the bill. It stated, that the plaintiff had been sued at law, and that issue had been joined, and a reference awarded, and it then added, that he \u201c could not make out his defence, nor obtain a report of the referees in his favour, from the account of the defendant having been fraudulently withheld, and from- the facts essential to the defence and set-off resting, in a great measure, in the knowledge of the defendant, and, therefore, not to be made out but from a full discovery of the defendant.\u201d This is the language of a bill of discovery; and I take it for granted, that this plain and avowed purpose was the ground of the allowance of the injunction. But it appeared afterwards, that the bill was filed too late for such an object, provided the discovery was intended to have been used before the referees.</p>\n<p id=\"Aix\">.After a verdict at law, a party comes too late with a bill of discovery. <em>(Barbone </em>v. <em>Brent, </em>1 <em>Vern. </em>176.)</p>\n<headnotes id=\"ALNh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>After a trial at refcreeafa party afdoftbiscourt! impeach*\u00ae th! verdict <em>\u00b0L fe- </em>or 0\u00bf ground! of no^ haveava\u00fced hitoself, or was prevented \u201e .-dor ing.it, by fraud or accident, Or the act of the opposite party, without any ne'gligence or fault bn bis-yart,</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">There is n\u00f3 reason assigned why the bill was hot presented before the 2-7th of <em>August, </em>being only the day before the one for Which notice of the hearing at the reference had been given. It \u00f1tiw appe'ars, that the referees met on the day appointed, and heard the C\u00e1nse iti the absence of the plaintiff; and that they had made their report, and delivered it to the defendant, some hours before notice Of the injunction whs s\u00e9rv\u00e9d. The Caus\u00e9 (as It appears, frorii the answer to that part of the bill relative to S\u00e9 suit \u00e1t law) had been at issue ab\u00f3fe a year, and the Supreme Court had, at three different terms, been applied to, in resp\u00e9ct to the appointment of referees, and in tWo instances, One of the referees hadbe\u00e9n nominated by,- or on behalf of the present plaintiff. The notice of the reference had alSO been duly gifen, a's early as tlie 7th Of \u00a1August, and yet \u00fc\u00f3 bill w\u00e1S fil\u00e9 cl, Or application for an injunction made, until the 27th of <em>August. </em>Here was extrem\u00e9 delay On the part Of the plaintiff, in the exhibition Of his bill, whether Se object of the bill Was discovery in- aid of the defence at la#, or Whether it w\u00e1s for final r\u00e9lief here. If 'a party will riot apply iri dh'e season to this court, and \u00e1pp\u00e9\u00e1rs to have had sufficient time, and Sufficient information to \u00e9h\u00e1ble him to do it, the cas\u00e9 stands precisely On the same ground, as if he had applied s/tor the trial Or reference at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">It is \u00e1 settled principle, that a p\u00e1fty will hot be aided after a trial at law, Unless he c\u00e1\u00f1 impeach the justice Of the verdict Or report, by facts, Or on grounds of Which he could not have availed himself, or was prevented from d\u00b0ing it, by fraud or accident, Or the act of the opposite Pariy, urimixed with negligence 'or fault oh his part. This Point bas been 80 often ruled, that it cannot he h\u00e9c'ess\u00e1ry' 0r exPe(bent to discuss it again; ahd it is One by Which I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>mean to continue to be governed. In some of the cases in this court, referred to by the defendant\u2019s counsel, it was shown to be the rule of the <em>English </em>Chancery, and it appears also to have been frequently noticed and recognized in the Courts of Equity in this country. <em>(Marshall, </em>Ch. J. in <em>Marine Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Hodgson, </em>7 <em>Cranch, </em>336. Chancellor <em>Desaussure, </em>in <em>Winthrop and others </em>v. <em>Lane and others, </em>3 <em>Desaussure\u2019s Rep. </em>324, 325. <em>Noland v. Cromwell, </em>4 <em>Munf. </em>155.) If the principle was to be materially relaxed, the departure from it, as I apprehend, would soon be perceived and felt to be a great public grievance, by encouraging negligence, protracting litigation, exhausting parties, and drawing within the cognizance of this court the general review of trials at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">There is nothing before me impeaching the justice of the report of the referees. If the suit there was in a case of which a court oflaw had jurisdiction, (and which point I shall presently consider,) I do not know of any ground entitling the plaintiff to the continuance of his injunction. If there be any sufficient cause for a rehearing, or for setting aside the report, he will have an opportunity of applying to the Supreme Court, which has competent powers for the purpose, as-the report has not as yet been made to that court, and confirmed. I do not think I ought to assume the control of a matter of relief which has previously attached, and fitly belongs to that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">2. The matters of account stated in the bill were not proper-subjects of set-off in the action of covenant; and if-the discovery had been obtained <em>in season, </em>I presume it would not have aided the defence. The breaches assigned in the action at law were, that the plaintiff had refused to perform his part of the covenant, in furnishing timber and provisions, &amp;c. and the demand at law was in the nature of redress for a <em>wrong </em>or <em>injury </em>committed, and not for a <em>debt </em>due. It rested entirely in uncertain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>unliquidated damages. There cannot be a set-off even of a debt against the demand .of the plaintiff, unless that deman\u00bf be of such a .nature .that it could be set-off by a debt, if it existed in him. There must be mutual debts. This is the settled doctrine in the courts of law. <em>(Colson </em>v. <em>Welsh, </em>1 <em>Esp. N. P. Rep. </em>378.) Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>said Howlet v. <em>Strickland, (Cowp. Rep. </em>56.) that not only the statute, but <em>the reason of the </em>thing, related to mutual debts <em>only, </em>and that unliquidated or uncertain damages, arising from a breach of covenants, were no debts. The same doctrine was held in <em>Weigall </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>(6 <em>Term. Rep.) </em>and in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Bowne, </em>(2 <em>Johns. </em>Rep. 150.)</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AupA\"><em>not' </em>se\u00edi\u00b0ff where the decertain damafrom a breacf of covenant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"b364-6\">BquityC\u00b0n\u00ed \u00b0f the same gene-court of as 0 set off,</headnotes>\n<p id=\"A4z\">same rule prevails, also, in Courts of Equity, The practice may, perhaps, be more liberal in respect to mutual <em>credits, </em>but there is no case in which a set-off has been allowed, where the demand was for uncertain damages arising on a breach' of covenant. The courts of law and equity follow the same <em>general </em>doctrines on the subject of set-off. This appears from the opinion of Sir <em>Thomas Clarke, </em>in <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Rush. (Amb. </em>407.) The cases of <em>Ex parte Stephens, </em>and <em>Ex parte Hanson, </em>(14 <em>Ves. </em>24. 12 <em>Ves. </em>346.) only established that under certain circumstances, there may be a set-off, in equity, when there can be none at law; and as late as the case of <em>Addis </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>(2 <em>Merivale, </em>121.) it was observed by the Master of the Rolls, that in equity, as well as at law, a joint eould not be' set-off against a separate demand. Until the statute of 2 <em>Geo. </em>II. Courts of Equity followed the rule of law, and would not allow mutual, unconnected debts to be set off \u201c If they had done otherwise,\u201d said Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>in <em>Green v. Farmer, </em>(2 <em>Burr. </em>1214.) \u201cthey would have stopped the course of law, in all cases where there was a mutual demand.\u201d It was the observation of Lord <em>Hardwicke, </em>(1 <em>Atk. </em>237.) that he did not know that a Court of Equity had gone further than the courts of law, in cases of a set-off</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AsF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>There must \u00ae \u201c\"thorize6 a set off</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b365-2\">The doctrine of set-off was borrowed from the doctrine of <em>compensation </em>in the civil law. Sir <em>Thomas Clarke </em>shows the analogy, in many respects, on this point, between the two systems; and the general rules in the allowance of compensation or set-off by the civil law, as well as by the law of those countries in which that system is followed, are the same as in the <em>English </em>law. To authorzie a set-off, the debts must be between the parties^ in their own right, and must be of the same kind or quality, and be clearly ascertained or liquidated. They must be certain and determinate debts. <em>(Dig. </em>16. <em>2. de Compensationibus, Code </em>4. 31. 14. and <em>Code </em>5. <em>21. </em>1. <em>Inst. </em>vol. <em>2. 525. 527. Pothier, Trait, des Oblig. </em>No. 587. to 605. <em>Ferriere sur </em>Inst. tom. 6. 110. 113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Courts of Equity, before the statute of <em>Geo. </em>II. (and when courts of law had no power on the subject,) have enforced a set-off, after judgment of law, where it clearly appeared to have been the <em>intent </em>of the parties, that the one demand should be set off against the other. Lord Macclesfield, in a strong case of this kind, <em>(Hawkins </em>v. Freeman, <em>2 Eq. Cas. Abr. </em>10. pl. 10. 8 <em>Viner, 560. </em>pl. 26.) interfered with hesitation, and put his interference on the ground of the manifest intent</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">I observed that the practice might be more liberal in cases <em>of mutual credit, </em>and, for the more accurate understanding of that observation, I would refer to the case <em>Ex parte Deeze, </em>(1 <em>Atk. </em>228.) in which it was held, by Lord <em>Hardwicke, </em>that if a man had a debt due from a bankrupt, and had, at the same time, <em>goods </em>of the bankrupt in his hands, which could not be got from him without the assistance of law or equity, the assignees ought not to take them from him, without satisfying his whole debt. Mutual credit was not to be confined to pecuniary demands, but it reached to a case like this, of goods in the hands of the creditor. This case was cited by Ch. J. <em>Gibbs, </em>in <em>Olive v. Smith, </em>(5 Taunton, 56.) as a just decision; and he observed, that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Base, and the doctrine in it, had always been supported. Where one party being indebted to another,-intrusts that other with goods, it was a case of mutual credit; and the statute of 30 <em>!Geo. II. </em>c. 5. 'has been carried beyond money transactions, and extended ato cases of mutual \u2018trust. (4 <em>Term Rep. </em>211.)

(Co. <em>Litt. </em>171. a. <em>Montague on Partnerships, </em>vol. 1. 45.) In that action, the auditors have all the requisite powers, for they can compel the parties to account, and to be examined under oath; and I have not been able to discern any good reason why that action has so totally fallen into disuse, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The practice, also, under the statute, of appointing referees in matters of account, is a new power given to our courts law, and it would seem to render the cognizance of causes much more suitable for a court of law here, than in <em>England. </em>This court has no better mode of settling accounts than by referees, and it is, in many cases, under the necessity of appointing a merchant or other skilful accountant, to assist the Master in taking and stating the accounts. Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>once said, (2 <em>Atk. </em>144.) that the House of Lords frequently made such references in matters, of account, and he thought it the most proper method in a case then before him. In <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Koops, </em>(3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>289.) the undivided interest, of one partner was taken On execution, and the C. B. refused to make an order of reference to their prothonotary to take the partnership account, and the judges considered that such a step would be assuming equity jurisdiction <em>In that case, </em>and in such a collateral way, the measure proposed would have been changing the character' of the court; and, doubtless, it had not the jurisdiction in the mode asked for. But if such a point had directly arisen in the action of account, no such objection could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>made, and auditors would have been appointed; I believe, that the action of <em>assumpsit </em>has never been carried further, between partners,- than to the case of an account stated, and a promise by one of them to pay to the other the balance struck. <em>(Foster </em>v. <em>Allanson, 2 Term </em>Rep. 479. Moravia v. <em>Levy, 2 Term Rep. </em>483. note.) Whether the action of <em>assumpsit </em>may not be further extended, (for it is a veiY liberal and remedial action,) so as to reach, and carry into effect the general powers of a court of-law, of settling account, by referees, it is not for me to determine. It is sufficient, for the present purpose, that the defendant had a suitable action at law provided for his case, and that the action of <em>covenant </em>mentioned in the pleadings was xvell brought; and the cases I have referred to, in the <em>Term Reports, </em>admit, that if the parties enter into articles of copartnership xvithin a covenant to account atstated times, an action at laxv will lie upon the covenant. We meet \u2022 . also with the same doctrine, applied even to an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>in <em>Venning </em>v. <em>Leckie, </em>(13 <em>East, </em>7.) That xvas an action of <em>assumpsit </em>on g-promise in -writing to take Part \u00b0f certain goods, bought by the plaintiff on joint account, and for xvhich they xvere to be equally concerned in the profit-and loss. It was objected; that this xvas a partnership, and that-no action lay by one partner against the other; but the court said, that- there were many deed's of copartnership in xvhich the partners covenanted each to advance a certain sum, and that an action at laxv xvould lie to enforce the covenant, though there were accounts between them afterxvards, xvhich would require unraxrelling in equity.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"AjT7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>An action of brought at^law 1^,;\u00b0\u00b0\u00ae another* of^^tiTbc a|0' faction is \u00aept resorted to, instead of a bill in equity.,</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"A14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>An- action of covenant lies at law by one partner aginst anotherf\u201cwhere ^ii\u2019crct/a\u2018covc\u00ed nant to</headnotes>\n<headnotes id=\"An7\">Andan <em>assump</em>cti will also he, on a promise in partner,\u2019totakeof \u00cdought,inwhich cqualiyercon-\u00ede fit <em>and*loss. </em>*ir\u00b0\"</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">These cases approach, in principle, to the one under-discussion ; and though the plaintiff may be entitled to-go on, and have an account taken in this court, yet I see nothing to justity me in interfering in the mean time with the defendant\u2019s action at law.
