The testator died September 20, 1901, and the will and codicils were admitted to probate by the probate court of Cook county October 30, 1901. After the payment of debts and funeral expenses and specific bequests to the amount of $1000, by the tenth paragraph of the will the testator nominated Thomas Brenan and James Healy as executors, and by the sixth paragraph he gave, devised and bequeathed to his said executors, or the survivor of them, all the rest and residue of his estate, which consisted of personal and real estate, in trust, and provided that his said trustees should manage and control ,the same, but should not have the power to sell or encumber his real estate except No. 1466 Indiana avenue, which they were given power to sell and convey. The will also provided the appellant, who was the widow of his deceased son, John J. Mullanny, should have the right to occupy a flat in one of his buildings free of rent, and be paid by his s^id trustees, out of his estate, $40 per month, which amount by one of the codicils was increased to $60 per month, during her' life; also, after the payment of all charges and .expenses connected with the management and control of the estate, including taxes, insurance, repairs, expenses of the trust and trustees\u2019 fees, that the net income arising from said estate, or so much thereof as said trustees should deem proper, should be expended for the care, education, support and maintenance of Margaret Mary Mullanny and Dominick Daniel Mullanny, who were the children of the appellant by the testator\u2019s deceased son, John J. Mullanny, and sole heirs-at-law of the testator, until the younger of said children should arrive at the age of twenty-three years, when, if living, the entire estate should vest in said grandchildren; that said Dominick Mullanny, on the 9th day of September, 1898, published the second codicil to his said will, which, in part, is as follows: \u201cI hereby nominate and appoint my nephew, John Nangle, with Thomas Brenan, nominated and appointed in my said will, as and to be the executors of my said last will and testament and all codicils thereto, the appointment of James Healy, mentioned in my said last will and testament as executor thereof, being hereby revoked and set asidethat the said Thomas Brenan declined to qualify or act as executor and also disclaimed said trusteeship and refused to act as trustee; that said James Healy also disclaimed said trusteeship and refused to act as trustee; that John Nangle duly-qualified as executor and letters testamentary were issued to him; that subsequently said probate court appointed Edward F. Dunne administrator with the will annexed, under the provisions of section 38 of chapter 3 of Hurd\u2019s Revised Statutes of 1903, to act with said John Nangle.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\" pgmap=\"249\">The bill was amended and an answer was filed, and it was sought to have determined (1) whether James Healy was removed as trustee as well as executor by said codicil; (2) whether John Nangle was appointed trustee as well as executor by said codicil; (3) and in case it was determined that said James Healy was not removed as trustee by said codicil, to have Edward F. Dunne appointed as trustee in the place of Thomas Brenan to act with James Healy; or (4) in case it was determined that James Healy was removed as trustee and John Nangle substituted in his place as trustee, to have Edward F. Dunne appointed as trustee in place of Thomas Brenan to act with John Nangle.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\" pgmap=\"249(195) 250(64)\">The case was heard upon the amended bill and answer, and the court decreed (1) that John Nangle, by said codicil, was substituted in the place of James Healy, both as executor and trustee, and that the estate vested in trust in John Nangle; (2) that it was the intention of the testator that there should be at all times two acting trustees of the estate, and Edward F. Dunne was appointed trustee in the place of Thomas Brenan to act with John Nangle; that thereafter Edward F. Dunne declined to act as trustee, and the court substituted in his place as trustee the appellant. To reverse this decree John Nangle sued out a writ of error from the Appellate Court for the First District, where errors and cross-errors were assigned by the respective parties. The Appellate Court affirmed the decree of the superior court in so far as it decreed that John Nangle was appointed executor and trustee in place of James Healy, and reversed the decree in so far as it decreed that it was the intention of the testator that there should be at all times two acting trustees, and held that John Wangle was the sole trustee of said estate, and that as there was no vacancy in the trusteeship, the superior court was powerless to appoint appellant a trustee to act with said John Wangle, and all costs were adjudged against the appellant, Maria Mullanny, and she has prosecuted an appeal to this court to review the judgment of the Appellate Court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AczU\" pgmap=\"250\">P.

The will named James Healy as an executor but did not expressly name him as a trustee. He therefore became trustee by virtue of the fact that certain powers and duties were conferred upon him as executor which did not pertain to the powers and duties of an executor, but belonged to those of a trustee. The powers and duties of an executor and those of a trustee are separate and distinct, and while they are usually performed by different persons, the same persons are occasionally named in wills as both executors and trustees. If a person be expressly named as executor, also as trustee, the revocation of his appointment as executor will not necessarily revoke his appointment as trustee; but where powers and duties are conferred upon a person appointed as executor which do not pertain to the powers and duties of an executor but pertain to those of a trustee, the executor, by virtue of his appointment, becomes a trustee by implication of law, in which event the revocation of his appointment as executor revokes his power to act as trustee, and the duties and powers conferred upon him as an incident to his appointment as executor will terminate upon a revocation of his appointment as executor, unless otherwise provided by the will. In other words, if James Healy had been specifically named as executor, also as trustee, and his appointment as executor alone had been revoked, his powers and duties as trustee would not necessarily have terminated; but as he was named as executor only, and as executor certain powers and duties were conferred upon him which pertained to those of a trustee, upon the revocation of his appointment as executor his right to perform the powers and duties conferred upon him as executor which pertained to the powers and duties of a trustee were terminated. The testator, after revoking the appointment of James Healy as executor, which revoked his appointment as trustee, appointed John Nangle as executor in the place of said James Healy. The powers and duties of Thomas Brenan remained as they were before the appointment of John Nangle, who by the terms of the codicil was appointed' executor to act with Thomas Brenan. If John Nangle was to act with Thomas Brenan, then obviously the powers and duties conferred upon him were intended by the testator to be the same as the powers and duties conferred upon Thomas Brenan, which were the\" powers and duties not only of an executor, but also of trustee. After naming John Nangle as executor, the codicil contains the expression \u201csaid trustees.\u201d These words clearly refer to Thomas Br\u00e9nan and John Nangle. We think it clear, therefore, that the testator intended to revoke the appointment of James Healy as executor and trustee and to substitute in his place as executor arid trustee John Nangle, and that the superior and Appellate Courts ruled correctly in holding that by virtue of the appointment of John Nangle as executor he was given the powers and duties of trustee that were originally conferred upon James Healy by the will.</p> <p id=\"b254-5\" pgmap=\"254(102) 255(392)\">The next question presented for our determination is, upon Thomas Brenan declining to qualify as executor and disclaiming as trustee, did the superior court have the right to appoint a successor to Thomas Brenan as trustee to act with John Nangle? The testator appointed two executors by his will, and gave, devised and bequeathed to said executors, or to the survivor of them, so much of his estate as should remain after the payment of his debts, funeral expenses and certain charges and bequests, in trust for the specific purposes named in his will. At the time of the testator\u2019s death his duly nominated and appointed executors were Thomas Brenan and John Nangle, who by implication of law were also the trustees of the residuum of his estate. Thomas Brenan refused to qualify as executor and trustee, whereupon John Nangle qualified as executor, and thereupon became sole executor and trustee of said will and codicils and said estate. The testator, by devising the residue of his estate to his executors or to the survivor of them, showed that he did not intend that there should always be two acting trustees of his estate, otherwise, in case of the death of one of the executors appointed by him, he would not have provided that the survivor should hold in trust the remainder of his' estate, but would have provided for the appointment of a successor to said trustee. Where a testator names two trustees and makes no provision for the appointment of a successor in case one of the trustees dies, resigns or refuses to act, the entire trust devolves upon the trustee who qualifies. (Golder v. Bressler, 105 Ill. 419.) This being true, it is apparent so long as such trustee acts there is no vacancy in the trusteeship. While a court of equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee, such court cannot rightfully appoint a trustee to administer a trust until there is a vacancy in the trusteeship, and in case a trust is created and more than one trustee is named, the author of the trust has the right to determine whether the failure of one trustee to qualify shall create a vacancy, and in case of a vacancy to determine in what manner it shall be filled. (French v. Northern Trust Co. 197 Ill. 30.) Here the author of the trust appointed two trustees. One, only, qualified. No provision was made for the appointment of a successor, and it is apparent the testator did not intend that the failure of one trustee to qualify should create a vacancy. In such state of case the trust devolved upon the trustee who qualified and there was no vacancy in the trusteeship, and the superior court was without power to appoint a trustee to act for the one who failed to qualify with the one who had qualified.</p> <p id=\"b256-2\" pgmap=\"256\">We have looked into the record and are of the opinion the Appellate Court did not err in adjudging the cost in that court and in the trial court against the appellant.</p> <p id=\"b256-3\" pgmap=\"256\">The judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b256-4\" pgmap=\"256\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b256-5\" pgmap=\"256\">Wilkin and Cartwright, JJ., dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
