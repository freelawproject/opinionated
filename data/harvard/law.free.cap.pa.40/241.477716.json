Where suit was brought for a bill of goods sold more than six years before, and the Statute of Limitations was pleaded; evidence of the practice and custom of the trade to sell goods upon a system of credits, was held inadmissible for the purpose of proving that the price was not to be paid when the goods were sold, but on a certain date thereafter, so as to avoid the bar of the statute by showing that the bill was not due until within the six years: and it was error in the court below to receive the evidence and refer it to the jury as testimony from which they might infer a contract different in terms from that exhibited in the account.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b241-10\">2. But if any such general custom had been proved, or a special eustom affecting the peculiar locality or trade, it would have been the law of the contract, and both parties would have been bound by it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b241-11\">3. The usage and practice of the firm, though not good as a custom, would have been binding, if expressly made part of the contract, or shown to have been known and assented to by the defendant at the time: and evidence of such a contract, either direct, or by proving, a course of dealing between the parties on such terms, and of such frequency, as to justify the inference that the transaction was on the accustomed terms, is admissible.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-12\">Error to the Common Pleas of <em>Union county.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-13\">Tbis was an action of November 29th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>1858, by Gibson North, Pliny Chase, and Asa W.

That wares sold between the 1st of July and January \u201cmust be settled by one half cash, and the other half by note, at three months, on the 1st of January, and between that time and July, on the 1st of that month.\u201d This bill of goods was sold and charged on 19th August 1852, and was claimed by the plaintiffs as not being due until 1st January'1853.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">It was not pretended that any general custom existed in the country to this effect, or any special custom affecting either the particular locality or trade. A custom is something which has the force and effect of law; is law by the usage and consent of the people. But it must be uniform and universal within the sphere of its action, and so ancient \u201cthat the memory of man runneth not to the contrary1 Bl. Com. 68-74; 4 Rawle 212 ; 3 Watts 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">It was nothing like that which the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony tended to prove. If it had been, it will, be conceded that the custom would have been the law of the contract, and both parties would have been bound by it. The one would not have been liable to suit, nor the other to the running of the statute until the customary credit had expired. It was not this, however', which the testimony was offered to prove, but the practice and usage of the firm in regard to giving credit. Now, as this was not good, as a custom, according to the definitions, it did not, <em>ex proprio </em>vigore, bind. Plow else could this practice, if it existed, have effect ? We answer, either by being expressly made parcel of the terms of the contract, or shown to have been known to the defendant and assented to. And this might be shown either by express proof, or by proving a practice of habit of dealing between plaintiffs and defendant, on such terms of such frequency, as to justify an inference that this transaction was on the accustomed terms. Evidence of this nature would have justified the reference of the question to the jury, from which to ascertain the terms of the contract and the credit given, but that received did not. It was error, therefore, to receive it, and consequently error to refer it to the jury as evidence from which they might extract a contract different in terms from that exhibited by the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
