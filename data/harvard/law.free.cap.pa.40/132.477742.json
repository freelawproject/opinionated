That George Hartle subsequently died, and proceedings having been instituted in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Bedford county, to make partition and valuation of the said tract of land to and among the heirs of the said George Hartle, and the heirs having all refused to accept the said tract of land at the valuation thereof, on the 28th day of November 1833 an order was issued out of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Bedford county to sell the said tract of land, \u201csubject to the dower of the widow of Valentine Play, deceased, in said premises.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pALM\">That in pursuance of the said order of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Bedford county, the said tract of land was sold on the 26th day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>of December 1833 to Samuel Green, for the sum of $825, \u201c subject to the dower of the widow of Valentine Hay,\u201d and that said sale was confirmed by the said court on the 28th of January 1834. That Samuel Green sold the said tract of land, on the 4th day of April 1834, to Peter Shoenberger, for the sum of $825, \u201c subject to the payment of the dower of the widow of the late Valentine Hay, deceased, which is $562.82.\u201d That the widow of the said Valentine Hay is deceased, and that the plaintiffs are the children and heirs of the said Valentine Hay. The will of Valentine Hay \u2014 the deed of Valentine Hay\u2019s executor to <em>Jacob </em>Hartle \u2014 the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Bedford county for the sale of said tract of land, and the deed by Samuel Green to Peter Shoenberger, and the will of Peter Shoenberger, are to be considered a part of the case stated. Dr. P. Shoenberger paid to the widow of Valentine Hay the annual interest on the dower, as it is called, down to the 1st April 1851, being the time when a lease for life or four years (in ease of the testator not living <em>to the </em>end of the said four years), from the said Peter Shoenberger to John W. Duncan, commenced, after which time the said John W. Duncan paid whatever interest was paid, if any, to the said widow; which said lease is made a part of this case stated. Dr. Peter Shoenberger devised the tract of land, hereinbefore described, to his executors, in trust for the use of his daughter, Martha K. Duncan, for and during her natural life, and upon her death he devised the remainder to her children. The devise was made in the following form, that is to say:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-6\">\u201c Seventhly.

(Then follows an enumeration and description of the lands by tracts.) \u201c Also, I devise to my daughter, Martha Duncan, in trust as aforesaid and same manner, the Upper and Middle Maria Forges, with all the farms, lands, and tenements thereto belonging, situate in Blair county, and designated in the following schedule, viz.&amp;c. (Then follows a list of tracts by description in detail, in which is included the Valentine Ilay tract, hereinbefore mentioned.) After all the lands included in the devise aforesaid were described and enumerated, the will proceeds as follows, viz.: \u201cAnd I direct that the rents, issues, and profits of the said hereinbefore-described real estate so devised in trust for the use and benefit of my daughter, Martha Duncan, shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>regularly and annually paid to my said daughter, Martha Duncan, for her sole and separate use, free from the control or disposition of her present or any other future husband whom she may at any time have during her natural life, and, upon her death, I devise the same to her surviving children, and the lawful issue of such of her children as shall be then dead, leaving lawful issue, as tenants in common, in equal shares, such issue to take, in equal parts, the share only which would have been taken by his, her, or their parent, had such parent been living at the time of the death of my said daughter, Martha Duncan, the said surviving children, and the lawful issue of such as shall be then dead at the time of the death of my said daughter, Martha, to have and to hold the said lands and tenements hereby devised to them, upon the death of my said daughter, Martha Duncan, as a remainder as purchasers, and not by descent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">If the court be of opinion that the plaintiffs ought to recover from the defendants the dower that remains a charge upon the said tract of land, and subject to which Peter Shoenberger purchased the same, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs for the sum of $562.82, with interest from the 1st day of July 1854, the time of the death of the widow of Valentine Hay; but if not, then judgment to be entered for the defendants \u2014 the costs to follow the judgment, and either party reserving the right to sue out a writ of error therein. Either party to have the right to take a writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">On hearing, the court below gave judgment for the plaintiffs.

G-. </em>Miles, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alg\">The question is, Does Martha K. Duncan take the land devised <em>cum </em>onere, or must the charge which rested upon it in the lifetime of the testator be paid out of his residuary estate ? It is believed that the case of Bell\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Bell, 8 Casey 311, conclusively settles the point against the defendants in error. The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Bedford county for the sale of the land as the property of George Hartle, deceased, ordering the sale to be made \u201c <em>subject to the dower of the widow of Valentine Hay, deceased, in said, premises,\u201d </em>the deed from Adam Black, administrator of Hartle, to Green, made in pursuance of and in conformity to the decree, and the deed from Green to Shoenberger, in the <em>habendum </em>of which, are the following clauses, viz.: \u201c Subject, however, to the payment to the said Samuel Green of the sum of $550, part of the consideration-money above mentioned, and for which the said Peter Shoenberger has given his judgment-notes bearing even date herewith, and <em>subject also to the payment of the dower of the widow of Valentine Hay, deceased, </em>and <em>which the above tract of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>land was subject to in the hands of the said Samuel Green,\u201d </em>all show a charge in favour of the widow of Valentine Hay, standing in the <em>title </em>devised to Martha K. Duncan, similar in its nature to <em>statutory </em>dower, and so treated and called in the decree of the court and in the deeds themselves. A judicial sale of the land, as the property of either Green or Shoenberger, upon the judgment of a third person, would not have extinguished the charge in question: Dewait\u2019s Appeal, 8 Harris 236. The case of Campbell <em>v. </em>Shrum, 3 Watts 60, cited to support the position taken by Hay\u2019s heirs, was the case of an action of covenant founded upon articles of agreement, sealed by both parties, in which the one party sued the other for not paying the debt of the first to a third person. The payment of that debt, under the terms of the agreement, was adjudged to be the principal consideration of it, and, therefore, in the case of an unexecuted contract, signed by both parties, held to amount to a covenant to pay it. It was very unlike the case of a deed conveying the legal title subject to a charge, which adhered to it in its various stages of transmission to the present owner, under the will of Dr. Shoenberger.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-6\">In ad-dition to the leading case of Bell <em>v. </em>Bell, the following authorities are clear to the point that the residuary estate is not liable upon the facts of the case: Keyzey\u2019s Executor <em>v. </em>Keyzey, 9 S. &amp; R. 73; Toller on Executors 419; 2 P. Wms. 664; 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 421; Hoff\u2019s Appeal, 12 Harris 204; 1 Maddock\u2019s Ch. 592; 3 Ves. 128, note (a) under ease of Woods <em>v. </em>Huntingford ; Butler <em>v. </em>Butler, 5 Ves. 534.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-7\">In the absence of any proof to that effect, two leading facts prove that Dr. Shoenberger did <em>not </em>make the debt in question his own :\u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-8\">1st. In the deed from Green to him there is evidence of a discrimination in that respect between the <em>two </em>dowers which encumbered the land at the same time, to wit, the one in question and the other in favour of the widow.of Hartle. The one shows personal obligation, the other none.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-9\">2d. The testator paid the annual interest to Mrs. Hay during the time only when he was in the <em>possession </em>of the land.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-10\"><em>H. Hammond, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3j\">The question presented for adjudication is not as stated by the plaintiffs in error, whether Martha Duncan takes the land devised, <em>cum onere, </em>but whether the estate of Dr. Shoenberger is bound to pay the claim set forth in the case stated ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-11\">Dr. Shoenberger purchased the land from Samuel Green for $825, \u201csubject to the payment of the dower of the widow of the late Valentine Hay, deceased, which is $562,82.\u201d This constituted, on the part of Dr. Shoenberger, an agreement to pay, in addition to the $825, the sum of $562.82. The payment of the sum of $562.82 is part of the consideration for which the land was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>conveyed to Dr. Shoenberger: Campbell <em>v. </em>Shrum, 3 Watts 60; Blank <em>v. </em>German, 5 W. &amp; S. 36.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-6\">It is evident that the estimated value of the land by Green and Dr. Shoenberger embraced the money for which this suit has been brought, and that it was deducted or retained by Dr. Shoenberger, he paying Green the estimated value of the land less the sum of $562.82. A conveyance in consideration of the assumption of a lien on the land renders the grantee liable to pay it, and is a valuable consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-7\">Whether covenant would be the proper form of action, where it appears that he had not executed the deed, but was a party to it, and held under the conveyance, it is unnecessary to decide; for if covenant would not lie, an action on the case would, and the agreement in writing would be sufficient evidence : Dubbs <em>v. </em>Finley, 2 Penna. State Rep. 397. But debt and not covenant is the proper action: Maule <em>v. </em>Weaver, 7 Barr 329. See McCracken\u2019s Estate, 29 Penna. State Rep. 426, as to liability of defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-8\">In the case of Bell\u2019s Executor <em>v. </em>Bell, relied upon by the plaintiffs in error, there was no covenant to pay the \u201c statutory dower in favour of a widow of a former owner.\u201d The suit was brought by the devisee of the land against the estate of the devisor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-9\">Dr. Shoenberger could not, by leasing or disposing of the land in any way, change his liability under the covenant and agreement in the deed by Green to him. In his will he directs his executors to pay his just debts and funeral expenses, and the expenses of the administration of his estate, out of his personal estate not hereinafter specifically bequeathed, and his real estate not specifically devised; and thereby intended the lands specifically devised in his will to pass to the devisees free from any encumbrance. It cannot be doubted that Dr. Shoenberger became personally liable to pay the sum of $562.82; and if so, his executors are directed to pay the same in his will.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-10\"><em>Miles, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ael\">Dower is an estate in the nature of a rent-charge, not an encumbrance upon land: Power <em>v. </em>Power, 7 Watts 212; Thomas <em>v. </em>Simpson, 3 Barr 69; 3 Id. 70; Shaupe <em>v. </em>Shaupe, 12 S. &amp; R. 12. It is a continuing charge during the life of the widow of a deceased husband, different from the debts and encumbrances which formed the subject of the cases referred to in the argument of the counsel of the defendants in error: McCracken\u2019s Estate, 5 Casey 428.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-11\">Every case cited on the other side was ruled upon the force of an agreement back of the deed, except Maule <em>v. </em>Weaver, 7 Barr 329, where it was held that an action of covenant could not be sustained against a grantee of a deed recited to be an indenture <em>inter partes </em>\u2014 sealed alone by the grantor, in which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>contained a covenant on the part of the grantee to pay a rent reserved out of the land. That was the only point ruled in the case.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AvZ\">July 25th 1861,</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-6\">Our case is not that of a first grantee, but of a testator, who in his lifetime occupied the position of a third in the chain of connection between the original proprietor, Valentine Hay (the dower of whose widow was a charge upon the land), and the testator\u2019s devisee. It is clearly distinguishable from the cases relied upon in the opposite argument, and strictly within the ruling of Bell <em>v. </em>Bell. Dr. Shoenberger was a third grantee of the <em>legal </em>estate charged with a continuing dower, conveyed by a deed-poll <em>subject </em>to such charge. In regard to such a deed, the rule of construction would be different from that which would govern a paper sealed by both parties. See Poyntell <em>v. </em>Spencer, 6 Barr 256. The principles settled after an elaborate discussion by most eminent counsel in the case of Walker <em>v. </em>Physick, 5 Barr 193, must rule this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-7\">This same principle is found in Royer <em>v. </em>Ake, 3 Penna. Rep. 464; Wiedner <em>v. </em>Foster, 2 Id. 25; Thomas <em>v. </em>Connell, 5 Barr 14; Wiekersham <em>v. </em>Irwin, 2 Harris 108, 110, 111; Berry <em>v. </em>McMullen, 17 S. &amp; R. 87; Doe <em>v. </em>Provoost, 4 Johns. 66; Hogan <em>v. </em>Jackson, Cowper 304, 305.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-8\">Upon the question of the intention of the testator, there is nothing in the will to take the case out of the rule laid down in the case of Bell <em>v. </em>Bell. The same reasons exist in this case as in that, for holding that there is a total absence of an intention manifested to exonerate the land from the charge, and to throw it upon the residuary fund.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"AFcH\">by Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS3\">This was an action of debt against the plaintiffs in error, to enforce an alleged undertaking of their testator to pay off a dower; subject to which, on the 4th of April 1854, he purchased and accepted a conveyance of a certain piece or tract of land, formerly belonging to Valentine Hay, deceased, and which, by his will, he devised before the same became payable, to Mrs. Duncan, his daughter. Is it a debt chargeable to the residuary estate of Dr. Shoenberger, or does the devisee take the land <em>cum onere ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">In the case of Wolveridge <em>v. </em>Steward, 3 Moore &amp; Scott 561, it was held in the Exchequer Chamber (opinion of the court by Lord Denman, C. J.), on an indenture <em>sealed by both parties, </em>the words \u201csubject nevertheless to the payment of the yearly rent and performance of the covenants and agreements reserved and contained in the said indenture of lease,\u201d &amp;c., being inserted in the <em>habendum, </em>did not, without the intent otherwise appeared, imply an agreement or covenant to pay the rent and perform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>covenants; that the words in that place naturally import or qualify the generality of the words which precede them, and his lordship cites the definition of the office of a <em>habendum </em>from Co. Litt. 6 : \u201cIt doth qualify the general intendment of the premises; and the reason of this is, for that is a maxim of law, that every man\u2019s grant shall be taken by construction of law, most forcible against him.\u201d Ilis lordship also in that opinion explains a seeming difference between that case and Barnett <em>v. </em>Lynch, 5 B. &amp; C. 597, determined in the King\u2019s Bench. The difference arose out of the difference in the instruments, and perhaps form of action, but it is more apparent than real.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Without affirming the principles of this case expressly, our court has done so impliedly, by looking, notwithstanding the words, to the entire agreement for the evidence of intent to make the d\u00e9bt or encumbrance the debt of the grantee in the conveyance. Thus, in McCracken\u2019s Estate, 5 Casey 428, the intent was deduced from the act of the assignee buying but an equitable interest, and procuring an assignment of the contract between the original vendors and his assignor to himself; which it was thought evinced an intent to be bound as his assignee was bound. So, too, this intent was thought to be evinced by the testator\u2019s will, in the manner in which he devised his estate. So in Bell\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Bell, 8 Casey 309, words such as exist here were held not sufficient of themselves against the improbability that any man would so contract as .to tie up his estate indefinitely from final administration, until the widow\u2019s dower should become payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In Walker <em>v. </em>Physic, 5 Barr 193, the words were, \u201cunder and subject to the payment of the said rent, as the same shall accrue, for ever,\u201d in the <em>habendum. </em>Mr. Justice Kennedy, in an elaborate opinion at Nisi Prius, considered these words in the same light as did Lord Denman in Wolveridge <em>v. </em>Steward, as a qualification of the estate granted, and also to save responsibility under the words \u201cgrant, bargain, and sell.\u201d In affirming that case in banc, Gibson, C. J., says the true rule of interpretation is the intent of the parties. This of course denied to the words, <em>per se, </em>the effect of a covenant, or a personal promise to be liable. Many reasons, derived from results which might flow from holding them to have the force of an agreement to pay, are given in that case, proving what has already been said, that such a conveyance does not, <em>pier se, </em>imply a personal covenant to pay without regard to the enjoyment of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The same principle was held in Wickersham <em>v. </em>Irvine, 2 Harris 108. But Mr. Justice Rogers denied what has sometimes been asserted, that buying, subject to encumbrance merely, created no privity of contract. That the assignee, and so Avith his successors, Afere liable for ground-rent only on privity of estate arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>from the \u201c actual or beneficial enjoyment of the premises, or the right of possession and enjoyment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">These authorities are sufficient to establish, beyond doubt, that the words in the <em>habendum, </em>in the deed by Green to Dr. Shoenbergcr, \u201c <em>subject also to the payment of the doiver of the widow of Valentine Hay, deceased, and which the above tract of land was subject to in the hands of the said Samuel Green,\u201d </em>do not, of themselves, the deed not being sealed by the latter, import a covenant or a promise by acceptance of it, to be personally answerable to discharge the dower. The dower having become due and payable after the doctor\u2019s death, and after the estate had passed by devise to Mrs. Duncan, upon no principle of privity of contract or estate is his estate answerable to discharge the encumbrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">As we see no indication whatever, outside of the words used, evincive of an intent to make the payment of the decree a personal obligation by the testat\u00f3r, we are clearly of opinion that the case must be reversed. It is not, in principle, distinguishable from Bell\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Bell, already cited, and which followed abundance of authority, as appears by the citations therein. In the case in hand, the dower was not even counted as part of the purchase-money. That was $825 for the land, \u201c subject to the payment of the dower,\u201d <em>ko,., </em>\u201cwhich is $562.82.\u201d \u201cI have no doubt,\u201d says Gibson, C. J., in Walker <em>v. </em>Physic, \u201cthat they actually meant no more than to say the grantee was to take an encumbered estate, without recourse to the grantor for a breach of the statutory covenant arising from the words \u201c grant, bargain, and sell.\u201d And the fact that the encumbrance was not included in the purchase-money, is a strong circumstance that this was the understanding of the parties. I need do no more than to notice one or two cases relied on by the defendant in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The facts of Campbell <em>v. </em>Shrum, 3 Watts 64, were, in some particulars, like those in McCracken\u2019s Estate. Shrum sold to Campbell, by articles of agreement, an equitable title, which agreement both parties signed and sealed. By these Campbell agreed to buy, for a consideration to Shrum, \u201c subject to the payment of the <em>purchase-money </em>and <em>interest now due, </em>on articles of agreement between Thomas Netly and James Gibson of the one part, and the said Shrum of the other part.\u201d It is evident that the principal consideration for the sale to Campbell by Shrum, was, that the former should discharge the arrears then due by the latter, and for which he was liable to be called on at any moment. It was the evident intent apparent in the covenants, as appears in the opinion of the court, Avhich led to the ruling there. No one can doubt its propriety, I think. But it does not conflict with the case in hand. The dower was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>payable when Dr. Shoenberger bought, nor did it become so in his lifetime. The estate came to him charged with it, and it is evident he took it to hold as encumbered.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The only other case to be noticed is Maul\u00e9 <em>v. </em>Weaver, 7 Barr 329. We may dismiss it with the only remark remaining, in view of the case before us, and that is, that the point there decided was that covenant does not lie against a party who has not signed or sealed the instrument sued on. No point of that kind arises here. This was an action of debt, and as there can be no doubt but that it would lie in all eases for the recovery of a specific sum of money, we see no objection to the form of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">But for the reasons assigned, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Judgment reversed, and judgment for the defendants, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
