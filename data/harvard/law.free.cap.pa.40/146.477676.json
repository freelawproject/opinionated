On the 12th June 1858, they filed their account in the prothonotary\u2019s office, Berks county, of which the prothonotary gave the usual notice. An auditor was appointed on this account, who gave due notice to creditors to present their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>claims. He made his report, which was confirmed absolutely, October 24th 1859, distributing the money in the hands of Benneville Keim\u2019s assignees.

This report was subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court, to wit, June 28th 1860. Benneville Keim was solvent until 1856, more than two years after his account as assignee of Daniel De B.

Rep. 18. There was no notice given by defendant to Webner, nor to his administrator, requiring suit to be brought. Defendant, therefore, is liable. See also Cope <em>v. </em>Smith, 8 S. &amp; R. 112; Gedder <em>v. </em>Hawk, 10 Id. 33; 1 Watts 280; Erie Bank <em>v. </em>Gibson, 1 Id. 143; Greenawalt <em>v. </em>Kreider, 3 Barr 264; United States <em>v. </em>Simpson, 3 Penna. Rep. 439. Nor is this case within that class in which the surety has been held discharged, because the creditor had the means of payment in his hands. The cases cited in support of this point are unlike the present: Cathcart\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris 416; Morrison <em>v. </em>Hartman, 2 Id. 55, look to some active interference on the part of the creditors, and sustain the principle that mere supineness will not discharge a surety. See also Brubaker <em>v. </em>Okeson, 12 Casey 519; Bank <em>v. </em>Klingensmith, 7 Watts 523.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-8\">It is not the policy of the law to relieve sureties from their obligations in the absence of some positive act or declaration of the creditor detrimental to the surety\u2019s interest.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A9p\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>July 25th 1861,</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">If the plaintiff did nothing for defendant\u2019s benefit, defendant might have done something for himself. The principle we rely on ought to apply strongly in cases like this, where the creditor is not consulted in the selection of the assignee or his sureties. Even if the assignment of Benneville Keim, and the possession of assets by his assignees to pay his debts, be considered a judicial proceeding, and equivalent to money in the hands of a sheriff for creditors, plaintiff would not have been obliged to resort to it. One lawsuit is enough, and equity will not require a creditor to follow his claim through two sets of assignees.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"Aqg\">by Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADk\">The main proposition of law for which the plaintiff in error contends may bo conceded without necessarily reversing this judgment. That proposition may be stated thus : That, whilst mere omission of a creditor to sue the principal debtor does not discharge a surety, yet when the creditor has the means of satisfaction either actually or potentially in his hands, and does not choose to retain it, the surety is discharged. What it is to have the means of satisfaction actually or potentially in hand, must be gleaned from the eases. Thus the levy of a <em>fi. fa. </em>on personal goods of the debtor, as in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Miller\u2019s Adm\u2019rs., 8 S. &amp; R. 457, and in Bellas <em>v. </em>Haas, 16 Id. 252, was to possess the means of satisfaction, and a release of the levies worked a discharge of the sureties. So when the surety applies to the creditor, and apprises him of any legal means of recovering his debt, and he declines, upon demand made, to pursue it, whereby the opportunity of being paid is lost, the surety is discharged : Lichenthaler <em>v. </em>Thompson, 13 S. &amp; R. 157. Or if suit be brought by the creditor which might result in satisfaction, but is discontinued against the consent of the surety, as in Bank <em>v. </em>McAllister, 6 W. &amp; S. 149, the surety is released.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">These are instances of the actual or potential possession of the means of satisfaction in the hands of a creditor, \u2014 but was there anything of this sort in the case before us ?</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The plaintiff in error, defendant below, was the surety of Benneville Keim, the assignee of Daniel De B. Keim. Ludwig Webner was the creditor of the assignor. The assignee having filed his account of the trust, an auditor reported distribution of* 71 per cent, to the creditors on the 18th of January 1845. Exceptions were filed to his report, which were not dismissed, and the report absolutely confirmed until the 27th of June 1854, before which time Webner had died, and Frill had become his administrator. His distributive share, according to the auditor\u2019s report, was f251.62.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Now, the excuse of the administrator for not claiming prompt payment of this sum is, that he had no knowledge of the debt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Be it that this is an insufficient excuse \u2014 that it was his duty to know the assets of his decedent \u2014 and that, as standing in the shoes of the dead man, he shall he presumed to have known, what then is the case more than mere indulgence of a debtor, which, according to all the authorities, never discharges the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In what sense can it be said the administrator had the means of satisfaction, either actual or potential, in his hands ? The debt was against Daniel Keim. He assigned the means of paying it to Benneville Keim. Richards, as the surety of Bonneville, promised that he should faithfully apply those means. The assignee\u2019s possession was, as between the debtor and creditor, the possession of the debtor rather than of the creditor. The debtor appointed the assignee, and though he became trustee for the creditors, it was a trust created and limited by the debtor for his own benefit. Benneville Keim and his sureties were substituted for Daniel Keim. The assets of Daniel were in their legal and their actual possession. But the creditor might have obtained payment by calling for his money. It was set apart and ready for him, and, though actually in the hands of the assignee, it could be had for the asking. Grant that this was extraordinary and unreasonable inaction on the part of the creditor, it was not possession actual or potential of the means of satisfaction, and thus the main proposition of counsel fails of its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">But would not such inactivity discharge the surety ? No; because the rule is well settled that mere forbearance, however prejudicial to the surety, will not discharge him. It is his peculiar business to judge of the danger to be apprehended from delay, and to quicken the creditor, where occasion requires it, in the way known to the law; in default of which the loss incurred is necessarily to be attributed to his own supineness: 3 Penna. Rep. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">But there is another chapter to this case. On the 6th September 1856, Benneville Keim made a general assignment for the benefit of his creditors. The assignees gave the usual notice 'to creditors to present their claims. On the 12th June 1858, the \u25a0 assignees filed their account, which was referred to an auditor, who made a report, which was confirmed absolutely on the 24th October 1859, distributing the money in the hands of the assignees, which paid the creditors in full, and left a balance for the assignor, Benneville Keim, which was paid over to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Here there was a good chance for the administrator to get his decedent\u2019s debt paid. Webner\u2019s claim had become a debt of Benneville Keim. His estate was ample to pay it, and was in process of liquidation for payment of all his debts. Erill had only to come in and receive his money at the hand of the assignee of Benneville Keim. He neglected to do it. Was this the release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>of a potential satisfaction, like- the staying of a <em>fi. fa., </em>or the discontinuance of a suit? We cannot think so. For the reasons before given, we consider it mere indulgence \u2014 unreasonable inaction \u2014 which the surety ought to have quickened into activity by notice to the creditor. He knew, or had the means of knowing, that his principal had not paid the Webner debt. It was negligence in him to stand by and see the estate of his principal scattered without providing for this ascertained claim, or giving the creditor notice to secure it. The utmost he can impute to the creditor is inaction, not release of anything in possession\u2014 and the cure for inaction was in the surety\u2019s own will. Whenever he chose to require the creditor to move, the creditor would have been obliged to put himself in motion, and further inactivity would have discharged the surety. But until he gave the word, and he never gave it, he acquired no legal defence, from lapse of time, to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-5\">Thompson, J., dissented.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b151-6\">Strong, J., took no part, having been of counsel in the case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
