(\u201cFlying J\u201d) on Jones\u2019s Title VII retaliation claim. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AZfX\">A. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">Plaintiff Jones worked for Flying J as a convenience store manager from December 8, 2005 until April 21, 2006, when she was terminated for excessive absenteeism. Jones sued Flying J under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>alleging (1) she was sexually harassed and subjected to a hostile work environment by Butch Jacobs, her immediate supervisor, and (2) she was terminated by Keith Staples in retaliation for her complaining about Jacobs\u2019s sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">The district court granted summary judgment to Flying J on Jones\u2019s sexual harassment claim on <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>grounds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jones has not opposed summary judgment on this claim either in the district court or on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-17\">The case proceeded to a jury trial on Jones\u2019s retaliation claim. At the close of Jones\u2019s case, Flying J moved, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, for judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court reserved ruling on the motion and permitted Flying J to present its case. At the close of all evidence, the district court granted Flying J\u2019s Rule 50 motion. The district court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was no evidence that Staples knew about Jones\u2019s complaint against Jacobs when Staples terminated her. Jones appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>To resolve Jones\u2019s appeal, we first review the evidence presented at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">B. Trial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Flying J operates a number of \u201ctravel plazas,\u201d facilities that combine a convenience store, restaurant, and gas station. On December 8, 2005, Butch Jacobs, the general manager of one travel plaza, hired plaintiff Jones as a convenience store manager. Jacobs was Jones\u2019s immediate supervisor. Jacobs\u2019s supervisor was district manager Kerry Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Jacobs sexually harassed Jones. On March 30, 2006, Jones\u2019s attorney sent a letter to Flying J\u2019s corporate counsel, Kelly Lowrey, reporting Jacobs\u2019s sexual harassment of Jones.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">After an investigation, Flying J, on April 10, 2006, fired Jacobs and named Keith Staples, who was Flying J\u2019s district accounting manager, to serve as interim general manager of the travel plaza.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">On Friday, April 21, 2006, interim general manager Staples fired Jones, citing her excessive absences. Jones was absent five days right before her firing. Specifically, Jones was scheduled to work on Friday, April 14, 2006, but did not. Jones called in and spoke to Lake. Lake told Jones that they needed her at work, but Jones told him she was in pain and would be out until at least the following Tuesday. Jones was not scheduled to work on Saturday, Sunday, or Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">On Monday, April 17, 2006, Jones learned she was pregnant. Jones was bleeding, and the doctor advised her to stay off her feet. Jones told no one at work that she was pregnant, but told them she was under a doctor\u2019s care and that the doctor wanted her off her feet. On Monday night, Jones told Lake that she \u201cdidn\u2019t really want to go into what was going on, but it was a major issue and [she] was waiting on some test results and a couple other things before [she] could return to work.\u201d At Lake\u2019s request, Jones called Staples and told him \u201cit was a medical issue, that [she] could provide documentation, and that [she] would definitely be out that week, that [she] would keep them apprised of the situation, and that [she] was hoping to be back the next week but [she] wasn\u2019t sure, to go ahead and prepare that [Jones] wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">Jones did not work on Tuesday, April 18, 2006. Jones called Staples and told him she was waiting on test results from her doctor. Staples \u201casked numerous times [for Jones] to come in\u201d to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">Jones did not work on Wednesday, April 19, 2006. Staples called Jones. Jones told Staples she could not come in, that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>situation had not changed and that she was \u201choping to be back the next week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Jones did not work on Thursday, April 20, 2006. She did not call in because nothing had changed. She did not provide Flying J with a doctor\u2019s note about her five missed days of work. On Friday, April 21, 2006, Staples called Jones and told her \u201cthat due to [Jones\u2019s] excessive absences, [she] was being terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Jones acknowledged she had received an employee manual and knew Flying J had a written policy for being paid sick leave by filling out an application. Jones \u201cwasn\u2019t really concerned with it, because [she] wasn\u2019t planning on being out that long.\u201d Jones was aware Flying J allowed employees to take maternity leave and leave for issues relating to pregnancy, but she did not want anyone to know about her pregnancy at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Keith Staples, the interim general manager who fired plaintiff Jones, denied knowing Jones had complained about sexual harassment. Staples knew Butch Jacobs was fired. Staples filled out Jacobs\u2019s termination form, which stated Jacobs was terminated for \u201c[m]isrepresentation during investigation.\u201d Staples had no information about the Jacobs investigation and did not participate in the investigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Staples testified he did not learn Jones had a medical condition until after he fired Jones. Between April 14 and April 21, 2006, Staples \u201cwas calling [Jones,] asking what was going on, and [Staples] wasn\u2019t getting any information.\u201d Their conversations were \u201cpretty adversarial.\u201d Staples told Jones that he \u201cwas trying to run a business\u201d and \u201cneeded to know what was going on and when she was coming back to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">On April 20, 2006 Staples called Flying J\u2019s Human Resources director Jerry Beck-man and told Beckman that Jones was not reporting to work, that Staples was concerned, and that Staples needed Beck-man\u2019s advice. The next day, Jones did not report to work and Staples had not heard from her. Staples- fired Jones and called her at home to tell her.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">Jones\u2019s counsel showed Staples his deposition, in which Staples stated he consulted with the human resources director Beck-man and with corporate counsel Lowrey in deciding to fire Jones. Staples clarified that he meant that he called Beckman and assumed that Beckman would talk with Lowrey or the legal department. In his deposition too, Staples denied knowing about Jones\u2019s sexual harassment allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">Corporate counsel Lowrey testified that when she received the March 30, 2006 letter from Jones\u2019s attorney, Lowrey sent the letter to Chris Bone, a manager in the company\u2019s human resources department, so that Bone could investigate Jones\u2019s allegations. After an investigation, Lowrey wrote Jones\u2019s attorney that Jacobs was terminated and that Jones should notify Flying J\u2019s corporate human resources department immediately if Jones had any other problems at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">Lowrey never contacted Staples or anyone else at the travel plaza about Jones\u2019s sexual harassment allegation because the investigation was human resources\u2019 responsibility. Lowrey did not talk to Staples or consult with him in any way before he fired plaintiff Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">Chris Bone, the human resources manager, testified that, after investigation, he concluded Jacobs should be fired and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>structed Lake to do so. Bone never discussed the investigation with either Staples or Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">To make out a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff \u201cmust show that: (1) he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered a materially adverse action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Howard v. Walgreen Co., </em>605 F.3d 1239, 1244 (11th Cir.2010); <em>accord Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir.2007). There is no dispute that Jones has established the first two elements \u2014 her sexual harassment complaints were statutorily protected activity, and her firing was a materially adverse employment action. The only issue is whether Jones produced evidence from which a reasonable jury could find a causal connection existed between her sexual harassment complaints and her firing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">To establish the causal connection element of the prima facie case, a plaintiff must show only \u201cthat the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>Goldsmith v. City of Atmore, </em>996 F.2d 1155, 1163 (11th Cir.1993) (quotation marks omitted). To do so, \u201cthe plaintiff must generally show that the decision maker was aware of the protected conduct at the time of the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir.2000). The decision maker\u2019s awareness can be established by circumstantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Although close temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse employment action is ordinarily enough circumstantial evidence to permit a jury to find the causal connection element met, \u201ctemporal proximity alone is insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to causal connection where there is unrebutted evidence that the decision maker did not have knowledge that the employee engaged in protected conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Clover v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., </em>176 F.3d 1346, 1355-56 (11th Cir.1999)). The plaintiff must present more than \u201cmere curious timing coupled with speculative theories.\u201d <em>Raney v. Vinson Guard Serv., Inc., </em>120 F.3d 1192, 1197 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Here, Jones was fired 22 days after her first sexual harassment complaint and only 1 day after her second. Thus, she has shown close temporal proximity between her protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>See, e.g., Donnellon v. Fruehauf Corp., </em>794 F.2d 598, 601 (11th Cir.1986). But the decision maker, interim general manager Staples, repeatedly denied knowing at the time he fired Jones that Jones had complained of sexual harassment. Further, the other Flying J employees who did know about Jones\u2019s sexual harassment claims \u2014 corporate counsel Lowrey, who received the complaints, and human resources manager Bone, who investigated them \u2014 denied telling Staples about them. Staples\u2019s denials stand unrebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Jones points to Staples\u2019s deposition testimony that (1) Staples decided to fire Jones \u201cin consultation with\u201d both Beckman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>(human resources) and Lowrey, and (2) Staples discussed \u201cthe situation with Milissa [Jones]\u201d with Lowrey, Lake, and Beck-man before Staples fired Jones. Given the context, there is no reasonable basis for inferring that this comment referred to Jones\u2019s sexual harassment complaints rather than her absences from work. In fact, Staples\u2019s follow-up statement \u201cI mean I may have told them what I was doing\u201d strongly suggests that Staples\u2019s comment refers to Jones\u2019s absences and Staples\u2019s response to them. Moreover, human resources director Beckman testified that he and Staples spoke the day before Staples fired Jones, and they discussed Jones\u2019s failure to report to work.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Finally, we recognize Staples filled out Jacobs\u2019s termination form \u2014 which stated Jacobs was terminated for \u201cMisrepresentation during investigation.\u201d While this shows Staples was aware of the fact of an investigation, it does not raise a reasonable inference that Staples knew that the investigation involved sexual harassment by Jacobs or that Jones had prompted the investigation. <em>See Clover, </em>176 F.3d at 1354-55 (concluding plaintiffs evidence that manager who fired plaintiff knew his friend and subordinate was being investigated by the company was insufficient for reasonable jury to find manager was aware that plaintiff participated in the investigation). And the fact that Staples spoke regularly with Lake, who was aware of the details of the investigation at the travel plaza, is not sufficient either. <em>See id. </em>at 1355 (stating that the \u201cfact that the vice-president who heads a corporate division and the vice-president in charge of Human Resources talk regularly is not surprising, nor is it enough to support a reasonable inference that they discussed a specific topic, much less an inference concerning what they said about it,\u201d for \u201c \u2018could have told\u2019 is not the same as \u2018did tell\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">In conclusion, Jones did not establish the causation element of the prima facie case as to her retaliation claim, and the district court did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law to Flying J.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-11\">. <em>Faragher v.

In this letter, Jones offered to resign in exchange for six months\u2019 salary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b319-9\">.

Jones\u2019s reliance on <em>Goldsmith, </em>996 F.2d 1155, is misplaced. In <em>Goldsmith, </em>the city mayor who decided on the adverse employment action (plaintiff's transfer) and the city councilman to whom plaintiff had brought her complaint of sexual discrimination admittedly met in the time frame between plaintiff\u2019s complaint and her transfer but denied talking about the plaintiff. 996 F.2d at 1163 &amp; n. 12.
