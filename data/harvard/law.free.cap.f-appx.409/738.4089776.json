He filed suit against the Government in federal district court, seeking a refund of all federal taxes that Dell withheld from his pay ($27,929 in income tax and $8,104 in FICA tax). He contends that the \u201cunprivileged private-sector remuneration\u201d that he received from Dell does not constitute taxable wages. He also sought an injunction enjoining the Government from \u201cfuture abuse\u201d and an unspecified amount of money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-20\">The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction because Montero had not satisfied the jurisdictional prerequisites for filing a tax refund suit in federal court (payment of assessed tax liability in full and timely filing of an administrative claim for a refund with the Internal Revenue Service). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(1); 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); <em>Flora v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 145, 177, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960). Montero argues that these jurisdictional prerequisites apply only to \u201ctaxpayers\u201d and, therefore, do not apply to him because he is a \u201cnon-taxpayer.\u201d These arguments are patently frivolous and devoid of any merit whatsoever. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is in all respects AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-21\">Montero\u2019s \u201cMotion to Improve Legibility of Currently Illegible Portions of the Record on Appeal\u201d is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-22\">The Government\u2019s motion for a lump-sum sanction of $8,000, in lieu of calculating the costs and attorney\u2019s fees it incurred in responding to Montero\u2019s frivolous appeal, is GRANTED. This court has approved similar awards in similar cases because it \u201csaves the government the additional cost of calculating its expenses, and also saves the court the time and expense of reviewing the submission of costs.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number><em>Parker v.
