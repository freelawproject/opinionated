No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">On appeal, Andrews argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict because the government produced insufficient evidence of his guilt. He contends that the audio and video recordings did not clearly show a drug transaction and that the confidential informants were not credible. We review \u201cthe sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1269 (11th Cir.2005). We draw all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the government and the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">To support a conviction for possession of drugs with intent to distribute under section 841(a)(1), the government had to prove (1) knowledge of possession; (2) possession of a controlled substance; and (3) intent to distribute. <em>United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2008). All three elements may be proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1391-92 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Here, evidence showed that police officers began investigating Andrews after receiving several complaints that Andrews was selling drugs in a certain area of Jackson, Georgia. Officers used two confidential informants to make two controlled buys from Andrews. Andrews met with only one of the informants to complete both drug sales because he did not know the other informant. After each sale, the informant reported back to the officers with the drugs he had purchased. An audio recording of the first transaction and a video recording of the second transaction were played to the jury. Both informants and the investigating officers testified consistently about the drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Based on this evidence (and drawing all reasonable inferences in the government\u2019s favor), we conclude that sufficient evidence supports Andrews\u2019s conviction. Testimony about the two controlled drug buys \u2014 along with the audio and video evidence documenting these buys \u2014 showed that Andrews possessed and distributed the drugs. While Andrews points out that the video and audio transmissions did not completely capture both transactions, the witnesses\u2019 testimony provided sufficient evidence of the transactions without the video and audio recordings; and the testimony also explained what may have been unclear in the recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Andrews also challenges the credibility of the informants. But we are \u201cbound by the jury\u2019s credibility determinations and by the jury\u2019s rejection of the inferences raised by the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>433 F.3d 1328, 1334 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). And here, the jury had full knowledge of the informants\u2019 criminal histories and of the benefits they received for cooperating with the investigation. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to find Andrews guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>473 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that \u201c[i]t is not enough for a defendant to put forth a reasonable hypothesis of innocence, because the issue is not whether a jury reasonably could have acquitted but whether it reasonably could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">Andrews also argues that the district court abused its discretion in not granting his motion for a mistrial; the motion was based on witness testimony that Andrews earlier had served time in federal prison. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>30 F.3d 1407, 1410 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">On cross-examination, one of the informants testified about his telephone conversation with Andrews.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The informant noted that Andrews explained to him that he was trying to be careful about his drug transactions and that Andrews told him Andrews was \u201cwatching out for the FBI because he had been in the fed before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We conclude that the district court abused no discretion in denying Andrews\u2019s motion for a mistrial. The comment about Andrews\u2019s prior time in federal prison was isolated, inadvertent, and vague. The comment provided no information about prior crimes by Andrews. We generally uphold a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial where, as here, the comments presented to the jury were \u201cspontaneous and singular.\u201d <em>United States v. Funt, </em>896 F.2d 1288, 1295 n. 5 (11th Cir.1990). Furthermore, as discussed above, the government produced other significant evidence of Andrews\u2019s guilt; and we cannot say that the comment had a substantial impact on the government\u2019s verdict. Improper and prejudicial testimony \u201cis less likely to mandate a mistrial when there is other significant evidence of guilt which reduces the likelihood that the otherwise improper testimony had a substantial impact\u201d on the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Rouco, </em>765 F.2d 983, 992 (11th Cir.1985) (internal quotation and citation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\">. The audio recording of this conversation only recorded the informant's side of the conversation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-10\">. Andrews faults the district court for not <em>sua sponte </em>issuing a curative instruction about the comment. But the decision not to give a curative instruction was within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>782 F.2d 908, 916 (11th Cir.1986); <em>see also Willis v. Kemp, </em>838 F.2d 1510, 1519 n. 19 (11th Cir.1988) (the court is not required to give a <em>sua sponte </em>curative instruction every time the jury hears improper evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
