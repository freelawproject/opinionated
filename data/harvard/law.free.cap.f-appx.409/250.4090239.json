No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-20\">Castillo was charged, in pertinent part, with possessing illegally (1) an unregistered short-barreled rifle not identified by a serial number and (2) a machine gun receiver. Castillo\u2019s parole officer discovered these items and other firearms in the downstairs bedroom of Castillo\u2019s residence, where Castillo lived with his mother. Castillo maintained that the items were not his and that they belonged to his friend who had been staying in the downstairs bedroom. Castillo claimed that he had moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>from the downstairs bedroom to an upstairs bedroom so that the friend could use the downstairs bedroom. But Castillo\u2019s friend had left a few days before the police search, and Castillo had later been unable to reach him.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The investigation into Castillo\u2019s unlawful gun possession stemmed from an alert law enforcement officers received about Castillo\u2019s MySpace web page. The officers were alerted by the mother of Castillo\u2019s ex-wife. The web page showed a photograph of Castillo wearing a ski mask, holding an assault rifle, and displaying his middle finger. The web page also contained statements, containing expletives and threats, directed at Castillo\u2019s ex-wife and her family. The district court admitted the web page evidence at trial, concluding that the web page was probative of Castillo\u2019s possession of the guns in the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">On appeal, Castillo argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting the web page into evidence because, under Fed.R.Evid. 403, the evidence was unduly prejudicial and tended to inflame the jury. We review a district court\u2019s decision of whether to exclude evidence under Rule 403 for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1284 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Rule 403 provides that, \u201c[although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d In interpreting Rule 403, we \u201clook at the evidence in a light most favorable to its admission, maximizing its probative value and minimizing its undue prejudicial impact.\u201d <em>Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d at 1284; <em>see also United States v. Church, </em>955 F.2d 688, 703 (11th Cir.1992) (describing Rule 403 as having a \u201cstrong presumption in favor of admissibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">We agree with the district court that the web page was probative of Castillo\u2019s possession of the illegal firearms. One of Castillo\u2019s defenses was that the firearms found at his residence had belonged to someone else and that Castillo had not possessed them. The web page picture indicated that Castillo knowingly possessed the assault rifle in the photograph. Castillo\u2019s knowing possession of the AR-15 rifle stored (along with the charged illegal firearm) at his residence tended to make his possession of the illegal firearms \u2014 a fact of consequence \u2014 more probable than it would be without the evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401. So, the web page was probative of the issue at trial: whether Castillo knowingly possessed the illegal firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The web page contained prejudicial contents, including Castillo making an obscene gesture, profanity, insults, and possible threats directed toward Castillo\u2019s ex-wife and her family. While Castillo argues that the issue of domestic abuse likely inflamed the jury, the court explained to the jury that it was not trying a case that involved domestic violence and that such an issue did not bear on the issue the jury had to decide in Castillo\u2019s case. The district court, thus, directed the jury towards the evidence\u2019s probative value and away from its prejudicial aspects: and the court was in the best position to evaluate the evidence\u2019s value. <em>See Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d at 1285 (explaining that \u201cthe district court is uniquely situated to make nuanced judgments on questions that require the care<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>ful balancing of fact-specific concepts like probativeness and prejudice\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In maximizing the probative value of the MySpace web page and minimizing its prejudicial impact, the danger of undue prejudice did not outweigh substantially the web page\u2019s probative value. We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Castillo also argues that the district court abused its discretion by allowing the government to present rebuttal evidence on a matter that was raised by the government on cross-examination of Castillo, but not on his direct-examination. The rebuttal evidence was in this form: the testimony of a law enforcement officer about a phone call made by Castillo to his mother while he was incarcerated and the transcript of the recorded telephone conversation. In the conversation, Castillo tells his mother (in a coded language) to erase photographs from a computer. The photographs included a photograph of a pistol. \u2018We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d 779, 783 (11th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Gold, </em>743 F.2d 800, 818 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cthe decision to permit rebuttal testimony is one that resides in the sound discretion of the trial judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The district court abused no discretion in allowing the government to present rebuttal evidence about Castillo\u2019s telephone conversation. Castillo admitted, on the government\u2019s cross-examination of him, that he spoke to his mother on the telephone while he was incarcerated. But he denied telling her to get rid of photographs on the family\u2019s computer that depicted him with firearms. Thus, the transcript of the conversation contradicted Castillo\u2019s testimony during cross-examination. Although Castillo\u2019s statement was made during cross-examination, instead of during his direct testimony, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence. <em>See id. </em>(concluding that a district court abused no discretion in allowing rebuttal evidence that contradicted a statement that defendant made on cross-examination, even though the evidence did not rebut anything defendant had presented in her defense); <em>see also United States v. Delk, </em>586 F.2d 513, 516 (5th Cir.1978) (\u201cthe purpose of rebuttal testimony is to explain, repel, counteract, or disprove the evidence of the [ajdverse party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">. The gun in the MySpace web page photograph appeared to be an AR-15 assault rifle. An AR-15-style rifle matching the rifle pictured in the photograph was discovered among the illegal firearms in Castillo\u2019s residence. Possession of the AR-15 rifle was not charged in the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\">. Castillo argues that the government, during its closing argument, directed the jury\u2019s attention to prejudicial aspects of the evidence. But the government\u2019s comment during closing argument did not bear on the district court's pretrial Rule 403 ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
