We remanded for re-sentencing, and the district court reimposed the same sentence after taking evidence showing that Gonzalez-Molina had previously been convicted of a \u201ccrime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>violence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Molina, </em>353 Fed.Appx. 959, 960 (5th Cir.2009). Gonzalez-Molina appeals again.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Gonzalez-Molina now asserts, for the first time, that his case should be remanded yet again so that the district court can resentence him in light of a recent guidelines amendment that took effect on November 1, 2010, after his resentencing and after briefing was completed. Amendment 742 eliminated criminal history points based on \u201crecency,\u201d that is, the temporal proximity of the offense of conviction to a prior term of imprisonment. See United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>Supp. to Appendix C, Amendment 742, pp. 354-56 (Nov. 1, 2010) (amending \u00a7 4Al.l(e)). Amendment 742 is not retroactive because it is not listed as a retroactive amendment in \u00a7 lB1.10(e). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a) &amp; (c), p.s.; <em>United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 218 (5th Cir.1996). Gonzalez-Molina contends that the district court should be allowed on remand to reconsider its application of the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in light of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s decision to eliminate recency points. The gravamen of his contention is that his sentence is unreasonable in light of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s \u201cchange of position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Although the Sentencing Commission\u2019s reasoning was not available to support a challenge to the recency point at Gonzalez-Molina\u2019s original sentencing or on the first appeal, such a challenge could have been made pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a) and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), which held that a court may vary from the advisory guidelines range based on policy considerations or disagreements with the Guidelines. Because Gonzalez-Molina failed to raise this issue in his two sentencing proceedings or his prior appeal, his claim is barred by the mandate rule. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>470 F.3d 200, 205 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Marmolejo, </em>139 F.3d 528, 531 (5th Cir.1998). In addition, a substantive guidelines amendment that takes effect after sentencing \u201cmay not be considered on direct appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Huff, </em>370 F.3d 454, 466 (5th Cir.2004). As Gonzalez-Molina raises no cognizable challenge to the district court\u2019s judgment on resentencing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b777-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
