Cabeen first contends the district court erred by dismissing his claims predating 27 May 2006, as time barred, because he was entitled to equitable tolling while hospitalized from 8 February 2007 until 14 April 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"AkZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>The dismissal of Cabeen\u2019s action, pursuant to both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii), is reviewed <em>de novo. See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii); <em>Moore v. Carwell, </em>168 F.3d 234, 236 (5th Cir.1999) (reviewing dismissals under \u00a7 1915(i) and (ii) <em>de novo, </em>the same standard used to review dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)). In a \u00a7 1983 action, applied are the forum state\u2019s personal-injury limitations period, <em>Jacobsen v. Osborne, </em>133 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir.1998), as well as its equitable-tolling provisions, <em>Walker v. Epps, </em>550 F.3d 407, 415 (5th Cir.2008). In Texas, the personal-injury period is two years; that period is tolled for legally disabled individuals who, at the time the action accrues, are of \u201cunsound mind\u201d or \u201cyounger than 18 years of age.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 16.003(a), 16.001(a),(b).</p>\n<p id=\"A06\">In regard to tolling, Cabeen asserts he was <em>medically </em>incapacitated during his hospitalization, not <em>mentally </em>incapacitated or of unsound mind. Even if Cabeen could show he was of unsound mind during his hospitalization, his disability arose after the limitations period accrued, and does not toll the period for claims predating 27 May 2006. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 16.001(d). Cabeen has failed to produce Texas authority applying tolling principles in his circumstances. <em>E.g., Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 394, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007) (forgoing discussion of state tolling principles in \u00a7 1983 action where prisoner failed to bring to court\u2019s attention similar state cases in which equitable tolling had been applied); <em>cf. Rotella v. Pederson, </em>144 F.3d 892, 897 (5th Cir.1998) (applying Texas equitable tolling principles in \u00a7 1983 action brought by Texas prisoner). Because the complaint was filed on 27 May 2008, and the limitations period was not tolled, the court did not err in determining Cabeen\u2019s claims predating 27 May 2006 were time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"AZU\">The court also did not err in dismissing Cabeen\u2019s following, non-time-barred claims. Along that line, he contends jail officials were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs by not taking him to his neurological appointments. To establish deliberate indifference in the Eighth Amendment context, an inmate must show defendants: were aware of facts from which an inference of an excessive risk to an inmate\u2019s health or safety could be drawn; and, made such inference. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Accordingly, a jail official acts with deliberate indifference \u201conly if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Cabeen fails to allege his eyesight deteriorated because of missed appointments and, therefore, has not shown these appointments constituted a \u201csubstantial risk of serious harm\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGD\">Cabeen also contends he suffered a seizure due to contraindicated medications. He does not assert, however, defendants knew it was inadvisable for him to take the medications. Accordingly, he has failed to show defendants were aware the medications posed a risk to his health and safety. <em>See id. </em>at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"AvI\">In addition, Cabeen maintains jail officials verbally harassed him; however, verbal abuse, threatening language, and gestures do not constitute a constitutional violation. <em>See Bender v. Brumley, </em>1 F.3d 271, 274 n. 4 (5th Cir.1993). Similarly, Cabeen\u2019s assertion that he was strip searched by a jail official is unavailing because he does not claim a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"ArD\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b803-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
