The district court enhanced Graves\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 based on his prior Texas conviction of delivery of a controlled substance, which it classified as a controlled substance offense. This court granted Graves a COA on the issue whether his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise before this court the fact of its decision in <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712 (5th Cir.2007), which was decided while Graves\u2019s direct appeal was pending, concerning this classification of his prior delivery of a controlled substance conviction as a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Because counsel did not object concerning this classification at sentencing, review on direct appeal would have been limited to plain error. <em>See Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d at 714. To show plain error, an appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 129 S.Ct. 1428, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Under the law at the time that Graves\u2019s appeal was decided, his prior conviction of delivery of a controlled substance would not have constituted a controlled substance offense under \u00a7 4B1.1 unless the charging documents or jury instructions revealed that the offense did not involve a mere offer to sell. <em>See Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d at 714-16; <em>see also United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 717 n. 2 (5th Cir.2007) (noting that the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) that was considered in <em>Gonzales </em>and the definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) for \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement are nearly identical and may be treated as identical for purposes of determining whether an offense meets either definition).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Although <em>Gonzales </em>was not decided until Graves\u2019s appeal was pending, any error under <em>Gonzales </em>still satisfied the \u201cclear or obvious\u201d prong of the plain error test because \u201cit is enough that the error be plain at the time of appellate consideration.\u201d <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 275 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Furthermore, <em>Gonzales </em>itself was decided under the plain error review standard, and relief was granted to the defendant. 484 F.3d at 714, 716 (\u201c[W]e review for plain error since [Gonzales] did not properly preserve his argument below.....[T]he district court erred when it concluded that Gonzales\u2019s prior conviction was for a drug-trafficking offense[, and] this error is plain since Garza-Lopez<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> makes it clear that offering to sell a controlled substance does not constitute a drug-trafficking offense.\u201d). Nothing in the record indicates that the necessary documents were presented to the district court, and the district court\u2019s apparent reliance on the presentence report alone in classifying Graves\u2019s prior conviction of delivery of a controlled substance as a controlled substance offense under \u00a7 4B1.1 constituted error that was clear or obvious. <em>See id </em>at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">Because the 151- to 188-month guidelines range that Graves would have been subject to without the career offender enhancement was significantly lower than the below-guidelines 216-month sentence that the district court imposed, Graves would have satisfied the third prong of the plain-error test. <em>See Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d at 716 (concluding that Gonzales met his burden on proving that the error affected his substantial rights by showing that the correctly calculated guidelines range was \u201csignificantly lower\u201d than the sentence he received). As to the final prong, any such sentencing error seriously affected \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d because it \u201cclearly affected\u201d Graves\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Indeed, the Government here makes no ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>fort to argue that the error was harmless and, instead, concedes that Graves\u2019s sentence should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Because such a plain error argument would have constituted a solid, meritorious argument based on directly controlling precedent and because counsel\u2019s filing of a motion to withdraw rather than an appellate brief concerning this issue cannot be the result of any conceivable strategic decision, counsel acted deficiently in failing to raise this issue on appeal or to at least notify this court of the <em>Gonzales </em>decision after he had filed his <em>Anders </em>brief. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Graves has shown that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue on appeal because there is a reasonable probability that the result of his appeal would have been different if the issue had been raised. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court denying Graves\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, and we remand this case to the district court for an order granting Graves\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and ordering a vacatur of his sentence and re-sentencing not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b806-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
