Specifically, Coates alleged that CGTC violated her First Amendment rights by expelling her from the College on September 5 or 6, 2007,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in retaliation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>for protected speech she made in a class. Coates mentioned in her complaint that she was also bringing an equal protection claim, but did not describe how or why the Defendants violated her equal protection rights. Coates further alleged that the Defendants violated her substantive and procedural due process rights by denying her request for a hearing. Finally, Coates alleged several state law claims, including that 1) the Defendants tortiously interfered with a contract she had entered into with the Workforce Investment Act (\u201cAVIA\u201d), in which AVIA agreed to pay $6,000 per year toward her schooling at CGTC; and 2) the Defendants breached the written policy in CGTC\u2019s student handbook by failing to provide her with a hearing so that she could challenge her expulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The district court dismissed all of Coates\u2019s claims for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Specifically, the district court dismissed Coates\u2019s First Amendment and equal protection claims as being barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The court additionally found that Coates failed to state a procedural or substantive due process claim. Finally, the district court ruled that Coates\u2019s state law claims were barred by sovereign immunity and that she otherwise failed to state a contract-based claim. Based on this record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">First, Coates\u2019s First Amendment claim accrued when she learned of the Defendants\u2019 decision to expel her, and because she filed her complaint more than two years after this date, the district court did not err in determining that Coates\u2019s First Amendment claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Second, Coates\u2019s conclusory statement that her equal protection rights were violated was not sufficient to state a claim for relief as she failed to allege that similarly situated persons had been treated disparately by the Defendants or that the Defendants were motivated in denying her a hearing by an unlawful factor. <em>See Draper v. Reynolds, </em>369 F.3d 1270, 1278 n. 14 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that to state an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must allege that \u201cthrough state action, similarly situated persons have been treated disparately\u201d and allege that the defendants\u2019 actions were motivated by an unlawful factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Third, Coates\u2019s procedural due process claim failed to state a claim because Coates failed to avail herself of available state procedures \u2014 namely, a writ of mandamus issued by a state court. <em>Cotton v. Jackson, </em>216 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir.2000). Coates\u2019s substantive due process claim fails because she failed to identify any fundamental rights that were violated by her expulsion from CGTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Finally, we find no merit to Coates\u2019 arguments pertaining to her state based claims. The district court did not err in dismissing Coates\u2019s contract claim based on the termination procedures in CGTC\u2019s student handbook because the handbook did not entitle Coates to a hearing after her expulsion unless she followed certain procedures, which were not followed. The district court did not err in dismissing Coates\u2019s tortious-interferencewith-contract claim because the Defendants were not strangers to the contract with which they allegedly interfered, and thus, they could not be liable under such a theory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Coates\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-22\">. Coates\u2019s amended complaint alleged that she was expelled on September 5, 2007, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the expulsion letter attached to her amended complaint was dated September 6, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-11\">. Because of our resolution of Coates\u2019 state law claims, we need not reach the question of whether the state's voluntary removal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>action to federal court waives sovereign immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
