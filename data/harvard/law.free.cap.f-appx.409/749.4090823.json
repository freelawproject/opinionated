His resulting offense level, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>and 110-months sentence of imprisonment, were based, in part, on his prior Texas conviction for evading arrest with a motor vehicle, in violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 38.04, being classified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d, pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), 4B1.2(a)(2). Banks claims plain error concerning that erime-of violence ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">As Banks concedes, he did not object to the offense level in district court; therefore, this contention is reviewed only for plain error. <em>Kg., Puckett v. United </em>States, --- U.S. ---, ---, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). For reversible plain error, Banks must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>If Banks makes such a showing, we have discretion to correct the error and, generally, will do so if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Banks maintains the crime does not meet the relevant definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it could theoretically be committed without presenting \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d, as required by Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). This contention is foreclosed, however, by <em>United States v. Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d 531, 536-37 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 130 S.Ct. 1015, 175 L.Ed.2d 621 (2009), which held the same Texas offense (evading arrest with a motor vehicle) was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The residual clauses (\u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d) in the definitions of \u201cviolent felony\u201d, under the ACCA, and \u201ccrime of violence\u201d, under Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), are identical. <em>United States v. Mohr, </em>554 F.3d 604, 609 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 130 S.Ct. 56, 175 L.Ed.2d 45 (2009). <em>Harrimon </em>held evading arrest with a motor vehicle is \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d and \u201cinvolves a serious potential risk of physical injury to others\u201d. 568 F.3d at 534, 537. Accordingly, the district court did not err by treating Banks\u2019 prior conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <em>See United States v. Mendoza, </em>397 Fed.Appx. 941, 941-42 (5th Cir.2010) (holding contention, that Texas conviction for evading arrest with a motor vehicle is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2, is foreclosed by <em>Harrimon </em>); <em>United States v. Petersen, </em>383 Fed.Appx. 458, 459 (5th Cir.2010), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(21 Sep. 2010) (No. 10-6667) (also holding, as defendant there conceded, such contention is foreclosed by <em>Harrimon </em>).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b775-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
