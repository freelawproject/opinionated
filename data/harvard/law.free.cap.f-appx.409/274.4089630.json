Lee titled his initial motion a \u201cMotion to Request for Injunctive Relief Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,\u201d and named the United States Probation Office, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d), and BOP Director Harley G. Lappin as defendants. In light of this title, the motion was first docketed as a civil motion, but was later reclassified as criminal. The district court denied this motion on February 22, 2010, and Lee filed a Notice of Appeal on April 14, 2010.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-17\">We begin with Lee\u2019s contention that we should strike the government\u2019s opening brief because the government obtained a seven-day extension to file its brief through fraud. The time prescribed by an order to perform any act, other than the filing of a notice of appeal, may be extended for good cause, even after that time has expired. Fed. R.App. P. 26(b). Also, we may act on a motion under Rule 26(b) without waiting for a response from the nonmoving party. Fed. R.App. P. 27(b). A party adversely affected by the grant of an extension may only challenge that grant by filing a motion to reconsider, vacate, or modify that action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-18\">Here, the government requested additional time after experiencing difficulty locating documents from Lee\u2019s record that it deemed necessary for appeal. In his reply brief, Lee argues that this request was made in bad faith. Because Lee did not challenge our decision to grant this exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>sion in a separate motion pursuant to Rule 27(b), however, we are unable to entertain it. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 27(b) (\u201cTimely opposition filed after the motion is granted in whole or in part does not constitute a request to reconsider, vacate, or modify the [extension of time]; a motion requesting that relief <em>must be filed.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). For this reason, we DENY Lee\u2019s request to strike the government\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We turn next to Lee\u2019s underlying motions. The government argues that we lack jurisdiction over Lee\u2019s appeal because it was not timely filed. Specifically, the government points out that Lee filed his Notice of Appeal on April 14, 2010, and contends this is well past both the 14-day appeal period provided in Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(l)(A)(i), and the extended time that we are authorized to provide in Rule 4(b). Lee argues, in response, that his motion was originally filed as a civil matter and was therefore subject to the longer window in which to appeal in a civil matter. Specifically, he argues that because the United States is a named party, under Rule 4(a)(1)(B) he is thus entitled to a 60-day window in which to file a Notice of Appeal. Lee filed his Notice of Appeal 51-days after the district court\u2019s Order, and as a result under this extended 60-day window, his Notice of Appeal would be timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u201cWe are required to examine our jurisdiction <em>sua sponte, </em>and we review jurisdictional issues <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Lopez, </em>562 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). Even though we have clarified that Fed. R.App. P. 4(b) is not jurisdictional, we must enforce it where the government timely challenges a defendant\u2019s Notice of Appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1314. Here, the government timely challenged Lee\u2019s Notice of Appeal, and therefore we must dismiss any aspect of it that is criminal in nature. To the extent that Lee seeks a civil remedy, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to consider his motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">But even to the extent that Lee\u2019s motion can be characterized as a civil action, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal because he has not pointed to any civil action that would entitle him to relief. Lee\u2019s first motion sought relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Section 1983 is improper, however, because Lee sued only federal actors. <em>See Hartman v. Moore, </em>547 U.S. 250, 254 n. 2, 126 S.Ct. 1695, 1700 n. 2, 164 L.Ed.2d 441 (2006). Nonetheless, because federal courts have \u201can obligation to look behind the label of a motion filed by a <em>pro se </em>inmate and determine whether the motion is, in effect, cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework,\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990) (citation omitted), we must consider whether Lee would be entitled to relief if we recharacterize his motion as one brought pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Lee cannot succeed on a <em>Bivens </em>theory. He seeks a revision to his PSI, which this Court can effect only by ordering the Probation Office to prepare an amended PSI. However, <em>Bivens </em>does not provide a remedy against federal agencies, <em>F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 486, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1005-06, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994), and therefore Lee cannot rely on <em>Bivens </em>to obtain relief against either the Federal Bureau of Prisons or the United States Probation Office of the Southern District of Florida. As a result, even if we recharacterize his motion as one brought under Bivens, <em>he is still unable to obtain relief.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Al1\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-13\">. We will presume that Lee filed his notice of appeal on the day he signed it because, as the government concedes, there is no evidence to the contrary. <em>Washington v. United States, 243 F.3d </em>1299, 1301 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-17\">. In rejecting this action, of course, we do not rule that Lee may never obtain relief. As the government concedes, Lee may in theory be able to raise these claims in a separate 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 that is currently on remand to the district court. We express no opinion as to the merits of that proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b303-26\">. Lee also argues that the district judge abused his discretion in denying Lee\u2019s motion for recusal. Lee has not appealed this order, however, and we therefore will not consider this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
