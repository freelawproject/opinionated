We lack jurisdiction to review the June 30 removal order \u2014 because Petitioner did not petition the BIA for reconsideration within 30 days of the issuance of that removal order \u2014 and therefore dismiss the instant petition for review to the extent that it implicitly seeks review of that removal order. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1); <em>see also Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201c[sjince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d). The instant petition is timely as it relates to the December 30 order, however; hence, we have jurisdiction to review it. We do so under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-22\">A motion for reconsideration, such as the one Petitioner presented the BIA in this case, \u201cshall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). A motion to reconsider that merely restates the arguments that the BIA previously rejected provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>no reason for the BIA to change its prior decision. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329. \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or lav/ as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d Id (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">In his motion for reconsideration, Petitioner failed to identify any errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s June 30 removal decision. Instead, he reiterated arguments that he had previously presented to the BIA. Given that these arguments did not address errors of law or fact in the June 30 decision, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
