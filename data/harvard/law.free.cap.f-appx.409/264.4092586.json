After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l)-(2). Starks\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is based on Amendment 706 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to most crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Here, the district court denied Starks\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion after concluding that Amendment 706 was inapplicable to Starks. The district court based this conclusion on the erroneous belief that Starks\u2019s offense involved powder cocaine, not crack cocaine. In fact, a jury convicted Starks of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute both powder and crack cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The district court\u2019s error appears to stem from the fact that the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) converted the crack cocaine quantities into powder cocaine equivalents (using a 100 to 1 ratio) to calculate Starks\u2019s guidelines range. At sentencing, the district court found that Starks was directly involved with over 10,-400 kilograms of powder cocaine based on trial testimony from a co-conspirator to whom Starks had distributed a total of 104 kilograms of crack cocaine. Although the district court\u2019s basis for denying Starks\u2019s \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion was error, that error was harmless because, even though Amendment 706 applied to Starks\u2019s crack cocaine offense, the district court nonetheless lacked authority to modify Starks\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">At Starks\u2019s sentencing, the district court assigned Starks a base offense level of 42 based on the Drug Quantity Table. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (1991) (providing for an offense level of 42 for a drug quantity of \u201c1500 KG or more\u201d of powder cocaine or \u201c15 KG or more\u201d of crack cocaine). However, after offense level adjustments for his leadership role (four levels) and obstruction of justice (two levels), Starks\u2019s total offense level was 48. Because then, as now, the highest offense level in the Sentencing Table is 43, the Sentencing Guidelines instructed that any offense level above 43 was treated as an offense level 43. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A, n. 2 (1991). With a criminal history category of II and a total offense level of 43, Starks\u2019s guidelines range was life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">After Amendment 706, Starks\u2019s applicable base offense level was lowered to level 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2009) (providing for a base offense level of 38 for an offense involving \u201c150 KG or more\u201d of powder cocaine or \u201c4.5 KG or more\u201d of crack cocaine). Leaving all of Starks\u2019s other guidelines calculations intact, his total offense level was lowered to 44, which is treated as level 43, and yields the same guidelines range of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table (2009). Because Starks\u2019s amended guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>lines range would be the same as his original guidelines range, the district court lacked the authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Starks\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (providing that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized if an amendment does not lower the applicable guidelines range); <em>see also United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Starks\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion also cited Amendment 591, which, in relevant part, amended the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2. Section 2D1.2 provides base offense levels for offenses occurring in protected locations or involving minors or pregnant individuals. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2. Amendment 591 clarified that \u00a7 2D1.2 applied only if the defendant is convicted of an offense \u201creferenced to\u201d \u00a7 2D1.2 and not upon a judicial finding that the defendant was involved in such conduct. U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 591; <em>see also United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We find no merit to Starks\u2019s argument that the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc) by failing to address explicitly whether Amendment 591 authorized a sentence reduction. We have never applied <em>Clisby </em>outside the habeas context. <em>See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 936 (barring the district court\u2019s piecemeal resolution of claims raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion). Furthermore, Amendment 591 is inapplicable because Starks\u2019s offense level was not calculated using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2. <em>See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1219. Thus, Amendment 591 provided no basis for reducing Starks\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-17\">. We \"review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Even if a district court errs during \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, we will affirm if the error is harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>United. States v. Jackson, </em>613 F.3d 1305, 1310 n. 7 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b291-9\">. Starks was the leader of a very large crack cocaine distribution ring in Montgomery, Alabama that purchased powder cocaine and converted it to crack cocaine for distribution in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Mississippi. In addition to his drug conspiracy conviction (count one), the jury found Starks guilty of structuring financial transactions to avoid reporting requirements (count three) and money laundering (counts four and five). Starks received a life sentence on count one, a concurrent 60-month sentence on count three and concurrent 240-month sentences on counts four and five.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">. To the extent Starks was attempting to challenge the district court\u2019s original sentencing determinations as to his relevant conduct, such claims are outside the scope of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that, with the exception of the particular guideline changed by the amendment, all original sentencing determinations remain unchanged).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
