California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Blanding has not filed a response. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b766-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-30\">. We note that while Blanding\u2019s plea agreement waives the right to collaterally attack his conviction or sentence, the district court informed Blanding that he waived the right to collaterally attack his sentence, omitting mention of the conviction. This omission has no effect on the instant appeal. We make no determination at this time of the significance of the omission with respect to any collateral challenge that Blanding might file.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
