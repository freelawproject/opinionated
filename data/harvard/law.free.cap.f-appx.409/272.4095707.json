He now appeals his sentences, arguing that his sentence are both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Appellant contends that the sentences are procedurally unreasonable because the district court improperly considered his prior arrests<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and failed to provide a \u201cmore significant justification\u201d for its upward variance from the prescribed Guidelines sentencing range. Appellant contends that his sentences are substantively unreasonable because (1) the district court overemphasized his criminal history without giving due weight to the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d thereby creating a \u201csubstantial disparity\u201d between his sentences and the those imposed in typical alien-smuggling cases; (2) the district court should not have considered specific deterrence and incapacitation as sentencing objectives given that this was appellant\u2019s first offense involving the smuggling of aliens; and (3) U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1, \u00a7 4A1.3, and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s relevant policy statements, all counseled against an upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Our \u201csubstantive review of sentences is deferential\u201d and \u201conly look[s] to see if the district court abused its discretion by committing a clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1165 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc). </em>Review for abuse of discretion applies to all sentences, even variances outside the Guidelines sentencing range. <em>Id. </em>at 1186 (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). The party who challenges a sentence, here the defendant, \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both the record and the factors in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Tate, </em>586 F.3d 936, 947 (11th Cir.2009) (alterations and citation removed).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">A sentence may be procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court (1) improperly calculates the guideline range, (2) treats the Guidelines as mandatory, (3) fails to consider the appropriate \u00a7 3553(a) factors, (4) selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or (5) fails to adequately explain the chosen sentence, including an explanation for any deviation from the guideline range. <em>Id. </em>In reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances and ... whether the sentence achieves the sentencing purposes stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009). A sentence may be substantively unreasonable where a district court \u201cunjustifiably relied on any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor, failed to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected the sentence arbitrarily, or based the sentence on impermissible factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the district court \u201cis permitted to attach great weight to one factor over others.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009) (citation and internal quotations omitted). Although the district court must provide \u201csufficiently compelling\u201d justifications to support a sentence that varies from the Guidelines sentencing range, we will not presume that a sentence outside the range is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Mateos, </em>623 F.3d 1350, 1366 (11th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>2010) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Finally, although \u201cthe district court is required \u2018to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1252 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6)), \u201c[a] well-founded claim of disparity ... assumes that apples are being compared to apples.\u201d <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1102 (11th Cir.2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Appellant\u2019s sentences are proeedurally reasonable because the district court properly calculated the Guidelines sentencing range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the appropriate \u00a7 3553(a) factors, adequately explained its reasons for the sentences, and did not err in considering appellant\u2019s prior arrests. Appellant\u2019s sentences are substantively reasonable because district court properly emphasized the \u00a7 3553(a) factors of \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant[,]\u201d the need for the sentence \u201cto promote respect for the law[,]\u201d and the need for the sentence \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct[.]\u201d Furthermore, Quezada\u2019s sentence did not create an unwarranted disparity among similarly-situated defendants, and the district court did not depart upward pursuant to the Guidelines, but varied upwards pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">. Appellant\u2019s prior arrests did not result in the filing of criminal charges against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
