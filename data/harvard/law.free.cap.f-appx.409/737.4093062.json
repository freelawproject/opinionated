He was sentenced to 66 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-23\">Anguino argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to ask potential jurors during voir dire about the possibility of ethnic bias. He argues that because Del Rio, Texas, is a border community, there is a reasonable probability of ethnic bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in conducting voir dire. The record reflects that the district court included questions that were sufficient \u201cto produce some basis for defense counsel to exercise a reasonably knowledgeable right of challenge.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>993 F.2d 1170, 1176 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-25\">The district court did not violate the Constitution when it declined to ask the questions proposed by Anguino. <em>See Rosales-Lopez v. United States, </em>451 U.S. 182, 189, 101 S.Ct. 1629, 68 L.Ed.2d 22 (1981). There was no racial or ethnic issue \u201cinextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial.\u201d <em>See Ristaino v. Ross, </em>424 U.S. 589, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>597, 96 S.Ct. 1017, 47 L.Ed.2d 258 (1976). Nor did the district court\u2019s decision run afoul of the rule set out as part of the Supreme Court\u2019s supervisory authority. <em>See Rosales-Lopez, </em>451 U.S. at 192, 101 S.Ct. 1629. Nothing in this record indicates a reasonable possibility that racial or ethnic prejudice affected the jury. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b763-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
