The bill is one which the plaintiff calls \u2018a bill for review to set aside a judgment.\u2019 It is signed by the complainant as solicitor <em>pro se. </em>It is not verified. It' has not even the common form of affidavit annexed. It prays to restrain the sheriff from selling, and to enjoin the defendant fim the ground of fraud and duress,\u2019 and that the judgment may be set aside, as without consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-4\">\u201cIt has been repeatedly held that to obtain an injunction, the statements of a bill which are relied upon as ground for granting the writ must be specifically verified. <em>Dick.
