There was no bill of exceptions' reserved to the ruling of the court refusing a continuance. That matter can not be revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-19\">Another ground of the motion is, that the court erred in permitting the defendant\u2019s wife to sit in the court room in front of and facing the daughter of the defendant while testifying. She was the\" prosecuting witness. It is urged these actions and conduct of his wife greatly influenced and probably controlled the testimony of the prosecuting witness, appellant\u2019s claim being that the prosecuting witness was persuaded to testify against the defendant- by undue influence of her mother, wife of defendant. There is no -hill of exception verifjring this matter, therefore we are unable to revise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-20\">Hor is there any reviewable matter presented by the allegation that appellant had discovered evidence since the trial that was unknown to him prior to the trial. There is in the record the affidavit of a party named Delee, which sets out that as an officer he had looked into the matter and that appellant had been arrested for an assault upon his wife, which -offense he had occasion to investigate, and found no truth in the accusation, and, of course, appellant was subsequently ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>quitted. At a later date this affiant testifies that he remembered appellant\u2019s arrest upon a charge made by his wife of assault with intent to rape, and that he also had occasion, as deputy sheriff, to investigate that matter, and found that it was a conspiracy on the part of the wife and others, and that there was no merit in the case, aLd that, the wife had made numerous threats against her husband to send him to the penitentiary, and that on this particular occasion she thought she had him where he could not escape, which facts this affiant says he reported to his superior officers, and he also swears that subsequent'to this latter arrest appellant\u2019s wife was living with another man; that he did not report these matters until after the defendant was convicted of this offense. In fact, he says he was not aware of the fact that the grand jury ever indicted the defendant. In the absence of the statement of facts, this would present no legal reason for granting a motion for new trial or reversing the judgment. Appellant may have known all these matters in advance. It may be stated also that some of those matters might have been inadmissible, as they were but conclusions of the party making the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
