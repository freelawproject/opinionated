Nobody put the defendant in the house, and sixty yards from the house was the nearest point at which appellant was seen by witnesses. A boy who was working close by the house and ought to have.known if appellant entered the house, and could have seen it if it occurred, as it was in broad daylight, did not see him go to the house. While there are some suspicious circumstances, still the evidence falls short of the rule required in cases of circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-22\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-23\">\n<em>Reversed and rem&amp;nd?d&gt;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-24\">Prendergast, Judge, not sitting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
