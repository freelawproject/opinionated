There is a judgment in the record overruling the motion to quash the indictment, but the motion itself does not appear in the record. Looking to the motion for a new trial, in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8, we find the complaint was made that the indictment attempted to charge appellant \u201cwith an attempt to commit rape\u201d and was insufficient to charge that offense; and further that the indictment is insufficient to charge an \u201cassault with intent to commit rape,\u201d and the court erred in submitting the latter offense to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">This brings into review articles 608 and 640 of the Penal Code. In the eases of Brown v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 569; Burney v. State, 21 Texas Crim. App., 565; Taylor v. State, 22 Texas Crim. App., 529; Milton v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 204; Melton v. State, 24 Texas Crim. App., 284; Reagan v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 227, it is clearly held that these statutes create separate and distinct offenses, and by article 640 it is provided \u201cif it' appears on the trial of an indictment for rape that the offense, though not committed, was attempted by the use of any of the means spoken of in articles 634, 635 and 636, but not such as to bring the offense within the definition of an assault with intent to commit rape, the jury-may find the defendant guilty of an \u2018attempt to commit the offense.\u2019 \u201d Article 634 defines \u201cforce;\u201d article 635, \u201cthreats,\u201d and article 636, \u201cfraud.\u201d So the offense denounced by article 640 must be committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>by the use of force, threats or fraud as defined in those articles, and it is clear that the indictment, herein copied, does not charge nor seek to charge that offense, and the authorities quoted by appellant, showing that the indictment is insufficient to charge that offense, correctly state the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\">However, this case was not tried on the theory that the indictment charged the offense defined in article 640, and the court did not submit that offense to the jury, but it was claimed by the State that the offense charged in the indictment was an assault with intent to commit rape, as defined by article 608, and this is the offense the court submits to the jury for their determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Article 608 reads: \u201cIf any person shall assault a woman with intent to commit the offense of rape, he shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary for any term of years not less than two.\u201d Hnder this article of the Code it has been held, to charge this offense on a female under the age of consent, it is unnecessary that force, threats or fraud were used. In the case of Moore v. State, 20 Texas Crim. App., 275, Judge White, speaking for the court, holds: \u201cWhere the injured female is under the age of ten years it is neither necessary to allege in the indictment nor to prove on trial that the offense was committed \u2018with or without consent and with or without the use of force, threats or fraud/ because carnal connection with a female of such tender years is per se rape under any and all circumstances, whether with her consent or not. (Penal Code, article 528). Allegations, then, of force, threats and fraud should in such such eases never be used. Standard precedents and prescribed forms do not contain them. (1 Whart., Prec. of Ind., 189, 190; 1 Bish., Crim. Proc., sec. 481; Willson\u2019s Crim. Forms, Nos. 374, 375, pp. 167, 168; Mayo v. The State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 342; Gibson v. The State, 17 Texas Crim. App., 574; 50 Conn., 578.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">It is thus seen that in charging a violation of article 608 on a female under fifteen years it is only necessary to allege and prove that an <em>assault </em>was made with the intent to commit the offense of rape. In this indictment it is alleged that defendant made an assault on the female, and did then and there <em>attempt to ravish </em>and have carnal knowledge of the said Cora Lee Stout. In the case of Taylor v. State, 69 S. W. Rep., 149, it is held that an indictment drawn in terms similar to this one charges an offense under article 608, and the use of the word \u201cattempt\u201d in lieu of the word \u201cintent\u201d in the indictment is held to be a sufficient compliance with the Code. Mr. Bishop in his Procedure says: \u201cIt seems impossible to doubt that the only distinction between an \u2018intent\u2019 and an \u2018attempt\u2019 to do a thing is that the former implies the purpose only, while the latter implies both the purpose and an actual effort to carry that purpose into execution.\u201d Atkinson v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 424, 30 S. W. Rep., 1064; Hart v. State, 30 Texas Crim. Rep., 383; Brown v. State, 27 Texas Crim. App., 330; Witherby v. State, 39 Ala., 702;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
