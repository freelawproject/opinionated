Q. Youngblood, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM3\">On the question of insufficiency of evidence: Joliff v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 61, 109 S. W. Rep., 176.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-5\"><em>C. E. Lane, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.\u2014Cited cases in opinion.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b278-6\">PRENDERGAST, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A_o\">The appellant was prosecuted and convicted under articles 496 and 500 Penal Code (new), for unlawfully keeping and being concerned in keeping a certain house in which spirituous, vinous and malt liquors were sold and kept for sale, without first having obtained a license to retail such liquors, and his penalty fixed at a fine of $200 and twenty days in'jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The appellant has only three bills of exceptions. By the first ho shows that the State introduced Joe Davis and asked him this question: \u201cOn the 5th day of August what time in the day was it that 3rou were there? A. Well, we went to work at 12 o\u2019clock in the day and worked until 12 o\u2019clock at night, and continued around the place from 12 o\u2019clock in the day until 12 o\u2019clock at night.\u201d The appellant objected to said question because it was leading and there was no allegation in the information of any offense having been committed 'on August 5. That is in substance the full of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The second is that the State introduced Robert Hamlin, as a witness and asked him, \u201cHow many times will you say you bought beer from him? A. Three times any way.\u201d Appellant objected because said question was leading and did not confine the answer of the witness to sales of beer alleged in the information in point of time. That is in substance the whole of this bill. The court in approving it qualified it by stating: \u201cThe State (witness) had previously stated that he had bought beer from defendant and the State asked this question to fix the number of times he had bought beer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The other bill is that the State introduced the following testimony,' to wit: Lee Thompson and Joe Davis were allowed to testify that a Federal liquor license ivas on Avail at Minter\u2019s place, -that said license was issued to one Brewer, and that same was a live license. Appellant objected and moved the court to strike the same from the records, unless the State showed defendant had some connection with said Federal license. The court overruled said objection and motion and admitted said evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Clearly, neither of these bills are sufficient to require this court to pass upon the questions attempted to be raised. Conger v. State, 63 Texas Crim. Rep., 312, 140 S. W., 1112, and authorities there cited. However, the character of testimony here objected to was clearly ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>xnissible in this character of case. Tacchini v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 55, 126 S. W., 1139; Joliff v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">No bill of exceptions whatever was taken to the charge of the court or any part thereof. Neither did the appellant request any special charge to be given on any point'. Therefore, the complaints of the charge, made first in the motion for new trial, can not be considered by us. Basquez v. State, 56 Texas Crim. Rep., 329. Section 813, subdivision 6, White\u2019s Ann. Code Criminal Procedure, p. 533, for collated cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The court correctly charged in this case that the burden was on appellant to show he had a license. Lucio v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 320 and eases cited in section 1058 White\u2019s Code Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">No bill of exceptions shows that any motion for continuance was had or overruled; hence, appellant\u2019s motion for new trial on this ground can not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The testimony is amply sufficient to have justified the verdict of the jury. In fact, from it we conclude no other verdict should have been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">The ground for new trial in appellant\u2019s motion, because of newly discovered evidence, wholly fails to show any diligence whatever. Besides, the motion in attempting to set up the facts wholly fails to meet the requirements necessary to show that a new trial should have been granted on this account. Gray v. State, 65 Texas Crim. Rep., 204, 144 S. W., 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
