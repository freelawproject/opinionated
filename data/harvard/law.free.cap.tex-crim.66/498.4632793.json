However, if the evidence would sustain the verdict we are not authorized to disturb it, unless it is shown to be so unreliable that no reasonable man would accept it as true. In this case the State\u2019s witness makes a plain matter of fact statement; the jury believed her, and the trial court refused to disturb the verdict, and at this distance we can not say they were not justified in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">The alleged newly discovered evidence presents no reason for a reversal of the case. In the first place, the affidavits themselves show that appellant must have been aware of what they knew as well before as subsequent to the trial. In the next place, they would testify as did the witnesses present\u2014that they saw the belt and scabbard but noticed no pistol in the scabbard. This would be but cumulative of what three or four witnesses testified on the trial. In the third place, we would call attention to the fact that the affidavits were taken by an attorney of record in the case, and, therefore, can not be considered by this court. Maples v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep., 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
