Deceased, who heard this took it as insulting remarks about his sister, and resented it, telling appellant' not to talk about his sister in that way. Appellant replied, \u201cBy God, I didn\u2019t say no harm about her.\u201d Appellant says deceased said, \u201cYou can cut that out, you can drop her name right now. There is lots of those fellows anyhow talking about my sister.\u201d Appellant claims he further then said to the deceased that he, appellant, had sisters and he didn\u2019t talk about \u201cno man\u2019s sisters.\u201d Appellant further testified that deceased then said, \u201cThere is lots of these fellows around here talking about these women as if they were cows.\u201d The witnesses differ as to the exact expression of what was said between the parties at the time, but they all agree that when appellant first made the remarks about deceased\u2019s sister, deceased resented it and words followed; that deceased then walked off, got his gun, came back to where the crowd was, threw it down on the crowd, told them to scatter, and then, as they got up, threw his hat out on the ground and invited any of them to step in it. One of the crowd then picked up the hat, put it on deceased\u2019s head and told him that what had occurred ought not' to cause any trouble, and they all thereupon dispersed. Appellant immediately started off walking, from the crowd towards his home. Some of the witnesses testified that as appellant was leaving he said he would fix him (deceased) when he came back. All the testimony, including that of appellant, shows that he then left for his home, he himself, testifying that as soon as he got out of sight he ran to his home for his gun, a repeating Winchester. Several witnesses testified after being gone fifteen or twenty minutes, appellant returned to the party, hunted for and tried to find deceased. Deceased in the meantime had gone off to his home and did not return. When appellant returned with his gun, some of the witnesses testified, he not only had his Winchester, but several cartridges for it, and said: \u201cI will plant every one of these balls in him (deceased); the damn son-of-a-bitch, I will put every one of these in him.\u201d Appellant, himself, on this point, denied making such threat, but said he was not caring if he saw deceased; \u201cI was not going to settle it with him, but if it had to be settled with him right there, I expect it would come off.\u201d No other explanation was made by him as to why he went off, got his Winchester and came back at that tim\u00e9. All this occurred on one Saturday night. The killing occurred on Priday about noon, lacking one day of being two weeks from that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The uncontroverted testimony further shows that' the deceased lived with his wife at her father, Moscow Cooper\u2019s, and that the appellant knew this. That repeatedly after the Saturday night row, almost from day to day, the appellant passed hack and forth in a path or road leading right by deceased\u2019s home, the State\u2019s witness testifying that every time he did so, he was carrying his Winchester rifle, and held it with one hand across the other arm. Appellant himself admits all this, except, he claims, that he went twice on horseback when he did not have his gun with him, but he knew deceased was not then there. The deceased was not shown to carry his gun any of this time, but appellant himself testified that he <em>heard </em>that on Sunday evening, after the trouble at the party about deceased\u2019s sister the night before, deceased had his.gun going t'o his work and passed the grounds where a baseball game was going on. Appellant is not shown to have been at the game and said he did not see deceased with the gun at that time, and did not claim he saw him with a gun at any other time.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\">Appellant had two witnesses who testified that the general reputation of deceased was that of a violent and dangerous man. The State controverted this and had some testimony to the reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"A4Ip\">Moscow Cooper, the father-in-law of deceased with whom deceased and his wife lived, testified that a few days\u2014about Wednesday\u2014 after the night of the trouble about deceased\u2019s sister \u2019at said festival, when appellant was passing his house, he had a conversation with the appellant in which appellant told him that 'die was going to kill deceased; that when he and deceased met one or the other was going to flutter in Egypt; one or the other had to leave; that' he was going to put him on the other side of Turtle Bay to stay.\u201d Appellant did not deny, as stated above, repeatedly going by Moscow Cooper\u2019s place with, his Winchester -rifle between the time of the trouble about deceased\u2019s sister and the killing, and did not deny having at said time a conversation with Moscow Cooper. He did not testify what the conversation was, or what either said, but did deny making such threat.</p>\n<p id=\"Acq\">Some four or five eyewitnesses for the State testified that about noon on Friday, appellant' was passing Moscow Cooper\u2019s house carrying with him at the time his Winchester rifle; that deceased was on the gallery at his father-in-law\u2019s, which was his home, and saw, or someone called his attention to the fact, that appellant was passing. These eyewitnesses differ as to the details of what was said between, deceased and the appellant at that time, some of them claiming that deceased first called to appellant. Another that appellant called to deceased and said, \u201cMount, come out here, I want to talle with you.\u201d Deceased replied, \u201cWell, Peter, I heard you told Uncle Moscow you was going to kill me.\u201d Some of the others stating that deceased said, \u201cI heard you told Uncle Moscow when we met one of us had to flutter in Egypt.\u201d At any rate, it was shown that either at the invitation of the appellant or voluntarily, deceased then walked out in the yard gate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>with his gun, and in the colloquy between them, appellant said t'o deceased that if the difficulty was to be settled between them he didn\u2019t Avant it settled on somebody else\u2019s place or premises, and invited him out to settle it. Deceased then went outside of the yard several steps. That in the colloquy then occurring between them, all the witnesses testified, deceased had the butt of his gun standing on the ground with his hand up over the barrel, in no attitude whatever t'o shoot; appellant did not dispute this; that when the deceased was doing nothing at the time, appellant said, \u201cMatters a God damn,\u201d and threw his gun doAvn on deceased and shot him twice. That when the first shot was fired deceased began to stagger, staggering backwards several steps, and just before falling his gun fired off into the ground. Prom the testimony, we think, this firing by deceased was without aim at appellant and caused more by deceased staggering than otherwise. All of the State\u2019s witnesses testified that it was after appellant had shot twice. Appellant claims that he shot only once and did not shoot until deceased shot; and that immediately after deceased shot, he shot only one time at deceased, and that Clyde Cooper, a brother-in-law of deceased, who had passed out of the yard gate some twenty steps somewhat back of him, going to hunt a horse, fired the third shot. All of the eyewitnesses and Clyde Cooper, testify that Clyde did not shoot at any time. They all agree that after the three shots, appellant went to Moscow Cooper\u2019s barn. He himself testified that he then extracted the empty shell from his gun with his knife and put it in his pocket; that he then left the barn, walked up to where the deceased was lying, and one of the State\u2019s witnesses testified, patted the deceased on the head while he was lying there on the ground dying, and said, \u201cOh! lie still, old bully; by God, lie still, I have got you.\u201d Another witness testified substantially the same thing; and still another, on this point, testified: \u201cAnd he (appellant) came up from the barn to where I was at Mount. I says, \u2018Peter, what in the name of God, you come here and shoot that man down for, kill that man?\u2019 He says, \u2018It had to be done.\u2019 I says, \u2018Well, Peter, I have always talked to you.\u2019 And he says, \u2018Yes, Hncle Sanders, you have always talked to me, but it had to be done,\u2019 and he (appellant) reached down and patted him (deceased) on the head. I says, \u2018Peter, I am sorry for you.\u2019 When he (appellant) patted him (deceased) on the head he says, \u2018Old bully, lie there, I have got you,\u2019 I says, \u2018Yes, and they are going to get you just that very way.\u2019 He says, \u2018I will have to abide by the consequences; well, I says, \u2018It will be poor dividement, Peter,\u2019 and he said, T don\u2019t give a damn what they do with me.\u2019\u201d Appellant did not deny doing or saying what either of these witnesses testified he did and said. That the appellant then went on some distance with this witness and when the witness reached his, witness\u2019 home, he stopped and appellant went on. Appellant testified that he went to his home, put up his gun in the rack, told his father about the killing and then walked off a mile or more to the justice of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>We will give the appellant\u2019s testimony of the killing and what he says occurred immediately before and immediately thereafter just as he testified to it: \u201cOn the day of the killing when I came along the road there by Moscow Cooper\u2019s house I saw Mount there. Mount was sitting on the gallery. At that time I was going to old man Isom Richardson\u2019s, he is my uncle. With reference to how far beyond l\u00edoscow\u2019s to old man Isom\u2019s fence\u2014there is a fenced place and old man Isom lives in that and old man Moscow lived in his, right across where you go over to go through Isom\u2019s field. The road that I was on lead to Isom\u2019s house. About the time I got up about opposite Moscow\u2019s house this Mount Bank\u2019s wife, Bertha, she says to Mount, \u201cHow is your time, here he comes past Bully\u2019 (Bertha denied saying any such thing) and when she says that to him\u2014he was sitting on the gallery with his legs crossed this way\u2014I am going to tell the truth. I have got to tell that here today and I may have to tell it some day in judgment day\u2014he was sitting on the gallery with his gun this way; he says to me, 'Peter Blue, I heard that you said you was going to kill ,me.\u2019 I says, 'Ho, Mount, I never said I was going to kill you.\u2019 He said, 'Old man Moscow says you told him you was going to kill me.\u2019 So then' Mount gets up and comes out to where I was. After he got out to where I was I says, 'Mount, that little fuss that occurred over there between me and you don\u2019t amount To all that.\u2019 He says, \u25a0Well,\u2019 he says, 'now is just as good a time to settle it as any other time,\u2019 and after he said that, why, I told him, I says, 'Mount, if you are going to get mad about it I wouldn\u2019t mean to settle it here; this is at some other man\u2019s premises, place, and asked him to come on and settle it some other time and about that time he shot; when Mount shot\u2014I never seen him\u2014I didn\u2019t know he cocked his gun to shoot, he could not have got a chance to do that because if I knowed that he came out with the intention of killing me or anything like that I could have shot him, but Mount Banks throws his gun up\u2014b-o-o-m and I shot. When I shot he wheeled and fell and when he fell this little fellow Clyde he came on out with Mount, he was back about south\u2014 he was southwest of where me and Mount was and he lets loose, he makes a shot. That was in the back, around towards the back of me. He was about twenty or twenty-two steps from me, about that far, it might not have been so many, I never stepped it off to see, and so when Clyde makes that shot I turns and goes on to the barn. When I gets there I takes my knife out to puli the shell out of the gun and the shell I pulled out I put it in my pocket. When I passed by there about that time old man Sanders Cooper was there and he says, 'Peter, what made you do that?\u2019 I said, 'Uncle Sanders, I could not help myself. I did that to save myself.\u2019 When I said that to him he turned and got hold of me and said come on and took me and went on down the road, and after we started away from where this fellow was killed I got about- eight or ten steps from him this Pred -Cooper\u2014 he did not come out the door, when he got to the door he says, 'Look <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>out Uncle Sanders, look out, let me get to him.\u2019 When he said that Uncle Sanders said, \u2018Don\u2019t you shoot this way, Fred, don\u2019t you shoot this way,\u2019 and I told him you had better stop him because if you don\u2019t something might happen again. That is what I told him; after we got there he turned oil to his house and I went on home. Fred had a pistol in his hand and he was waiving it that way (indicating) trying to get Uncle Sanders to move. Uncle Sanders said, \u2018Fred, don\u2019t you shoot this way,\u2019 and waived his hands\u201d like that. He had me going with his hand pressed on my shoulder and when we got opposite his house he turned <em>off into </em>his house and I goes on <em>home. </em>When I gets home I tells my father about what happened. I then goes right straight on up to Mr. Wilson\u2019s and gives myself up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Appellant, in his brief, presents but one question, and that is, he claims that the court erred in not charging on manslaughter. We have carefully and repeatedly gone over and studied the evidence in this case and in our opinion the court should not have charged on manslaughter as it is in no way raised by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The evidence not only does not show sudden passion or adequate cause, but on the contrary, the evidence repels both of these elements of manslaughter. All the evidence is \u201cof a most cogent character and force, showing malice.\u201d Miller v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 639; Massic v. State, 30 Texas Crim. App., 64; Ex parte Jones, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 422; Ex parte Sherwood, 29 Texas Crim. App., 334; Miller v. State, 20 S. W. Rep., 1103. In our opinion the evidence shows a premeditation and coolness on the part of appellant and a preparation to kill, and, while not lying in wait, he repeatedly and often went by the home of deceased, where he knew deceased stayed, prepared and with the full determination of killing him if he had -an opportunity. In other words, that he sought the opportunity repeatedly for two weeks to find the deceased for the purpose of killing him. That when he finally did come upon him he killed him without the slightest provocation, or the slightest demonstration on the part of the deceased towards him. Appellant\u2019s evidence alone, even from his standpoint, only raises self-defense. The physical facts and the testimony of some four or five eyewitnesses disputed him directly and pointedly on this question, and the jury found against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">It is now elementary in this State that if a case is either murder or perfect self-defense, it is not error to fail to charge on manslaughter.

Rep., 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\u2022 <em>We </em>are clearly of the opinion that the evidence in this ease in no way raised the issue of manslaughter so as to require a charge thereon by the court. Jennings v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep., 421; Blount v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 510; Dougherty v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 464; Potts v. State, 56 Texas Crim. Rep., 44; Ford v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 280; Treadway v. State, 65 Texas Crim. Rep., 208, 144 S. <em>W., </em>655, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Clyde Cooper and some two others of the State\u2019s witnesses testified that Clyde had a single-barrel shotgun carrying it with him at the time of the killing and that about the time the deceased passed out of the yard gate to appellant, that Clyde also passed out and went on off with his gun, hunting for or to get a horse to go somewhere on an errand. When Fred Cooper was on the stand, as a State\u2019s witness, he testified positively that Clyde did not have a gun when the shooting occurred and that he did not go down the road at the time with a gun, but that he was standing at the gate and did not leave the gate, nor go down the road to get a horse and that he was positive of that. Thereupon the appellant, on cross-examination, asked him: \u201cAre you as positive of that as you are of anything else you testified to?\u201d And then asked this question: \u201cAre you as positive of the fact that Clyde did not go down the road with a gun about the time of that trouble as you are of the fact that Peter Blue shot George Banks?\u201d To which questions the State objected and the court sustained the objections. The witness, if permitted to have testified, would have stated that he was as positive that Clyde Cooper did not have a gun when the shooting occurred as he was that Peter Blue shot at George Banks. The witness, as shown, having testified what he did and that he was positive of that'fact, the court did not err in not permitting the character of cross-examination shown above. Such matters are largely in the discretion of the trial court and the witness having already so testified and testified positively, it certainly showed no error not to have had him to repeat in substance the same answers to the two questions objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Appellant has two other bills of exceptions. They show in substance that after the killing the appellant walked away from the scene, walked several hundred yards to his home, put up his gun, told his father of the killing and then walked a mile to the home of the justice of the peace and gave himself up. He then offered to prove, as res gestae, by himself and by the justice of the peace, what he then told the justice of the peace of the killing. Upon objections of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>this evidence was not permitted. We think it clear that this evidence was not res gestae and the court did not err in excluding it. See section 1236, White\u2019s Ann. Penal Code; and section 1085, White\u2019s Ann. Code Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\">By another bill appellant complains that the court erred in not permitting him to prove by Moscow Cooper that he heard some child state, after the killing when appellant was not present, that Clyde Cooper shot at appellant. The bill shows that when this evidence was offered that the court at the instance of the parties retired the jury and heard the testimony of the witness on the subject, which was that from a half hour to an hour after the killing when a great many people and children from all the surroundings, had gathered at his house where the killing had occurred, that he heard some child who was not identified, state that Clyde Cooper had shot at appellant. The bill, in our opinion, demonstrates that the evidence was inadmissible for any purpose and the court did not err in so holding. See sections 1242 and 1243, White\u2019s Ann. Penal Code; and section 1096, White\u2019s Ann. Code \u25a0Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">There is no merit in appellant\u2019s complaint to a paragraph of the court\u2019s charge on self-defense. There being no reversible error the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"ACv\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"Apvh\">June 26, 1912.</p>\n<author id=\"b661-8\">PRENDERGAST, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AK-\">The only question raised by appellant on his motion for rehearing is what he claims is raised by the eighth ground of his motion for new trial. We quote that ground in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdC6\">\u201cThe court erred in not instructing the jury that the defendant had the right to presume that the deceased was going to attack him with a deadly weapon.\u201d ' This, by all the authorities, is uniformly held too general to require this court to consider it. Ryan v. State, 64 Texas Crim. Rep., 628, 142 S. W. Rep., 878; Berg v. State, 64 Texas Crim. Rep., 612, 142 S. W. Rep., 884, and cases therein cited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">The appellant now claims that the evidence showed that the deceased was advancing toward the defendant with a gun at the time appellant shot and killed him and refers us to page 37 of the statement of facts. In the original opinion, we gave the full substance of the testimony and on this particular page of the statement of facts, we quoted fully and literally the testimony of the appellant in the original opinion. As we read and study this testimony the very reverse of appellant\u2019s contention is shown thereby. And, as stated in the original opinion, all of the eyewitnesses, some four or five in number, testified that at the time appellant shot deceased that the deceased had the butt of his gun standing on the ground with his hands up over the barrel in no attitude whatever to shoot. Appellant did not dispute this, and according to the State\u2019s witnesses, when the deceased was doing nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>at the time, appellant said: \u201cMatters a God damn,\u201d and threw his gun down on deceased and shot him. So that even if we could consider appellant\u2019s assignment above, the evidence did not raise and the court should not have charged as therein claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
