On the 3d of September, it being Sunday, appellant closed up his place of business about 9 o\u2019clock in the morning, as was his custom of doing on Sunday, having opened on said day for the purpose of serving meals to his customers and boarders. He started home, carrying his coat on his arm, which had a pistol in the pocket. The purpose of appellant was to carry the pistol home from his place of business. When he had gone a short distance en route home he was stopped by Ely Porter who engaged him in conversation. After he had been talking to Porter a few minutes Bussell came along, riding in a wagon, and stopped in the street opposite where defendant and Porter were talking, and called defendant to come to him. When appellant approached the wagon where Bussell was, Bussell said something defendant did not hear and immediately reached into the bed of the wagon and picked up some brickbats and began throwing at defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>When Eussell had thrown two or three of said bricks defendant pulled his pistol and shot at Eussell but failed to hit him. Eussell drove away and defendant went home, as the statement of facts shows, \u201cnever deviating from his nearest route from his place of business to where he lived and never stopped on the way except as above set out t'o converse Avith said Porter and at the instance of Eussell.\u201d It is also shown appellant had $150 on his person in going from his place of business to his home on this particular occasion. This is the testimony in the case. We are of opinion appellant\u2019s contention is right. The evidence does not sIioav a violation of the law. Appellant had a right to carry the pistol home from his place of business under the circumstances. As to Avhether he did wrong or not in shooting at Eussell is not a question in this case. The facts of this case make it almost identical Avitli the ease of Elias v. State, recently deoided by this court. That case is authority for the reversal of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
