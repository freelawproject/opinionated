There is in the record what perhaps was intended for a statement of facts, but it is not shown to have been filed in the lower court, nor in any way approved by the judge thereof. So that in neither event it can be considered for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">The only question sought to be raised is shown by the motion for new trial which complains that \u201cthe verdict of the jury is against the law,\u201d and \u201cthat the court failed to charge the law applicable to the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">In addition to this, there is in the record, without stating when it was filed, what is designated as an assignment of error in these words: \u201c1, and only error the court failed to charge on circumstantial evidence, to which the evidence demanded a charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">These assignments are too general to require any consideration by this court.

Again, it \u201cis the well established law of this State that in misdemeanor eases the only way this court is authorized to review complaints of the charge of the court, either of commission or omission, must be shown by bill of exceptions taken at the time and made full and specific.
