On another trial this question can not arise, The prosecuting witness, Swanzy Haltom, testified that on or about December 1 he got a quart of whisky from appellant at the Bedlands Hotel, and gave him $1.50 to get the whisky. That he talked to another negro about the whisky, besides appellant, but he got it from appellant. On cross-examination he said he could not swear whether it was appellant or another negro who went and got it. Appellant testified that Mr. Haltom came to him at the Bedlands Hotel, and said he had to ride fourteen miles that night, and asked him to get him some whisky; that he told him he did not know where he could get it; that Dawson MeNeer came along and he called him and told him what Haltom wanted, and that Dawson MeNeer got two pints of whisky and brought them to the Bedlands Hotel and gave them to him to give Mr. Haltom, and he gave the two bottles to him. The defendant then placed Neil Butler on the witness stand, who testified that he heard the conversation between Mr. Haltom and appellant, and that he saw Mr. Haltom, appellant and Dawson MeNeer talking. The defendant then offered to prove by the witness that he saw Dawson MeNeer bring the two bottles hack to the hotel and deliver them to appellant, and appellant give the whisky to Mr. Hal-tom. The State objected to the defendant being permitted to make this proof and the court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The defendant\u2019s theory was that he acted only as agent of Mr. Haltom in securing the whisky and desired to prove by the witness Butler that he saw him, appellant, call Dalton MeNeer, and give the $1.50, and that MeNeer went off and was gone about forty minutes and returned and gave the whisky to appellant, who in turn gave it to Mr. Haltom. It may be that the testimony would not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>trup, and the jury would have so found, yet appellant had the right to introduce this testimony in support of his contention, and the court erred in excluding the testimony. While perhaps it would not be reversible error to refuse special charge No. 2 requested, yet it more aptly' presents the question of agency than does the court\u2019s main charge, and on another trial the substance of it should be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">For the error above pointed out in excluding the testimony of the witness Butler, the case must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
