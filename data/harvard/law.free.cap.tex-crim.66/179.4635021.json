Article 500, Penal Code, is: \u201cAny person who shall, directly or as agent for another, or through any agent, keep or be concerned in keeping, or aid, or assist or abet in keeping ... a disorderly house in any house, building, edifice, or tenement, or shall knowingly permit the keeping of a . . . disorderly house in any house, building, edifice or tenement owned, leased, occupied or controlled by him, directly (or) as agent for another, or through any agent, shall be deemed guilty, etc. . . .\u201d The complaint and information in this case strictly follow these statutes in charging the offense, except that in the last part it charged that the house was occupied, etc., by the said appellant \u201cdirectly and indirectly.\u201d A motion was made to quash the complaint and information because of the use of the last two words just above quoted, \u201cand indirectly.\u201d Ho other objection is made to the complaint and information. Without these latter words which appellant complains of, the complaint and information are unquestionably complete and charge an offense under the statute above noted. These last two words may, under all the authorities, be considered as surplusage and do not affect the remainder of the complaint and information. See cases cited under section 382, p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>285, of White\u2019s Code Criminal Procedure. The charge of the court limited the finding of the jury to the occupancy, etc., by the appellant \u201cdirectly\u201d and did not submit -to them any \u201cindirect\u201d occupancy, etc.' It is, therefore, unnecessary for us to determine whether the charge in the complaint and information that the appellant occupied, etc., \u201cindirectly\u201d would take the place of and supply the language of the statute above quoted to the effect \u201cas agent for another, or through any agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\">There is no statement of facts in the ease and, therefore, this court can not pass upon any of the other questions attempted to be raised by the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The judgment will, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
