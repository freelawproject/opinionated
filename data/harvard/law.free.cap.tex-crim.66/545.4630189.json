B. Penny prior to the 15th day of November, 1911 (date of filing indictment), and subsequent to the 15th day of July, 1910 (the date prohibition became effective in that county). After proving that prohibition was in effect in Lubbock County and went into effect on July 14, 1910, the State proved by Mr. Penny, that he resided in Lubbock County on the 15th of June, 1911, date of alleged sale in indictment. That he bought a pint of whisky from appellant, paying him one dollar for it. That the transaction took place on the train between Slaton and Lubbock, in the county of Lubbock. J. W. Baker testified he was on the train on June 15, 1911, and saw both appellant and Penny on the train.' C. L. Ery testified he was on the train on June 15, 1911, and' saw appellant and Penny on the train, and on that occasion he saw appellant deliver the bottle of whisky to Penny.

It was branded \u201cMaxwell whisky.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">This sufficiently proved that the- sale took place on June .15, 1911, and the judgment is affirmed. .</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
