The Assistant Attorney-General moves to dismiss the appeal because, in the first place, the instrument is not a recognizance, and, in the second place, it was executed after the adjournment of court. The statute requires that the recognizance must be entered into in open court. The motion to dismiss is well taken, and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"AfsK\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
