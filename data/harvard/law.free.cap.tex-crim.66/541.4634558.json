Omitting formal parts, the indictment alleges \u201cthat Pies Whittaker on or about the 13th day of September, 1911, in the county of Harris and State of Texas, with force and arms, then and there without lawful authority, and with intent to injure and defraud, did willfully and fraudulently make a false instrument in writing to the tenor following: (then sets out in haec verba a contract binding Ellis Eandal to pay to The L. B. Price Mercantile Co. a given sum weekly) against the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Appellant moved to quash the indictment on the following grounds: \u201cSaid indictment fails to set out that the alleged forged instrument \u2018purports\u2019 to be the act of another, nor does it set out the name of the person whose name it is claimed to have been forged; and that it does not allege whether or not The L. B. Price Mercantile Co. is a corporation or partnership.\u201d The other grounds in the motion Telate to the count charging appellant with passing a forged instrument, but as he was convicted of forgery, it is unnecessary to discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\">The contention of appellant that the indictment does not contain a \u201cpurport\u201d clause presents no ground for reversal, it being held in the case of Rhudy v. State, 58 S. W. Rep., 1007, that it is the recognized doctrine in this State that it is not necessary that the indictment contain a purport clause, it being sufficient if the instrument is set out according to its tenor, citing Westbrook v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 401; English v. State, 30 Texas Crim. App., 470; 2 Bish. Crim. Prac., see. 413. This question is discussed at length in the case of Webb v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 534, as well as the other questions raised in appellant\u2019s motion, and they are all decided adversely to appellant\u2019s contention, it being specifically held that it was not necessary to allege whether or not the beneficiary named in an instrument was a partnership or corporation, as it was not claimed that the beneficiary named executed the instrument. See also Usher v. State, 47 Texas Crim. Rep., 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The instrument in this case alleged to have been forged clearly imports an obligation on the part of Ellis Randal to pay to The L. B. Price Mercantile Co. the amount named in the obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
