An Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), in a decision affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), rejected Sanchez's motion to suppress the statements he made to the state officers and ICE, and ordered his voluntary departure. Sanchez now petitions for review. For the reasons that follow, we must deny that petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 22, 2009, Maryland Transportation Authority Police (\"MdTAP\") Officer Acker stopped Jose Alberto Badillo Taylor (\"Badillo\") for a traffic violation. Badillo failed to produce a valid license and Officer Acker noticed that the car had exposed ignition wiring and lacked a steering column, indicating that perhaps it had been stolen. When Badillo explained that the car, a Nissan, belonged to a friend, Officer Acker directed Badillo to call the Nissan's owner, Juventino Tenorio Davila (\"Tenorio\"), to retrieve his car from the scene. At the time Tenorio received Badillo's call, he was traveling in an Acura with Sanchez and another passenger, Seltik Ferino Sanchez (\"Ferino\"). Sanchez agreed to drive Tenorio and Ferino to Badillo's location to retrieve the Nissan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the three men arrived on the scene, Sanchez parked the Acura about twenty to thirty feet in front of the Nissan. Sanchez, Tenorio, and Ferino remained inside the Acura with the engine running. After approximately five minutes, Officer Acker approached the Acura, leaned inside the front passenger window, and asked the men whether they were \"illegal or legal.\" Officer Acker repeated the question two or three times. The Officer later explained that because he believed the men had acted in a \"suspicious\" manner, when they refused to answer his questions, he spoke to them in an \"authoritative\" tone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Sanchez, the questioning made him \"scared and nervous.\" Because he \"felt pressured and intimidated,\" he answered the Officer's question and admitted that he had entered the country illegally. At that point, Officer Acker stopped questioning the men and asked Sanchez to turn off the ignition and give him the keys. Sanchez complied. Upon the Officer's request, all three men produced identification cards. With the assistance of another MdTAP officer, Officer Acker then handcuffed the three men.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   MdTAP officers transported Sanchez, Tenorio, Ferino, and Badillo to the MdTAP station. At the station, MdTAP officers removed the handcuffs and placed the men in a small cell. After about 90 minutes, Officer Acker returned, re-handcuffed the men, and explained that he was taking them to the ICE facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In total, MdTAP officers detained Sanchez for approximately three-and-a-half hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While in ICE custody, an ICE agent interviewed Sanchez, who again admitted that he had entered the United States illegally without inspection. The agent memorialized Sanchez's admissions to Officer Acker and ICE about his immigration status\n   in a Form I-213 (Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien). That form also identifies Sanchez as \"a native and citizen of Mexico who entered the United States\" in \"February 2000 without inspection by an Immigration Officer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on the form, ICE instituted removal proceedings against Sanchez pursuant to Section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A)(1) (2006). Sanchez moved the IJ to suppress all evidence of his illegal entry, including the Form I-213. He maintained that the state police officers obtained this information in violation of his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In support of his contentions, Sanchez provided affidavits from himself, Tenorio, Ferino, and Badillo. Sanchez also offered an affidavit from Major Stanford O'Neill Franklin, the Executive Director of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition and a former member of the Maryland State Police and MdTAP. In addition, the IJ heard testimony from Sanchez, Officer Acker, Major Franklin, and ICE's expert witness (a Maryland sheriff and former MdTAP officer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The IJ found that Sanchez \"testified credibly in terms of what happened\" during the May 2009 traffic stop. He also concluded that Officer Acker treated Sanchez \"and his friends ... pretty much in the manner\" Sanchez described, in that Officer Acker inquired \"about who they are, where they are from,\" and asked them \"to produce identification.\" But the IJ was not persuaded that the state officers \"intimidated and frightened\" Sanchez into giving \"up information regarding his Immigration status.\" The IJ therefore concluded that the record lacked \" 'specific and detailed statements from which [the IJ] could find evidence\" that the MdTAP officers had engaged in \"coercion or duress.\" As a result, the IJ concluded that Sanchez had \"failed to demonstrate any violation of the Fifth Amendment that can provide the basis for suppression of evidence.\" The IJ also found that even if \"the MdTAP officers did violate [Sanchez's] Fourth Amendment rights, the presumed violation\" was not \"egregious.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal before the BIA, Sanchez argued that the IJ applied the incorrect legal standard to his Fourth Amendment claim. The IJ had determined not to suppress Sanchez's statements because any violation of Sanchez's Fourth Amendment right was not \"egregious\" under\n   <em>\n    INS v. Lopez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    468 U.S. 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), and\n   <em>\n    Yanez-Marquez v.

Sanchez claimed that the IJ should have instead applied \"the full exclusionary rule\" and that under that standard, the IJ should have suppressed his statements. Alternatively, Sanchez maintained that, contrary to the IJ's conclusion, he had \"suffered an egregious violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.\" Sanchez also argued that the IJ erred in finding that the officers did not violate his Fifth Amendment right to due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The BIA affirmed. It rejected Sanchez's claim that the IJ \"should have applied the full exclusionary rule.\" Instead, the BIA held that in the context before it the exclusionary rule requires proof of an \"egregious\" Fourth Amendment violation. The BIA found that the IJ had correctly determined that Sanchez failed to establish \"an egregious violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.\" In addition, the BIA agreed that Sanchez had failed to prove that any MdTAP officer had violated Sanchez's due process right. Sanchez noted a timely appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The exclusionary rule directs courts to suppress evidence obtained through \"an unlawful, warrantless arrest\" where \"the link between the evidence and the unlawful conduct is not too attenuated.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    468 U.S. at 1040-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]he exclusionary rule is not an individual right.\"\n   <em>\n    Herring v.

The Court acknowledged that applying the exclusionary rule to civil deportation proceedings could deter unlawful police actions. For example, the Court reasoned that since \"only a very small percentage of arrests of aliens ... lead to criminal prosecutions,\" in the immigration context, an officer's \"primary objective ... will be to use evidence in the civil deportation proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    at 1042-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, where an officer's \"primary objective\" is to obtain evidence for use in a criminal proceeding, suppressing that evidence in a civil proceeding is less of a deterrent.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court found, however, that \"other factors significantly reduce the likely deterrent value of the exclusionary rule in a civil deportation proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    at 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, in civil deportation proceedings, the government need only establish identity and alienage.

Much of the\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   Court's rationale applies here. For example, evidence concerning an alien's illegal presence in this country remains useful primarily in the\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   deportation context, but independent evidence is often still available to ascertain alienage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    at 1042-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But some of the safeguards discussed in\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   that \"reduce[d] the likely deterrent value of the exclusionary rule\" as applied to federal officers do not apply to state and local officers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    at 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nor can \"declaratory relief against the federal agency effectively address persistent problems with abusive enforcement\" by state and local officers. Pet. Br. at 30. Moreover,\n   because \"there is no state-law parallel\" to a federal civil immigration proceeding, \"the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   proceeding in which immigration-related evidence will be used is a federal proceeding.\" Amici Br. at 20. We therefore agree with the Challengers that applying the \"full\" exclusionary rule in civil immigration proceedings to state and local officers would clearly have some deterrent effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   But we do not agree that the likely additional deterrent value of the \"full\" exclusionary rule, as opposed to the \"egregious violation\" rule, is\n   <em>\n    appreciable\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   enough to justify its application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p141\">\n    555 U.S. at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p141\">\n    129 S.Ct. 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    468 U.S. at 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is so because of the combined effect of the \"egregious violation\" rule and our recent holding in\n   <em>\n    Santos v. Frederick County Board of Commissioners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070804\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/451/\">\n    725 F.3d 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2013). In\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that \"absent express direction or authorization by federal statute or federal officials, state and local law enforcement officers may not detain or arrest an individual solely based on known or suspected civil violations of federal immigration law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070804\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/451/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070804\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/451/\">\n    at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   makes clear that when, absent federal direction or authorization, a state or local officer detains or arrests someone based\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on a civil immigration violation, the officer violates that individual's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A stop or seizure based solely on an abuse of an officer's legal authority and without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity will usually be egregious. In some circumstances, more may be required. But because such conduct is likely egregious, its fruits will likely be suppressed in civil immigration proceedings. For that reason, we believe that, post-\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   , the \"egregious violation\" rule can substantially deter state and local officers from illegally enforcing civil immigration laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, even if the Challengers' proposed rule provides some marginal additional deterrence, that does not outweigh its substantial costs. Requiring IJs to apply a different exclusionary rule depending on the circumstances of a given case would disrupt and complicate the \"deliberately simple deportation hearing system.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    468 U.S. at 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341559\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/1032/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is especially true because state and federal officials can cooperate on immigration matters in various ways. For example,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201357\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) authorizes the Attorney General to grant to specific state or local officers the authority to \"perform a function of\" a federal \"immigration officer\" through a formal, written agreement with the state or local agency. But in the absence of such a written agreement, state and local law enforcement agents may still \"cooperate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1357(g)(10)(B). Under the Challengers' proposed rule, immigration courts would apply the \"full\" exclusionary rule to state and local officers who merely \"cooperate\" with ICE under \u00a7 1357(g)(10)(B), but would apply the \"egregious violation\" rule to those authorized by \"written agreement\" to \"carry out\" federal immigration functions under \u00a7 1357(g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This would undoubtedly burden the deportation hearing system. The Challengers' rule would require IJs to determine the level of authority a given state or local official had to enforce federal immigration law and to decide which test applies where officers with differing authorities jointly execute an immigration action. It is often difficult to define these categories with clarity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Maldonado v.

Reply Br. at 15. This argument rests on a mischaracterization of Officer Acker's testimony. Before the IJ, Sanchez's counsel asked Officer Acker, \"do you have any legal authority to enforce Federal civil Immigration violations,\" to which he replied, \"No, ma'am, that's why we\n   <em>\n    detain\n   </em>\n   them.\" Officer Acker also explained, consistent with his incident report, \"that Mr. Sanchez was\n   <em>\n    detained\n   </em>\n   , not arrested.\" Thus, Officer Acker apparently believed that he could not lawfully\n   <em>\n    arrest\n   </em>\n   Sanchez but could lawfully\n   <em>\n    detain\n   </em>\n   Sanchez, and that his actions accorded with this restriction. Of course, in\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   we clarified that \"absent express direction or authorization by federal statute or federal officials, state and local law enforcement officers may not\n   <em>\n    detain or arrest\n   </em>\n   an individual solely based on known or suspected civil violations of federal immigration law.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070804\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/451/\">\n    725 F.3d at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The IJ credited Officer Acker's testimony that this was \"contrary to the way individuals typically act when picking up a friend at the scene of a traffic stop.\" Although the IJ did not make a specific finding on this point, the Officer also testified that the Acura \"had extremely dark tinted windows.\" Combined, these facts led Officer Acker to conclude that the vehicle's occupants were acting in a \"suspicious\" manner and were perhaps involved in illegal activity. Given these facts, we find no error in the IJ's conclusion that Officer Acker did not question Sanchez based on race or ethnicity alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Of course, even where an officer can articulate other reasonable bases for his actions, a factfinder still considers whether, under the totality of the circumstances inquiry, race or ethnicity motivated the officer's actions. Here, however, the IJ was \"not persuaded that racial profiling motivated the MdTAP officers.\" Sanchez contends that in so finding, the IJ erred. He notes that Officer Acker even testified before the IJ that he considered \"the fact that the men were speaking Spanish\" \"a 'real problem.' \" Pet. Reply Br. at 12. Action assertedly based on proficiency in Spanish may well be a proxy for discrimination against Latinos.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

But Officer Acker's testimony reflects that he considered the use of Spanish \"a real problem\" because\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   was not fluent in Spanish. Thus, Officer Acker had\n   to call for a Spanish-speaking officer to join him on the scene. Although Sanchez cites to other record evidence which, if true, might offer some support for a contrary holding,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the record simply does not lead us to conclude that \"any reasonable adjudicator\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   be compelled\" to so hold.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(B) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Sanchez also maintains that the MdTAP officers used threats, coercion, and abuse to obtain his admission.

Although Sanchez stated that when Officer Acker repeatedly asked whether the three men were \"legal or illegal,\" he \"felt pressured,\" \"intimidated,\" and \"frightened,\" Sanchez's passengers did not maintain that Officer Acker coerced or threatened them. Moreover, Officer Acker characterized his tone as \"authoritative\" rather than \"aggressive.\" He explained that he tended to speak \"a little louder\" when on \"the side of the highway,\" because passing vehicles impair his hearing and that it can sometimes \"seem to a person inside a vehicle that you're yelling.\" Based on all of this testimony, a reasonable factfinder need not, but certainly could have, concluded that the MdTAP officers did not use coercion, threats, or force.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   At its very essence, \"[s]omething egregious is by nature extreme, rare, and obvious.\"\n   <em>\n    Yanez-Marquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233638\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/434/\">\n    789 F.3d at 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Maldonado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181407\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/155/\">\n    763 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   165 ) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Thus, to stay faithful to the dictates of the Supreme Court, it follows that an alien's evidentiary proffer concerning egregiousness must be high, otherwise\" courts risk undermining \"the very heart of\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 459.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Consider\n   <em>\n    Rochin v.
