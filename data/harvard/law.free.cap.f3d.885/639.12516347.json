Byrd later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit possession of a dangerous drug, and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court conducted a pre-answer screening of Byrd's complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a). The court first found that Byrd had improperly named the Phoenix Police Department as a defendant, instead of the City of Phoenix. In addition, the court found that, even if Byrd had sued the city, his claim could not survive dismissal because he alleged a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   theory of liability but did not allege that the officers were acting pursuant to an official policy or custom of the municipality. The court therefore dismissed the suit against the department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Next, the court examined the six counts of the complaint. The excessive force claim in Count Six was dismissed because the district court found its allegations too vague and conclusory to state a claim, and Count Three was dismissed as duplicative of Count Six. The court held that\n   <em>\n    Heck v.

The district court dismissed the complaint, with leave to amend, instructing Byrd to \"cure the deficiencies outlined\" and re-submit the complaint on a court-approved form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 18, 2016, Byrd filed his First Amended Complaint, which again named the City of Phoenix Police Department and the two officers as defendants and repeated the six counts alleged in the original complaint. The district court found that the First Amended Complaint suffered from the same defects that the court had previously identified and dismissed it without leave to amend. The district court denied leave to amend because Byrd was apparently \"unable or unwilling to [craft a viable complaint] despite specific instructions from the Court,\" and further opportunities to amend would be \"futile.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For certain prisoner civil rights litigation, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a) requires pre-answer screening of the complaint so that \"the targets of frivolous or malicious suits need not bear the expense of responding.\"\n   <em>\n    Nordstrom v.

In this review, the district court \"shall identify cognizable claims or dismiss the complaint, or any portion of the complaint, if the complaint-(1) is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; or (2) seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b).
