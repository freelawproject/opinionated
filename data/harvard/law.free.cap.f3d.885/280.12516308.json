It reasoned that plaintiffs' fear of future arrest and prosecution under the two statutes does not rise above speculation and thus does not constitute an injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   But at least some of the named plaintiffs do not rely on conjecture or speculation, but rather, on the fact that they attend school where they were previously arrested and criminally charged under the two South Carolina statutes, and they don't know which of their actions at school will be interpreted to violate the statutes in the future. Further, plaintiffs allege that the two laws chill their exercise of free expression, forcing them to refrain from exercising their constitutional rights or to do so at the risk of arrest and prosecution. In our view, that is sufficient to plead both a future and ongoing injury in fact. We therefore vacate the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before turning to the merits, we set out the relevant statutes.

D.S. and S.P. represent the proposed class of elementary and secondary public school students in South Carolina. Girls Rock is suing on behalf of its members and itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   D.S. and S.P. are high school students. D.S. (who is black and has learning disabilities) was charged with violating the Disturbing Schools Law \"after becoming involved in a physical altercation which she did not initiate and in which she was the only person who sustained an injury, a lump on her head.\" Compl. \u00b6 101. S.P. (who is white and suffers from mood and conduct disabilities) was charged with violating the Disorderly Conduct Law after she cursed at a student who had been teasing her and refused to leave the library with the principal as instructed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Kenny and Nesmith are young adults who were previously arrested and charged with violating the Disturbing Schools Law when they expressed concerns about police conduct. When Kenny (who is black) was in high school, she saw a school resource officer pull a female student from her desk, drag her on the floor, and handcuff her. Kenny \"attempted to document the incident and called out for someone to do something to stop the violent treatment of her classmate.\" Compl. \u00b6 84. In response, Kenny was arrested and charged with violating the Disturbing Schools Law. The experience left Kenny scared and humiliated, and she withdrew from high school. She later obtained her G.E.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nesmith (who is also black) attends Benedict College. He alleges that a campus police officer arrested him on suspicion of violating both statutes after he complained that the officer was engaged in racial profiling and questioned the officer's request that he produce identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Girls Rock is a nonprofit organization that \"provides mentorship, music and arts education, and leadership development to young people in Charleston, South Carolina.\" Compl. \u00b6 22. Girls Rock \"operates an afterschool program serving at-risk youth\" and is \"guided by core principles that include challenging criminalization.\" Compl. \u00b6 22. The complaint describes two members of Girls Rock-K.B. and D.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   K.B. is Latina and was charged with violating the Disturbing Schools Law at age thirteen after she arrived late to gym class and loudly protested when she was asked to leave and go to the \"tardy sweep\" room. Compl. \u00b6 94. K.B. was sentenced to probation and referred to Girls Rock. When K.B. returned to school, she was placed in a program called \"Twilight,\" through which \"she was provided no more than three hours of computer-based education per day.\" Compl. \u00b6 95. The Twilight program \"did not provide access to the courses necessary to obtain a high school diploma.\" Compl. \u00b6 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   D.D. is black and was charged with violating the Disturbing Schools Law at her Charleston middle school after she was sent out of class for talking and then proceeded to speak with another student in the hallway. She too was placed on probation and ordered to participate in the Twilight program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiffs' complaint outlines two \u00a7 1983 claims. First, all plaintiffs challenge the Disturbing Schools Law as unconstitutionally vague on its face and, second, D.S. and S.P. also challenge the Disorderly Conduct Law as unconstitutionally vague as applied to elementary and secondary public school students in South Carolina. Both claims allege (in sum and substance) that the statutes violate plaintiffs' right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment because they fail to provide sufficient\n   notice of prohibited conduct and encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kolender v. Lawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298570\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/352/#p357\">\n    461 U.S. 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298570\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/352/#p357\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298570\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/352/#p357\">\n    75 L.Ed.2d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that both statutes criminalize behavior that is indistinguishable from typical juvenile behavior, which schools address on a daily basis without resorting to the criminal justice system. For example, students, including some as young as seven, have been charged under the statutes for cursing, refusing to follow directions, or getting in a physical altercation that doesn't result in any injuries. The complaint further alleges that some students are arrested and charged simply for expressing concerns about police conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to plaintiffs, criminal charges under the two statutes are among the leading reasons young people enter the juvenile justice system in South Carolina. Between 2010 and 2016, over 9,500 young people throughout the state were referred to the Department of Juvenile Justice under the Disturbing Schools Law, a statistic that excludes those students seventeen and older who are charged and prosecuted as adults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that students arrested for violating the statutes are less likely to graduate and more likely to feel stigmatized and afraid, making it difficult to engage in the classroom. When a student's behavior is characterized as \"criminal,\" the school is likely to impose a harsher punishment, diminishing the student's educational opportunities through expulsion, suspension, or placement in alternative settings that do not offer coursework necessary to graduate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that the statutes are enforced in a discriminatory manner, leaving racial minorities and students with disabilities especially vulnerable. In 2014-2015 black students in South Carolina were nearly four times as likely to be charged under the Disturbing Schools Law compared to their white classmates. In Charleston County, a charge under the Disturbing Schools Law was the number one reason young people entered the juvenile justice system and black students were more than six times as likely to be charged for the offense compared to white students. Plaintiffs allege that such racial disparities in discipline cannot be explained by differences in behavior among students of different races.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The individual plaintiffs and members of Girls Rock-all of whom have previously been charged under one of the two statutes-fear future arrest if, while on or around the grounds of a school, their actions are interpreted to fall under any of the broad terms of the statutes. Additionally, Girls Rock alleges that, as an organization, it is \"substantially burdened in its mission by the continued practice of charging students\" under the Disturbing Schools Law. Compl. \u00b6 23. Girls Rock volunteers attend hearings with its members and present testimony on their behalf. These hearings divert time and resources away from \"developing programming and providing direct services to young people and attending to administrative business necessary to sustain the operations of the organization, such as writing grant proposals and conducting fundraising activities.\" Compl. \u00b6 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs seek: (1) a declaratory judgment that the statutes violate their right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining defendants from enforcing the laws; and (3) an order enjoining defendants from considering or retaining any of plaintiffs' records relating to the Disturbing Schools or Disorderly Conduct charges filed against them, except as would be permissible following expungement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2017-1-40\">\n    S.C.

Specifically, the district court held that D.S., S.P., Kenny, Nesmith, and Girls Rock all lacked standing because allegations of a fear or risk of future arrest do not show \"imminent harm, an intention to engage in conduct proscribed by the challenged laws, or a credible threat of prosecution.\" J.A. 542. The court held that the plaintiffs failed to \"plead a likelihood of future injury that is certainly impending and not merely possible.\" J.A. 543. The court also held that Girls Rock lacked organizational standing because it did not face imminent harm and its interests were outside the \"zone of interests\" protected by the Due Process Clause. J.A. 545-47. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a case for lack of standing.\n   <em>\n    David v.
