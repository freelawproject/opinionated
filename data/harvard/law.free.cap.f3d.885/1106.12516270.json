He appeals, arguing that the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   improperly defined the crime of bribery when analyzing his indictment and instructing the jury, committed evidentiary errors, and unreasonably calculated the loss due to his bribery scheme. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Three individuals are key to this case. The first is Suhl, a successful Arkansas businessman. Among the businesses that Suhl owned or ran were two for-profit companies that provided mental health treatment to juvenile Medicaid recipients. Between 2007 and 2011, these two companies received over $10 million per year in Medicaid reimbursement. The second is Phillip Carter, an Arkansas probation officer. Carter and Suhl knew each other because Carter frequently referred juveniles for treatment at Suhl's companies. The third is Steven Jones, a former state legislator and the second-in-command at the\n   Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services (ADHS). ADHS is Arkansas's largest agency; its responsibilities include administration of Arkansas's federally-funded Medicaid program and regulation of juvenile mental health care providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Suhl knew Jones from Jones's days as a state legislator, and he sought to capitalize on that acquaintance. At some point, Suhl asked Carter to arrange a meeting with Jones; Carter replied that the meeting would only happen if Suhl paid Jones a $2,000 \"fee.\" Suhl agreed, and wrote a $2,000 check to the church Carter attended, telling Carter \"y'all know what to do with it, do what you want with it.\" Soon afterward, Suhl met with Jones over dinner. After that meeting, Carter's church (through its pastor, John Bennett) wrote Jones a check for $2,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This pattern repeated itself for four years. Suhl would call Carter, Carter would call Jones, Suhl would pay Carter's church, Suhl and Jones would meet, and Carter's church would pay Jones. At their meetings, and by phone through Carter, Suhl would ask Jones to assist his businesses. Some of his requests were broad: \"see what he can do to help us.\" Others were more specific. In an effort to increase his companies' Medicaid reimbursement rates, for example, Suhl asked Jones \"to see if he can get the Medicaid portion of [ADHS] ... up under his jurisdiction.\" Suhl also sought more clients by asking Jones to increase the geographical radius from which one of his companies could receive referrals. And Suhl asked Jones to convince the governor to reappoint him to a state board that licenses and inspects juvenile residential treatment facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jones never specifically agreed to do any of the things Suhl asked. He told Suhl he would \"look into\" his requests, and sometimes reported that he had involved himself in a meeting so he could gain information for Suhl. But there is no evidence that Jones ever did anything more than inquire into Suhl's requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Suhl's last meeting with Jones was over dinner at a steakhouse in Memphis, Tennessee. Carter was also there. That meeting was comprehensively documented by the FBI, which was investigating Suhl and his companies. FBI agents were listening when Suhl called Carter to complain that a rival company was receiving all the ADHS juvenile mental health referrals in northeastern Arkansas. Suhl told Carter that he wanted Jones to put a stop to this, and to direct the referrals to one of his companies instead. Agents also heard Jones accept Carter's invitation to meet with Suhl, but only if Suhl had \"enough time to make sure he's got everything together for us.\" At the steakhouse, video surveillance recorded Suhl passing Carter a check intended for Jones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   FBI agents approached Carter soon after this final meeting. Confronted with the wiretap and video surveillance evidence, Carter agreed to help the FBI investigate Suhl and Jones. Agents watched when Carter-now working with the FBI- took Jones the check Suhl had given him at the dinner. Jones accepted the money, and the FBI confronted him. Jones also agreed to help the FBI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A grand jury indicted Suhl on one count of conspiracy in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; three counts of honest-services wire fraud in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1346 ; one count of federal-funds bribery in violation of 18 U.S.C \u00a7 666(a)(2) ; and one count of interstate travel in aid of bribery in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). After trial, a jury convicted Suhl on the federal-funds bribery count, the count of interstate travel in furtherance of bribery, and two of the honest-services wire fraud counts. He was acquitted of all other counts. The district\n   court imposed an 84-month sentence. Suhl timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, Suhl alleges three sets of errors. First he argues that the district court misinterpreted the federal bribery statutes, leading to errors in analysis of the indictment and instruction of the jury. Next, Suhl contends that the district court violated his right under the Confrontation Clause by limiting cross-examination of two witnesses, and abused its discretion by excluding evidence of his charitable giving. Finally, Suhl claims that the district court failed to accurately calculate the loss due to his bribery for purposes of sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Application of the Bribery Statutes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Suhl objects to the way the indictment and the jury instructions applied the federal bribery statutes to his conduct. Because Suhl's arguments involve the interplay of several anti-bribery statutes, a bit of background is useful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Federal statutes criminalize both the making and the taking of bribes, with separate subsections laying out different elements for defendants who pay bribes (the payor) and defendants who take bribes (the payee).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), (2) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (2). Suhl paid money to Jones, so he is a payor defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Suhl was charged under two federal bribery statutes. The first is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which criminalizes what we will call \"federal-funds bribery.\" Suhl was charged under the provision of the statute that makes it a crime to \"corruptly give[ ], offer[ ], or agree[ ] to give anything of value to any person, with intent to influence or reward an agent of ... a State ... or any agency thereof ... in connection with any business transaction ... of such [government] agency involving anything of value of $5,000 or more.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). A jurisdictional provision of the statute limits its application to agencies that receive \"benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 666(b). The parties do not contest that ADHS is such an agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The second statute is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1346, which together criminalize \"a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\" In\n   <em>\n    Skilling v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/358/\">\n    561 U.S. 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408-09,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283,3815903\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2896/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/358/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), the Supreme Court limited this statute's application to bribery and kickback schemes. Since Suhl was charged under a bribery theory, we will call this \"honest-services bribery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following\n   <em>\n    Skilling\n   </em>\n   , it was unclear where courts should look to find the elements of honest-services bribery. Some have sought guidance from the general federal bribery statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3536015\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/607/#p612\">\n    707 F.3d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612-13 (6th Cir. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cir. 2013). In this case, the parties agree that \u00a7 201 provides the elements of honest-services bribery. The relevant portion of \u00a7 201 makes it a crime to \"directly or indirectly, corruptly give[ ], offer[ ], or promise[ ] anything of value to any public official ..., or offer[ ] or promise[ ] any public official ... to give anything of value to any other person or entity, with intent ... to influence any official act.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Two Supreme Court cases relevant to our analysis have examined portions of \u00a7 201. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of California\n   </em>\n   , the Court explained that the words \"intent to influence\" require \"a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   -a specific intent to give ... something of value\n   <em>\n    in exchange\n   </em>\n   for an official act.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133273\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/398/#p404\">\n    526 U.S. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404-05,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133273\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/398/#p404\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133273\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/398/#p404\">\n    143 L.Ed.2d 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). And recently in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Court narrowly defined \"official act\" to mean\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   a decision or action on a \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\" The \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy\" must involve a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit before a court, a determination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/#p2371\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2371-72,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/#p2371\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) ). Merely \"[s]etting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event (or agreeing to do so)-without more-does not fit [the] definition of 'official act.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    at 2372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Indictment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Suhl argues that the indictment-which was filed pre-\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   -failed to state an offense, and that the government, rather than correcting its mistake by filing a superceding indictment, simply constructively amended the indictment at trial. We review the district court's refusal to dismiss the indictment de novo, and we will reverse only if the indictment is \"so defective that it cannot be said, by any reasonable construction, to charge the offense for which the defendant was convicted.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3162802\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/820/#p821\">\n    513 F.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 821 (8th Cir. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Suhl's argument appears to have several parts: (1)\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   applies to both honest-services and federal-funds bribery; (2)\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   requires an agreement between bribe payor and bribe payee to exchange something of value for an official act and, because the indictment did not allege an agreement between Suhl and Jones, it did not state a crime; and (3) when the government became aware of this problem, it constructively amended the indictment. We address each part of the argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Suhl asks us to apply\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   to both honest-services and federal-funds bribery.\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   interpreted the term \"official act\" in \u00a7 201, and the parties agree that \u00a7 201 also defines the elements of honest-services bribery. Section 666, however, does not include the term \"official act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Nevertheless, even if we assume that\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   's definition of \"official act\" applies to both honest-services and federal-funds bribery, we are unconvinced that\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   requires the sort of agreement that Suhl describes. Suhl cites to the language in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   wherein the Court explained that \"[t]o qualify as an 'official act,' the public official must make a decision or take an action on [a] 'question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy,' or agree to do so.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/#p2371\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that passage applied the definition of \"official act\" to the portion of \u00a7 201 dealing with\n   <em>\n    payee\n   </em>\n   defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) (requiring \"performance of any official act\"). The portion of \u00a7 201 relevant to payors like Suhl requires only an \"intent ... to influence any official act.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). The relevant portion of the federal-funds bribery statute likewise requires payment with \"intent to influence\" a state actor \"in connection\n   with any business ... of ... [a state] agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Neither of these statutes, nor\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   , imposes a universal requirement that bribe payors and payees have a meeting of the minds about an official act. A payor defendant completes the crimes of honest-services and federal-funds bribery as soon as he gives or offers payment in exchange for an official act, even if the payee does nothing or immediately turns him in to law enforcement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The indictment, therefore, adequately stated the offenses of honest-services and federal-funds bribery. Assuming official acts are required under both statutes, the indictment identified the official acts that Suhl sought to influence. It included transcripts of Suhl's phone calls with Carter, which detailed how Suhl asked Jones to increase Medicaid reimbursement to his companies, draw a larger area from which his companies could receive referrals, ensure his reappointment to a state review board, and end a referral policy that benefitted one of his competitors. The indictment incorporated these facts into both the honest-services and federal-funds bribery counts. All of these acts involved a request for the \"formal exercise of governmental power,\" as required by\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/#p2371\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2371-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That placed Suhl on fair notice that the government was alleging that he had paid money with an intent to influence official acts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3162802\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/820/#p821\">\n    513 F.3d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we do not understand Suhl to argue that the requests made in the phone calls detailed above did not qualify as formal exercises of governmental power under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Given that the indictment stated an offense, Suhl's assertion that the government constructively amended the indictment also fails. Constructive amendments occur \"when the essential elements of the offense set forth in the indictment are altered, either actually or in effect, by the prosecutor or the court after the grand jury has passed on them.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Begnaud\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1544031\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/783/144/\">\n    783 F.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147 n.4 (8th Cir. 1986).

Jury Instructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Suhl raises three objections to the jury instructions. He claims that (1) the honest-service bribery instructions did not require the jury to find that he bribed Jones\n   <em>\n    in exchange for\n   </em>\n   an official act; (2) the federal-funds bribery instruction did not require an official act at all; and (3) the federal-funds bribery instruction failed to identify a specific business transaction valued at $5,000 or more. \"[W]e review jury instructions for abuse of discretion, and will affirm the district court if the instructions, as a whole, sufficiently submit the issues to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court prohibited Suhl from probing the particulars of that conviction while cross-examining both Carter and an FBI agent. Suhl contends that in doing so, the district court denied him the opportunity to confront his accuser. But Suhl received that opportunity when he extensively cross-examined Carter. Suhl asked Carter about his voter fraud conviction and his agreement with the government. Carter admitted that the government allowed him to plead to only one count of voter fraud, charged him with only one count of bribery in connection with the Suhl scheme, and promised not to charge him with any other crimes if he testified truthfully against Suhl.

Any similar limitation on the testimony from the FBI agent was likewise permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to the district court's exclusion of evidence detailing the Suhl family's long history of giving to Christian causes, we review for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874615\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/1084/#p1089\">\n    650 F.3d at 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Suhl argues that this evidence was crucial to his defense because his track record of philanthropy undermined the government's theory that his payments to Carter's church were really bribes for Jones. We agree that evidence of Suhl's philanthropy was relevant to the issue of intent, but Suhl was allowed to introduce evidence of his regular contributions to Carter's church that were made long before the allegations contained in the indictment. Suhl himself testified that he was a frequent contributor to Christian causes. And Suhl's mother testified that Suhl's payments to Carter's church were not bribes, but were part of the family's long-running benevolence. Under these circumstances, we are reluctant to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the proffered evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nevertheless, evidentiary errors are harmless if they have only slight influence on the verdict and do not affect the defendant's substantial rights.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, the record contained strong evidence that Suhl's payments to Carter's church were exactly what the government said they were: bribes that Suhl intended to exchange for Jones's official acts. Multiple wire-tapped conversations documented Suhl's repeated attempts to pay Jones to take official action to help out his companies.

The court looked at Suhl's company records and determined that Suhl reaped a profit of 2.9% on Medicaid reimbursements in 2011, and a 0.9% profit in 2012. The court then multiplied those profit margins by the 2011 and 2012 Medicaid reimbursements received by the competitor from whom Suhl wanted Jones to divert clients. The court then added the 2011 and 2012 estimated profit totals together to get an estimated intended loss of $176,820.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This calculation is indeed an estimate, but it is sufficiently reasonable to avoid clear error. Intended losses are frequently difficult to calculate. Here, the district court based its calculations on concrete information: wiretaps of Suhl's calls that indicate his intent, the Medicaid profit margin of Suhl's company, and the Medicaid reimbursements received by Suhl's competitor. The resulting loss estimate was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Suhl contends that the facts do not back up the district court's calculation. Suhl argues that there is no evidence that Jones could get\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the juvenile Medicaid patients in northeastern Arkansas referred to Suhl's company. But the district court's loss calculation was based on the loss that Suhl\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   , and USSG \u00a7 2C1.1(b)(2) does not require that a defendant be successful in causing the losses he intends. A preponderance of the evidence indicates that Suhl paid Jones with intent that Jones divert all the Medicaid cases to his company. Suhl also asserts that he did not request a change in the referral policy until July 2011, rendering losses from the first several months of 2011 irrelevant. But the evidence indicates that Suhl first asked Jones to divert patients in 2010. The district court's loss calculation was not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Zimmerman did not apply \u00a7 201\"official acts\"-which were at issue in\n    <em>\n     McDonnell\n    </em>\n    -to \u00a7 666 as a whole or to the portions dealing with payor defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Suhl also argues that, because the district court's \u00a7 666 instructions were wrong, his conviction for interstate travel in furtherance of bribery must also be reversed. Because we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury on the federal-funds bribery count, we reject this claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The only details Suhl identifies on appeal are that Carter had engaged in voter fraud \"in connection with at least fourteen other elections,\" and received a \"50% reduction in sentence ... in part for his cooperation against Suhl.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    During deliberations, the jury asked whether Suhl belonged to Carter's church, whether Suhl belonged to any other church, and whether Suhl gave money to other churches. Suhl contends that the jury's questions prove prejudice, but he focuses only on the last of the three questions. Suhl does not argue that the district court excluded evidence that would have provided an answer to the first two questions. The jury's question about contributions was not answered directly at trial, but three witnesses testified that Suhl had a reputation as a very generous contributor to Christian causes. The jury's questions do not render the district court's decision to limit evidence of Suhl's charitable giving an abuse of discretion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
