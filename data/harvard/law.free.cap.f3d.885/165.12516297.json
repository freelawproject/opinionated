BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Omar Norvil Whylie Lewin, a native and citizen of Jamaica, was admitted to the United States in 1987 as a legal permanent resident. In 2000, Lewin was convicted of receiving stolen property in the third degree, in violation of New Jersey law, N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:20-7(a), and was sentenced to five years of probation. Seven years later, following a finding that he violated the terms of his probation, Lewin was resentenced to a term of four years of imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another seven years later, Lewin received a Notice to Appear, charging\n   him as removable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(ii)-(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   An Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") concluded that Lewin is removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G), based on his 2000 New Jersey conviction for receipt of stolen property and later resentencing, and that the conviction also barred him from relief in the form of cancellation of removal. The IJ therefore pretermitted Lewin's application for cancellation of removal. Lewin then filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied. His case was ultimately transferred to a second IJ, who adopted the original IJ's conclusions regarding Lewin's removability and ineligibility for cancellation of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lewin appealed that decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), arguing that his New Jersey conviction did not categorically constitute an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) and that the IJ had prematurely pretermitted his application for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision. It too concluded that, because Lewin's New Jersey receipt of stolen property conviction categorically constituted an aggravated felony under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(G), he is ineligible for cancellation of removal. It thus dismissed Lewin's appeal. He responded with this petition for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lewin's petition challenges only the sufficiency of the mens rea element of his New Jersey offense: he says that the minimum mens rea under New Jersey's \u00a7 2C:20-7(a) -\"believing that [the property] is probably stolen\"-renders that offense insufficient to categorically constitute an aggravated felony under the INA, specifically under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). He argues that, although the BIA properly applied a \"strict categorical approach\" when determining whether his conviction constituted an aggravated felony under the INA, it reached the wrong result. (Opening Br. at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We apply the categorical approach's element-by-element analysis to determine whether Lewin's New Jersey receiving stolen property conviction \"fits\" the generic definition of receiving stolen property that is contemplated by the INA under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G).\n   <em>\n    Rojas v.
