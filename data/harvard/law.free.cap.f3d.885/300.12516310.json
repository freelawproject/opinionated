At his sentencing, the district court applied a sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) of the Sentencing Guidelines based on McCollum's prior conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) for conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering. McCollum argues that the district court erred because conspiracy under \u00a7 1959(a)(5) does not require an overt act and is therefore broader than generic conspiracy. As we explain below, we are constrained by the Guidelines text and precedent to agree. The dissent, on the other hand, achieves the result it prefers by overlooking inconvenient Supreme Court and circuit precedent interpreting the Guidelines language at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we are reluctant to do so, we vacate McCollum's sentence and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   McCollum pleaded guilty in the Western District of North Carolina to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The presentence investigation report asserted that McCollum had two prior convictions that qualified as crimes of violence under \u00a7 2K2.1, the Guidelines provision that establishes the base offense level for a felon in possession of a firearm: a New Jersey conviction for aggravated manslaughter, and a conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) for conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering. These two convictions supported an enhancement that increased McCollum's base offense level from fourteen to twenty-four. The district court sustained McCollum's objection to classification of his New Jersey conviction as a crime of violence but held that McCollum's \u00a7 1959(a)(5) conviction was properly classified as such. Accordingly, the district court concluded McCollum had one prior conviction that qualified as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2K2.1 and that McCollum's base offense level was twenty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   McCollum argues that his enhanced sentence is unlawful because conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering is not a \"crime of violence\" since it does not require an overt act, while conspiracy under the Guidelines does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We review de novo whether a prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We conclude that \u00a7 1959(a)(5) is not categorically a crime of violence because conspiracy under that provision is, in fact, broader than generic conspiracy, and precedent directs that we consider the inchoate crime of conspiracy and its object independently.

The government disagrees. It argues as a threshold matter that we should not employ the categorical approach to evaluate a predicate\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   crime because we have never previously done so. Alternatively, the government continues, even if the categorical approach could be applied to some predicate federal crimes, it should not be applied to \u00a7 1959(a)(5) because it would be unreasonable to believe the Commission intended to exclude obviously violent crimes like conspiracies to commit murder in aid of racketeering from its definition of \"crime of violence.\" Moreover, the government contends that generic conspiracy, like common law conspiracy, does not require proof of an overt act. We address these issues below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We first consider whether the categorical approach applies to federal crimes like conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering. We conclude that it does for two reasons. First, although the Commission has not expressly addressed the issue, the text of \u00a7 4B1.2 and other Commission publications strongly suggests that it does. Second, we find no textual or analytical basis in our precedent for distinguishing the treatment of state and federal statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our starting point is the Guidelines text. The fact that under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) a \"crime of violence\" includes qualifying offenses \"under federal or state law,\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a), suggests that the two are to be treated similarly. And treating federal predicates similarly necessarily implicates the categorical approach. It is beyond debate that we utilize the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   construct and the categorical approach to determine whether a prior\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   conviction constitutes a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    495 U.S. at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Dozier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277314\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/180/#p185\">\n    848 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   183 ;\n   <em>\n    Shell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232438\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/335/#p340\">\n    789 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   338 ;\n   <em>\n    Carthorne\n   </em>\n   , 726 F.3d at 512-13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Notably, too, the Commission's 2016 Supplement to Appendix C explains that courts employ the categorical approach when applying the enumerated offense clause, and it offers no exception for federal crimes: \"The 'enumerated offense clause' identifies specific offenses that\n   qualify as crimes of violence. In applying this clause, courts compare the elements of the predicate offense of conviction with the elements of the enumerated offense in its 'generic, contemporary definition.' \" U.S.S.G. Supp. to App. C, amend. 798 (2016), at 129. If the Commission had intended for courts to apply the categorical approach only to state crimes, it could easily have made that clear. When the Commission wants to single out federal laws, it can-and does-do so explicitly. For example, the text of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) includes as crimes of violence \"unlawful possession of a firearm\n   <em>\n    described in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205845\">\n     26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)\n   </em>\n   or explosive material\n   <em>\n    as defined in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Therefore, we find that the Guidelines text supports the application of\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   's categorical approach to predicate crimes under both state and federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We next consider our precedent. The Supreme Court has not spoken directly to the point, but we are nevertheless bound by\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   's mandate: the categorical approach aims to realize the Commission's purpose that enhanced sentences follow convictions for \"crimes having certain specified elements,\" not crimes having certain names.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    495 U.S. at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Dozier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277314\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/180/#p185\">\n    848 F.3d at 185-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The government's argument that we should abandon the categorical approach when considering a prior federal conviction whose label is listed in the Guidelines does not effectuate this mandate. Both state governments and the federal government can write statutes with elements that deviate from those of the corresponding generic crime, and our precedent provides us with no basis for treating the two differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Furthermore, the government's position is undermined by the fact that there is no single federal definition of conspiracy that we can assume the Commission intended to adopt when it included conspiracy in the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2. The general federal conspiracy statute requires as an element an overt act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To reach this conclusion, it ignores the plain text of the federal statute and unmistakable textual command of the Guidelines provisions and commentary, which state in so many words that conspiracy to commit murder is a crime of violence. When the text is this plain, there is no reason to get into the ambiguous weeds of generic definitions, which can no more overcome a plain textual command than amorphous legislative history can overcome a clear statutory mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Even if one were to follow the elusive road to a generic definition the majority maps out, the conclusion would be the same. Neither the common law nor the great majority of federal conspiracy offenses requires an overt act. And state criminal definitions cannot be allowed to rework the textual clarity of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Dual sovereignty runs in both directions. Just as there are limits to federal control over state criminal systems, so too are there limits to state control over federal criminal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The majority's error is serious. In committing it, the majority ignores, misinterprets, or fails to follow Supreme Court and circuit precedent at every turn. In ignoring the Guidelines' plain text and in misapplying the basic generic-definition analysis, the majority has arrived at the deeply unfortunate conclusion that participation in a conspiracy to commit the enumerated violent crime of murder is somehow not a crime of violence. Properly applied, the categorical approach can ultimately coincide with common sense. Applied as the majority has done here, it reaches a result that no one inside or outside of Congress and the Sentencing Commission will ever\n   understand. True, there may be some beings in some other planetary system who can make sense of it all, but for earthlings, not so much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This case is easily resolved by the plain language of the Guidelines and their commentary.

This is not surprising. Murder is singular. It is the quintessential violent crime.

Awaiting help from elsewhere, as the concurring opinion prefers, is like waiting in a bus station for someone who has long since arrived. The answer is already abundantly clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   It is also commonsensical.

Rather, that is precisely the consequence of the majority's addition of an overt act requirement. Its dismissal of the common law, as noted, is no small matter. It will exclude from the Guidelines' crime of violence definition the vast majority of federal conspiracy offenses-including multiple murder-conspiracy offenses-and roughly one-third of all state conspiracy offenses. This is not what the Commission intended. Because the common-law definition of conspiracy is neither \"obsolete\" nor \"inconsistent with the [guideline]'s purpose,\" the search for a generic definition of conspiracy need go no further.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   But further the majority goes, and the more severe its error grows. For proper application of the multijurisdictional analysis in this case indicates that the contemporary understanding of conspiracy does not contemplate an overt act requirement. The multijurisdictional method of divining generic definitions calls upon courts to survey the overall landscape of criminal laws in the various jurisdictions across the country, including both the federal government and the states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    495 U.S. at 598-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Rangel-Castaneda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547870\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/373/#p376\">\n    709 F.3d at 377-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (consulting the laws of the federal government, the states, and the District of Columbia).

By putting a thumb on the scale, the majority warps the overall balance of relevant authorities, which in reality cannot be reconciled with its holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The lion's share of federal conspiracy statutes contain no overt act requirement. As the Fifth Circuit tallied in 2014, 24 federal conspiracy statutes require an overt act whereas 142 do not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pascacio-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064160\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/353/#p360\">\n    749 F.3d at 360-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But that provision covers a wide variety of violent and nonviolent offenses, and is therefore\n   far broader than the sort of conspiracy the Sentencing Commission was concerned with here. The great majority of federal conspiracy provisions dealing specifically \"with conspiracies to commit crimes that arguably would be within the definition of a 'crime of violence' \" contain no such requirement.\n   <em>\n    Pascacio-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064160\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/353/#p360\">\n    749 F.3d at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that 8 such provisions \"require an overt act, while 43 do not\" (footnote omitted)). Surely the Commission did not intend to exclude those offenses when it included conspiracy within the crime of violence definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The majority correctly notes that most states have added an overt act requirement to their own conspiracy statutes. Maj. Op. at 307-08. But the number of states that retain the common-law definition is by no means \"few.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    495 U.S. at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p599\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the majority sees it, this two-thirds cluster of state conspiracy statutes requiring an overt act \"is sufficient to establish the contemporary definition of conspiracy as such.\" Maj. Op. at 308. If those state laws aligned with the federal law, I might be inclined to agree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rangel-Castaneda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547870\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/373/#p376\">\n    709 F.3d at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To hold that the plain meaning of a guideline must change whenever the number of states shifts leaves federal law in an unstable condition. The majority inexplicably pays scant attention to federal law in its bean-counting exercise even though the text it claims to be applying is the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Our government is designed to accord respect for the distinct provinces of the dual sovereigns that comprise it. The principle of dual sovereignty reverberates in such varied contexts as the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against double jeopardy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heath v.

So too does that principle resonate in cases such as this. While the criminal laws of the states may help illuminate the definitions of generic federal crimes, it is ultimately the intent of the federal lawmakers that must control.
