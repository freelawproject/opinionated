According to Walker, he immediately told corrections officers Dale White and Catherine Amonds he feared living with Nash. Six days later, Nash raped Walker. Walker sued the two officers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for failure-to-protect in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The jury found for the officers. Walker appeals, arguing the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   made evidentiary errors. Having jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before trial, the officers moved to exclude any reference to officer White's disciplinary file. Walker wanted to cross-examine White about an incident that he thought showed White's character for untruthfulness. The district court refused to allow the cross-examination, because the \"unfair prejudice outweighs the probative value of it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Walker also moved to exclude any reference to his \"sexual orientation or sexual relationships/encounters.\" The officers responded that evidence of Walker's sexually-aggressive behavior toward previous cellmates was relevant to whether \"everyone should have known\" Walker was in danger. The court said that admissibility depended on how Walker presented his case. The court instructed the officers' counsel not to introduce this evidence \"until we've had a sidebar.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, with the rape stipulated to, the parties focused on whether the officers were aware of a substantial risk of serious harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Whitson v. Stone Cty.

Walker, testifying first, said Nash was \"six foot something,\" \"200 plus pounds,\" and \"well-known for sexual assaults.\" (Walker was five-and-a-half feet tall, and about 160 pounds.) Walker said that the day Nash moved in, officer Amonds told him she knew what Nash was \"capable of\" and would \"lock him up\" if there were any problems. Officer White added, \"You'll be all right.\" According to Walker, he told them he \"felt threatened\" by Nash, but did not ask for protective custody. Walker claimed he also told officer Douglas W. Baker he felt threatened. Walker admitted he did not mention this to any officers after these conversations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Walker then called White and Amonds to testify. White said he did not remember Walker, or any conversation with him. Walker did not attempt to ask White about his disciplinary file. Amonds recalled telling Walker-with White present-to let an officer know if he had any troubles with Nash, something she customarily told individuals with new cellmates. But according to Amonds, Walker expressed no fears. Amonds knew Nash to be a \"bully,\" but not violent or known for sexual assaults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The officers' only witness was officer Baker. He was in charge of cell assignments and had paired Walker and Nash. Baker testified, contradicting Walker, that Walker did not tell him he felt threatened by Nash. According to Baker, he did not talk to Walker during July 2012. Baker described his process of assigning inmates, pairing \"aggressive\" inmates with others who are at least not \"timid.\" Over Walker's objection (and after a sidebar discussion), Baker said he paired Walker and Nash\n   because of Walker's aggressive behavior toward cellmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Walker challenges the district court's evidentiary rulings. \"The admission or exclusion of evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion; evidentiary rulings are reversed only for a clear and prejudicial abuse of discretion.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Davis v.

Not why. You want to cross-examine him on it, or you're not going to introduce an exhibit?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   MR. MEYER [Walker's counsel]: It would not be through an exhibit. It would be under 608(b) through inquiry only on cross-examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. So tell me what the incident was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   MR. MEYER: So, Your Honor, the incident itself involved printing a photograph of an offender and writing derogatory comments on it and then the filing of the report and investigation that followed, and as a result of this, there were six DOC policies that were found to be violated. The final two included being truthful in reports, interviews, during investigations, inquiries, and other dealings with the public and staff and fully cooperating with all administrative inquiries and fully and truthfully relating knowledge of all facts pertaining to alleged behavior, and so I think both of these are properly brought in under 608(b) as specific instances of conduct that goes towards truthfulness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: ...

During Baker's testimony, Walker's counsel requested a sidebar and objected to any mention of his sexual history. The court overruled the objection. Baker then testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q. And could you tell us who was responsible for placing Mr. Walker and Jerome Nash in the same cell?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A.

Basically, [Walker's] past three cellmates, although everything matched up, they came one at a time, as it was over a period of time, complaining, begging to get out of the cell because of him intimidating and coercing them, pressuring them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Walker argues that Baker's statement is inadmissible, because his reason for pairing Walker and Nash is irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Fed. R. Evid. 401\n   </strong>\n   ;\n   <strong>\n    402\n   </strong>\n   . Even if relevant, he argues, it was inadmissible under Rule 412(a), which generally prohibits, in civil proceedings \"involving alleged sexual misconduct,\" evidence offered to prove a victim's \"sexual behavior\" or \"sexual predisposition.\" Such evidence is admissible only if \"its probative value substantially outweighs the danger of harm to any victim and of unfair prejudice to any party.\"\n   <strong>\n    Fed.

Alternatively, Walker argues the evidence is inadmissible under Rule 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This court need not address these arguments, because any error in admitting Baker's testimony was harmless. \"To be harmless error, the admitted evidence must not have had a substantial influence on the verdict.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Batiste-Davis v.

Baker's testimony had little, if any, probative value on the key issue whether Walker told White and Amonds he felt threatened. Walker relied on his own testimony to show that he did. The officers contradicted him, emphasizing inconsistencies in his story. Any additional effect of Baker's statement on Walker's credibility was insignificant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Walker argues Baker's testimony introduced \"sexual stereotyping\" and \"innuendo into the factfinding process.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Wardlow\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5926539\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/817/#p820\">\n    830 F.3d at 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the testimony actually admitted over Walker's objection was brief. Neither counsel alluded to it\n   again. It was non-inflammatory, not explicitly referencing sexual behavior. Finally, the rape-the factual issue where a jury might use sexual stereotyping or innuendo-was stipulated. Even if improperly admitted, Baker's testimony did not have a substantial effect on the jury's verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   *******\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The Honorable Catherine D.
