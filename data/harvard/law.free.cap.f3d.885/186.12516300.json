Appellants challenge an order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania\n   denying class certification. We will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2009, Appellants Patricia Wright and Kevin West filed suit in the District Court under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a proposed nationwide class of individuals who \"owned, own, or acquired\" structures on which certain Owens Corning-manufactured roofing shingles \"are or have been installed since 1986.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v. Owens Corning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    317 F.R.D. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 455 (W.D. Pa. 2016). Wright and West claimed that Oakridge shingles-an Owens Corning brand of fiberglass asphalt roofing shingles-are \"plagued by design flaws that result in cracking, curling and degranulation\" and \"will eventually fail, causing property damage, and costing consumers substantial removal and replacement costs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of Owens Corning, finding that Wright and West's claims had been discharged in bankruptcy by the 2006 confirmation of Owens Corning's reorganization plan. We partially reversed, concluding that the claims were not discharged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v. Owens Corning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731092,3876806\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/101/\">\n    679 F.3d 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108-09 (3d Cir. 2012). After the case was remanded to the District Court, Appellants Jaime Gonzalez, Gerald Boehm, and Edward and Diane Maag (together with Wright and West, Plaintiffs) filed three similar suits in district courts in other states, which were then transferred to the Western District of Pennsylvania and consolidated with Wright and West's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs are homeowners from Pennsylvania, Illinois, Texas, and California, on whose roofs Oakridge shingles were installed prior to 2006. They allege that their shingles have not performed as promised because they were manufactured \"in accordance with defective design specifications.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    317 F.R.D. at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of the named plaintiffs, three reported property damage and two had their roofs reshingled. The shingles were all subject to warranties of 25 years or more, which Plaintiffs argue amounted to affirmative representations about the shingles' expected useful life. Plaintiffs proposed two classes in the District Court: (1) a class of property owners from their four home states (the Four-State Class), asserting various combinations of state-law causes of action against Owens Corning; and (2) a nationwide class of property owners (the Nationwide Class) seeking a ruling regarding the legal standard governing whether Owens Corning can use a bankruptcy discharge defense to shield itself from liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs proffer the Four-State Class as either a money damages class under Rule 23(b)(3) or an issue class under Rule 23(c)(4). Plaintiffs define the class as follows: \"all individuals and entities that own a building or structure physically located in the states of California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, or Texas on which Owens Corning's Oakridge-brand shingles were installed from 1992 through 2012, and where those shingles manifested any cracking, degranulation, fragmentation, or deterioration during the warranty coverage period.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    317 F.R.D. at 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During the proposed 20-year class period, Owens Corning manufactured at least 23 kinds of Oakridge shingles at 13 different plants around the country using more than 500 design specifications. Plaintiffs did not dispute that all of these specifications met the applicable industry standard (ASTM D3462), which prescribes minimum measurements for newly manufactured shingles, such as \"tear strength, net mass, mat mass, asphalt mass, and mineral matter\n   mass.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs contended that in lieu of industry standards, defectiveness should be judged by the expected useful life of the shingles as represented by the applicable warranty period. According to Plaintiffs, compliance with ASTM D3462 did not consistently yield shingles that would last until the applicable warranty expired. In Plaintiffs' view, Owens Corning's design specifications sometimes yielded shingles vulnerable to \"premature deterioration so that they ... will actually only last 15 to 20 years.\" App. 247-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs claimed that Oakridge shingles had a propensity to fail before their warranties expired because of one or more of the following design flaws: insufficient asphalt quantity or quality, and insufficient mat mass and tear strength. Based on testing he conducted on 298 shingles, Plaintiffs' expert Dean Rutila opined that \"about half\" of the Oakridge shingles produced during the proposed 20-year class period fell on the \"low end\" of Owens Corning's specifications, which meant they were manufactured at or near the ASTM minimums.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    at 514, 523, 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Owens Corning challenged the admissibility of Rutila's opinions under\n   <em>\n    Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). The District Court ruled that all testimony based on Rutila's testing was inadmissible, but that he could testify to the general effect of various measurements on shingle performance based on his review of Owens Corning's internal documents, including design specifications and internal communications. For example, Rutila could testify that Oakridge design specifications produced shingles with a significant range of measurements, with only the \"high-end\" shingles capable of lasting for more than 20 years.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    317 F.R.D. at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rutila acknowledged, however, that the \"appropriateness of design specification measurements can only be judged in relationship to each other,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that \"a shingle would have to be individually inspected to determine whether it is a nondefective or defective shingle,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, Plaintiffs could not point to \"any particular measurement or set of measurements for the individual elements of a shingle that constitute a design defect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs propose that the Nationwide Class proceed under Rule 23(b)(1)(B) or Rule 23(b)(2), and that it include \"all individuals and entities that own a building or structure physically located in the United States on which Owens Corning's Oakridge-brand shingles are currently installed, where those shingles were purchased on or before September 26, 2006.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    at 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Through the Nationwide Class, Plaintiffs seek to mitigate what they perceive is a risk of inconsistent judgments resulting from the procedural history of this case prior to the consolidation of Wright and West's action with those brought by the other named plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 26, 2006 (the cutoff date for the proposed class), the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed a reorganization plan for Owens Corning after nearly six years of bankruptcy proceedings. Pursuant to the order confirming the plan and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201141\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , all claims that existed against Owens Corning as of that date were discharged. After Wright and West brought suit but before Plaintiffs' actions were consolidated, Owens Corning moved for summary judgment, arguing that the claims belonging to Wright and West existed prior to September 26, 2006, and were thus discharged when the reorganization plan was confirmed. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Owens\n   Corning, citing this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    JELD-WEN, Inc. v. Van Brunt\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Grossman's Inc.\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683962,3818142\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/114/\">\n    607 F.3d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2010) (en banc) (\"\n   <em>\n    Grossman's\n   </em>\n   \"). In that case, we held that for purposes of determining whether a claim is dischargeable in bankruptcy, the claim arises when the claimant is exposed to the debtor's product or conduct, regardless of when an injury is discovered.\n   <em>\n    Grossman's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683962,3818142\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/114/\">\n    607 F.3d at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For Wright and West, this meant that their claim arose when they purchased their shingles. Since that was before Owens Corning's reorganization plan was confirmed, the District Court concluded that Wright and West's claims were discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal to this Court, we declined to apply the\n   <em>\n    Grossman's\n   </em>\n   rule retroactively, citing due process concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731092,3876806\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/101/\">\n    679 F.3d at 108-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2012). We concluded that bankruptcy cases in which reorganization plans were confirmed prior to the\n   <em>\n    Grossman's\n   </em>\n   decision are governed by the dischargeability standard articulated in the case that\n   <em>\n    Grossman's\n   </em>\n   overruled, namely\n   <em>\n    Avellino &amp; Bienes v. M. Frenville Co.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re M. Frenville Co.\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"598784,6560542\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/744/332/\">\n    744 F.2d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1984).\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731092,3876806\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/101/\">\n    679 F.3d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since Owens Corning's reorganization plan was confirmed prior to our decision in\n   <em>\n    Grossman's\n   </em>\n   , we held that\n   <em>\n    Frenville\n   </em>\n   governed whether Wright and West's claims were discharged.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731092,3876806\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/101/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the\n   <em>\n    Frenville\n   </em>\n   standard, a court must look to the underlying state limitations law to determine when a claim arises.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731092,3876806\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/101/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 104 &amp; n.5. Thus, for example, a claim brought under the law of a state in which the discovery rule applies arises when the claimant discovers the injury. We affirmed in part and reversed in part the District Court's summary judgment, agreeing with the Court that Wright and West held \"claims\" under the Bankruptcy Code,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731092,3876806\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/101/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731092,3876806\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/101/\">\n    at 106-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but concluding that the Court erred in holding that those claims had been discharged,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731092,3876806\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/101/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731092,3876806\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/101/\">\n    at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On remand to the District Court, this case was consolidated with the cases brought in other districts by Gonzalez, Boehm, and the Maags. Because no class had been certified at the time of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   , that decision did not bind unnamed putative class members. Hence Plaintiffs' desire to certify the Nationwide Class, through which they seek a judgment declaring that\n   <em>\n    Frenville\n   </em>\n   governs the dischargeability of class members' claims-effectively giving our decision in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   binding classwide effect. Owens Corning concedes that, as we made clear in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Frenville\n   </em>\n   (not\n   <em>\n    Grossman's\n   </em>\n   ) applies in determining whether the claims against it have been discharged in bankruptcy, and it has repeatedly-including during oral argument-foresworn any intention of raising a discharge defense against Plaintiffs or future claimants. Plaintiffs nevertheless argue that classwide adjudication of the question we faced in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   is necessary \"[t]o avoid inconsistency and needless litigation for other consumers.\" Plaintiffs Br. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs moved for certification of the Four-State and Nationwide Classes. On March 31, 2016, the District Court denied Plaintiffs' motion.

They argue, contrary to the District Court's analysis, that Owens Corning would not be precluded from raising a discharge defense. Because of the discretionary nature of collateral estoppel when asserted by a plaintiff who was not party to the original judgment-what we call \"non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel\"-a court could theoretically decline to find that\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   precludes a discharge defense under these circumstances.

Put in terms of the\n   <em>\n    Step-Saver\n   </em>\n   factors, the judgment Plaintiffs seek on behalf of the Nationwide Class would lack both conclusiveness and\n   practical utility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Step-Saver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047170\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/912/643/#p647\">\n    912 F.2d at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As Plaintiffs acknowledge, because the\n   <em>\n    Frenville\n   </em>\n   test requires a fact-intensive analysis of each claim under the applicable state limitations law, a court's declaration that \"\n   <em>\n    Frenville\n   </em>\n   applies\" would not determine whether the claims held by individual members of the Nationwide Class were discharged. That would depend on the outcome of the\n   <em>\n    Frenville\n   </em>\n   analysis as applied to each claim. But Plaintiffs do not seek this relief. Instead, they ask that we now declare-as we did in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   -that\n   <em>\n    Frenville\n   </em>\n   applies, but this time in the class context.

Contrary to Plaintiffs' suggestion, such a judgment would not adjudicate the rights of the parties, since it would not decide whether, under\n   <em>\n    Frenville\n   </em>\n   , a particular class member's claims had been discharged. It would merely repeat, on a larger scale, what this Court has already held. We understand Plaintiffs' concern that\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   's preclusive effect might be left to the discretion of a distant tribunal in a hypothetical future case, but Plaintiffs do not cite, and we cannot find, any support for the proposition that this fact alone suffices to create a justiciable question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude that the sole common question the Nationwide Class asked the District Court to answer was not justiciable under Article III.

In the District Court, Plaintiffs pointed to two questions central to all claims that, on their view, predominated over individual issues: whether Oakridge shingles suffer from a common defect, and if so, whether Owens Corning misrepresented the shingles' expected useful life. As the District Court observed, the defect question is primary, because success on each claim requires a finding that Oakridge shingles are defectively designed. This is because \"[t]he only misrepresentations or omissions that Owens Corning is accused of making are\n   that Oakridge-brand shingles will last for at least 25 years, or for the same number of years as the limited shingle warranty.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    317 F.R.D. at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Owens Corning argued that \"[i]f a class member's Oakridge shingle was not defective, no warranty was breached.... Similarly, if [the] ... shingles were not defective, then Owens Corning's conduct was not ... actionable under the state consumer fraud acts; nor has Owens Corning unjustly retained any benefit.\" App. 2824. Defective design is therefore an essential element of Plaintiffs' misrepresentation-based claims, and whether it is susceptible to classwide evidence is dispositive of whether Plaintiffs can satisfy predominance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While the parties agreed that the defect question underpins this case, they disagreed about the implications of this fact for the predominance analysis. Plaintiffs argued that the defect question was common and predominant for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3). Owens Corning countered that while the question may be essential to this litigation, it could not be \"proven using classwide evidence,\" and thus neither could Plaintiffs' misrepresentation claims. App. 2824. During the proposed class period, Owens Corning noted, 23 types of Oakridge shingles were designed according to 500 different specifications. As Plaintiffs acknowledged, the useful life of a shingle could be estimated only upon inspection of that shingle. Finally, Owens Corning argued that Plaintiffs' admission that a significant proportion of Oakridge shingles may in fact last the length of their warranties,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , lack any defect, distinguishes this case from the defective-products cases Plaintiffs cited in which courts certified a class after finding a predominant common question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs argued that their theory of defective design did not require them to show that all Oakridge shingles were prone to fail during their warranty periods. According to Plaintiffs, all Oakridge shingles could be considered defectively designed, regardless of their actual measurements or performance, because Owens Corning's design specifications provided for a range of measurements that resulted in some shingles having a higher-than-advertised likelihood of failing before the warranties expired. It therefore did not matter that Plaintiffs' expert could not identify the particular measurements that supposedly rendered the Oakridge specifications defective. Regardless of the quality of the shingles on their own roofs, all Oakridge customers had unknowingly entered a \"shingle lottery,\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    317 F.R.D. at 478-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because this theory of defect applies to the entire class, Plaintiffs argued, a predominant common question existed and Rule 23(b)(3) was satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The District Court rejected this argument and agreed with Owens Corning that it would be \"impossible for plaintiffs to meet their burden to prove a design defect by evidence common to the class.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the presence of a design defect was an essential element of Plaintiffs' misrepresentation-based claims, the District Court concluded that they could not be proved by common evidence. Given that, as Plaintiffs acknowledged, the design defect and misrepresentation issues form the core of their theory of liability, the Court concluded that the inability to prove these issues through classwide evidence was fatal to predominance and thus to certification of the Four-State Class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs' theory of design defect-which absolves them of the need to identify any particular problems with their shingles-is the focus of Plaintiffs' appeal. According to Plaintiffs, the District Court's rejection of this theory was an abuse of discretion because the District Court: (1) misread product-defect cases in this circuit\n   and others; (2) improperly excluded expert testimony; and (3) contravened\n   <em>\n    Amgen\n   </em>\n   by assessing the merits of Plaintiffs' claims at the class certification stage. In the alternative, Plaintiffs argue that the District Court should have certified a \"liability-only class\" under Rule 23(c)(4) because that \"resolution of the common liability issues would materially advance the litigation.\" Plaintiffs Br. 21.

Here, by contrast, resolving the defect issue can be done only by examining each individual shingle or by accepting a speculative theory of defect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In this case, instead of alleging a defect common to the class that might be proved by classwide evidence, Plaintiffs invite us to equate the existence of a defect with the mere possibility that one might exist. We find no support in Rule 23 or caselaw for class certification on such a speculative basis. Far from abusing its discretion, the District Court properly concluded that Plaintiffs' novel reformulation of the concept of a product defect could not be permitted to work an end run around the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the District Court also abused its discretion by ruling inadmissible the testimony proffered by Rutila based on his testing of Oakridge shingles. The Court ruled that Rutila could not testify because, among other reasons, the results were tainted by selection bias and statistically insignificant in light of the millions of Oakridge shingles installed during the class period. As Rutila admitted, the 298 shingles he tested had been returned in connection with a warranty claim, so they were the antithesis of a random sample of Oakridge shingles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs make several arguments as to why the Court's ruling on Rutila's testimony was erroneous, but we need not address them, because our Rule 23 analysis is unaffected by the outcome. Even if all of the testimony offered by Rutila were admissible, Plaintiffs would not have been able to cure their inability to identify a meaningful defect in Oakridge shingles susceptible to classwide evidence. As the District Court noted, Rutila's testing did not enable him to identify when a shingle \"crosses the line and becomes defective.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125728\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/443/#p455\">\n    317 F.R.D. at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor would it have negated Rutila's own admissions that (1) one can identify a shingle as defective, however that term is defined, only after examining it individually, and (2) even shingles designed at the low end of Owens Corning's specifications will not necessarily fail before the end of their warranty periods. The fundamental problem thus remains: Plaintiffs cannot identify what is defective about their shingles, let alone how the unidentified defect is susceptible to proof common to all class members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is therefore unnecessary for us to undertake a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   analysis to determine whether the District Court abused its discretion in holding Rutila's\n   testimony inadmissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that, to the extent the District Court had reservations about their theory of defect, the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Amgen\n   </em>\n   required it to set them aside for purposes of the class certification decision: \"[t]he district court may not have liked this theory, but class certification was not the place to adjudicate it.\" Plaintiffs Br. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Amgen\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court cautioned district courts not to \"put[ ] the cart before the horse\" by allowing their views of the merits to affect their analysis of the independent question whether a putative class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23. 568 U.S. at 460,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407588\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/455/#p466\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]he office of a Rule 23(b)(3) certification ruling is not to adjudicate the case; rather, it is to select the method best suited to adjudication of the controversy fairly and efficiently.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407588\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/455/#p466\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).

To be sure, if defect is defined in the manner Plaintiffs propose, it does not require a leap to conclude that the alleged defect is susceptible to classwide evidence, since class members would not be required to show anything about their individual shingles. But Plaintiffs offer no support for the idea that it is a violation of\n   <em>\n    Amgen\n   </em>\n   to recognize at the certification stage that the \"question of defect\" they propose is only superficially a \"common question,\" just as any question becomes universal when it includes the word \"all.\" Nothing about\n   <em>\n    Amgen\n   </em>\n   or Rule 23 limits district courts in this way. As the\n   <em>\n    Amgen\n   </em>\n   Court recognized, merits determinations are permitted \"to the extent ... relevant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.\" 568 U.S. at 466,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407588\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/455/#p466\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is incongruous to argue simultaneously, as Plaintiffs do, that their theory of defect is central to their claims and that its coherence and legal foundation are irrelevant to the certification decision. By rejecting Plaintiffs' theory, the District Court did not find as a matter of fact that Oakridge shingles are not defective. It merely applied Rule 23's predominance requirement, under which Plaintiffs were required at the certification stage to identify a defect that affected all class members' shingles, regardless of whether the defect will ultimately be proved by a preponderance of the evidence at the merits stage. It does not follow from\n   <em>\n    Amgen\n   </em>\n   that a common question suffices for purposes of Rule 23 by virtue of Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   . Instead, it remains the task of district courts, through application of the rule's requirements to the facts and claims before it, to determine what constitutes a \"question[ ] of law or fact common to class members.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). The District Court's determination in this regard, while fatal to certification, was nonetheless squarely within the discretion afforded it by\n   <em>\n    Amgen\n   </em>\n   and Rule 23. What Plaintiffs attack as the District Court's \"obsession with the merits,\" Plaintiffs Br. 36, we conclude was instead nothing more than the \"rigorous analysis\" required to determine whether the proposed class actually met the requirements of Rule 23.\n   <em>\n    Falcon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186289\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/147/#p161\">\n    457 U.S. at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186289\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/147/#p161\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Our conclusion that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Plaintiffs' theory of defect for purposes of Rule 23 ends our analysis of whether the Four-State Class should have been certified under Rule 23(b)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we have explained, because Plaintiffs cannot show that liability for defective design is susceptible to classwide evidence, they are equally unable to show the same in support of their misrepresentation claims.

This is such a case. Unlike a situation in which a Rule 23(c)(4) class might be appropriate because liability is capable of\n   classwide treatment but damages are not, Plaintiffs offer no theories of liability for which classwide treatment is apt. The District Court therefore correctly determined that a Rule 23(c)(4) class would not \"materially advance resolution of the underlying claims,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828401\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/255/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828401\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/255/\">\n    at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , any more than would a class under Rule 23(b)(3).

The Court would not permit him to testify, however, as to what measurements of asphalt mass and net weight would ensure a non-defective shingle. Even if all of these opinions were admissible, however, they would not help Plaintiffs articulate a meaningful theory of defect susceptible to classwide evidence, for two reasons. First, an opinion that one measurement will guarantee adequate performance does not mean that anything less is defective. Second, as discussed at the\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    hearing, \"it is the relationship between mat mass, asphalt mass and net weight that must be coordinated in order to produce a shingle that will be reliable.\" App. 390. Thus, a shingle with an inadequate mat mass might not fail before the end of the applicable warranty period if its other measurements are sufficient.
