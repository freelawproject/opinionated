At the same time, the doctrine of qualified immunity in the excessive force context has continued to evolve. This appeal presents a question at the intersection of the Fourth Amendment and qualified immunity law. In the course of a felony arrest, may a police officer point a loaded gun at an unarmed suspect's head, where that suspect had already been searched, was calm and compliant, was watched over by a second armed deputy, and was seated on the bumper of a police cruiser 10\n   <strong>\n    -\n   </strong>\n   15 feet away from a gun found in the suspect's car? Because the facts are at this stage disputed, we take the facts in the light most favorable to the suspect. We hold that pointing a loaded gun at the suspect's head in these circumstances constitutes excessive force under the Fourth Amendment, but that the officers here are entitled to qualified immunity because the law was not clearly established at the time of the traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In December, 2011, Pete Copeland, a deputy in the King County Sheriff's Office (\"KCSO\"), was on patrol in the City of Burien, Washington. After watching Lawrence Thompson commit \"multiple traffic violations,\" Copeland pulled him over. Thompson apologized to Copeland but failed to provide a driver's license, although he did offer up some mail addressed in his name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When Copeland ran Thompson's identifying information, he discovered that Thompson had a suspended license for an unpaid ticket, that Thompson was a convicted felon, and that his most recent felony conviction was for possessing a firearm. Copeland decided to arrest Thompson for driving with a suspended license, and to impound Thompson's car, as required by a City of Burien ordinance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Copeland had Thompson exit the vehicle and patted him down for weapons. Finding none, Copeland radioed for backup, and had Thompson sit on the bumper of Copeland's patrol car. Copeland then conducted an inventory search of Thompson's vehicle. During his search, Copeland saw a loaded revolver sitting in an open garbage bag on the rear passenger-side floorboard. After seeing the gun, Copeland decided to arrest Thompson for violating the Uniform Firearms Act, a felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209.41.040\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9.41.040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thompson continued to sit on the bumper of Copeland's police cruiser, watched over by another deputy who had arrived for backup on the scene. Thompson was about 10-15 feet from the gun in the backseat of his car, and was not handcuffed. Copeland signaled to the deputy watching over Thompson, then drew his gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   What happened next is disputed by the parties. Copeland claims he unholstered his firearm and assumed a low-ready position, with his gun clearly displayed but not pointed directly at Thompson. By contrast, Thompson claims that Copeland pointed his gun at Thompson's head, demanded Thompson surrender, and threatened to kill him if he did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Copeland directed Thompson to get on the ground, face-down, so that he could be handcuffed. Thompson complied and was cuffed without incident. Copeland arrested Thompson for being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State of Washington charged Thompson with \"unlawful possession of a firearm.\" A Washington state court dismissed the charges after determining that the evidence against Thompson had been gathered in violation of the Washington State Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thompson sued Copeland and King County under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging violations of his Fourth Amendment rights. Specifically, Thompson alleged that Copeland used excessive force in pointing his gun at Thompson and threatening to kill him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In recommending dismissal of this claim, the Magistrate Judge noted that the question is \"whether the officers' actions are 'objectively reasonable' in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\" The Magistrate Judge found that the degree of force used on Thompson was reasonable given that Copeland was conducting a \"felony arrest of a suspect who was not secured, who was in relatively close proximity to a weapon, who was taller and heavier than him, and who had a prior felony conviction for unlawfully possessing a firearm.\" The Magistrate Judge concluded that \"Copeland's minimal use-of-force in effectuating [Thompson's] arrest was objectively reasonable\" and did not violate Thompson's Fourth Amendment rights. The Magistrate Judge also recommended granting Copeland's motion for\n   summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The district court adopted the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation, and dismissed Thompson's claims with prejudice, a decision we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Sandoval v. Las Vegas Metro.

Accepting Thompson at his word, as we are required to do at the summary judgment stage, Copeland pointed the gun at Thompson's head and threatened to kill him if he did not surrender. This type and amount of force can hardly be characterized as \"minor,\" as the government contends. We have previously held, in the context of a residential confrontation, that \"pointing a loaded gun at a suspect, employing the threat of deadly force, is use of a high level of force.\"\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221423\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/528/#p537\">\n    598 F.3d at 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to the government's interests, Thompson was suspected of driving with a suspended license and violating the Uniform Firearms Act-potential crimes of low and moderate severity, respectively. The safety threat either to the officers or the public was\n   relatively low. The government's claim that Thompson \"could have charged past Deputy Copeland and grabbed the revolver [in the back of the car] in a matter of seconds\" is weak. Thompson would have had to travel 10-15 feet to his car to grab the gun or make any use of it. Thompson had no weapon and had already been searched. He was sitting on the bumper of a squad car, watched over by an armed deputy. He was not \"actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    490 U.S. at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Reviewing the totality of the circumstances, the force used against Thompson was excessive when balanced against the government's need for such force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the end, \"pointing guns at persons who are compliant and present no danger is a constitutional violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Baird v.

We do not discount the concern for officer safety when facing a potentially volatile situation. But where the officers have an unarmed felony suspect under control, where they easily could have handcuffed the suspect while he was sitting on the squad car, and where the suspect is not in close proximity to an accessible weapon, a gun to the head constitutes excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Thompson's nighttime, felony arrest arising from an automobile stop, in which a gun was found, coupled with a fluid, dangerous situation, distinguishes this case from our earlier precedent. More specifically, Copeland was conducting a felony arrest at night of a suspect who was not handcuffed, stood six feet tall and weighed two hundred and sixty-five pounds, was taller and heavier than Copeland, and had a prior felony conviction for unlawfully possessing a firearm. Although Thompson was cooperative, the situation was still critical in terms of potential danger to the officers, especially given that a loaded gun was only 10\n   <strong>\n    -\n   </strong>\n   15 feet away.

Deputy Copeland signaled Thompson to pull over to the side of the road after observing Thompson's failure to stop at an intersection limit line and turning without signaling a full 100 feet before initiating a turn. Thompson pulled over and immediately apologized to Deputy Copeland for the traffic infractions. He did not have his license with him but he gave his name and corroborated his identification with a business envelope that was addressed to him. Deputy Copeland ran Thompson's name through a computer and learned that Thompson's license had been suspended for an unpaid ticket, and that he had a felony conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm. Deputy Copeland decided to arrest Thompson for driving with a suspended license in the third degree, a misdemeanor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2046.20.342\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 46.20.342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), and called for backup. After Deputy Fitchett arrived on the scene, Deputy Copeland asked Thompson to step out of the car and patted him down to verify that he was unarmed. Finding no weapons, Deputy Copeland directed Thompson to sit on the bumper of his patrol car under Deputy Fitchett's supervision while Deputy Copeland began an inventory search of the vehicle Thompson had been driving.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We must construe the events that followed in the light most favorable to Thompson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barboza v. Cal. Ass'n of Prof'l Firefighters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339596\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/1257/#p1263\">\n    799 F.3d 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1263 (9th Cir. 2015). Thompson alleges he remained seated calmly on the patrol car's bumper while Deputy Copeland searched his car, which was located 10 to 15 feet away. The State does not deny that Thompson was calm and cooperative. There is no allegation that Thompson was behaving erratically or threateningly, nor that Thompson was anything but fully compliant with the officers' directives as he sat on the bumper of the patrol car. The parties also agree that during his search of the vehicle, Deputy Copeland noticed a gun inside a plastic grocery bag on the rear passenger floorboard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The parties dispute what happened next. Deputy Copeland averred that he unholstered his weapon, held it in the low-ready position, and ordered Thompson to lie face-down on the ground. According to Thompson, Deputy Copeland unholstered his weapon, pointed it at Thompson's head, and threatened to kill him if he made a wrong move. In response, Thompson immediately lay on the ground and \"did not resist in any way.\" Deputy Copeland handcuffed Thompson without incident and re-arrested him, this time for being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A Washington Superior Court judge found that Thompson was stopped for pretextual reasons, in violation of the Washington State Constitution. The judge also found Deputy Copeland's decision to impound Thompson's car was a pretext to search for evidence and dismissed the charges against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The circumstances in Thompson's case plainly justified the display of some degree of force. Deputy Copeland knew Thompson had a prior felony conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm, saw a gun in the backseat of the car Thompson had been driving, and suddenly found himself in the unenviable position of having to effectuate an arrest of a felon-in-possession. Thompson acknowledges, and I fully agree, that it would not have been unreasonable for Deputy Copeland to unholster his gun and hold it in the low-ready position. But there is a world of difference between unholstering a weapon as a display of force while commanding a suspect to submit to arrest, and threatening to kill someone while pointing a gun at their head. Our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, specifically our en banc decision in\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. Solano County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9399908\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/278/1007/#p1015\">\n    278 F.3d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc), drew this line over a decade ago. Even if officers previously thought pointing a gun at an unarmed, unthreatening citizen was a show of force only nominally more severe than holding a gun in the low-ready position,\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   declared that the former has irrefutable constitutional consequences. Today, the court ignores this critical distinction and regrettably blurs the guidance\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Determining whether officers employ unreasonable force in effectuating an arrest requires \"careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

Courts face a difficult task in deciding where a particular factual circumstance falls on the spectrum between reasonable and unreasonable force, and we must always assess the force actually employed from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    490 U.S. at 396-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That said, in 2002 our en banc court declared the force used in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   was unreasonable.

It also agrees that, going forward, qualified immunity should not be available to officers who point guns at suspects under similar circumstances. Yet the court grants Deputy Copeland qualified immunity. It does so by concluding that, until now, the law had not made it clear to an officer in Deputy Copeland's position that pointing a gun at the suspect's head would constitute excessive force. The court offers two reasons for reaching this conclusion. Neither withstands scrutiny. First, the court likens Thompson's case to a traffic stop. That comparison would be apt if Thompson had been sitting in a car, because then a reasonable deputy might have feared that Thompson could reach a hidden weapon. But Thompson was outside of his car and well away from it, he had already been frisked, and he was under the guard of a second officer.
