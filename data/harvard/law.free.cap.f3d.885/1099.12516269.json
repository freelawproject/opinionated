A.S. placed advertisements for sex acts on Backpage.com; Paul rented hotel rooms where A.S. met customers who responded to the ads. Paul collected all the money A.S. received from customers. He bought A.S. food, alcohol, and drugs, and prohibited her from having a boyfriend or seeing men who were not customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Government witness D.R. testified that, in May 2013, she was paying Paul to drive her to customers who responded to her Backpage.com ads. Paul traveled to Rochester, Minnesota with A.S. and D.R. and rented a motel room to see customers. While in Rochester, looking to recruit a new prostitute, Paul took D.R. to his cousin's home where they pilfered the phone number of victim Z.S., who Paul knew was having sex with his cousin. At Paul's direction, D.R. texted Z.S., inviting her to a party. Z.S. and her friend, victim K.J., met Paul and D.R. at a McDonald's. D.R. testified the girls looked young and admitted after they were high that Z.S. was twelve years old and K.J. was sixteen. Paul \"didn't really care\" that the girls were so young. The group traveled to the Rochester motel in Paul's car, where Z.S. agreed to work for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Paul then drove the group to the Twin Cities. He argued with A.S. along the way, yelling at her and \"getting in her face.\" A frightened Z.S. decided she did not want to work for Paul and wanted to go home; she showed K.J. a text saying she was scared and asked K.J. not to leave her. In the Twin Cities, Paul took Z.S., K.J., and A.S. to a motel. He told K.J. he would make her a prostitute if she performed a sex act with him; they performed oral sex on each other in his car. Paul and A.S. told K.J. she would prostitute for a customer, but the customer never showed up after the police arrived on an unrelated matter. Z.S. testified that Paul told her he would kill her and K.J. and \"leave [them] on the side of Minneapolis.\" Paul drove the group to another motel, where he raped Z.S. while A.S. and K.J. stayed in the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Back in the car, A.S. told Paul her mother would take A.S. back to her parents' house in Alexandria, Minnesota. Angry, Paul told A.S. to take K.J. and Z.S. with her, have them meet customers, and \"show them how to make money.\" K.J. called her mother on Z.S.'s phone, went to the motel's front desk to call the police, and encountered a plainclothes officer. A.S. alerted Paul, who fled. A.S. went to Alexandria with Z.S. and advertised Z.S. on Craigslist.com. Z.S. engaged in sex acts with two customers who responded to the ads. Text messages from Paul to Z.S. congratulated her on the first sex transaction, telling her, \"I see you catch on pretty fast that's good.\" Paul texted A.S., telling her \"to stay off the road as much as possible because you really don't want to get pulled over while having a 12 year old in the car.\" When Paul attempted to collect the money Z.S. made at A.S.'s home in Alexandria, A.S. refused. Law enforcement arrested Paul at A.S.'s home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The superseding indictment charged Paul with sex trafficking Z.S. knowing that force, fraud, or coercion would be used and knowing she was under the age of fourteen (Count I),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1591(b) ; sex trafficking K.J. knowing that force, fraud, or coercion would be used and knowing she was under\n   the age of eighteen (Count II); and sex trafficking A.S. knowing that force, fraud, or coercion would be used (Count III). Paul argues the evidence was insufficient to convict him of each count. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Z.S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Paul argues the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction on Count I because Z.S. did not engage in any commercial sex acts while in his company, and he did not place the online advertisements marketing Z.S. to potential customers or arrange the two commercial sex acts. We conclude the evidence was sufficient to support Paul's conviction for trafficking Z.S. Paul threatened Z.S. at one motel, raped her at another, ordered A.S. to take Z.S. to Alexandria and have her meet customers, and congratulated Z.S. after her first commercial sex act. The jury could reasonably find that Paul \"harbored\" Z.S. or benefitted from a \"venture\" with A.S. that harbored Z.S., knowing that fraud, force, or coercion would be used to cause Z.S. to engage in commercial sex acts, or that Z.S. was under the age of fourteen and would be caused to engage in commercial sex acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In that case, all of the different ways of committing that same offense may be alleged in the conjunctive in one count, and proof of any one of the enumerated methods will sustain a conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In \u00a7 1591(a), many of what Paul labels separate crimes are in fact alternative ways of committing a single offense-the defendant violates the statute if he knowingly \"recruits, entices [etc.],\" or \"benefits ... from participation,\" knowing that \"force, threats of force, fraud, coercion ... or any combination of such means\" will be\n   used. The jury did not need to unanimously agree on which of those means Paul used, so long as each juror found he used at least one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A more ambiguous issue of duplicity is reflected in the title of \u00a7 1591 : whether two more distinct types of prohibited commercial sex trafficking-knowing that force, fraud, or coercion will be used to cause any person, including an adult, to engage in a commercial sex act, and knowing that recruiting (etc.) will cause a child to engage in such an act-are separate crimes. But here, the district court eliminated this risk of non-unanimity by instructing the jury, and reflecting on the verdict form for Count I (Z.S.) and for Count II (K.J.), that it must make separate findings whether Paul committed (i) \"the crime of sex trafficking of a minor,\" and (ii) \"the crime of sex trafficking by use of force, fraud, or coercion.\" In convicting Paul of Counts I and II, the jury unanimously found Paul guilty of both offenses against both victims.

For multiple reasons, we conclude there was no plain error. First, as the jury convicted Paul of sex trafficking of a minor in Counts I and II, and as the evidence that he used force to cause A.S. to engage in a sex trafficking act was overwhelming (Count III), the allegedly vague instructions defining the alternative means of fraud and coercion did not affect his substantial rights. Second, the district court defined fraud consistent with the common meaning of that term, and instructed the jury to apply the statutory definition of coercion. These definitions provided fair notice of what is prohibited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Maynes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263450\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/110/#p113\">\n    880 F.3d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113-14 (4th Cir. 2018). Third, the terms fraud and coercion as defined clearly encompassed the conduct of Paul at issue; a party \"who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.\"\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053959\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/983/#p987\">\n    782 F.3d at 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted).
