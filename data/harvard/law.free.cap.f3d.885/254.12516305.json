Abbott, a detective with the Manassas City Police Department in Virginia, investigated allegations that 17-year-old Trey Sims used his cellular telephone to send sexually explicit photographs and video recordings of himself to his 15-year-old girlfriend. During the\n   course of the investigation, Abbott obtained a search warrant authorizing photographs of Sims' naked body, including his erect penis. When Abbott executed the warrant, he allegedly demanded that Sims manipulate his penis to achieve an erection. Sims unsuccessfully attempted to comply with Abbott's order. The civil action before us is based on these alleged events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Abbott died before the present case was filed. Sims therefore initiated this action against Kenneth Labowitz, the administrator of Abbott's estate under Virginia Code \u00a7 64.2-454 (the Administrator).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sims asserted claims for damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that the search of his person violated his Fourth Amendment right of privacy or, alternatively, his right of substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sims also brought a claim for damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging that, as a result of the search, he was the victim of manufactured child pornography in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The district court determined that the Administrator was entitled to qualified immunity on the Section 1983 claims, and accordingly dismissed that portion of Sims' action. The court also dismissed the remainder of Sims' complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon our review, we vacate the district court's judgment with respect to the Section 1983 claim alleging a Fourth Amendment violation. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Sims, a reasonable police officer would have known that attempting to obtain a photograph of a minor child's erect penis, by ordering the child to masturbate in the presence of others, would unlawfully invade the child's right of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. We therefore remand Sims' Section 1983 claim alleging a Fourth Amendment violation to the district court for further proceedings. We also vacate the district court's dismissal of Sims' claim for damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   as an alleged victim of child pornography, and remand that claim for consideration by the district court in the first instance. We affirm the district court's dismissal of Sims' remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sims alleged the following facts, which we accept as true in our review of the district court's dismissal of the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zak v. Chelsea Therapeutics Int'l, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072535\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/597/#p601\">\n    780 F.3d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601 (4th Cir. 2015). In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Virginia filed felony charges against Sims as a juvenile for manufacturing and distributing child pornography in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-374.1,\n   18.2-374.1:1. The charges arose based on Sims' conduct of \"film[ing] a video of himself and fondling his erect penis\" and sending the video to his minor girlfriend using his cellular telephone. After Sims declined to enter into a plea agreement, the Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney for Prince William County, Virginia, Claiborne T. Richardson, II, sought a nolle prosequi, and the juvenile court dismissed the charges against Sims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The investigation against Sims continued and, at Richardson's direction, Abbott obtained a search warrant from a Virginia magistrate. The warrant authorized a search for \"[p]hotographs of the genitals, and other parts of the body of [Sims] that will be used as comparisons in recovered forensic evidence from the victim and suspect's electronic devices. This includes a photograph of the suspect's erect penis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Richardson and Abbott also obtained a detention order for Sims, which authorized Abbott to transport Sims from his home to a juvenile detention center. In a \"locker room\" in the center, Abbott and two uniformed, armed officers executed the search warrant. Abbott ordered Sims to \"pull down his pants so that photos could be taken of his penis.\" After Sims complied, Abbott instructed Sims \"to use his hand to manipulate his penis in different ways\" to obtain an erection. However, Sims was unable to achieve an erection. Nonetheless, Abbott took photographs of Sims' flaccid penis using Abbott's cellular telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The next day, Sims was arraigned on charges of possession and distribution of child pornography. Abbott informed Sims' attorney that Abbott again \"proposed to take photographs of [Sims'] erect penis\" to be used as evidence. Abbott also stated that if Sims could not achieve an erection, Sims would be taken \"to a hospital to give him an erection-producing injection.\" Abbott obtained a second search warrant from a Virginia magistrate, which authorized additional photographs of Sims' naked body, including his erect penis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before the second search warrant was executed, however, the Manassas City Police Department issued a statement explaining that the department's policy did not permit \"invasive search procedures of suspects in cases of this nature.\" Additionally, the Prince William County Commonwealth's Attorney, Paul B. Ebert, condemned the first search of Sims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sims' attorney filed a motion to quash the second search warrant. Before the juvenile court ruled on the motion, Richardson informed the court that the Commonwealth \"would let the warrant expire without service.\" Richardson also stipulated that he would not use as evidence the photographs of Sims' penis that had been taken pursuant to the first search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the juvenile court reduced the charges to felony possession of child pornography, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to convict Sims but did \"not make a finding of guilt[ ]\" and suspended imposition of sentence for one year. The court ordered Sims to comply with certain terms of probation, including performing 100 hours of community service, barring Sims from \"access to social media,\" and prohibiting Sims from sending \"text messages.\" After Sims completed the terms of his probation in August 2015, the court dismissed the charge against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Administrator filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court granted the motion, concluding that the Administrator was entitled to qualified immunity on the Section 1983 claims. The district court also dismissed Sims' claim for damages brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Sims contends that any reasonable officer would have known that this conduct violated Sims' Fourth Amendment right of privacy and that, therefore, the Administrator was not entitled to the protection of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response, the Administrator maintains that Sims failed to allege sufficient facts to support a Fourth Amendment violation because Abbott's search did not place Sims at risk of physical harm, and because the search did not physically invade Sims' body. The Administrator alternatively contends that even if Abbott's conduct violated the Fourth Amendment, such right was not clearly established at the time of the search because Abbott acted pursuant to a validly issued search warrant. We disagree with the Administrator's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review de novo the district court's dismissal of Sims' complaint on the ground of qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Ridpath v.

Further, the manner that Abbott employed to execute the warrant, namely, ordering Sims to masturbate to obtain an erection, required that Sims perform a sex act in the presence of three armed officers. Such alleged conduct necessarily invaded Sims' bodily integrity even though no part of Sims' body was penetrated or physically harmed.

With great respect for my good colleagues, their decision fails to recognize the controlling facts that undermine the \u00a7 1983 claim of plaintiff Sims. That is, Detective Abbott was acting pursuant to the advice of counsel and adhering to a court order. In my view, Abbott's actions were entirely consistent with applicable law and the Fourth Amendment. To explain my position more fully, this dissenting opinion contains three short segments. First, I emphasize the sanctity and importance of court orders. Second, I review the controlling facts and some guiding legal principles. Finally, I explain that Detective Abbott did not contravene any constitutional right and that he is entitled to qualified immunity.

There is little deterrent to excluding evidence where \"an officer acting with objective good faith has obtained a search warrant from a judge or magistrate and acted within its scope.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    468 U.S. at 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the existence of a search warrant plays a significant role in the determination of whether a search and seizure was reasonable. This principle is important, and it exists because the search warrant mandate insures the reliable and detached scrutiny of a neutral magistrate, rather than the judgment of a single law officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Put succinctly, where a police officer has sought and obtained a search warrant and acted within its scope, the resulting search is presumptively reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In this situation, the safeguards guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment were carefully observed-i.e., the search of Sims was conducted pursuant to a search warrant issued by the neutral magistrate, and it was supported by probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156920\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/333/10/#p14\">\n    333 U.S. at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156920\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/333/10/#p14\">\n    68 S.Ct. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   This was therefore a warranted search, carried out under the law of Virginia and in compliance with Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.

Therefore, the \u00a7 1983 claim alleged by Sims plainly fails the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Saucier\n   </em>\n   , that is, no constitutional right was contravened in these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Strikingly, Detective Abbott did not go directly to the Prince William County magistrate seeking the search warrant. He went first to that county's Commonwealth's Attorney and solicited the advice and approval of the prosecutor. We have recognized-in another qualified immunity case arising in the Old Dominion-that an investigating detective's \"conference with the Commonwealth's Attorney and the subsequent issuance of the warrants by a neutral and detached magistrate weigh heavily\n   <em>\n    toward\n   </em>\n   a finding that [the detective] is immune.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wadkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9963811\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/214/535/#p543\">\n    214 F.3d at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our\n   <em>\n    Wadkins\n   </em>\n   decision is precedent here, and it drew heavily on Judge Wilkinson's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Torchinsky\n   </em>\n   . As that decision adroitly explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   When a police officer protects a suspect's rights by obtaining a warrant from a neutral magistrate, the officer should, in turn, receive some protection from suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Otherwise, the threat of liability would force officers to continuously second-guess the considered decisions of magistrates. This in turn would promote delay in the execution of warrants, and alter the proper allocation of law enforcement functions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Torchinsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521692\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/942/257/#p261\">\n    942 F.2d at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In executing this search warrant, Detective Abbott was acting pursuant to a court order that he had secured on the advice and direction of the Commonwealth's Attorney. The search was thus reasonable and, in my view, Abbott did not violate any constitutional right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   If Detective Abbott somehow contravened a Fourth Amendment right (as the majority rules today), the \u00a7 1983 claim alleged by Sims would nevertheless fail under\n   <em>\n    Saucier\n   </em>\n   's clearly established prong, which requires an assessment of \"whether the constitutional violation was of a clearly established right.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

Indeed, Detective Abbott actually sought and obtained two search warrants-from two different magistrates-at the behest of the Commonwealth's Attorney. The initial search warrant was the only one executed, but two neutral and detached Virginia magistrates separately found probable cause to exist.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Importantly, nine of the ten court decisions relied upon by the majority to support their view of the clearly established prong involved unwarranted searches.
