That means we care only whether each predicate crime requires the government to prove that the defendant used, attempted to use, or threatened to use physical force against another-not what actually happened on that day. If a State convicts a person of criminal trespass, it would not matter whether he dug a hole or punched a security guard to commit the offense. Because our touchstone is whether the crime\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   physical force, not whether the criminal conduct\n   <em>\n    involves\n   </em>\n   physical force, our test case becomes the least forceful conduct generally criminalized under the statute.

Section 160.10 criminalizes \"forcibly steal[ing] property,\" which involves \"us[ing] or threaten[ing] the immediate use of physical force upon another person.\" And ACCA treats a state crime as a predicate violent felony if it \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(i).

The New York courts by and large have construed the statute to go beyond a mere touching and to include force that would cause pain to another.

This common law background provides a good reason to believe the \"physical force\" in the New York robbery statute means the same kind of physical force that ACCA requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Several New York intermediate court decisions have embraced this interpretation.

If we \"indulge in imaginative flights\" about different ways a law could be broken without physical force (or different ways to read a two-sentence lower-court opinion about a state law)-even, as here, when the law by its terms requires \"the immediate use of physical force\"-we run the risk of transforming many countable violent offenses into non-countable offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

There is something to be said for the point. Under the categorical approach, as this case shows, we map a hypothetical test case under an oft-evolving state law onto a federal law that itself can change from time to time. The approach creates serial opportunities for uncertainty. It is no exaggeration to say that interpretive complications in this area, like a flu virus, can spread exponentially. Plus, a principal rationale for lenity is notice-that \"a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand.\"\n   <em>\n    McBoyle v.

Yet when the federal courts of appeals find themselves twisted in knots trying to figure out whether a crime is divisible into parts, involves physical force capable of causing injury, or sweeps more broadly than a common law analog, it is easy to wonder whether an ordinary person knows what law applies to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   But this is not a good case for applying the rule of lenity, which may explain why Perez did not argue it in his appellate briefs. There is one salient feature of this case that provides plenty of notice of the best kind: the text of the New York law. And that law lines up exactly with ACCA. It is fair to presume that a crime requiring a defendant to \"use[ ] or threaten[ ] the immediate use of physical force upon another person,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20160.00\">\n    N.Y.

Courts need a good reason to deviate from such clear textual clues, and Perez has not met that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   One other thing. The lower court New York cases on which Perez relies are brief orders, devoid of anything more than a few sentences of reasoning, and susceptible to multiple interpretations.\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654616,655195\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/219/570/\">\n    219 A.D.2d at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"655195\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/219/570/655195/\">\n    631 N.Y.S.2d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142640,1143481\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/197/378/\">\n    197 A.D.2d at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142640,1143442\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/602/138/\">\n    602 N.Y.S.2d 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"38033,38820\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/255/167/\">\n    255 A.D.2d at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"38033\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/255/167/38033/\">\n    680 N.Y.S.2d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Safon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1015873,1016034,1015502,1015158,1015992\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/166/892/\">\n    166 A.D.2d at 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=560%20N.Y.S.2d%20552\">\n    560 N.Y.S.2d 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because our task is to determine what conduct can realistically (not merely possibly) be punished under the statute, there is no reason to give these cases any more weight than the New York lower court cases going the other way and certainly not more weight than the text of the law or the pertinent New York Court of Appeals decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Before concluding, a word of caution is in order. By focusing on the elements of state crimes and not the circumstances of particular convictions, the categorical approach endorses a generalized inquiry. That method limits the scope of the sentencing court's analysis, reduces decision costs, and promotes consistency between individual defendants. While that approach requires federal courts to examine state precedents to determine the scope of the state law at issue, that inquiry must be a sensible one-lest the benefits of the categorical approach evaporate. If we hyper-scrutinize the factual details of every prior conviction and hypothesize generalizations based on a few-sentence analysis in such cases, that takes us far afield from the categorical approach's mandate-and creates an unfortunate irony to boot. How odd to dissect the precise contours of all New York robbery convictions but one: the conviction of today's criminal defendant. We should pause before adopting a mindset that reintroduces-and multiplies-some of the very ills the categorical approach was meant to cure. Else, the occasional risks of the modest slope (reviewing state cases to understand the meaning of a state criminal law) will surpass the perils of the steep slope (reviewing\n   the facts of each defendant's relevant state court convictions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For these reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    DISSENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-52\">\n   MERRITT, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   There are many cases under New York's second degree robbery statute.

App. Div. 1995), in which the defendant was part of a human wall holding hands in order to block the victim's path as he attempted to pursue a pickpocket. No violence or threat. The New York court applied the statute. As a result, as my colleagues seem to admit, the First and Second Circuits do not consider the New York statute to necessarily require the use or threatened use of violent physical force. The application of the statute is uncertain, to say the least. On the question of force, the statute has been interpreted all over the place. The various umpires have different \"strike zones.\" As applied, the meaning of the statute is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   I would, therefore, apply the Rule of Lenity. When applying the Rule of Lenity in this situation, I would think that my colleagues would not apply the Armed Career Criminal Act to impose the longest possible mandatory minimum sentence. We have the choice of not applying the harsher sentence under the Rule of Lenity. But no. Given the choice of a harsher or milder sentence by this unstable maze of cases, the Court chooses the harsher sentence. Why? I don't know. I leave it to the reader to speculate.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The Honorable Robert H.
