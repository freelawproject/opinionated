FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff William King was incarcerated in a Los Angeles County jail for almost eight years, from November 2005 to August 2013, as a civil detainee while awaiting the adjudication of an involuntary commitment petition under California's Sexually Violent Predator Act (\"SVPA\"). The reason for the extensive delay in adjudicating the petition does not appear in the record. For more than six of his years in the county jail, King was confined in Administrative Segregation (\"AdSeg\") along with criminal detainees. As an SVP detainee, King was compelled to wear a distinctive red uniform that made clear that he had been convicted of a sex crime. As a result, King was attacked in AdSeg by a criminal inmate who slashed King's cheek, chin, neck, and thigh with a modified razor while shouting, \"Die, baby raper, die!\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   King brought suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , contending that his conditions of confinement violated substantive due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

A \"sexually violent predator\" is a \"person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against one or more victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6600. Inmates held during the pendency of SVPA commitment proceedings are civil detainees.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173792\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/918/#p931\">\n    393 F.3d at 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2005, a petition was filed to commit King under the SVPA, and a successive petition was filed in 2007. King had previously served sentences for two rape convictions. Pending the resolution of the petition, King was detained at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility (\"TTCF\"), a Los Angeles County jail. TTCF houses SVP detainees in the jail's SVP unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The SVP unit consists of one or more \"pods\" in a \"module,\" or section, of TTCF. A pod in the SVP unit contains sixteen two-person cells in which detainees sleep, and a communal day room. In the day room are eight metal tables, each with four attached metal stools, and a television. The floor is concrete. The television is encased in a metal and plexiglass box. For a time, the day room contained portable bunks on which several detainees, including King, slept. Finally, each module has a single room with one large window facing outside and covered by a metal-wire mesh screen, for detainees' \"outdoor recreation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Detainees in the SVP unit were housed separately from the jail's criminal population, but were subject to essentially the same regime. Except during the holidays, SVP detainees were locked in their cells at night. SVP detainees were not allowed to make or receive direct telephone calls. They were not allowed to have \"contact visits\" with anyone, including family members. They were not allowed to possess property such as personal radios, televisions, computers, telephones, and athletic shoes and clothing. They were not allowed direct access to photocopy machines, even if they were representing themselves in legal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"As a courtesy,\" SVP detainees received a few \"privileges\" that were not available to the criminal detainee population. Jail regulations provided, \"Upon availability, and as a courtesy, SVP inmates may be issued one extra blanket.\" \"As a courtesy, SVP inmates may receive hot water servings during [the] AM shift and at the discretion of module staff.\" \"As a courtesy, plastic chairs are permitted in the SVP inmate pod and shall not be assigned to any particular inmate. No more than 10\n   chairs are permitted in the pod at any given time. Chairs will be permitted after the morning meal and shall be removed from the pod at 2130 hours.\" \"As a courtesy, each SVP inmate may retain a cardboard property box, green property bag and 3 file folders for the storage of legal material.\" \"As a courtesy, daily television programming may be scheduled by SVP inmates.\" \"As a courtesy, SVP inmates are permitted visits seven days a week, but no more than two thirty-minute visits per week.\" During such visits, \"SVP inmates shall be handcuffed to the single-cuff chain attached to the visiting stool.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The precise dates King was housed in the SVP unit are not entirely clear. For purposes of this opinion, we rely on King's \"Inmate Information\" log maintained by TTCF. According to the log, King was housed in the SVP unit from November 2005 until February 2006, and again from March 2007 to February 2008, for a total of a year and three months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the remainder of his time at TTCF, King was confined in AdSeg along with criminal detainees, in conditions indistinguishable from theirs. Detention in AdSeg was highly restrictive. AdSeg inmates were housed in single-person cells and had \"their dayroom time alone.\" Inmates were handcuffed when moved out of their cells. They were not allowed out of their cells for religious services. According to official jail policy, they were given \"a minimum of three hours of [outdoor] exercise and recreation ... over a period of seven days.\" According to King, however, he was never let out of his cell for \"more than thirty minutes a day to shower and make a brief phone call.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to his \"Inmate Information\" log, King spent just over a year in AdSeg, from February 2006 to March 2007. After less than a year back in the SVP unit, he was returned to AdSeg in February 2008, where he remained until August 2013. His total time in AdSeg was about six and a half years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants claim that King was kept in AdSeg because of his \"violent tendencies.\" During King's time at TTCF, he was involved in several disciplinary incidents, and was eventually designated as a \"High Security K-10\" status inmate. According to one of the Sheriff's deputies, \"[a] K-10 classification is utilized for inmates who, based on confirmed information, require administrative segregation from the general population at all times.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   King provides evidence that, if believed, shows that he was improperly given a K-10 classification. Among other things, King asserts that another inmate lied to convince jail staff that King was dangerous and violent, and that jail officials did not follow appropriate procedures to determine the truth of the inmate's charges against King. Taking the facts in the light most favorable to King, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether King displayed violent tendencies sufficient to justify assigning him to AdSeg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   King's detention in AdSeg was particularly harsh because of his SVP detainee status. To distinguish types of detainees and inmates, TTCF required uniforms of different colors. SVP detainees wore red uniforms. Juveniles were the only other inmates who wore red uniforms. King was almost sixty years old in 2006, when he was first placed in AdSeg, which readily distinguished him from juveniles. While in AdSeg, King was threatened repeatedly with death for being a \"child molester.\" Someone taped signs at or next to King's cell, singling him out as a \"child molester.\" One criminal inmate \"spent his entire half-hour out-of-cell time exhorting other Ad. Seg. residents to fulfill their [duty] to kill all child molesters.\" In November 2006, a criminal inmate attacked King with a\n   \"makeshift knife\" or \"altered razor\" while screaming, \"Die, baby raper, die!\" King was cut on his left cheek, chin, neck, and thigh. King repeatedly requested that he be returned to the SVP unit. After his placement in AdSeg in February 2008, his requests to return to the SVP unit were consistently denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In April 2012, Defendants attempted to transfer King out of TTCF to Coalinga State Hospital (\"Coalinga\"), even though his petition had not yet been adjudicated. Coalinga was the designated hospital for persons committed as \"sexually violent predators.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206600.05\">\n    Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code \u00a7 6600.05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For reasons unexplained in the record, after six and a half years of confinement in TTCF, King's civil commitment process still had not been completed. King feared that consenting to the transfer to Coalinga would prejudice his ability to contest his civil commitment, and he therefore informed the Mental Health Court that he wished to stay in TTCF pending the resolution of his petition. In August 2013, King was finally transferred to Coalinga.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To describe the conditions at Coalinga, we take judicial notice of the undisputed and publicly available information displayed on government websites.\n   <em>\n    Daniels-Hall v.

Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 23, 2010, King filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint against Defendants, alleging that the conditions of his confinement in the SVP unit and in AdSeg violated his right to due process. He sought monetary damages and injunctive relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The district court dismissed as time barred King's claims based on his detention between November 2005 and January 2006. For the remaining period, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants. With respect to King's detention in the SVP unit, the district court found that King had not provided admissible evidence of conditions at Coalinga, preventing the court from making the necessary comparisons under\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Blanas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173792\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/918/#p931\">\n    393 F.3d 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2004). With respect to King's detention in AdSeg, the court found that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was a legitimate, non-punitive justification for holding King in AdSeg, pointing to his alleged \"violent tendencies.\" The court rejected King's claims against Sheriff Baca in his individual capacity on the additional ground that King had not established a causal connection between Sheriff Baca's conduct and King's placement in AdSeg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   King appealed.

As to the first presumption, comparing the conditions of confinement in the SVP unit \"to ... those in which [the SVP detainees'] criminal counterparts [we]re held\" in TTCF, we conclude that conditions were \"similar.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173792\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/918/#p931\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173792\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/918/#p931\">\n    at 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only difference between the conditions of confinement for SVP detainees and their criminal counterparts was that SVP detainees were provided specified \"privileges,\" not as a right but \"as a courtesy\": an extra blanket \"upon availability\"; \"hot water servings\" at the discretion of staff; \"no more than\" ten plastic chairs in the day room during the day; \"a cardboard box, a green property bag and 3 file folders\"; the ability to schedule television programming; and no-contact thirty-minute visits twice a week while chained to a metal stool. These \"privileges\" did not change the basic nature of the SVP detainees' incarceration in TTCF. The reality was that SVP detainees in TTCF were subject to essentially the same conditions of confinement as their criminal counterparts. They were confined to their pod; they were not allowed outside and were exposed to fresh air only through a screened window; and they were given minimal opportunity for recreation and exercise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As to the second presumption, comparing the conditions of confinement for those \"awaiting SVPA adjudication\" to those \"following SVPA commitment,\" we conclude that conditions in the SVP unit in TTCF were \"more restrictive\" than conditions at Coalinga.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173792\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/918/#p931\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173792\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/918/#p931\">\n    at 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The comparison between the two facilities is so stark that we need not belabor the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We hold, further, that King's confinement in AdSeg also triggers both presumptions. As to the first presumption, the conditions in AdSeg to which King was subjected were \"substantially more restrictive\" than even the conditions faced by the jail's general criminal population.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173792\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/918/#p931\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173792\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/918/#p931\">\n    at 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For King, they were especially harsh, as he was required to wear a red uniform, signaling that he was an SVP detainee and therefore, in the view of some of the criminal detainees, a child molester or rapist. As a direct result, King was viciously attacked while in AdSeg. As to the second presumption, the conditions in AdSeg were\n   vastly different from the conditions at Coalinga.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   2.

The district court should also take into consideration the extended period during which King was held in TTCF. It is one thing to confine an SVP detainee in a county jail for a few months while awaiting adjudication of a civil commitment petition. For such brief periods, it may be justifiable to hold him in an SVP unit and to subject him to many of the jail's rules and policies. Further, if during that period he commits a serious disciplinary infraction, it may be permissible to confine him for a limited time in AdSeg, as long as appropriate procedural protections are provided before such confinement. However, it is quite another thing to confine an SVP detainee for an extended period in a county jail's SVP unit or AdSeg. In this case, King was confined as a civil detainee in TTCF for almost eight years-in the SVP unit for a year and three months, and in AdSeg for six and a half years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   B.

Second, Unit Order 5-17-011 established TTCF's AdSeg policy, including criteria for holding inmates in AdSeg and restrictions on AdSeg inmates.
