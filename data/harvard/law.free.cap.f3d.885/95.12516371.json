One of the two exceptions is relevant here: the exception for excavations less than five feet deep.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201926.652\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Application\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We conclude that the ALJ did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof. First, the ALJ properly placed the burden of proof on Triumph to demonstrate that its site fell within the exception for excavations less than five feet deep under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201926.652\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(ii). It was in the context of Triumph's argument that \"the area in the excavation where [the injured worker] was working was shallower than five feet,\" Sp. App. 26, that the ALJ considered Triumph's failure to present Formoso's testimony. The ALJ relied on the missing testimony as one of several factors to evaluate the credibility of one of Triumph's testifying witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the depth of the excavation was not an issue that turned on which party bore the burden of proof. The great weight of evidence established that the excavation was more than five feet deep, including (1) empirical measurements taken by OSHA recording depths of 64, 68, and 70 inches at the site, (2) the testimony of the injured worker, and (3) the testimony of the city's inspector.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Look Back Period\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Next, Triumph notes that the Commission has a policy of using a three-year look back period to determine a repeat violation, and argues that here the Commission failed to provide a reasoned explanation\n   for relying on previous violations more than three years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Applicable Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Act authorizes an enhanced civil penalty against any employer who \"repeatedly violates ... any standard\" promulgated pursuant to the Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither the Act nor OSHA's implementing regulations prescribe any temporal limits for determining whether a violation is repeated. In arguing that the Commission arbitrarily departed from its own policy, Triumph contends that the OSHA Field Operations Manual (the \"Manual\"), dated April 22, 2011, was in effect at the time of the February 13, 2015, citation and dictates a three-year look back period for assessing repeat violations-not the five-year period relied on by the Commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relevant language in the Manual provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Although there are no statutory limitations on the length of time that a prior citation was issued as a basis for a repeated violation, the following policy shall generally be followed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A citation will be issued as a repeated violation if ... [t]he citation is issued within 3 years of the final order date of the previous citation or within 3 years of the final abatement date, whichever is later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Joint App. 653.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Application\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We conclude that the Commission did not abuse its discretion by relying on previous violations more than three years old, because neither the Manual nor the Commission's precedent limits OSHA to a three-year look back period. The Manual explicitly notes that \"there are no statutory limitations on the length of time that a prior citation was issued as a basis for a repeated violation\" and describes a policy that \"shall\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   be followed.\" Joint App. 653 (emphasis added). The Manual is \"only a guide for OSHA personnel to promote efficiency and uniformity, [is] not binding on OSHA or the Commission, and [does] not create any substantive rights for employers.\"\n   <em>\n    Secretary of Labor v.
