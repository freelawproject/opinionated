A jury convicted her of two counts of capital murder. She was sentenced to death. Chamberlin, who is white, appealed her conviction, arguing in part that the prosecution invidiously discriminated against\n   black prospective jurors during jury selection at her trial in violation of\n   <em>\n    Batson v. Kentucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    476 U.S. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    90 L.Ed.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). Her appeal made its way through the Mississippi court system, where it was denied at every stage. She then turned to federal court, petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court granted Chamberlin's petition and ordered the State to give her a new trial, finding that the Mississippi Supreme Court erred when it concluded that the prosecution did not discriminate against black prospective jurors at Chamberlin's jury selection. Mississippi appealed to a panel of this court, which affirmed in a split decision. We agreed to hear the case en banc and now REVERSE the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The gruesome details of Chamberlin's crimes have been laid out in detail several times-we need not reiterate them here. The evidence against her was substantial; she was duly convicted by a jury of her peers of two counts of capital murder. What is essential to this appeal is not what happened during the trial, however, but rather what took place before the trial began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. Jury Selection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Chamberlin's jury selection began with a pool of 42 qualified jurors, thirteen of whom-31%-were black. The prosecution and defense were each entitled to exercise up to fourteen peremptory strikes. The prosecution began by moving through a batch of prospective jurors, striking or keeping as it went. The defense then went through the jurors the prosecution had accepted, exercising its peremptory strikes as it wished. Any jurors that were accepted by both the prosecution and defense were put on the jury, and the prosecution then began again with a fresh batch. This procedure continued until twelve jurors and two alternates were selected. The prosecution exercised thirteen of its peremptory strikes throughout the process; the defense used all fourteen. Ultimately, Chamberlin's jury consisted of ten white jurors, two black jurors, and two white alternates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Chamberlin's counsel objected to the prosecution's use of peremptory strikes against black prospective jurors throughout jury selection. The trial court expressed doubts that Chamberlin had established a prima facie case under the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   framework, but asked the prosecution for its race-neutral reasons for the strikes in any case. The prosecution's race-neutral reasons for striking two specific prospective black jurors are pertinent here. When asked to explain its strikes of black prospective jurors Sturgis and Minor, the prosecution pointed to their answers to three questions on the jury questionnaire. Both answered questions 30, 34, and 35 in ways that indicated they were uneasy with the prospect of announcing a verdict of death and might hold the government to a higher burden of proof than the law requires. The defense responded to these proffered race-neutral reasons on general grounds, arguing that both Sturgis and Minor \"could be ... fair-minded jurors on the question of the death penalty.\" Relevant to this appeal, at no point did Chamberlin's counsel seek a comparative juror analysis between black jurors the prosecution struck and white jurors it accepted, nor did the trial court conduct such a comparison\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   . The trial court rejected Chamberlin's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   argument and the trial proceeded apace. Chamberlin was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B. Mississippi Supreme Court\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Mississippi Supreme Court had two separate opportunities to review Chamberlin's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claim. It rejected her contentions both times. First was Chamberlin's direct appeal, where she argued that the trial court erred in denying her\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, focusing on the prosecution's strikes of seven black prospective jurors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chamberlin v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210969\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/989/320/#p336\">\n    989 So.2d 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 336 (Miss. 2008). The court concluded that Chamberlin's argument as to four of the prospective jurors was procedurally barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210969\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/989/320/#p336\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210969\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/989/320/#p336\">\n    at 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As for the other three, the court concluded that \"Chamberlin argued reasons why they would make good jurors but failed to rebut the specific reasons proffered by the State for striking them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210969\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/989/320/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the court found that, \"[c]onsidering the totality of the evidence, the trial court's ruling on Chamberlin's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge was neither clearly erroneous nor against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210969\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/989/320/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Just as in the trial court, Chamberlin's counsel never sought a comparative juror analysis on direct appeal, nor did the Mississippi Supreme Court perform such an analysis\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Chamberlin's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claim again came before the Mississippi Supreme Court two years later when she filed a motion for post-conviction relief, arguing in relevant part that her state trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to adequately argue her\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge. This time Chamberlin specifically argued that her counsel \"should have performed a comparative jury analysis, which would have demonstrated disparate treatment of the jurors, indicating that the State's strikes were pretextual.\"\n   <em>\n    Chamberlin v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038876\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/55/1046/#p1051\">\n    55 So.3d 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1051 (Miss. 2010). In response to this contention, the Mississippi Supreme Court conducted a \"thorough review of the record ... including the jury questionnaires provided by Chamberlin,\" and concluded that each of the black jurors struck gave responses \"in his or her jury questionnaire that differentiated him or her from the white jurors who were accepted by the State.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038876\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/55/1046/#p1051\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038876\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/55/1046/#p1051\">\n    at 1051-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court was therefore \"unable to find disparate treatment of the struck jurors\" and concluded that Chamberlin's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claim was \"without merit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   C. Federal Habeas\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Having failed to get the desired relief from the Mississippi courts, Chamberlin petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. Her petition listed thirteen grounds for relief, among them that the Mississippi Supreme Court clearly erred in denying Chamberlin's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chamberlin v. Fisher\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Chamberlin I\n   </em>\n   \"), No. 11CV72CWR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201485901\">\n    2015 WL 1485901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 n.3 (S.D. Miss. Mar. 31, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court granted Chamberlin's petition, finding that her\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claim warranted federal relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\"). AEDPA provides two grounds upon which a federal court can grant habeas relief for claims decided in state court: if the state court decision (1) \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) ; or (2) \"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). The district court concluded that both grounds for relief applied in Chamberlin's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   First, the district court interpreted the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Miller-El v. Dretke\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Miller-El II\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n    545 U.S. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n    162 L.Ed.2d 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), as requiring a state court to conduct a comparative juror analysis between black jurors who were struck by the prosecution and white jurors who were kept, even where the defendant had not sought any such comparison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chamberlin I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201485901\">\n    2015 WL 1485901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17. Accordingly, the district court found that \"the Mississippi Supreme Court's failure to conduct a comparative analysis was contrary to clearly established federal law requiring that analysis, as announced in\n   <em>\n    Miller-El\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   ].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201485901\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court further held that the lack of comparative juror analysis rendered \"the state court's conclusion that there was no showing of purposeful discrimination ... incomplete.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201485901\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It concluded that the lack of comparative analysis \"required by federal law\" rendered the Mississippi Supreme Court's \"factfinding procedures ...

It reasoned that because the Mississippi Supreme Court failed to do so, its decision on Chamberlin's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   case was both unreasonable as a matter of law and so infirm as a factual matter so as to not be entitled to the substantial deference AEDPA would otherwise require.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"In reviewing a grant of habeas relief, the Court examines 'factual findings for clear error and issues of law de novo.' \"\n   <em>\n    Richards v.

At no point did\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    suggest that the state court in that case violated the petitioner's constitutional rights by failing to adhere to such a procedural rule.

Chamberlin's\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    claim was inextricably intertwined with the ineffective assistance of counsel argument she raised at the postconviction proceeding. She argued in relevant part that her trial counsel was ineffective because he should have sought a comparative juror analysis in the trial court. In response to this contention, the Mississippi Supreme Court stated that it\n    <em>\n     had\n    </em>\n    conducted a \"thorough review of the record ... including the jury questionnaires provided by Chamberlin.\"\n    <em>\n     Chamberlin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038876\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/55/1046/#p1051\">\n     55 So.3d at 1051-52\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It found no evidence of \"disparate treatment of the struck jurors,\" and concluded that the identical\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    claim that eventually came before the district court was \"without merit.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038876\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/55/1046/#p1051\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038876\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/55/1046/#p1051\">\n     at 1052\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The district court thus erred twice as it pertains to the \"clearly established law\" ground for habeas relief under AEDPA. First, it erred in concluding that clearly established federal law required the Mississippi Supreme Court to conduct a comparative juror analysis\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    . Second, it erred in failing to address the comparative juror analysis the Mississippi Supreme Court\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n    conduct, albeit in the postconviction context.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    B. Unreasonable Determination of the Facts\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The district court further concluded that the state court's factual finding that the prosecution did not invidiously discriminate during jury selection was an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented. The district court rested its holding on a comparative juror analysis between Sturgis/Minor and Cooper alone.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Before reaching those arguments, however, it is important to stress that the district court did not grant proper deference to the Mississippi Supreme Court's factual findings at the postconviction proceeding. As noted above, the district court concluded it did not need to defer to the state court's factual findings under AEDPA because those findings did not include the requisite comparative juror analysis. We have already explained that conclusion was error because there is no\n    <em>\n     requirement\n    </em>\n    to conduct such a comparison, particularly\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    . But even if such a requirement did exist, the Mississippi Supreme Court's factual findings during the postconviction proceeding-findings made pursuant to a comparative juror analysis-would be entitled to AEDPA deference. We federal courts are required to defer to the Mississippi Supreme Court's factual finding that a comparative juror analysis in Chamberlin's case produced no evidence of disparate treatment of black prospective jurors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Even if we were not required to defer to the state court's factual findings, however, we would still hold that the district court erred in concluding that Chamberlin established that the prosecution's proffered race-neutral reasons were pretextual. To show why this is so, we turn to the comparative juror analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Supreme Court has instructed that, when analyzing\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    challenges, \"bare statistics\" are not the be-all and end-all.\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     545 U.S. at 241\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"Side-by-side comparisons of some black venire panelists who were struck and white panelists allowed to serve\" can be \"[m]ore powerful.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The crux of the district court's ruling is its erroneous comparison of black prospective jurors Sturgis and Minor, who were struck by the prosecution, to white juror Cooper, who was kept.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The district court's determination on this front can be boiled down in this way: (1) the prosecution said questions 30, 34, and 35 were the reasons Sturgis and Minor were struck; (2) Cooper answered those questions identically; therefore (3) questions 30, 34, and 35 could not have been the real reasons Sturgis and Minor were struck, else Cooper would have been struck as well. Accordingly, the prosecution's proffered race-neutral reasons for striking Sturgis and Minor must have been pretextual.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    But questions 30, 34, and 35 were not the\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    questions Sturgis, Minor, and Cooper had to answer. They were rather three questions out of dozens on a pages-long jury questionnaire. And if Cooper in particular gave other responses that materially differentiated him from Sturgis and Minor and made him a more favorable juror for the prosecution, then the district court's ruling does not follow.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Consider, for example, question 53, which asked prospective jurors to circle the response that best matched their opinion on the death penalty. Sturgis and Minor circled \"Generally Favor\" and \"No Opinion,\" respectively. Cooper, by contrast, circled \"Strongly Favor,\" and then wrote in \"for rape, murder, child abuse, [and] spousal abuse\" by hand in the margin. Cooper clearly answered a key question in a way that materially distinguished\n    him from Sturgis and Minor. Thus, the most logical explanation for the prosecution's not striking Cooper was not because he was white while Sturgis and Minor were black, but because Cooper was a more favorable juror based on his answers to other questions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    This conclusion is further confirmed by the existence of an additional black juror, Carter, who was accepted by the prosecution. Carter gave worse (from a prosecutor's perspective) answers to question 30 and 34 than did Sturgis and Minor, and gave the same answer as they did to question 35. But she answered question 53 in the same manner as Cooper: circling \"Strongly Favor\" and then writing in by hand additional crimes for which she felt the death penalty was appropriate. And again, Carter-a black prospective juror-was accepted by the prosecution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Indeed, the district court conceded that the prosecution could reasonably have viewed Cooper as a more favorable juror than Sturgis and Minor in light of his answer to question 53. But it decisively concluded that it could\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    consider Cooper's answer to question 53, because question 53 was not one of the race-neutral reasons given by the prosecution for striking Sturgis and Minor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chamberlin I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201485901\">\n     2015 WL 1485901\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6 (\"While [his response to question 53] might have made Cooper a slightly more desirable juror, it was not a rationale offered by the prosecutor.\"). The district court concluded, in other words, that to look at Cooper's other answers would be to allow the State to construct an impermissible post hoc explanation for its strikes of black jurors. This conclusion was erroneous for a number of reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    First, the district court took out of context the\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    admonition that \"a prosecutor simply has got to state his reasons as best he can and stand or fall on the plausibility of the reasons he gives.\"\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     545 U.S. at 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court was careful to limit its warning only to the prosecutor's \"reason[s] for\n    <em>\n     striking [a] juror\n    </em>\n    \" at the second prong of the\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    test.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     at 251\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). This narrow focus is essential to maintaining the integrity of the\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    framework, which requires a focus on the actual, contemporary reasons articulated for the prosecutor's decision to strike a prospective juror. The timely expressed neutral reasons, after all, are what must be tested for veracity by the trial court and later reviewing courts. And this is what the Supreme Court meant in stating the \"stand or fall\" proposition: it criticized both the prosecutor and later reviewing courts for accepting either entirely different substituted reasons or post hoc reasons for strikes. The Court's rationale, however, does not extend to preventing the prosecution from later supporting its originally proffered reasons with additional record evidence, especially if a defendant is allowed to raise objections to juror selection years after a conviction and to allege newly discovered comparisons to other prospective jurors. Nothing in the \"stand or fall\" statement means that the prosecutor would forfeit the opportunity to respond to such contentions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In addition, the Court specifically noted that when a prosecutor gives a facially race-neutral reason for striking a black juror, a reviewing court must \"assess the plausibility of that reason\n    <em>\n     in light of all evidence with a bearing on it\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     at 251-52\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Snyder v.

The Court thus drew a distinction between: (1) inventing a\n    <em>\n     new\n    </em>\n    reason for a strike after the fact (not allowed); and (2) reviewing the record to test the veracity of the prosecution's reasons\n    <em>\n     already given\n    </em>\n    in their proper time (required).

Wilkerson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=556%20Fed.%20Appx.%20360\">\n     556 Fed.Appx. 360\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 365 (5th Cir. 2014) (unpublished) (noting that the prosecution should be afforded the opportunity to demonstrate \"meaningful distinctions\" between asserted comparators). Instead, the prosecutor is highlighting a crucial difference between the black and non-black jurors that prevented the non-black juror from being struck despite sharing strike-worthy characteristics with a black counterpart that was struck.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Second, to hold that the prosecution is not allowed to point to Cooper's other jury questionnaire responses is to engage in a bait-and-switch that vitiates the probative value of the jury comparison in the first place. At jury selection, the prosecution was asked to explain why it struck black jurors Sturgis and Minor, as\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    requires. It did so. Then, years later on federal habeas, the defense altered its approach, and the prosecution was now asked to explain why it\n    <em>\n     kept\n    </em>\n    white juror Cooper. And yet, despite the change in inquiry, the prosecution was not allowed to respond, even by pointing to record evidence it undeniably would have been able to identify had a timely objection been made-it was stuck with the answer it had given to an entirely different question during jury selection. Not only is this state of affairs manifestly unfair, it is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's directive regarding juror analysis in\n    <em>\n     Snyder\n    </em>\n    . If a court does not consider the entire context in which a white juror was accepted, then he/she cannot serve as a useful comparator.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    A hypothetical will help to illustrate the point:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    1. Prosecutor decides, as a default position, to strike all jurors who express concerns about the legal burden of proof.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    2. Prosecutor reviews juror questionnaires and notes that Jurors A, B (both\n    black) and C (white) have expressed concerns about the legal burden of proof. Consequently, Prosecutor intends to strike all three by default.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    3. Upon further review, Prosecutor notes that Juror C alone strongly favors the death penalty. Because this is a capital case, Prosecutor decides to make an exception to the default rule and retain Juror C because of his favorable death penalty views.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    4. Prosecutor strikes Jurors A and B as planned. Responding to a\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    challenge, Prosecutor explains that A and B both expressed concerns about the legal burden of proof.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    5. Prosecutor never mentions white Juror C because the law does not require Prosecutor to explain why he decided to keep any specific juror.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    In this scenario, when Prosecutor strikes Jurors A and B for their position on the legal burden of proof, Prosecutor has concluded that their position on the legal burden of proof is a sufficiently strong basis to strike them. This implies that there are no other overriding reasons to\n    <em>\n     accept\n    </em>\n    A and B as jurors. Conversely, Juror C is not a comparator because his position on the legal burden of proof is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    sufficiently strong to strike him; instead, his position on the legal burden of proof is redeemed by his stance on the death penalty, making him desirable as a juror.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    If the defendant in such a case later raises a comparative jury analysis between Jurors A, B, and C as part of a\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    challenge, an accurate and honest assessment of the prosecutor's motives must allow the prosecution to point to white Juror C's view of the death penalty as the reason he was kept. Otherwise the\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    analysis risks capturing too many false positives, precisely because Juror C is no longer an accurate comparator to Jurors A and B.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Third, consider the related issue of the burden that would be placed on the prosecution at jury selection going forward if the district court's reasoning stands. In order to protect against future comparative juror analysis, the prosecution will not only have to explain why it struck black jurors-as\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    requires-but also why it\n    <em>\n     kept\n    </em>\n    white jurors. Indeed, the prosecution will have to explain why it kept\n    <em>\n     every\n    </em>\n    white juror, because it does not know which white jurors will be selected as comparators at some later date. In Chamberlin's case, for example, the only way the prosecution could have avoided the outcome dictated by the district court was by explaining why it\n    <em>\n     kept\n    </em>\n    Cooper. But the prosecution could not have known that Cooper would be the eventual comparator chosen and not some other juror, so it would have had to explain why it kept\n    <em>\n     every\n    </em>\n    white juror.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Such a requirement would make the jury selection process impractical, whereas considering the totality of the circumstances conforms with the Court's instruction in\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Snyder\n    </em>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Fourth, the procedure for conducting a comparative juror analysis described by the district court creates perverse incentives for both the defense and the prosecution. For the defense it is better\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    to raise comparative juror analysis in the trial court and to wait until much later in the game to point to a white comparator, because the prosecution will be stuck with whatever reasons it gave for striking black jurors in the trial court and allowed no other explanation-no matter how compelling and/or how certain it is that it would have been raised had a timely objection been made. And for the prosecution, it might be deemed strategically advantageous to be\n    <em>\n     less\n    </em>\n    detailed when giving race-neutral reasons in the trial court, because the more general the answers, the harder it will be to conduct a formal side-by-side comparison down the line.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Our holding today does not eviscerate\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    protections: We simply allow a prosecutor the chance to respond whenever the court engages in a comparative juror analysis. Important limitations on that response remain. For one, the prosecutor is constrained by the voir dire record, which helps guard against the fabrication of new distinctions that did not motivate the initial decision. Moreover, even if the prosecutor provides a supported basis for keeping a non-black juror, the court must still determine whether that basis provides an adequately redeeming reason to override the strike-worthy characteristics the non-black juror shares with the black jurors who were struck. Perhaps most importantly, allowing this response does not permit the prosecutor to change his original reasons for striking black jurors. Such protections will guard against the rare cases in which a\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    violation is followed by an ongoing, planned concealment of that violation by the various prosecutors involved in each case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Conversely, to hold that a reviewing court cannot look at the totality of the circumstances in order to determine an accurate comparator when conducting a comparative jury analysis\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    and belatedly on federal habeas is to invert the\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    framework, rendering it unjust, impractical, and contrary to its original purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The prosecution in Chamberlin's case did what it was supposed to do: it rejected some black prospective jurors and accepted others, accepted some white prospective jurors and rejected others. When asked why it struck individual black prospective jurors, it gave specific race-neutral reasons for the strikes. The Mississippi Supreme Court found on multiple occasions that the prosecution did not invidiously discriminate against black prospective jurors. Then, on federal habeas-where AEDPA deference is the rule-the prosecution was asked to explain years later why it\n    <em>\n     kept\n    </em>\n    a white juror. Yet, when it tried to answer that question with reference to record evidence it would have identified had the defense timely objected, the district court concluded it could not do so. No case-not\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    , or any other-has ever suggested, let alone mandated, this distortion of the\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    regime.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    IV\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    We find that neither statutory ground for granting federal habeas relief under AEDPA applies to Chamberlin's case. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court's order granting Chamberlin's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and VACATE the district court's order setting\n    aside Chamberlin's conviction and sentence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    GREGG COSTA, Circuit Judge, dissenting, joined by STEWART, Chief Judge, DAVIS, DENNIS, and PRADO, Circuit Judges:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The jury-the voice of \"We the People\" in our justice system-was of such importance to the Founding generation that it is one of only two rights included in both the Constitution and Bill of Rights.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    U.S. CONST. art.

In the latter, it is the only right that is a focus of two amendments. As is the case for many of our finest institutions, the greatest obstacle to the jury system's achieving its full promise has been racial discrimination.

Yet the concern today is that a decision affirming the district court's finding of discriminatory strikes, which would put us at a once-a-decade rate of finding\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    violations, would impose too much of a \"burden ... on the prosecution.\" Maj. Op. at 843.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The two cases in which we have found discrimination both relied in large part on comparative juror analysis. Today's opinion saps most of the force out of this one tool that has ever resulted in us finding a\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    violation. Despite the only reasons cited at trial for striking two black jurors applying equally to an accepted white juror, the majority rejects the direct conclusion to be drawn from this inconsistency that the proffered reasons could not have been the real reasons for the strikes. If this case in which the compared jurors are identical with respect to the reasons stated at trial is not enough (the standard only requires that they be similarly situated), it is difficult to see how comparative analysis will ever support a finding of discrimination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    What is even more troubling is that we have been down this road before. The way the majority opinion gets around the identical comparison is to differentiate the jurors based on reasons not cited during the\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    inquiry at trial. In\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court found error in our application of comparative juror analysis that did the same thing: \"substitution of a reason\" for the strike that was not offered at trial.\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     545 U.S. at 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Yet that is exactly what the majority opinion does: it uses the answers to questions not identified at trial as the basis for overturning the district court's finding that clear and convincing evidence of discrimination exists. As will be explored further, this approach used to avoid the clear import of a direct comparison of the reasons stated at trial is the same rejected analysis of our\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    opinion and the Supreme Court dissent.

The majority opinion does not even mention the highly disproportionate strikes of black prospective jurors. Instead it breezily says the prosecution \"rejected some black prospective jurors and accepted others, accepted some white prospective jurors and rejected others.\" Maj. Op. at 844. It is no wonder the majority opinion does not details those \"some\"s and \"others\"; they are nothing alike.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The prosecution struck seven of the first eight black venire members it considered, which included the challenged strikes of Sturgis and Minor. The inverse was true for the first eight white jurors the prosecution considered: it accepted seven of eight (and ended up accepting nine of the first ten whites). Only after defense counsel started raising\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    objections and the prosecution was running out of strikes did it accept the two black jurors who ended up on the jury, and the second was only accepted in a moment of confusion when the prosecutor believed the juror had already been struck.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     545 U.S. at 249-50\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (finding unpersuasive that, towards the end of jury selection, the prosecution accepted a black juror, noting that most of the prosecution's challenges were gone and the prosecutor \"had to exercise prudent restraint\" at that point).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Even including those late, post-objection decisions, the overall numbers evince discrimination. The prosecution struck nearly two times as many black jurors as it accepted (eight strikes compared to five accepted, including one alternate), while accepting more than four times as many white jurors as it struck (five strikes compared to twenty-three accepted, including three alternates). It exercised 62% of its strikes on black jurors, despite black jurors making up only 31% of qualified prospective jurors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    This racial breakdown of the strikes is even more telling when compared with the results random strikes would predict. Given the demographics of the venire, the probability that random, race-neutral strikes would result in 8 of the 13 struck jurors being black was about 1 in a 100.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Joseph L.

To put it in the practical context of jury selection, the idea is that if a lawyer is so troubled by a juror's views on certain issues that the concern leads to striking that juror, then one would expect to see the same concern with another juror expressing the same views. In a jury selection like this one involving written questionnaires, if the lawyer highlighted answers on one juror's form as troubling, the same answers on another juror's form should also be highlighted. If those highlighted answers are later cited by the lawyer in response to a\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    challenge for which the trial court has found\n    <em>\n     prima\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     facie\n    </em>\n    support and thus requested an explanation, it should not be hard for the lawyer to see and consider all the questionnaires with that answer highlighted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    shows how this analysis can reveal pretext.

But in doing so, the majority opinion makes the same mistake as the Mississippi habeas court in relying on juror differences not identified at trial. It cannot contest the obvious: that on the questions the prosecutor cited during jury selection as his reasons for excluding black jurors Sturgis and Minor, accepted white juror Cooper gave the same responses. Instead, it argues that it should now be able to identify differences among those prospective jurors on their responses to other questions. The example is the three prospective jurors' differing answers to a separate question about the death penalty (question 53): Cooper was strongly in favor of the death penalty whereas Sturgis \"generally favored\" it and Minor had \"no opinion.\" Maj.

It thinks the Supreme Court's emphatic prohibition on post-trial justifications can be overcome by repackaging the argument made by the State about the different answers to question 53.

If the difference between the three was question 53, that would mean Sturgis and Minor were struck not only because of their answers to questions 30, 34, and 35, but also because of their more lukewarm support of the death penalty conveyed in response to question 53. As its name demonstrates, the inquiry is a comparative one that requires differentiating the answers of struck and accepted jurors. That means citing different answers to the same question as a reason for keeping one juror is the same as saying the difference was a reason for striking the other juror.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v. Taylor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4101165\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/636/901/#p906\">\n     636 F.3d 901\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 906 (7th Cir. 2011) (properly framing the key question as the reason \"for striking [the black juror] but not [the white juror],\" which recognizes that the reasons for striking a black juror and keeping a white one are inseparable). To use a simple example, assume a prosecutor struck Jurors A and B on the ground that they wore hats in the courtroom (this is sometimes cited as a reason for strikes on the ground that it shows a lack of respect for the process). But Juror C was also wearing a hat. When this is later pointed out, the reviewing court speculates that Juror C must have been kept in the panel despite the hat because she expressed greater support for the death penalty on a questionnaire than did Jurors A and B. If the court were able to read the prosecutor's mind and this were in fact the real reason for the disparate treatment, then that would mean the hat was not the deal breaker; it alone was not enough for a strike as shown by the acceptance of Juror C. Jurors A and B thus would have been struck, per the court's conjecture, because\n    they wore a hat\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    were less supportive of the death penalty. And if that were in fact the case,\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    says the prosecutor had to cite both of those reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The view that courts may credit new reasons jurors were\n    <em>\n     kept\n    </em>\n    despite sharing the trait the prosecution claimed justified striking black jurors-a novel position as the en banc court cites no other example of a court doing this-would make meaningless\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    's bar on considering new reasons for strikes. Whether labelled as reasons for striking the black juror or ones for keeping the comparators, allowing new explanations years after trial turns the\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    inquiry into a \"mere exercise in thinking up any rational basis\" as there is no way to ensure the post-trial justification is what actually motivated the decisions made during jury selection.\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     545 U.S. at 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Today's decision demonstrates this as it does not even try to test the genuineness of the new explanation the state offers in its brief by, for example, requiring a hearing at which the prosecutor who selected the jury would testify.\n    <em>\n     See infra\n    </em>\n    Section IV.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    shows why the distinction between reasons for striking and keeping comparators is empty. The new reason for striking the black juror our court offered that the Supreme Court rejected-his ambivalence about the death penalty-could just as easily have been treated as a reason for keeping the white jurors: their firmer support of the death penalty.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     545 U.S. at 250-52\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     Miller-El v.

Indeed, that is how the\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    dissent characterized the difference: a white juror was likely kept because the juror \"was adamant about the value of the death penalty for callous crimes.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     545 U.S. at 294\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Thomas, J., dissenting).

Although it is apparent from the\n    <em>\n     voir dire\n    </em>\n    transcript why the State wanted to seat these veniremen on the jury, it was never required to 'offer' its reasons for doing so.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 306 n.4,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Thomas, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court majority rejected this attempt to offer never-before-cited reasons for keeping white jurors, viewing it as a violation of the stand-or-fall principle: \"The dissent offers other reasons why these nonblack panel members who expressed views on rehabilitation similar to Field's were otherwise more acceptable to the prosecution than he was.

Today's opinion is thus directly at odds with how\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    treated new reasons, even those for \"keeping white jurors\": it did not consider them. The Supreme Court's refusal to consider new justifications, whether framed as a reason for excluding the black juror or in mirror-image terms as a reason for accepting nonblack jurors, binds us.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    The majority also says we can look at answers to questions other than the three cited at trial because\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    instructed courts to evaluate whether a prosecutors' stated reason is plausible \"in light of all evidence with a bearing on it.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     545 U.S. at 251-52\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

There is a difference\n    between evidence bearing on the plausibility of the prosecutor's stated reason, which reviewing courts should consider, and new reasons, which they may not. In evaluating whether proffered reasons were plausible,\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    looked to evidence of the prosecutor's veracity other than just the juror comparisons: did he rely on misrepresentations about stricken jurors' answers, probe jurors about the areas of concern, or give inconsistent explanations for strikes?\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     at 244-51\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Maj. Op. at 841. The Supreme Court said just the opposite about the placement of the pretext inquiry: \"If a prosecutor's proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack who is permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination to be considered at\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    's\n    <em>\n     third step\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     545 U.S. at 240-41\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). The whole point of comparative juror analysis is to flush out pretext. As it is in the analogous framework for deciding summary judgment in employment discrimination cases, pretext is directly related to the ultimate question of discrimination.

Why didn't\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    allow consideration at step 3 of the differences our court and Justice Thomas identified among the comparators? If prosecutors and courts had free reign at\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    's third step to compare jurors as to characteristics not cited as a contemporaneous reason for the strike, one would expect to see cases allowing that.

The glaring problem with this is that the same was true in\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    , as well as in most of the subsequent cases faithfully applying its stand-or-fall command.

That is this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Snyder\n    </em>\n    concern about an undeveloped record on \"substantial similarity\" analysis is not present here. Because the prosecutor relied exclusively on three specific answers to questions on juror questionnaires, we are able to fully compare the jurors as to the only characteristics the prosecutor identified as relevant, and they are identical. This case thus does not confront the issue that is often the focus of the \"substantial similarity\" analysis and that\n    <em>\n     Snyder\n    </em>\n    's \"cold record\" comment was addressing. The explanation a lawyer offers for a strike is usually much more general than the identical answers to specific questions identified here. A prosecutor may, for example, say a juror was\n    struck because she \"seemed to be anti-law enforcement.\" That explanation, and whether it applies equally to accepted jurors of a different race, likely does not just implicate answers to a single question. A host of matters in the jury selection record may inform whether the struck juror is similar to an accepted juror as to a general characterization like \"anti-law enforcement.\" Relevant to that assessment might be answers to questions asking about one's views on criminal justice issues, as well as whether anyone in a person's family has been charged with a crime and the reaction to that experience, or whether a relative works in law enforcement. It is that situation in which\n    <em>\n     Snyder\n    </em>\n    raises a concern about being able to conduct a similarity inquiry on a cold record. As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, that concern is not present when prosecutors' stated reasons are narrow and specific as they are here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

It says the prosecutor should be given a \"chance to respond whenever the court engages in a comparative juror analysis.\" Maj. Op. 844.

The majority opinion instead slams the door on the\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    claim based on speculative reasons offered in a brief by appellate attorneys who work in a different office than the trial lawyer who picked the jury. That is at odds with the majority opinion's explanation that a court would have to assess if the new, post-trial justification \"provides an adequately redeeming reason to override the strike-worthy characteristics the non-black juror shares with the black jurors who were struck.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . As with any inquiry into intent, that determination would seemingly have to include a credibility assessment of the new reasons the prosecutor cites for \"keeping\" the white juror. That evaluation of credibility has never happened in this case. Nor will it ever. The majority opinion does not remand for a hearing on the supposed reasons for \"keeping\" the white juror who gave identical answers to the struck black jurors on Questions 30, 34, and 35. It just accepts what is said in an appellate brief without the prosecutor who made the strikes ever having to provide an explanation or without any explanation ever having been tested in an adversarial process and then evaluated by a factfinder. As a result, there is nothing to ensure that the new, post-trial justification is anything more than an \"afterthought.\"\n    <em>\n     Miller-El II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     545 U.S. at 246\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2317\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    IV.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Chamberlin's crime was horrific.

As such, on remand the court should have limited its inquiry and analysis to exploring that very question. But the remand hearing went much further. The government compared Watson to jurors Nowak, Evans, and Wills against the backdrop of seven new reasons unrelated to the jurors' willingness to impose the death penalty on a non-shooter. And the district court factored several of these new reasons into its analysis. For instance, the court accepted the government's explanation for striking Watson while keeping Nowak and Evans in the pool by closely examining the written responses of all three jurors to death-penalty questions on their juror questionnaires. But at the time the\n     <em>\n      Batson\n     </em>\n     challenge was made, the prosecutor did not say a word about striking Watson because of her answers on her juror questionnaire. Similarly, in crediting the government's explanation for striking Watson but not Wills, the court looked beyond their responses to the non-shooter question and analyzed their attitudes toward gun control and how they might evaluate the defendants' backgrounds when deciding whether to recommend the death penalty. But when the\n     <em>\n      Batson\n     </em>\n     challenge was made, the prosecutor never tried to justify striking Watson based on her views of either of these issues.\n    </blockquote>\n    <p id=\"p-159\">\n     <em>\n      Taylor\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4101165\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/636/901/#p906\">\n      636 F.3d at 905-06\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (emphasis in original).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-160\">\n     In contrast, a search of the term \"comparative juror analysis\" in Fifth Circuit caselaw turns up only two cases in which it appears the comparison was identified in the trial court.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      United States v.
