In this action, AmeriCulture filed a special motion to dismiss the suit under New Mexico's anti-SLAPP statute, a provision designed to expedite judicial consideration of so-called \"strategic lawsuits against public participation.\" The district court, however, refused to consider that motion, holding the statute authorizing it inapplicable in federal court.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  For the reasons set forth here, we agree. Judge Baldock first gives the factual background, on which the panel agrees. Chief Judge Tymkovich's opinion, which Judge Briscoe joins, explains why we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under the collateral order doctrine. The opinion of Judge Baldock explains our unanimous holding on the merits of this appeal. Finally, Judge Baldock dissents to our jurisdictional holding.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  <strong>\n   BACKGROUND\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-11\">\n   BALDOCK, Circuit Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The United States Bureau of Land Management leased 2,500 acres of geothermal mineral rights in Hidalgo County, New Mexico to Plaintiff Lightning Dock Geothermal HI-01, LLC (LDG), a Delaware company. Consistent therewith, LDG developed and presently owns a geothermal power generating project in Hidalgo County. LDG also developed a geothermal well field on the subject tract as part of its project. Defendant AmeriCulture, a New Mexico corporation under the direction of Defendant Damon Seawright, a New Mexico resident, later purchased a surface estate of approximately fifteen acres overlying LDG's mineral lease-ostensibly to develop and operate a tilapia fish farm. Because AmeriCulture wished to utilize LDG's geothermal resources for its farm, AmeriCulture and LDG (more accurately its predecessor) entered into a Joint Facility Operating Agreement (JFOA). The purpose of the JFOA, at least from LDG's perspective, was to allow AmeriCulture to utilize some of the land's geothermal resources without interfering or competing with LDG's development of its federal lease. We are told that Plaintiff Los Lobos Renewable Power LLC (LLRP), also a Delaware company, is the sole member of LDG and a third-party beneficiary of the JFOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties eventually began to quarrel over their contractual rights and obligations.

The former two\n   paragraphs allege Defendants \"impermissibly\" objected to permit applications Plaintiffs made before the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer and the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division. Paragraph 77 then concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants Seawright and Americulture have both intentionally and negligently made material misrepresentations concerning the Plaintiffs and the Project to numerous state agencies and other public bodies for the sole purpose of delaying and subverting the Project solely for the purpose of giving Defendants a competitive advantage for the Defendants own intended production of Geothermal Power in violation of the JFOA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants responded to these allegations and conclusions by filing a \"special motion to dismiss\" pursuant to the New Mexico anti-SLAPP statute, a state legislative enactment aimed at thwarting \"strategic lawsuits against public participation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2038-2-9.1\">\n    N.M.

As the factual basis for their motion, Defendants told the district court the permits which Plaintiffs sought and to which Defendants objected \"pertained to activities conducted on lands other than the 15-acre fee estate covered by the JFOA.\" As the legal basis for their motion, Defendants asserted \"New Mexico's Anti-SLAPP statute is a substantive state law designed to protect the Defendants from having to litigate meritless claims aimed at chilling First Amendment expression.\" Defendants described their rights under the state statute as \"in the nature of immunity because New Mexico lawmakers also want to protect speakers from the trial itself rather than merely from liability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court was not persuaded and denied Defendants' \"special\" motion because \"New Mexico's Anti-SLAPP statute is a procedural provision that does not apply in the courts of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Los Lobos Renewable Power, LLC v.

Instead, it creates a right to expeditious trial and appellate process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This means that were we to wait for this case to conclude in the court below by ordinary process, the statute's sole aim would already be lost. Defendants would have already incurred the ordinary time and expense of litigation that the statute potentially grants them a right to avoid. Indeed, we can reverse the rulings of a subordinate court, but we cannot order away proceedings and legal fees that have already passed into history. Nor can we remand the case with instructions to \"do it again, but faster this time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants' characterization of the statute as conferring an immunity from trial carries some significance as well. While we ultimately conclude in this case that the statute is better read as not conferring immunity, Defendants' contention in the district court and on appeal is far from fanciful. Even so, on questions of first impression, we usually decline to credit a party's claim to immunity, opting to conduct our own analysis instead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gen.

But this court has often-far too many times to count-taken interlocutory appeals based on asserted immunities only to deem those immunities inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

Our cases thus draw an unsatisfying distinction between appeals concerning the\n   <em>\n    scope\n   </em>\n   of certain immunities on the one hand, and appeals concerning the\n   <em>\n    existence\n   </em>\n   of immunities that we have yet to recognize on the other. The better course may be to credit plausible assertions of novel state-law immunities-like this\n   one-on matters of first impression in the\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   context. If, as here, we then determine that the asserted immunity is unavailable on the merits, it would end the matter for both purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We also think it instructive that\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   itself presented markedly similar facts.

We could not secure this statute's protections after final judgment on the merits because-just as in\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   -burdensome legal process has already been brought to bear at that point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royalty Network\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4100126\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/1351/#p1357\">\n    756 F.3d at 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The dissent points out that federal district courts have tools at their disposal to accomplish the same ends.

It asks whether courts of appeals have sufficient remedial power to reverse the effects of an erroneous order after litigation has run its course on the trial level.

Fortunately, we need not rely on any complex\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   analysis here because, assuming one is able to read, drawing the line between procedure and substance in this case is hardly a \"challenging endeavor.\" The plain language of the New Mexico anti-SLAPP statute reveals the law is nothing more than a\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   mechanism designed to expedite the\n   disposal of frivolous lawsuits aimed at threatening free speech rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Section 38-2-9.2, which sets forth the anti-SLAPP statute's purpose, says the statute addresses\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   \"[b]aseless civil lawsuits\" arising out of a defendant's participation in proceedings before a quasi-judicial governmental body.

Subsection A is unquestionably the most important of the three subsections. It mandates the expedited procedures applicable to the type of frivolous or retaliatory lawsuits at which \u00a7 38-2-9.2 tells us the statute is aimed. Subsections B and C are dependent subsections, entirely meaningless absent subsection A. Both the title of \u00a7 38-2-9.1 and the body of subsection A state that a dispositive pretrial motion filed pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute is \"special.\" According to the plain terms of subsection A, the only reason such motion is \"special\" is that it \"shall be considered by the court on a priority or expedited basis to ensure early consideration of the issues raised by the motion and to prevent the unnecessary expense of litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 38-2-9.1.A. Most importantly for our purpose, subsection A sets forth no rule(s) of substantive law. Rather, it tells the trial court to hurry up and decide dispositive pretrial motions in lawsuits that a movant claims fit the description of \"baseless\" provided in \u00a7 38-2-9.2,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , frivolous lawsuits-and that's it. All subsection A demands is expedited procedures designed to promptly identify and dispose of such lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The New Mexico Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Cordova v.

In that case, plaintiff filed a malicious abuse of process claim against members of a citizens' association following their efforts to remove him from the school board. Six of those members responded by filing a \"special\" motion to dismiss pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2038-2-9.1\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 38-2-9.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .A. The trial court granted the members' motion to dismiss and plaintiff appealed, ultimately to the New Mexico Supreme Court. The state supreme court held the association members were \"entitled to the\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   protections of the New Mexico [anti-SLAPP] statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Cordova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=396%20P.3d%20159\">\n    396 P.3d at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). But to resolve the case on the merits, the court relied on a substantive immunity defense\n   <em>\n    entirely separate\n   </em>\n   from the anti-SLAPP statute. The court identified the relevant inquiry as whether the members were \"entitled to the\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   protections provided by the\n   <em>\n    Noerr-Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 166 (emphasis\n   added). The court could not have made itself any clearer: \"While the Anti-SLAPP statute provides the\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   protections [the members] require, the\n   <em>\n    Noerr-Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine is the mechanism that offers [the members] the\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   First Amendment protections they seek.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . 166-67 (emphasis added).

To be sure, the statute seeks to spare those who exercise their free speech rights before a quasi-judicial governmental body from unwarranted and harassing litigation that threatens to chill the exercise of such rights. As\n   <em>\n    Cordova\n   </em>\n   plainly tells us, however, the statute as written pursues this policy through purely\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   means. The New Mexico anti-SLAPP statute sets forth a unique \"judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law,\" that is, substantive law located\n   <em>\n    entirely\n   </em>\n   outside the four corners of the anti-SLAPP statute.\n   <em>\n    Sibbach\n   </em>\n   , 312 U.S. at 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"358982\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/312/1/#p14\">\n    61 S.Ct. 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuba v.

Clearly, subsection B's second sentence is a procedural provision primarily designed to punish and deter a defendant from improperly invoking \u00a7 38-2-9.1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farmer v.

To be sure, the subsection's first sentence does not expressly refer to frivolous or retaliatory lawsuits. But why should it? Section 38-2-9.2 plainly tells us the New Mexico anti-SLAPP statute is aimed at a particular type of frivolous or retaliatory lawsuit. Therefore, construing the entirety of subsection B as a procedural fee-shifting device makes perfect sense. Save the second sentence of subsection B, which is aimed at a type of frivolous motion, the entire statute is aimed at a type of \"baseless\" lawsuit. As \u00a7 38-2-9.1 's title plainly suggests, Subsection B's first sentence provides for the imposition of fees and costs as a\n   <em>\n    sanction\n   </em>\n   primarily designed not to compensate for legal services but to vindicate First Amendment rights threatened by a kind of \"unwarranted or specious\" litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   All this leaves only subsection C for our consideration. Subsection C provides for an \"expedited appeal\" from a trial court's ruling, or failure to rule, on a \"special\" motion. In\n   <em>\n    Cordova\n   </em>\n   , the New Mexico Supreme Court held \u00a7 38-2-9.1.C allows a party to bring an interlocutory appeal in state court from a decision on a special motion filed pursuant to the New Mexico anti-SLAPP statute.\n   <em>\n    Cordova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=396%20P.3d%20159\">\n    396 P.3d at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After the trial court granted the association members' special motion, two of those members had counterclaims still pending. Thus, the appeal was interlocutory in nature. The supreme court, sensibly enough, reasoned that \"[b]oth the plain language and the purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute underscore a clear legislative intent to provide an interlocutory appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The purpose of the statute, according to the court, is to protect those who exercise their right to petition from the financial burden of having to defend against \"retaliatory\" lawsuits.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . And the statute's plain language reinforces this purpose:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Importantly, the plain language of Subsection A explicitly provides that the expedited process must allow for the\n   <em>\n    early consideration\n   </em>\n   of the issues raised by the motion and to prevent the unnecessary expense of litigation. Therefore\n   <em>\n    the plain language of Subsections A, B, and C of the Anti-SLAPP statute describes an expedited process that is necessarily interlocutory in nature\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 164 (second emphasis added) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).

Relying exclusively on \"the plain language and the purpose\" of the statute, the court decided the New Mexico legislature's\n   <em>\n    desire for expedited procedures\n   </em>\n   to thwart retaliatory lawsuits that abused the judicial process and\n   threatened to chill free speech\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   justified an interlocutory appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 165.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Undeterred by the New Mexico anti-SLAPP statute's plain language and the New Mexico Supreme Court's interpretation of it in\n   <em>\n    Cordova\n   </em>\n   , Defendants tell us \"the statute clearly expresses the intent of New Mexico's legislature to provide individuals immunity from suit\" or \"a right not to stand trial.\" Defs' Br. at 12.

Because absolutely nothing in the language of the anti-SLAPP statute exempts from liability under any circumstance one who has violated the law while petitioning a governmental body, the statute cannot constitute a grant of immunity. The \"right not to stand trial\" is not, as Defendants suggest, a substantive defense in the form of immunity itself. Such right is an entitlement\n   <em>\n    dependent\n   </em>\n   upon an exemption from liability, an exemption that under a plain reading of the New Mexico anti-SLAPP statute does not appear therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In this case, the line between procedure and substance is clear. A plain reading of the New Mexico anti-SLAPP statute reveals the statute is not designed to influence the\n   <em>\n    outcome\n   </em>\n   of an alleged SLAPP suit but only the\n   <em>\n    timing\n   </em>\n   of that outcome. The statute simply does not define the scope of any state substantive right or remedy. As we have learned, the statute is procedural in all its aspects. The statute's purpose is the prompt termination of certain lawsuits the New Mexico legislature deemed to be both unduly burdensome and a threat to First Amendment rights. To this end, the statute provides a movant the \"right\" to have a trial court promptly review the merits of the case (and, if necessary, the \"right\" to have an appellate court do so as well), so as to limit any harm engendered by the \"baseless\" lawsuit defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038-2-9.2\">\n    N.M.

A defendant's reliance on \u00a7 38-2-9.1 will not alter the suit's outcome because it does not provide a defendant the right to avoid liability apart from a separate determination of the suit's underlying merits.

Among other clear indicators within the original Bill, \u00a7 2.A plainly provided that a defendant was immune from liability in an action arising out of the defendant's objectively reasonable or good faith exercise of free speech before a governmental body. The original version of H.B. 241 unequivocally illustrates that the New Mexico legislature understands quite well how to draft a law providing a class of individuals with a limited immunity from suit. But the revised version of H.B. 241, which ended up as\n    <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2038-2-9.1\">\n     N.M.

But right or wrong, the Ninth Circuit's construction of a California statute very different from its New Mexico counterpart is none of our business. Our concern is with the proper interpretation of a much narrower statute, one that, as we have seen, does not protect a defendant \"from the ultimate judgments of liability.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Metabolic Research, Inc. v.

First, whether the New Mexico anti-SLAPP statute can logically operate alongside the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure without conflict is very much debatable. Rules 11 (sanctions), 12(b) (motions to dismiss), 12(c) (motions for judgment on the pleadings), 16(a) (expedited proceedings), and 56 (motions for summary judgment) seem to cover all the bases, leaving little room for \u00a7 38-2-9.1 to operate in federal court. But even assuming for the sake of brevity that the anti-SLAPP statute can exist alongside the Federal Rules, the twin aims of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    -\"discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws\"-do\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    render the state statute substantive for\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    purposes.\n    <em>\n     Hanna v. Plumer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525277\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/460/#p468\">\n     380 U.S. 460\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 468,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525245,1525277\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/85/1136/\">\n     85 S.Ct. 1136\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525277\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/460/#p468\">\n     14 L.Ed.2d 8\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1965). Anyone who believes that a federal district court is ill-equipped to deal swiftly and harshly with the sort of lawsuits described in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038-2-9.2\">\n     N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 38-2-9.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    absent application of \u00a7 38-2-9.1 is seriously mistaken. Those litigants and lawyers who seek to circumvent application of the New Mexico anti-SLAPP statute by filing a baseless SLAPP lawsuit in federal district court are in for a rude awakening.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The Court correctly points out that in applying the collateral order doctrine we decide appealability for categories of orders rather than individual orders. Interestingly, the Supreme Court has never identified the category of appealable order under which its decision in\n    <em>\n     Cohen\n    </em>\n    falls. In\n    <em>\n     Cohen\n    </em>\n    , the state statute at issue in a stockholder's derivative action made the plaintiffs, if unsuccessful, liable for all expenses, including fees, of the defense and required security for their payment as a condition for prosecuting the action. The Supreme Court concluded that upon final judgment, it would \"be too late effectively to review the present order and the rights conferred by the statute, if applicable.\"\n    <em>\n     Cohen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572420\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/337/541/\">\n     337 U.S. at 546\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572420\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/337/541/\">\n     69 S.Ct. 1221\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This appeal is readily distinguishable from\n    <em>\n     Cohen\n    </em>\n    . As my dissent shall well illustrate, the procedures provided for in the New Mexico anti-SLAPP statute are adequately vindicable in federal court by means other than application of the collateral order doctrine.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Another factor working against Defendants is that at one point they had the district court's blessing to request our discretionary review. The Supreme Court has noted that \"litigants confronted with a particularly injurious or novel ... ruling have several potential avenues of review apart from collateral order appeal.\"\n    <em>\n     Mohawk Indus.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638928\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/100/#p106\">\n     558 U.S. at 110\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638928\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/100/#p106\">\n     130 S.Ct. 599\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This case well illustrates the availability of one discretionary review mechanism. Here, the district court, cognizant of the suit's nature, certified its ruling that the New Mexico anti-SLAPP statute did not apply in federal court for an immediate appeal under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b). Little doubt exists in my mind that other district courts faced with lawsuits that may imperil First Amendment rights would similarly certify their non-final rulings for immediate appeal. For whatever reason, however, Defendants failed to timely petition us for permission to appeal once the district court certified the\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    question for interlocutory review.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b). Defendants'-or perhaps more accurately defense counsel's-apparent nonfeasance not only has caused this Court to expend valuable time addressing the\n    <em>\n     Cohen\n    </em>\n    issue but also surely has caused all parties to incur unnecessary fees and expenses. How ironic that Defendants claim their adversaries are running up unnecessary fees and expenses while doing so themselves!\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
