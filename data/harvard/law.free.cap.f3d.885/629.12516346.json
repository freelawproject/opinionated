Heryford, the District Attorney of Trinity County, California, from retaining private counsel on a contingency-fee basis to litigate in Heryford's name an action against American Bankers under California's Unfair Competition Law. American Bankers argues that the arrangement violates federal due process principles. We disagree. Heryford's retention of private counsel to pursue civil penalties under state law cannot be meaningfully distinguished from a private relator's pursuit of civil penalties under the qui tam provisions of the False Claim Act, an arrangement that we have already held does not violate due process. We therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of American Bankers' civil rights action against Heryford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The story of this lawsuit starts with a different lawsuit, one that Heryford filed against American Bankers and several other companies on behalf of the people of California under California's Unfair Competition Law (\"the UCL\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 17200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . That lawsuit was filed by Heryford in Trinity County Superior Court on behalf of \"the People of California, by and through the District Attorney for the County of Trinity.\" Heryford alleged that the defendants had \"engaged in deceptive marketing and sales practices in connection with\" services offered to California holders of certain credit cards. For these alleged violations, the complaint sought injunctive relief, restitution, attorney's fees, and-most relevant here-civil penalties. Although private parties may seek injunctive relief and restitution under the UCL, only a public prosecutor such as Heryford may pursue civil penalties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California v. IntelliGender, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290235\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1169/#p1174\">\n    771 F.3d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1174 (9th Cir. 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017204\">\n    Cal.

Attorneys from Baron &amp; Budd, P.C. and Carter Wolden Curtis, LLP were too. Heryford's office had retained these law firms along with Golomb &amp; Honik, P.C. (collectively, \"the Law Firms\") under an agreement designating them as \"Special Assistant District Attorneys.\" Under the agreement, the Law Firms were charged with \"assist[ing] in the investigation, research, filing and prosecution\" of the UCL suit against American Bankers and its co-defendants. More specifically, the agreement required the Law Firms to \"provide all legal services that are reasonably necessary for such representation and assistance, including without limitation, the preparation and filing of all claims, pleadings, responses, motions, petitions, memoranda, brief[s], notices and other documents,\" and to \"conduct negotiations and provide representations at all hearings, depositions, trials, appeals, and other appearances as may be required.\" The agreement gave the Law Firms \"the authority and responsibility to control and direct the performance and details of\" their work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The agreement also stated, however, that the Law Firms would work \"under the direction of the District Attorney,\" and that his office did \"not relinquish its constitutional or statutory authority or responsibility.\" Heryford retained \"sole and final authority to initiate and settle\" the UCL suit, along with \"final authority over all aspects of the litigation.\" He also had \"a general right to inspect work in progress to determine whether ... the services [we]re being performed by the Law Firms in compliance with\" the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Heryford retained the Law Firms on a contingency-fee basis. Under the terms of the agreement, the Law Firms would bear \"[a]ll reasonable and necessary costs of litigation,\" for which they would be reimbursed from any recovery in the action. They were also entitled to thirty percent of any remaining funds. If the UCL suit did not result in a recovery, the Law Firms would neither be reimbursed for their expenses nor compensated for their services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Heryford told the Trinity County Board of Supervisors that this arrangement meant there was \"a lot of upside with not a lot of downside for [his] office or the county.\" The UCL suit, he contended, was \"not going to be additional work for [Heryford's] staff\" because the Law Firms were\n   \"going to handle the litigation part of this.\" He made similar statements to a local newspaper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   American Bankers filed a civil rights action against Heryford in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, challenging the contingency-fee agreement as a violation of its federal due process rights, which is the lawsuit now on appeal before us.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Days after that action was filed, Heryford and the Law Firms voluntarily dismissed the UCL suit pending in Trinity County Superior Court, only to refile it the next month in the Eastern District, where it apparently remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   American Bankers alleged that the contingency-fee agreement between Heryford and the Law Firms gave the latter \"a direct and substantial financial stake in the imposition of civil penalties and restitution,\" which \"compromise[d] the integrity and fairness of the prosecutorial motive and the public's faith in the judicial process.\" American Bankers sought a declaration that the arrangement violated due process and an injunction \"allowing the UCL Suit to proceed ... but prohibiting the District Attorney from employing the Law Firms to prosecute the UCL Suit under their existing contingency-fee agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Heryford moved to dismiss, and American Bankers moved for summary judgment. The district court considered the motions together, granting the former with leave to amend and denying the latter as moot. American Bankers opted not to amend and asked the district court to enter judgment, which it did. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As a threshold matter, Heryford asks us, under\n   <em>\n    Brillhart v.
