Under Maryland law, sexual solicitation of a minor does not require that the perpetrator know the victim's age. And before this case, under Board of Immigration Appeals precedent, a sexual offense against a child categorically involved moral turpitude only if the perpetrator knew or should have known that the victim was a minor.

First, the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Silva-Trevino I\n   </em>\n   was consistent with the weight of Board and federal court precedent, serving as a \"rearticulat[ion] with greater clarity\" of a mental culpability requirement already being applied in most cases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 689 n.1 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20687\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 706-07 &amp; n.5.

Nor, we note, can it be reconciled with the decision's holding: that a Texas offense much like Maryland's, criminalizing all forms of sexual contact with a child, does not categorically involve moral turpitude \"[b]ecause [it] is broad enough to punish behavior that is not accompanied by the defendant's knowledge that the victim was a minor.\" 26 I. &amp; N.

And even if it did, the government's argument would face a second problem: There still is no explanation for the Board's decision to abandon the requirement of mental culpability as to a victim's age, in whole or in part. Footnote nine does no more than \"reserve\" the possibility that the Board might in the future reconsider\n   <em>\n    Silva-Trevino I\n   </em>\n   's application to statutory rape; it is not itself a change in position, and it provides no explanation for why statutory rape should be excluded from\n   <em>\n    Silva-Trevino I\n   </em>\n   's long-standing rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silva-Trevino III\n   </em>\n   , 26 I. &amp; N.

Jimenez-Cedillo argues that when he entered his guilty plea in February of 2015,\n   <em>\n    Silva-Trevino I\n   </em>\n   was in effect, giving him every reason to believe he was pleading guilty to an offense that did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   qualify as a crime involving moral turpitude because it did not allow for a mistake-of-age defense. As both the Supreme Court and the Board have made clear, aliens have an important interest in being able to anticipate the immigration consequences of guilty pleas, allowing them to enter \"safe harbor\" pleas that do not expose them to immigration-related penalties.\n   <em>\n    Mellouli v.
