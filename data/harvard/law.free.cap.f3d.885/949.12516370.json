The district court followed this rule, and we AFFIRM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2007, after appellant John Turner robbed four Memphis-area businesses at gunpoint, he was arrested by a Memphis police officer who was part of a joint federal-state \"Safe Streets Task Force.\" Turner hired an attorney. A Tennessee grand jury indicted Turner on multiple counts of aggravated robbery, and Turner's attorney represented him in plea negotiations with state prosecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During the state proceedings, the state prosecutor informed Turner's attorney\n   that the United States Attorney's Office planned to bring federal charges against Turner. Turner's attorney contacted the Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\") responsible for Turner's case, who confirmed that the United States planned to bring federal robbery and firearms charges that could result in a mandatory minimum of eighty-two years' imprisonment for the firearms charges alone. The AUSA conveyed to Turner's attorney a plea offer of fifteen years' imprisonment which would expire if and when a federal grand jury indicted Turner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Turner's attorney says that he correctly and timely relayed the federal plea offer to Turner, but that Turner refused it. Turner disputes this. In any event, Turner did not accept the federal plea offer before the federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee indicted him in 2008. Turner hired a new attorney and negotiated a plea deal which resulted in twenty-five years' imprisonment. As part of Turner's plea agreement, he waived his right to file a direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2012, Turner filed a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   motion alleging that his original attorney rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance during the federal plea negotiations. The district court, following Sixth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent, found that Turner's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not yet attached during his preindictment federal plea negotiations and denied his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A panel of this court affirmed the district court.\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

Accordingly, as Justice Joseph Story emphasized, it should be the objective meaning of the constitutional text, not the drafter's, editor's, or ratifier's subjective intention, that is to be ascertained, for \"[t]he people adopted the [C]onstitution according to the words of the text in their reasonable interpretation, and not according to the private interpretation of any particular men.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Call this the \"What did the average Joe (or Josephine) from the Founding era understand the words to mean?\" approach.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    This latter method, like most searches for word meaning, begins with the dictionary.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ariz.

Accordingly, I will first consult the prevailing lay and legal dictionaries of the time period when the Sixth Amendment was adopted. Second, I will look to Founding-era statutes and legal decisions interpreting the words \"accused\" and \"criminal prosecution\" to see whether these words were likely used and understood by the Framers and their contemporaries in a manner consistent with their dictionary definitions and not in some narrower sense. Finally, after articulating how the words \"accused\" and \"criminal prosecution\" were likely understood in the Founding era, I will apply that understanding by analogy to the facts of the case before us.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    This last step warrants brief explanation. Sometimes the Supreme Court articulates the original meaning of a constitutional provision with sufficient specificity that it applies directly to the facts of the case being decided.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Heller\n    </em>\n    , 554 U.S. at 624-27,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p603\">\n     128 S.Ct. 2783\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (explaining meaning of the right to bear arms such that the firearms regulation at issue could not then withstand\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    level of judicial scrutiny). But sometimes the Court articulates a more general understanding of such\n    a provision, which it then applies inductively, whether by analogy or otherwise, to the case before it.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Founding-Era Dictionaries\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Contrary to what one might surmise from Supreme Court precedents, Founding-era dictionaries offer no reason to suppose either that \"accused\" as used in the Sixth Amendment was commonly understood to mean \"indicted\" or that it was a term of art understood by the legally trained to mean \"indicted.\" Of the nine prevailing general English dictionaries (that is, non-legal dictionaries) of the Founding era, eight define \"accuse\" as some version of \"to charge with a crime; to blame or censure,\" and all nine offer a definition much broader than \"to indict.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    As for the four prevailing\n    <em>\n     legal\n    </em>\n    English dictionaries of the Founding era, one does not define \"accuse\" (or related words) at all;\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    the other three define \"accusation\" by example, citing Clause 39 of the Magna Carta: \"By\n    <em>\n     Magna Charta\n    </em>\n    , no man shall be imprisoned or condemned on any\n    <em>\n     accusation\n    </em>\n    , without trial by his peers, or the law.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    One can draw two conclusions: \"accused\" was a word in general usage (not a term with peculiar meaning in the law), and \"accused\" had a meaning that was broader than \"indicted.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Likewise with the Sixth Amendment's reference to \"criminal prosecutions\": Although there is no particular definition of that phrase, eight of the nine general English dictionaries cited above do define the word \"prosecution,\" and seven of the eight give a primary definition of that term such as \"[a] pursuit, an endeavor to carry on any design.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    This definition contemplates a broad meaning of \"prosecution\"-something reminiscent of its etymological meaning of pursuing a goal.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    The dictionaries also include more specific secondary definitions\n    such as \"a process at law\" and a \"suit against a man in a criminal cause.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    Nor do the legal dictionaries give reason to define a \"prosecution\" as occurring only post-indictment: of the four prevailing dictionaries, three do not define the word (or related words)\n    <em>\n     at all\n    </em>\n    -and the one legal dictionary that defines \"prosecutor\" does so only as \"he that follows a cause in another's name.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    From this evidence, one may draw two conclusions: \"prosecution\" was in general usage, and it was understood to have a broader meaning than referring only to the post-indictment critical stages of a judicial criminal action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    One also notes that\n    <em>\n     nowhere\n    </em>\n    else in the original Constitution or the Amendments does either \"accused\" or \"criminal prosecution\" (or a related word) appear except in the Sixth Amendment. In particular, the Sixth Amendment's unique use of the words \"[i]n all criminal\n    <em>\n     prosecutions\n    </em>\n    \" (emphasis added) to demarcate its rights prompts this question: if Sixth Amendment rights were to attach only after indictment, why didn't the Sixth Amendment state that it applied in a \"criminal case\" (as used in the Fifth Amendment) or in all criminal \"Cases\" (as used along with \"Controversies\" in Article III)? It is arguable that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions\" as used in the Sixth Amendment imparted temporally broader meaning than would have been imparted by the words \"[i]n all criminal cases.\" This word choice was consistent with the Founding-era dictionaries discussed above and other sources discussed below indicating that a \"criminal prosecution,\" indeed, could begin before a \"criminal case\" commenced.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    2.

From the imperfection of human language, it frequently happens that sentences which ought to be the most explicit are of doubtful construction; and in this case the words \"accused or indicted\" may be construed to be synonymous, to describe a person in the same situation,\n    <em>\n     or to apply to different stages of the prosecution\n    </em>\n    . The word \"or\" may be taken in a conjunctive\n    <em>\n     or a disjunctive sense\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     A reason for understanding them in the latter sense is furnished by the section itself.\n    </em>\n    It commences with declaring that any person who shall be accused and indicted of treason shall have a copy of the indictment, and at least three days before his trial. This right is obviously to be enjoyed after an indictment, and therefore the words are, \"accused and indicted.\" So with respect to the subsequent clause, which authorizes a party to make his defence, and directs the court, on his application, to assign him counsel. The words relate to any person accused and indicted. But, when the section proceeds to authorize the compulsory process for witnesses, the phraseology is changed. The words are, \"and every such person or persons accused or indicted,\" &amp;c.,\n    <em>\n     thereby adapting the expression to the situation of an accused person both before and after indictment\n    </em>\n    .\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6579548\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-cas/25/30/#p32\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphases added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Chief Justice Marshall thus understood Burr to be \"accused\" before he was \"indicted.\" Though Marshall addressed those terms as used in the Crimes Act, the clear implication of\n    <em>\n     Burr\n    </em>\n    's reasoning for the Sixth Amendment was that Burr, though not yet indicted, was nonetheless an \"accused\" in a \"criminal prosecution\" for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    And because the\n    right to compulsory process is constrained by the same terms as the right to counsel, it is reasonable to accord significant weight to Chief Justice Marshall's analysis in the\n    <em>\n     Burr\n    </em>\n    case as evidence of the Founding-era understanding of \"accused\" and \"criminal prosecution\" as those terms constrain the right to counsel as well.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Indeed, in the above-quoted passage from\n    <em>\n     Burr\n    </em>\n    , Chief Justice Marshall noted that under the Crimes Act of 1790, the\n    <em>\n     statutory\n    </em>\n    right of a party to apply for the court \"to assign him counsel\" under that Act did not accrue until the party was both \"accused\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    indicted\" (emphasis added). In contrast, a person's\n    <em>\n     constitutional\n    </em>\n    right under the Sixth Amendment to retain an attorney through his own efforts and receive \"assistance of counsel for his defence\" could accrue prior to indictment (i.e., when the person was only \"accused\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Chief Justice Marshall's holding in\n    <em>\n     Burr\n    </em>\n    also recognized that a \"criminal prosecution\" could exist prior to an indictment.

Other Federal Court Decisions\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    A few other federal court decisions shed additional light on the meaning of \"accused\" and \"criminal prosecution.\" The United States Circuit Court for the Third Circuit,\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n    for example, both recognized the right of a defendant to compulsory process before indictment and grappled with whether a defendant's failure to exercise that right before indictment was a failure of due diligence sufficient to forfeit the right\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    indictment.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

The court ruled that it was not, but it stands out that no judge appeared to question the notion that the Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process, though it extends only to an \"accused\" in a \"criminal prosecution,\" extended to pre-indictment defendants.\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Likewise, in\n    <em>\n     Ex parte Burford\n    </em>\n    , Chief Justice Marshall, this time writing for the Supreme Court, granted a writ of habeas corpus ordering the release of a prisoner who had been jailed based only on a warrant stating that he was \"not of good name and fame, nor of honest conversation, but an evil doer,\" and thus had an obligation to put up a $4000 surety against his inevitable bad behavior.\n    <em>\n     Ex parte Burford\n    </em>\n    , 3 Cranch (7 U.S.) 448,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1427712\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/7/448/\">\n     2 L.Ed. 495\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1806). The Chief Justice held that the Sixth Amendment right \"to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation\" applied to the prisoner even though he had been apprehended based only on a warrant and not formally charged with any crime.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 452. Again, Marshall interpreted the Sixth Amendment to grant rights that attached pre-indictment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      C. Applying the Evidence to Turner's Case\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    To be sure, the sources cited above are not conclusive, and I do not purport to have explored all relevant sources as to when the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches.\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    But the Founding-era\n    sources I have considered may be useful for future development of right-to-counsel jurisprudence even if they do not decide Turner's case. Whatever the bounds of \"accused\" and \"criminal prosecution\" may be, the Founding generation quite possibly would have understood Turner to be an \"accused.\" And though the Framers had no understanding of modern-day charge bargaining, it takes no stretch of logic to conclude that, in Turner's case, the\n    <em>\n     prosecutor\n    </em>\n    's presentment of an offer to enter into an agreement that would functionally\n    <em>\n     terminate\n    </em>\n    the judicial proceedings against him came\n    <em>\n     during\n    </em>\n    rather than prior to a \"criminal prosecution\" as those words were originally understood.\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Nor does the fact that charge bargaining was alien to the Framers preclude our application of their understanding of the Sixth Amendment to the modern-day charge-bargaining context. As in cases like\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Crawford\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Part I.A,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court routinely applies Founding-era precepts to then-unknowable modern-day scenarios. And twenty-first-century federal charge bargaining-a process for determining which crimes are to be formally charged-is analogous, for example, to the examination process under eighteenth-century Virginia law in which it was determined which crimes would or would not be allowed to proceed to trial. Thus, it makes sense to look to sources like those cited above as a starting point in analyzing Turner's right-to-counsel claim, and, should the Supreme Court wish to reconsider its right-to-counsel jurisprudence, these important and frequently overlooked sources may prove relevant to that task as well.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    It is difficult to imagine that any jurist today would quibble much with Turner's right to\n    <em>\n     retain\n    </em>\n    counsel in Turner's circumstances. Surely what has prompted this en banc review is not Turner's right to\n    <em>\n     retain\n    </em>\n    counsel but rather his right to\n    <em>\n     free, effective\n    </em>\n    counsel. But those rights are, the Supreme Court has told us, one and the same.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Martinez v.

In other words, Turner argues that where, as here, a defendant is being jointly investigated and prosecuted by both state and federal authorities for the same crimes, and is indicted by one jurisdiction, the right to counsel attaches as to all charges stemming from the defendant's conduct in all jurisdictions. Contrary to the majority opinion, I agree with Turner that when a defendant is indicted first in state court, and is later indicted for the same offense in federal court, the right to counsel attaches after the first state court indictment and covers all interactions with prosecutors related to the later federal indictment. In this case, however, Turner is not entitled to relief because he was not prosecuted for the \"same offense\" in both state and federal court as that term is defined in federal law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Texas v.

Where, as here, the same conduct supports a federal or a state prosecution, a dual sovereignty exception would permit one sovereign to question a defendant whose right to counsel had attached, to do so in the absence of counsel and then to share the information with the other sovereign without fear of suppression. We easily conclude that\n    <em>\n     Cobb\n    </em>\n    was intended to prevent such a result.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    <em>\n     Mills\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8968756\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/325/#p330\">\n     412 F.3d at 330\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (footnote omitted).

On appeal, the question was whether the burglary and murder were the same \"offense.\" Although some courts had devised a test which considered two crimes the same if they were factually related (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    committed on the same day), the Court imported the\n    <em>\n     Blockburger\n    </em>\n    test from the double jeopardy definition of \"offense,\" and held that two offenses are not the same for Sixth Amendment purposes if each requires proof of a fact that the other does not.\n    <em>\n     Cobb\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300919\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/162/#p168\">\n     532 U.S. at 173\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300919\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/162/#p168\">\n     121 S.Ct. 1335\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ].

But that statement is ambiguous in context; the Supreme Court was not confronted with the question of whether the dual sovereignty doctrine applies in the Sixth Amendment context, and there is no other discussion in the opinion that sheds light on the question before the\n    <em>\n     en banc\n    </em>\n    Court here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Coker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881053\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/39/#p43\">\n     433 F.3d at 49-51\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Cyr, J., dissenting). And as the Second Circuit noted in\n    <em>\n     Mills\n    </em>\n    , applying the dual sovereignty doctrine under the circumstances presented by this case would lead to illogical and perverse results. By accepting the government's position, the Court allows federal authorities to speak to defendants\n    who have been indicted in state court pursuant to a joint federal-state investigation without counsel present, and then both relay all of the information they have obtained to state prosecuting authorities and also use that information in a separate federal prosecution for the same offense conduct. In effect, the Court is sanctioning an end-run around the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel by federal-state task forces. This result surely was not envisioned when the Sixth Amendment was drafted, because until recently there was \"little, if any, official coordination\" between state and federal law enforcement authorities.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Thomas White,\n    <em>\n     Limitations Imposed on the Dual Sovereignty Doctrine by the Federal and State Governments\n    </em>\n    , 38 N.

As this formulation makes clear, each statute has an element that the other does not. To wit, Tennessee aggravated robbery requires either the use of a weapon or resulting great bodily harm, while Hobbs Act robbery requires neither of those things, and Hobbs Act robbery requires that the robbery have affected interstate commerce,\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    while Tennessee aggravated robbery has no such element. Therefore, (i) the two crimes are not the \"same offense\" under the\n    <em>\n     Blockburger\n    </em>\n    test, and (ii) under\n    <em>\n     Cobb\n    </em>\n    , Turner's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not triggered with respect to federal authorities when he was indicted by Tennessee for aggravated robbery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Turner's arguments to the contrary essentially ignore the interstate commerce element of Hobbs Act robbery. As recited earlier, Turner implicitly assumes that the government must only prove the elements of simple robbery in order to make out a Hobbs Act charge, and that therefore Hobbs Act robbery is essentially a lesser included offense of Tennessee aggravated robbery. But the interstate commerce element is not merely window dressing ; if the government fails to prove it, the defendant is entitled to acquittal as a matter of law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Wang\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11240354\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/234/#p240\">\n     222 F.3d 234\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 240-41 (6th Cir. 2000) (reversing Hobbs Act robbery conviction where the government failed to prove that the robbery had more than a\n    <em>\n     de minimis\n    </em>\n    effect on interstate commerce).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Accordingly, Hobbs Act robbery is not merely a lesser version of Tennessee aggravated robbery, but a separate offense with different substantive elements. Under\n    <em>\n     Cobb\n    </em>\n    , that conclusion compels the related conclusion that Turner's right to counsel was not triggered during his preindictment federal plea negotiations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    <strong>\n     III. Summary\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Because the Supreme Court's opinion in\n    <em>\n     Gouveia\n    </em>\n    expressly held that Sixth Amendment rights do not attach until formal judicial adversarial proceedings are commenced and because the Supreme Court has never overruled or revised\n    <em>\n     Gouveia\n    </em>\n    , I join that part of the judgment of the\n    <em>\n     en banc\n    </em>\n    court. This Court could not hold that the right to counsel attaches during pre-indictment plea negotiations without squarely violating the holding in\n    <em>\n     Gouveia\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    However, I disagree with the\n    <em>\n     en banc\n    </em>\n    court that the dual sovereignty doctrine from the double-jeopardy context applies to the Sixth Amendment right-to-counsel context. When preindictment plea negotiations with the federal government occur after the defendant has been indicted in state court for the same offense at issue in the federal negotiations, the right to counsel protects the defendant in his interactions with the government. But in this case, Turner had not been indicted for the \"same offense\" in state court as that term is used in federal law, and therefore his right to counsel had not attached during his federal pre-indictment plea negotiations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Although today we hold otherwise, the right to counsel\n    <em>\n     should\n    </em>\n    attach during preindictment plea negotiations. The current rule leads to unduly harsh consequences for criminal defendants. It allows prosecutors to exploit uncounseled criminal defendants, and leaves counseled defendants, just like Turner, without a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel when their attorneys render deficient performance.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    The purpose of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is to protect the \"unaided layman at critical confrontations with his adversary.\"\n    <em>\n     Gouveia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196731\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/180/#p188\">\n     467 U.S. at 189\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196731\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/180/#p188\">\n     104 S.Ct. 2292\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

This reasoning misses the point of the case before us in several important ways. By elevating general language to a static rule, it disregards the Supreme Court's development across time of the law governing Sixth Amendment claims, particularly the Court's practical recognition of the changing criminal justice system and its responsive jurisprudence extending the right to counsel to events before trial. This reasoning also ignores the purpose of an en banc court-to determine whether existing circuit caselaw has failed to correctly understand or apply legal principles or Supreme Court precedent. Finally and as ably explicated by Judge Bush's historical analysis, relying on a rigid, mechanical\n    approach closes the door to the apparent understanding of our Founders, including the authors of the Sixth Amendment, that Turner would have been recognized as an \"accused.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    Instead of presuming a rule-bound outcome, this case calls upon us to answer a question that the Supreme Court has not yet had the occasion to address: Does the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attach to preindictment plea negotiations when a prosecutor has presented a formal plea deal for specific forthcoming charges? The Supreme Court's Sixth Amendment precedent supports holding that such a plea offer qualifies as an adversary judicial proceeding and therefore triggers the accused's right to counsel. The failure to grapple with this precedent and engage in the requisite fact-intensive inquiry gives license to a system in which individuals are confronted with criminal charges and coerced into signing away their liberty without access to legal representation. Because I believe that the Sixth Amendment prohibits this kind of prosecutorial end run around the right to counsel, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    <strong>\n     ***\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    The Supreme Court has described the Sixth Amendment right to counsel as \"embod[ying] a realistic recognition of the obvious truth that the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to protect himself when brought before a tribunal with power to take his life or liberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned counsel.\"\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.

The Supreme Court's circumstance-specific inquiry in\n    <em>\n     Rothgery\n    </em>\n    again reflects its commitment to a practical, case-by-case resolution of attachment questions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    The majority opinion concludes that the \"attachment rule is crystal clear\" because the right to counsel does not attach until the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings. But this conclusion begs the question because it fails to engage with what the Court means by adversary judicial proceedings. The Supreme Court has never applied a mechanical, indictment-based rule in its attachment cases. It has instead repeatedly scrutinized the confrontation, evaluating both the relationship of the state to the accused and the potential consequences for the accused. Based on this longstanding and explicit practice, it falls on us to apply the paradigm first set forth in\n    <em>\n     Kirby\n    </em>\n    and reiterated numerous times since: We must scrutinize Turner's formal federal plea offer to determine whether it marked the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    I think it clear that a formal plea offer on specific forthcoming charges contains all of the trappings of an adversary judicial proceeding. First and foremost, an individual who receives a formal plea offer has become an accused.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Prosecutors do not\n    make plea offers to all suspects, only those who face impending charges. It would be an ethical violation for a prosecutor to make a formal plea offer if she did not intend to bring charges or if she lacked the factual or legal basis to do so.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    Am. Bar Ass'n,\n    <em>\n     Criminal Justice Standards for the Prosecution Function\n    </em>\n    , Standard 3-5.6(g) (4th ed. 2015); U.S. Dep't of Justice,\n    <em>\n     U.S. Attorneys' Manual\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 9-27.430 (2017). Thus, when a prosecutor extends a formal plea offer for specific charges, she has cemented her position as a defendant's adversary and she has committed herself to prosecute. Even if a police investigation remains ongoing, by communicating a formal and specific plea offer, the prosecutor signals that an individual has transitioned from a mere suspect to an accused. Formal plea offers also undoubtedly expose individuals to the intricacies of substantive and procedural law. This is precisely the sort of confrontation at which an inexperienced defendant who lacks legal skill risks signing away his liberty to a savvy and learned prosecutor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    Turner's case well illustrates this point. When the federal prosecutor communicated the plea offer to Turner's attorney, Turner already faced state robbery charges. The federal prosecutor had already committed himself to prosecute Turner-he had plans to present the federal charges to a grand jury if Turner did not accept the preindictment plea offer. Without question, that prosecutor was acting as Turner's adversary and exposing him to a minimum of more than eighty years in prison, a de facto life sentence. Turner, meanwhile, was confronted with the prosecutorial forces of organized society. To meaningfully evaluate the plea deal, Turner had to understand the charges he faced, the punishments prescribed for those charges, the defenses available to him, the strength of the case against him, and the risks of proceeding to trial. Evaluating the offer also required fluency in the complexities of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, a task that is challenging even to experienced attorneys. In sum, when scrutinizing the formal federal plea offer Turner received-as we must-I am persuaded that it marked the initiation of \"adversary judicial proceedings.\" Turner's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    My conclusion is buttressed by the Supreme Court's analysis of post-indictment plea negotiations in\n    <em>\n     Missouri v.

When plea negotiations take place before an indictment, they may be an accused's\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    adversarial confrontation. Denying an accused the right to counsel during preindictment plea negotiations therefore all but ensures that his window of exposure to the criminal justice system will open with the prosecutor and close in the prison system. Evaluating a formal plea offer, which reflects deliberate state\n    action, moreover, requires the guidance of legal counsel just as much before an indictment as after an indictment. Accordingly, the logic animating\n    <em>\n     Lafler\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Frye\n    </em>\n    's conclusion that plea negotiations are a critical stage supports a determination that the right to counsel attaches when the prosecution makes a preindictment plea offer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    I find today's decision particularly concerning for two additional reasons. First, it will leave unprotected whole hosts of defendants. As the\n    <em>\n     Lafler\n    </em>\n    Court emphasized, \"[c]riminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials.\"\n    <em>\n     Lafler\n    </em>\n    , 566 U.S. at 170,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188541\" index=\"396\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/156/#p162\">\n     132 S.Ct. 1376\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Indeed, one of our own cases made this same observation nearly two decades ago:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n    Yet, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines have substantially increased the importance of preindictment plea bargaining. In terms of percentages, the number of pleas continues to rise. Each year since 1990 the percentage of all convictions represented by pleas of guilty or nolo contendere has increased. In 1990, 40,452 people pleaded guilty or nolo contendere; in 1998, 56,256 people so pleaded. These numbers represent 86.575% and 93.940% of all convictions during those respective years. The vast majority of these pleas are the products of plea agreements.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    <em>\n     United States v. Moody\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11455200\" index=\"397\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/609/#p614\">\n     206 F.3d 609\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 616-17 (6th Cir. 2000) (Wiseman, J. concurring) (citations omitted). Judge Wiseman, a district court judge sitting by designation, also explained that the advent of the Guidelines has resulted in increased pressure on \"prosecutors and defendants to engage in plea bargaining ever earlier in the criminal process. As early as 1992 commentators noted that the Guidelines provide an incentive to engage in pre-indictment plea bargaining.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11455200\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/609/#p614\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11455200\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/609/#p614\">\n     at 617\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citations omitted). This remains true: At oral argument the parties and this court acknowledged the heavy reliance on preindictment plea bargaining, and the value of having counsel involved in that process. Although we increasingly normalize and depend on preindictment plea negotiations, today's decision insulates those confrontations from the constitutional protections on which our criminal justice system ordinarily relies. They are likewise insulated from constitutional review. As Turner's case teaches, even those who have representation during preindictment plea negotiations are now foreclosed from bringing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    Second, the majority's wooden adherence to its attachment-only-on-indictment rule raises the specter of prosecutorial manipulation. (Turner himself was offered a plea deal that exploded on indictment, betraying an effort to bypass entirely the traditional criminal process.) If the right to counsel does not attach before indictment, prosecutors can simply delay indicting people to extract unfavorable and uncounseled plea agreements. When 93.9% of all convictions in 1998 resulted from pleas, and that percentage apparently continues to increase, we are consigning the vast majority of citizens exposed to the American justice system to navigate the confines of an adversarial and critical plea bargaining process without legal representation. The Sixth Amendment does not countenance giving hostages to fortune in this way.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    ***\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    The Supreme Court has expressly instructed courts to place criminal confrontations under the microscope and to apply a flexible, fact-specific analysis, but the majority opinion instead turns a blind eye to the practical realities of the situation in which Turner and multitudes of other citizens find themselves. Turner stood accused of a crime by an experienced federal prosecutor, yet today's decision condemns him and the ever-growing number of those\n    similarly situated to confront such accusations without the professional legal skills necessary to protect them from the unwarranted loss of their liberty.\n    <em>\n     Zerbst\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10805\" index=\"399\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/458/#p462\">\n     304 U.S. at 462-63\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10805\" index=\"400\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/458/#p462\">\n     58 S.Ct. 1019\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . I believe that this result violates the Sixth Amendment. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-180\">\n     I note that the Court's precedents do not expressly state that\n     <em>\n      only\n     </em>\n     a \"formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment\" may trigger the attachment of the right to counsel.\n     <em>\n      Cf.\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Rothgery v.

Nevertheless, because the Court's precedents imply that attachment of the right to counsel requires at least some post-arrest formalization of the criminal case such as by indictment or magistration, and because there was no such formalization in Turner's case, a reversal here would appear to contravene the Court's attachment jurisprudence.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-181\">\n     Letter from James Madison to Jared Sparks (Apr. 8, 1831),\n     <em>\n      reprinted in\n     </em>\n     Gouverneur Morris,\n     <em>\n      The Diary and Letters of Gouverneur Morris\n     </em>\n     , vol. 1, at 17 (Anne Cary Morris ed. 1888).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-182\">\n     Letter from Gouverneur Morris to Henry W.

But, as Justice Thomas recently wrote, \"the Sixth Amendment was designed to abolish\" rather than reify such English common-law practices as the denial of counsel in felony prosecutions.\n     <em>\n      Luis v.

And the American states resoundingly rejected the English system in their constitutions and statutes by recognizing a general right to be heard by means of counsel and without a law-versus-facts distinction.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Beaney,\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n     , at 29. Accordingly, I do not rely on Blackstone's Commentaries as probative evidence of the Founding-era understanding of \"accused\" and \"criminal prosecution\" as those words constrain the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"25\">\n    <p id=\"p-206\">\n     It is beyond the ambit of this opinion to determine exactly what the bounds of these words are.

But I reach neither of those conclusions; instead, my conclusion is simply that the analysis of Turner's claim should begin with evidence of the original meaning of these words, and that the next time a court considers the Sixth Amendment right to counsel anew, that court's analysis should likewise begin with such evidence.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-207\">\n     Otherwise, the Hobbs Act would not be a valid exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause powers under Article I of the Constitution.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-208\">\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Steven J.
