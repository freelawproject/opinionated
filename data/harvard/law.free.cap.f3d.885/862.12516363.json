Accordingly, we DENY the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Vazquez, a native and citizen of Mexico, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident around October 12, 2007. On August 28, 2013, Vazquez was convicted in Oklahoma for possession of a controlled and dangerous substance, cocaine, in violation of Oklahoma Statute Annotated title 63, \u00a7 2-402(A)(1) (2013). Vazquez pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a deferred term of imprisonment of three years, to serve 30 days, followed by 24 months of supervised probation. On July 23, 2015, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued Vazquez a Notice to Appear, charging that he was subject to removal pursuant to \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i), because he was convicted of a controlled substance violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Vazquez denied the factual allegations pertaining to his conviction, noting that the judgment was deferred and, under Oklahoma law, the conviction would be automatically expunged upon his satisfactory completion of the probation term. He also sought, and received, several continuances while he collaterally attacked his conviction in state court. The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found by clear and convincing evidence that Vazquez was convicted of cocaine possession based on documentary evidence submitted by the DHS. The documentary evidence provided that Vazquez pleaded guilty in 2013 to \"possession of controlled dangerous substance-cocaine.\" The IJ concluded that Vazquez's conviction was valid for immigration purposes, and he was removable as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Vazquez appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA. He argued, inter alia, that the IJ failed to conduct a categorical analysis of the statute of conviction, the statute was not divisible, and violating Oklahoma's controlled substances statute did not equate to violating the federal Controlled Substances Act because the Oklahoma and federal schedules did not categorically match. The BIA dismissed the appeal, concluding that Vazquez was removable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i) because his conviction for possession of a controlled and dangerous substance in violation of Oklahoma state law was a categorical match to the corresponding federal offense. Specifically, the BIA noted that it \"fail[ed] to find any of the alleged differences cited by [Vazquez] on appeal\" after conducting a de novo comparison of controlled substances listed in Oklahoma's Schedule II, Part B with the substances included in Schedule II of the federal drug schedules. The BIA noted that even if Oklahoma's drug schedules included substances that were not included in the federal drug schedules,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   there must be a realistic probability that the State would prosecute conduct under the statute that falls outside the generic definition of the removable offense to defeat a charge of removability under the categorical approach. In other words ... we presume there is a categorical match between state and federal drug schedules unless the respondent shows that the state actually prosecutes cases involving substances not on the federal schedule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Vazquez filed a timely petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In\n   <em>\n    Dale v.

In this case, Vazquez exhausted his argument that the Oklahoma statute is broader than its federal counterpart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Vazquez asserts that he properly raised all issues before the BIA. Specifically, he exhausted the issue of whether or not the Oklahoma controlled substance schedules included more substances than the federal schedules such that they were not a generic match. Thus, a controlled substance offense under Oklahoma law could not categorically be an offense related to a controlled substance as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i). Not only did Vazquez provide a concrete statement in his brief to which he could tie his claim on appeal, but Vazquez explicitly argued the exact claim he makes before this Court: \"[a] review of the Oklahoma statute of conviction ... reveals that the Oklahoma schedules contain substances that are not contained in any of the five federal schedules.\" In support of his claim, Vazquez\n   argued that his conviction was not categorically related to a federally controlled substance because Oklahoma's drug schedules, specifically subsection B of Schedule II, included 20 substances not included in the federal drug schedules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Vazquez argued that Oklahoma's drug schedules included substances that were not included in any of the federal drug schedules, we conclude that he exhausted the issue and we therefore have jurisdiction to hear his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, Vazquez relies on three other substances that he claims are not included in any federal schedule: Salvia Divinorum, Salvinorin A, and Cyclohexamine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Salvia Divinorum and Salvinorin A are not federally controlled substances.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Okla.

Although Vazquez did not reference these specific substances in his brief to the BIA, we find that he exhausted his overbreadth argument. While Vazquez may have cited different\n   <em>\n    examples\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    issue\n   </em>\n   he identified was that the Oklahoma schedules were not a categorical match to federal schedules. Vazquez explicitly told the BIA as much in his brief. Because Vazquez's criminal penalty applies to any Schedule I or II substance, it is necessary to compare the Oklahoma and federal Schedules I and II to determine the acts criminalized under the categorical approach. Vazquez's broader argument was thus sufficient to fairly present the issue before the BIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5896958\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/314/#p318\">\n    562 F.3d at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that the exhaustion requirement was met where the \"petitioners made some concrete statement before the BIA to which they could reasonably tie their claims\"). His argument thus \"embraces\" the more narrow issue of comparing Oklahoma's controlled substance schedules. In any event, where the BIA chooses to address an issue on its merits-here whether the Oklahoma statute was a categorical match to the federal analog-the issue is considered exhausted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Dubon v.

Either way, we may hear Vazquez's claim that he presents on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This is not the case where efficient adjudication is at issue, and Vazquez is not asking us to require the BIA to \"divine from the record all potentially-disputed issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Omari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5896958\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/314/#p318\">\n    562 F.3d at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By making the argument that (1) the Oklahoma statute of conviction was not a categorical match, and (2) the Oklahoma schedules had at least one substance not on the federal schedules, Vazquez fairly identified the issue, notified the BIA of the appropriate standard, and the BIA addressed the merits of his claim. Thus, we may hear the claim Vazquez now makes on appeal-both that the BIA erred in employing the categorical approach and that the Oklahoma\n   statute is not a categorical match to the federal statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

But Vazquez contested the issue of whether the modified approach was proper in his case. He argued on appeal to the BIA that \"his Oklahoma statute of conviction is not divisible but overbroad, such that the modified categorical approach may not be applied to his record of conviction to identify the controlled substance involved here as Cocaine.\" But the BIA did not decide this issue, nor did it appear to apply the modified categorical approach. Although the Government thoroughly briefs this issue, this panel may not affirm on this basis because it was not the BIA's stated rationale. We thus decline to assess whether the Oklahoma statute is divisible, or whether the modified categorical approach applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In limiting its review to Schedule II, rather than reviewing Schedules I and II under Oklahoma and federal law, the BIA erred in its application of the categorical approach. The categorical approach required comparing the Oklahoma statute to its federal analog. In this case, because the Oklahoma statute criminalized controlled substances on Schedule I and II, the BIA should have compared both Schedules I and II. We find that the Oklahoma Statute Annotated title 63, \u00a7 2-402(A)(1) (2013) is facially overbroad under the categorical approach: Oklahoma schedules contain at least two substances (Salvia Divinorum and Salvinorin A) that are not included in any federal schedule.
