In exchange for compliance with the strictest federal mandates, Congress afforded manufacturers express preemption from state laws imposing different or additional \"safety or effectiveness\" requirements for those devices. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a)(2). This case presents an issue of first impression among the Courts of Appeals: how courts should apply that express preemption provision to state law tort claims challenging the design and manufacture of a medical device comprised of multiple components, some of which are from \"Class III\" medical devices subject to federal requirements,\n   <em>\n    Riegel v.

This question, while ancillary when each component of a system receives the same review by the FDA, is central when evaluating hybrid systems, like the one implanted in Mr. Shuker's hip that contain both Class II and Class III components.

Determining the Device at Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Shukers urge on appeal that the \"device\" at issue is the entire hybrid system itself. Any other determination, they argue, would produce unfairness and incongruity by according preemption even when a component is used off-label in a manner \"that was never studied or approved by the FDA,\" Appellant's Br. 23 (capitalization omitted), merely because that component part was pre-approved for use with another system. Appellees, seconded by the FDA, counter that analysis at the component level is the only way to harmonize various provisions of the statute. We agree with Appellees for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , analysis at the component level finds support in the text of the statute and regulations.

Codified in 1938 with the original Act, this definition has always provided that the term \"device\" includes \"components, parts, and accessories,\" mirroring the definition for \"drug\" immediately preceding it, which was and is defined to include \"articles intended for use as a component\" of a drug. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Pub. L. No. 75-717, \u00a7 201(g), (h),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Stat.%201040\">\n    52 Stat. 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1041 (1938) (codified as amended at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20321\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), (h) ). The implementing regulations, at least for quality control purposes, also describe \"[c]omponent\" to include \"any raw material, substance, piece, part, software, firmware, labeling, or assembly which is intended to be included as part of the finished, packaged, and labeled device.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20820.3\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 820.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the Act's provision for off-label use supports a component-level analysis.

As noted, off-label uses of devices (and components) are \"an accepted and necessary corollary of the FDA's mission to regulate in this area without directly interfering with the practice of medicine.\"\n   <em>\n    Buckman Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/#p350\">\n    531 U.S. at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/#p350\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put differently, the regulatory landscape contemplates that devices may be broken down into component parts and individual components used separately by third parties. Even then, however, premarket approval requirements \"apply equally\" to the components, as manufacturers \"generally may not deviate from the requirements imposed through premarket approval regardless of how [a component] is used.\" FDA Amicus Br. 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20396\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Congress thereby has evinced an intent not to \"discourage[ ]\" device manufacturers \"from seeking ... approval of devices with potentially beneficial off-label uses for fear that such use might expose the manufacturer ... to unpredictable civil liability,\"\n   <em>\n    Buckman Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/#p350\">\n    531 U.S. at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/#p350\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and instead to \"protect[ ] manufacturers that have complied with detailed federal requirements from being subject[ ] to liability under state law for doing what federal law required.\" FDA Amicus Br. 9.

The Shukers' claims, however, would impose requirements \"with respect to\" the R3 metal liner that are \"different from, or in addition to,\" federal ones, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a), because, as the District Court correctly observed, \"the heart of each of [the Shukers'] claims\" challenged the safety and effectiveness of the R3 metal liner,\n   <em>\n    Shuker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201475368\">\n    2015 WL 1475368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Neither in the District Court nor on appeal have the Shukers identified any freestanding defect with the Class II device or the R3 Acetabular System\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   . To the contrary, despite conclusory allegations\n   that the R3 System was defective with and without the R3 metal liner that would foreseeably be used with it, the Shukers' negligence, strict liability and breach of implied warranty claims rest on the premise that the R3 System was defective only because it was used with the R3 metal liner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Oral Arg. 79:13-18 (identifying that the defects arose when \"all of the components\" are used \"in tandem\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:19-22 (explaining \"[y]ou can't have the debris coming out without the conjunction of the Class 2 and Class 3 components coming together.

But the FDA already imposed device-specific labeling requirements on the liner, and thus, as the FDA itself points out in its amicus submission, \"a state warning requirement that applie[s] specifically to the use of the R3 system's components with the R3 metal liner in particular\" is preempted.

To state a parallel negligence claim, then, the Shukers were required to plead (1) a duty arising from federal requirements applicable to a medical device, (2) a breach of that duty, and (3) a causal connection between the breach and the Shukers' injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Construing all reasonable inferences in the Shukers' favor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Victaulic Co.\n   </em>\n   , 839 F.3d at 257, the Shukers' Third Amended Complaint plausibly alleges each of these three required elements. First, as to duty, the complaint alleges that the R3 metal liner received premarket approval as part\n   of the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing System and was approved \"only ... for use with [that] ... [s]ystem,\" App. 473, leading to the reasonable inference that the R3 metal liner was a \"restricted device\" under the Medical Device Amendments, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360j(e), and that federal law therefore imposed a duty on Smith &amp; Nephew to refrain from publishing \"false or misleading\" advertising with respect to the R3 metal liner,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20331\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 352(q), even if such advertising was for the purpose of marketing a separate device,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20801.6\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 801.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, as to breach, the complaint asserts that, even though the FDA did not approve the R3 metal liner for use with any hip system other than the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing System, Smith &amp; Nephew \"actively marketed the [R3] metal liner as 'optional' for the [separate] R3 Acetabular System,\" App. 479. The complaint also cites to Smith &amp; Nephew's February 2009 press release, which explicitly announces \"the introduction of a metal liner option for [Smith &amp; Nephew's] R3 Acetabular System.\" App. 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   These factual allegations give rise to the reasonable inference that Smith &amp; Nephew's marketing was \"misleading\" regarding the FDA-approved uses of the R3 metal liner,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20352\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q), and that Smith &amp; Nephew breached its duty under federal law not to advertise its medical device in that misleading manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, as to causation, the Shukers' Third Amended Complaint alleges that Mr. Shuker's surgeon \"either read\" or \"was aware\" of the information in Smith &amp; Nephew's press release, that the surgeon proceeded to find the R3 metal liner \"appropriate\" for Mr. Shuker, \"given his body habitus and his activity level,\" and that Mr. Shuker endured pain \"caused by metal sensitivity due to the degeneration of the metal on metal articulation\" in his hip replacement system. App. 480, 483. Together these factual allegations lead to the reasonable inference that Smith &amp; Nephew's marketing materials caused Mr. Shuker's surgeon to recommend the R3 metal liner and to install it within Mr. Shuker's hip replacement system, a course of action which in turn caused Mr. Shuker's subsequent injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Because the factual allegations in the Shukers' Third Amended Complaint allow us reasonably to infer each of the three legal elements of the Shukers' parallel negligence claim, the complaint contains sufficient facts to \"nudg[e]\" that claim \"across the line from conceivable to plausible,\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , 556 U.S. at 683,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and hence the District Court's dismissal of that claim was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Loss of Consortium\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Loss of consortium is an injury referring to \"the impact of one spouse's physical injuries upon the other spouse's marital privileges and amenities,\" and, while remaining \"a ... distinct cause of action\" for \"loss of services, society, and conjugal affection of one's spouse,\" is a claim \"derivative\" of a spouse's separate\n   claim of injury.\n   <em>\n    Darr Constr.

Because we hold the Shukers have adequately pleaded a negligence claim premised on Mr. Shuker's injuries, they have also adequately pleaded the derivative claim of loss of consortium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Third Amended Complaint alleges that, after Mr. Shuker's hip replacement surgery and \"due to the degeneration of the metal on metal articulation,\" he experienced \"buttocks, groin and thigh discomfort\" that \"caused him pain and extremely limited his daily activities.\" App. 483. Thus, we can reasonably infer that, because of Smith &amp; Nephew's misleading marketing in violation of federal law, the R3 metal liner's subsequent use in Mr. Shuker's hip replacement surgery, and Mr. Shuker's ensuing \"physical injuries,\" Mrs. Shuker suffered a loss of her husband's \"services, society, and conjugal affection.\"\n   <em>\n    Darr Constr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11709779,559445\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/715/1075/\">\n    715 A.2d at 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In contrast to the Shukers' pleading of their other claims, the Shukers' pleading of their fraud claim is not adequate because it does not satisfy Rule 9(b)'s requirement that, though \"intent ... and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally,\" plaintiffs \"must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\" Fed.

Applying that rule here, the Shukers may obtain only jurisdictional discovery \"regarding ... nonprivileged matter that is relevant to [personal jurisdiction over PLC] and proportional to the needs of the case,\" taking into account \"the importance of the issue[ ] at stake ..., the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issue[ ], and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 259 (quoting Fed.
