Conservation Petitioners' Br. 28. As a plant nears the end of its useful life, the state and EPA may tolerate less stringent emissions standards in the short run (because the cost of compliance exceeds emissions benefits in the \"best\" retrofit technology scenario) in exchange for zero emissions in the long run after the plant shuts down. See, e.g.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C686\">\n    78 Fed.

If clause (i) requires modelling to show that visibility in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   Class I area will be as good or better under CSAPR than under BART, then there would be no need to inquire whether there was an improvement measured by \"the\n   <em>\n    average\n   </em>\n   differences between BART and the alternative over all affected Class I areas.\" If every member of a set is superior to every member of some alternative set, the average of the first set is necessarily superior to the average of the second set.

Recall that clause (ii) of EPA's better-than-BART standard is \"determined by comparing the average differences between BART and the alternative over all affected Class I areas.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2051.308\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3)(ii). In this case, EPA considered both the average visibility improvement for all Class I areas in the modeling region subject to CSAPR, as well as the average improvement for all Class I areas nationwide. The conservation petitioners identify fourteen Class I areas nationwide where BART is modeled to outperform CSAPR on the best and worst 20 percent of days. They argue that EPA should somehow subdivide or segment its averages, thereby revealing that CSAPR is not better than BART in all places and circumstances. Again, we think this dispute is foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    UARG I\n   </em>\n   , where we both upheld EPA's regulatory standard and made clear that \"nothing in [the Clean Air Act's] 'reasonable progress' language requires at least as much improvement\n   <em>\n    at each and every individual area as BART itself would achieve\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045721,3561523\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/471/1333/\">\n    471 F.3d at 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). It is in the nature of averages that some particular sites may underperform while others overperform. EPA's rule requires aggregate average improvement, and its comparison of the CSAPR-region Class I areas as well as all Class I areas nationwide was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The state and industry petitioners challenge two related aspects of EPA's action: EPA's rescission of its former rule finding participation in CAIR an adequate BART alternative and its concomitant disapproval of SIPs that relied on CAIR to meet their obligations under BART. In essence, the petitioners argue that if compliance with CAIR had for years allowed them to achieve greater reasonable progress than BART would have, their continued enforcement of emissions standards in line with the now-defunct CAIR must necessarily be found an adequate alternative to BART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   But, of course, without CAIR-which all parties agree is dead and beyond revival-there is no legal basis for a requirement that states control their sources at CAIR levels; indeed, for states that are not part of CSAPR, there is no legal basis for requiring states to participate in any haze-related interstate trading program. We cannot order EPA to consider CAIR an alternative to BART without resurrecting CAIR itself, a rule that we have already stricken and ordered to be vacated.\n   <em>\n    North Carolina I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869258,5864725\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/896/\">\n    531 F.3d at 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    remanded staying vacatur after reh'g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865381,5883542\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1176/\">\n    550 F.3d at 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For this reason, EPA argues that the state and industry petitioners' challenge is moot; there is apparently no relief we can give them. See\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055269,12173701\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/4/\">\n    802 F.3d 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The petitioners save themselves from mootness only by couching their request for relief as \"a contingency.\" Argument Tr. 28. They argue that \"if the CSAPR-for-BART rule-which NPCA and Sierra Club are challenging here-were to be vacated or rescinded, approval of the CAIR-for-BART SIPs would protect State and Industry Petitioners from the adverse effects of EPA's June 2012 actions.\" State &amp; Industry Petitioners' Reply Br. 3. The petitioners seem to have in mind CSAPR's litigation history. When CSAPR was first challenged in this Court, we stayed implementation pending a decision on the merits and ordered EPA to continue to implement CAIR.\n   <em>\n    EME Homer City Generation, L.P. v. EPA\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-1302, Order (D.C. Cir. Dec. 30, 2011). After argument on the merits, we vacated CSAPR and again ordered EPA to keep implementing CAIR.\n   <em>\n    EME Homer City Generation, L.P. v.

Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   But the logic of that analogy does not follow here. In\n   <em>\n    North Carolina II\n   </em>\n   we recognized that CAIR offered\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   environmental benefit, so that EPA's flawed CAIR rule was better than nothing.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865381,5883542\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1176/\">\n    550 F.3d at 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For that same reason we left CAIR in place while remanding CSAPR in\n   <em>\n    EME Homer City\n   </em>\n   . See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869931,5862612\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/7/\">\n    696 F.3d at 37-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But here, CSAPR itself is not challenged, only EPA's finding that CSAPR is a better-than-BART alternative. Even if we were to grant the conservation petitioners' request, vacating CSAPR-for-BART would not restore CAIR-for-BART; it would leave BART in place alone, and CAIR-based SIPs would not become any less problematic. At any rate, because we do not grant the conservation petitioners' request, and the state and industry petitioners have hitched their wagon to that star, their contingency theory fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The petitioners finally argue that EPA could nevertheless approve their CAIR-based SIPs, despite CAIR's demise; EPA has in fact done so in one instance, so it must be feasible. Indeed, EPA approved Connecticut's SIP application on April 26, 2013,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2039%2C322\">\n    79 Fed.

At that time,\n   <em>\n    North Carolina I\n   </em>\n   's reversal of CAIR had been on the books nearly four years, and\n   <em>\n    North Carolina II\n   </em>\n   had made abundantly clear that CAIR was suffered to continue only until EPA promulgated a revised cap and trading rule, at which time CAIR would be vacated.

EPA promulgated its final CSAPR rule on August 8, 2011. 76 Fed. Reg. at 48,208. By June 2012, we had stayed implementation of CSAPR while we reviewed the rule on its merits. But, apparently expecting that CSAPR would shortly be affirmed and take effect, EPA disapproved pending CAIR-based SIP applications and instructed states to submit SIPs based either on CSAPR or other non-CAIR alternatives to BART.

Memorandum from Gina McCarthy, Assistant Administrator, EPA, to Air Division Directors, Regions 1-10, Nov. 19, 2012, at 1-3. Connecticut's partially CAIR-based SIP was submitted in August 2012 and approved by EPA the following April.

In sum, the difference in timing comes down to this: In June of 2012, EPA\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   approved CAIR-based SIPs such as petitioners' but chose not to, given its not unreasonable expectation that CAIR was shortly approaching its end; in April of 2013 (and for the indefinite future while CSAPR's litigation fate remained uncertain), our direction in\n   <em>\n    EME Homer City\n   </em>\n   effectively\n   <em>\n    barred\n   </em>\n   EPA from rejecting Connecticut's CAIR-based SIP on the ground of CAIR's well-known legal infirmity. EPA suggests a variety of other factors that made its approval of Connecticut's SIP reasonable, including Connecticut's comparatively low emissions and its only partial reliance on CAIR. We need not address those factors, however. EPA's different treatments of the petitioning states and Connecticut were not unreasonable at the relevant times, and the difference certainly provides no basis for us to declare the petitioning states subject to a rule that no longer exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because we find no merit in the conservation petitioners' arguments and can afford\n   no relief to the state and industry petitioners, the petitions are\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Denied\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Although EPA signed off on Connecticut's SIP on April 26, 2013, publication in the Federal Register did not follow until July 10, 2014.
