It intertwines allegations of an incestuous relationship with criminal charges of tax evasion, unlawful distribution of controlled substances, and health-care fraud. Following a contentious trial, the jury found defendant-appellant Joel A. Sabean guilty on all of the charged counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant strives to convince us, through a wide-ranging asseverational array, that the jury's verdict should not stand. After careful consideration of a tangled record conspicuously free from prejudicial error, we are not persuaded. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We sketch the relevant events and travel of the case, reserving a fuller elaboration of the facts for our subsequent discussion of specific issues. For this purpose, we take the facts in the light most flattering to the jury verdict, consistent with record support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    George\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173632\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/55/#p59\">\n    841 F.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59 (1st Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant is a licensed physician, specializing in dermatology, who maintained a lucrative practice in Maine for decades. Between 2008 and 2013, the defendant sent his adult daughter S.S., who was then a resident of Florida, between $500 and $1,500 daily. During this interval, the defendant claimed S.S. as a dependent on his tax returns and represented to the government (as well as to his bookkeeper) that much of this money was tax-deductible because it defrayed S.S.'s medical expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For instance, the defendant stated at various times that his daughter needed funds to cover costs associated with temporary brain death, tumors, and amputated limbs. These statements were demonstrably false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant never examined S.S. during the relevant period and, in reality, S.S. never suffered from temporary brain death, tumors, amputated limbs, or the other ailments described by the defendant to his bookkeeper. She squandered much of her father's treasure on drugs, gambling, and gifts for her boyfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant continued sending cash to his daughter even after his wife and office manager complained that he was \"hemorrhaging money\" and would be unable to afford continued outlays. All told, the defendant sent his daughter over $2,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   There was another dimension to this strange relationship. Between 2010 and 2014, the defendant wrote prescriptions for the anti-depressant drugs Ambien, Lunesta, and Alprazolam (commonly known as Xanax ) and transmitted them to pharmacies near his daughter's home. He also wrote and transmitted to Florida pharmacies prescriptions for certain more expensive drugs in the name of his wife Karen, who-unlike S.S.-was covered by health insurance. Karen, though, was bedridden and never set foot in Florida during the relevant time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The mills of the law sometimes grind slow, but they grind exceedingly fine. On October 20, 2015, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Maine charged the defendant, in five counts corresponding to five different tax years, with knowingly evading nearly $1,000,000 in federal tax liability by claiming fraudulent medical deductions between 2009 and 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207201\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The indictment further charged the defendant, in fifty-two counts, with having distributed Ambien, Lunesta, and Xanax to S.S. on fifty-two separate occasions between December 15, 2010 to January 4, 2014 outside the usual course of professional medical practice and without legitimate medical purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201306.04\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306.04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Finally, the indictment charged the defendant, in a single count, with committing health-care fraud by writing certain prescriptions meant for S.S. in his wife's name between March 28, 2010 and December 9, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201347\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During elaborate pretrial skirmishing (much of which is irrelevant here), the district court denied the defendant's motion to sever the tax-evasion counts from the drug-distribution and health-care fraud counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sabean\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:15-cr-175,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205477569\">\n    2016 WL 5477569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D. Me. Sept. 29, 2016). So, too, the court denied the defendant's motion in limine seeking to exclude S.S.'s testimony regarding alleged sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Trial commenced on November 1, 2016 and lasted nine days (exclusive of jury deliberations). At the close of the government's case-in-chief and again at the close of all the evidence, the defendant moved for judgment of acquittal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a). The district court reserved decision on these motions. Following jury instruction, the defendant unsuccessfully objected to the district court's charge concerning the drug-distribution counts. After the jury returned an across-the-board guilty verdict, the district court acted on its previous reservation of decision and denied judgment of acquittal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(b), (c). The court thereafter sentenced the defendant to serve concurrent 24-month terms of immurement on the 58 counts of conviction. This timely appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant, ably represented, assails the judgment below on a multitude of grounds. We start with his most loudly bruited argument, which relates to the admission of other-acts evidence concerning the alleged sexual abuse. We then deal with his objections to the district court's exclusion of certain evidence. Once we have disposed of these evidentiary challenges, we turn our attention to a miscellany of other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. THE DISPUTED EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We subdivide our discussion of the disputed evidentiary rulings into two segments, dealing first with rulings admitting evidence and then with rulings excluding evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Other-Acts Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendant's flagship claim is that the district court improvidently admitted S.S.'s testimony concerning sexual abuse. Some context is needed to place this claim into a workable perspective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   S.S., who was 41 years old at the time of trial, testified that she began having intercourse with her father at around age twelve and that they frequently had sex while she was in high school and in the years that followed. Even after she left Maine and moved to Florida in 2007, she regularly exchanged emails with him detailing sexual fantasies (which they called \"lovegrams\"). They also had \"phone sex.\" While S.S. was on the witness stand, the court admitted emails in which the defendant referred to his daughter in terms such as \"[d]earest woman who has captivated my being,\" \"hot chick,\" and \"Supreme Sextress.\" In one particularly lurid email, the defendant wrote \"penis available, blasting zone.\" In addition, S.S. testified that the defendant often discussed the possibility of marriage with her and claimed at one point to have procured an engagement ring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The government asserts that this evidence was admissible as other-acts evidence and was relevant to show the defendant's motive and absence of mistake. As the government sees it, the jury could have inferred that the defendant sent S.S. money and wrote prescriptions for her in order to buy S.S.'s silence about his abuse and to induce her continued participation in their prurient communications. Relatedly, the government asserts that the defendant committed tax evasion and health-care\n   fraud in an effort to offset the exorbitant costs of this scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although the district court denied the defendant's motion in limine addressed to this testimony, it gave a carefully worded limiting instruction once the witness embarked on this line of testimony. The district court told the jury that the government was offering the testimony \"as evidence of what the Government says is the defendant's motive to commit the tax evasion, prescription fraud and health care fraud.\" Additionally, the court admonished the jury not to \"use evidence of a sexual relationship or sexual contact between the defendant and his daughter to infer that because of his character, the defendant carried out the acts charged in this case.\" The jurors, the court said, were to consider the evidence only for the limited purpose of determining whether the defendant \"had a motive or intent to commit the acts charged in the indictment.\" The court made clear that the jurors could find that the defendant \"had sexual contact or a sexual relationship with his daughter, but still find that the Government has not met its burden of proving that he committed one or all of the crimes charged.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Against this backdrop, we survey the legal landscape. A party may not introduce \"[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act ... to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\" Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). Evidence of other acts may, though, be admissible for certain specific purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205477569\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When an objection is interposed, a proffer of such evidence is subject to a threshold inquiry: the trial court must determine whether \"the finder of fact 'can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Raymond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3622839\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/32/#p38\">\n    697 F.3d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38 (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Huddleston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14005\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/681/#p689\">\n    485 U.S. 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 689,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14005\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/681/#p689\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14005\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/681/#p689\">\n    99 L.Ed.2d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) ). If the answer to this threshold inquiry is in the affirmative, the court next must determine \"whether the evidence submitted 'is probative of a material issue other than character.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14005\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/681/#p689\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Huddleston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14005\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/681/#p689\">\n    485 U.S. at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14005\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/681/#p689\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Put another way, other-acts evidence must have \"special relevance to an issue in the case,\" such as motive, intent, absence of mistake, or knowledge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14005\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/681/#p689\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Varoudakis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11172637\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/113/#p118\">\n    233 F.3d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118 (2000) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A finding of special relevance is a necessary-but not a sufficient-precondition for the admissibility of other-acts evidence. Rule 404(b)\"incorporates\n   <em>\n    sub silentio\n   </em>\n   the prophylaxis of Federal Rule of Evidence 403.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sebaggala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084905\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/256/59/#p67\">\n    256 F.3d 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67 (1st Cir. 2001). It follows that even if other-acts evidence is specially relevant, the trial court may exclude that evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by potential evils such as unfair prejudice, jury confusion, or waste of time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 403. Where, as here, objections to other-acts evidence have been preserved, our review of rulings admitting or excluding such evidence is for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raymond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3622839\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/32/#p38\">\n    697 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   36 ;\n   <em>\n    Varoudakis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11172637\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/113/#p118\">\n    233 F.3d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The logical starting point for our inquiry in this case is the district court's conclusion that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant sexually abused his daughter. As we have explained, \"[w]hen the relevancy of evidence is conditioned on the establishment of a fact\"-here, the fact that the defendant sexually abused S.S.-\"the offering party need only introduce sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find the conditional fact by a preponderance of the evidence to establish that the evidence is\n   relevant.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Balthazard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164200\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/309/#p313\">\n    360 F.3d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313 (1st Cir. 2004) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Trenkler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306783\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/61/45/#p53\">\n    61 F.3d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53 (1st Cir. 1995). On this point, the defendant argues that no sufficient foundation was laid because S.S.'s testimony was incredible. He suggests that no reasonable juror could have believed S.S. in light of her history of committing perjury and engaging in other dishonest acts, and adds that no other basis existed on which to find that sexual abuse transpired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This argument is dead on arrival. With only narrow exceptions not pertinent here, credibility determinations are left to the wisdom of the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alicea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11457811\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/205/480/#p483\">\n    205 F.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483 (1st Cir. 2000) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Scheffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503568\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/303/#p313\">\n    523 U.S. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503568\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/303/#p313\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503568\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/303/#p313\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) (plurality opinion) (explaining that \"the\n   <em>\n    jury\n   </em>\n   is the lie detector\"). Thus, when a jury trial is underway, the court lacks the authority \"to exclude evidence on the basis of [its] own belief as to the persuasiveness of that evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pellegrino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9123877\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/43/#p47\">\n    329 F.3d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (1st Cir. 2003). Although the jury in this case was presented with several reasons that might have led it to discredit S.S.'s testimony,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   it was the jury's prerogative not to do so. After all, the jury's right to judge the credibility of witnesses is not restricted to circumstances in which the witness's testimony is flawless in every respect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alicea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11457811\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/205/480/#p483\">\n    205 F.3d at 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude, therefore, that S.S.'s testimony, combined with the exhibits memorializing the salacious father-daughter correspondence, comprised a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find that the defendant had sexually abused his daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This brings us to the question of whether the other-acts evidence has special relevance to any disputed issue in the case. Evidence has \"special relevance\" when \"it tends to prove a material fact apart from a mere propensity to behave in a certain way.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3526795\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/159/#p165\">\n    695 F.3d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 165 (1st Cir. 2012). A prime example of special relevance, pertinent here, is when evidence of other-act evidence is introduced \"to complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate context of happenings near in time and place.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Goyner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151342\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/157/#p163\">\n    761 F.3d 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163 (1st Cir. 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    D'Alora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"845679\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/585/16/#p20\">\n    585 F.2d 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20 (1st Cir. 1978) ).

Moreover, the bedrock of the defense was that the defendant truly believed that S.S. needed both the money and the extensive medical treatment that he described.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In an effort to change the trajectory of the debate, the defendant suggests that evidence of abuse was not probative of his intent to commit the charged crimes. This suggestion relies on the assertion that S.S. never provided direct testimony that sexual abuse was the reason for either the cash outlays or the bogus prescriptions; indeed, he collects snippets from the transcript in which she \"testified to the contrary.\" In support of this suggestion, the defendant points out that S.S. indicated that she had never threatened to expose the incestuous relationship if her father stopped sending money and drugs. And at another point, S.S. said that the cash and drugs were not meant \"to keep [her] quiet\" but, rather, were meant to keep her \"happy and comfortable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This suggestion misapprehends both the record and the law. With respect to the record, the defendant glosses over other testimony by S.S. that contravenes his synthesis of the transcript. By way of example, S.S. testified that there was an implied understanding between father and daughter that he would send her money and drugs so that she would engage in sexualized communications with him. S.S. also testified that her father threatened to cause her \"big problems\" and \"cut [her] off\" if she ever revealed his sexual abuse. Fairly viewed, S.S.'s testimony was a mixed bag-and it is apodictic that a jury may \"credit some parts of a witness's testimony and disregard other potentially contradictory portions.\"\n   <em>\n    Alicea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11457811\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/205/480/#p483\">\n    205 F.3d at 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With respect to the law, the infirmities of the defendant's argument are even more pronounced. Criminal defendants rarely shout their nefarious intentions from the rooftops.

We recognize that the defendant's behavior was very far from the norm. But though (or perhaps because) that behavior was outrageous, proof of it was necessary to paint an accurate picture of what was transpiring. Without admission of the other-acts evidence, the jury would have been left with an incomplete picture as to why the defendant would funnel millions of dollars to his daughter despite warnings that he was hemorrhaging money, why he would tell his bookkeeper that the funds were for medical conditions that his daughter never experienced, and why he would prescribe highly addictive drugs in large quantities to a person with a drug habit without conducting anything resembling a medical examination of the putative patient. Telling the tale of this case without referring to\n   sexual abuse would be like telling the tale of Abraham Lincoln's assassination at the hands of John Wilkes Booth without mentioning either the Civil War or the Emancipation Proclamation. The jury was entitled to the full picture, and we therefore conclude that the district court's determination of special relevance was within the encincture of its discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151342\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/157/#p163\">\n    761 F.3d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (approving admission of sex-abuse evidence without which the jury \"would have been presented with an incomplete picture\" of defendant's state of mind).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This conclusion does not end our odyssey.

The audiotape would have confirmed that S.S. provided a Florida probation officer with false documentation of her community service and lied under oath that her son had been paralyzed as a result of an automobile accident. It also captured S.S.'s statement of her intention to appear as a \"key witness against\" the defendant in the criminal trial. While the district court permitted the defendant to cross-examine S.S. about this testimony, it sustained the government's objection when the defendant sought to introduce the audiotape itself into evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The defendant asseverates that the audiotape would have shown-far more powerfully than cross-examination-S.S.'s \"motive to lie about her father\" and her \"pattern of lying about her family in order to deflect blame from herself onto others.\" This asseveration runs headlong into Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b), which prohibits \"the introduction of[ ] extrinsic evidence of specific instances of a witness's misconduct if offered to impugn [her] credibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Winchenbach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633649\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/197/548/#p559\">\n    197 F.3d at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis removed). The district court determined that the audiotape comprised extrinsic evidence of particular instances of prevarication that were probative only of S.S.'s penchant for truthfulness. That determination fell comfortably within the scope of the district court's discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Relatedly, the defendant posits that the audiotape was evidence relevant to material (rather than collateral) issues. In his view, S.S.'s testimony played such an important role in the trial that the admissions in the audiotape were \"fact[s] of consequence\" and, thus, not subject to the bar constructed by Rule 608(b). This argument overlooks that the \"facts\" were before the jury through cross-examination of S.S. Perhaps more importantly, this argument reflects a misunderstanding of the applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A matter is collateral if evidence relating to it could only have been introduced for the purpose of impeachment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Schuler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3387922\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/1148/#p1155\">\n    458 F.3d 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1155 (10th Cir. 2006). Viewed in isolation, the contents of the audiotape had no direct bearing on any element of a claim or defense cognizable in the criminal case. Rather, the audiotape was relevant only for the limited purpose of impeaching S.S.'s character for truthfulness. The fact that S.S.'s testimony played a significant role in the case does not alter this reality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendant assays two fallback arguments. First, he argues that the audiotape was admissible to impeach the government's opening statement. To be specific, the government indicated in its opening statement, without objection, that S.S. would disclose the defendant's sexual abuse \"for the first time in public.\" The audiotape, the defendant says, would have revealed that S.S. testified about the sexual abuse publicly on an earlier occasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This argument lacks force. The Evidence Rules permit impeachment of both witnesses and out-of-court declarants whose statements are admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 607, 806. Without more, though, a prosecutor is neither a witness nor a declarant, and his opening statement is not evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715905\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/1222/#p1237\">\n    649 F.3d 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1237 (11th Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the defendant's view, however, there is more to the question. He argues that in this instance, the prosecutor opened the door to rebuttal of this particular statement. But this argument does not gain him any traction: the fact that S.S. had previously testified concerning sexual abuse bore no relevance to any cognizable claim or defense. And in any event, rebuttal became unnecessary because S.S. never adopted the prosecutor's characterization while testifying; she did not deny having previously testified regarding the sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The defendant's second fallback argument is even more of a stretch. He suggests that the audiotape was admissible as evidence of bias. A witness's testimony may be relevant to bias when it pertains to her \"like, dislike, or fear of a party\" or \"self-interest.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Abel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958408\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/45/#p52\">\n    469 U.S. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958408\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/45/#p52\">\n    105 S.Ct. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958408\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/45/#p52\">\n    83 L.Ed.2d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).

In these emails, the defendant complained about S.S.'s profligate spending habits and threatened to stop sending her money. The defendant submits that, if admitted, the emails would have shown that he intended to dry up the flow of funds to S.S. for reasons unrelated to sexual abuse. In this way, he says, they would have undercut the government's theory regarding motive and absence of mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The defendant's claim of prejudicial error is untenable. It is common ground that a declarant's out-of-court statement is inadmissible if it is offered \"to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.\" Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). The threats contained in the 2005 emails were therefore inadmissible to prove that the defendant intended to withhold funds from S.S. because of her thriftless spending unless an exception to the hearsay bar applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To this end, the defendant nonetheless insists that the Rule 803(3) hearsay exception applies. He is mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Rule 803(3) exempts from the hearsay bar statements exhibiting a declarant's \"then-existing state of mind.\" But the exception is not \"a sweeping endorsement of all state-of-mind evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Colasanto\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Life Ins.

Given this temporal gap, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the Rule 803(3) exception unavailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The defendant argues, in the alternative, that the emails were admissible for a different purpose. If this argument holds water, the hearsay bar can be avoided: as long as the significance of an out-of-court declarant's \"statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeCologero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054478\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/36/#p58\">\n    530 F.3d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58 (1st Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).

Even assuming arguendo that the emails could be admitted for a non-hearsay purpose, any error was patently harmless. When, as now, an alleged error is not of constitutional dimension, we may affirm a conviction so long as we have \"fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Melvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702450\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/29/#p39\">\n    730 F.3d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39 (1st Cir. 2013) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sasso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528574\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/25/#p29\">\n    695 F.3d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 29 (1st Cir. 2012) ).

And although the emails also can be read as supporting the defense's theory-that the defendant was willing to cut S.S. off regardless of whether she kept quiet about the abuse-the fact is that he kept paying. Given this bubbling caldron of conflicting inferences, we think it apparent that the net impact of the evidence was likely a wash, and, therefore, its exclusion was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

To buttress this assertion, he points to cases such as\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Randazzo\n   </em>\n   , in which we recognized that \"false statement claims\" may be joined with tax-evasion charges \"where the tax fraud involves failure to report specific income obtained by the false statements.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7639269\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/623/#p627\">\n    80 F.3d 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627 (1st Cir. 1996) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Yefsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516287\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/885/#p895\">\n    994 F.2d 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 895 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding that \"tax fraud and mail fraud counts could be joined because some of the unreported income was the fruit of the mail fraud scheme\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The defendant, however, reads our case law through rose-colored glasses, and we reject his attempt to transmogrify a sufficient condition for the joinder of tax and non-tax charges into a necessary condition. Here, the alleged tax-evasion and drug-distribution offences took place in roughly the same time frame, and the government reasonably could have anticipated when it secured the indictment that the disposition of all of the charges would hinge on common factual issues (including S.S.'s health, prescription history, record of treatment, and relationship with her father). This temporal and factual commonality weighs heavily in favor of allowing joinder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412454\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/54/967/#p973\">\n    54 F.3d at 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To cinch the matter, the government had a solid basis for anticipating that it would be able to prove that all of the charged counts (tax evasion, drug distribution, and health-care fraud) emanated from a single plan to conceal the defendant's past sexual abuse and keep his daughter engaged in salacious communications while minimizing the net cost of providing the drugs and hush money. Given this panoply of facts, we hold that all of the counts were lawfully joined under Rule 8(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The defendant's plea for severance under Rule 14 fares no better. That plea is anchored in the notion that severance was necessary to prevent prejudicial spillover from S.S.'s allegations of sexual abuse. The theoretical premise on which this notion rests is sound: severance may be appropriate when \"proof that defendant is guilty of one offense may be used to convict him of a second offense, even though such proof would be inadmissible in a second trial for the second offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645534\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/74/#p81\">\n    515 F.3d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854645\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/14/#p16\">\n    112 F.3d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16 (1st Cir. 1997) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Here, however, the conclusion that the defendant seeks to draw from this premise does not follow. The court below found that S.S.'s allegations of sexual abuse were relevant to all of the charges laid in the indictment, and that finding cannot plausibly be termed an abuse of discretion. Consequently, the defendant's allegation of prejudicial spillover is without substance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854645\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/14/#p16\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   To say more about either joinder or severance would be supererogatory. For the reasons articulated above, we conclude that the defendant has neither rebutted the strong presumption in favor of joinder nor mounted a compelling showing of undue prejudice. It follows inexorably, as night follows day, that the district court's refusal to sever the tax-evasion charges is impervious to the defendant's onslaught.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Jury Instructions\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The defendant next challenges the district court's jury instructions on the drug-distribution counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This claim of error\n   was preserved below, and we follow a two-part framework in reviewing preserved claims of instructional error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sasso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528574\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/25/#p29\">\n    695 F.3d at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We agree, of course, that a physician's departure from the standard of care, without more, is not enough to sustain a conviction under Section 841(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wexler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762298\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/194/#p204\">\n    522 F.3d 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204 (2d Cir. 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Feingold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559994\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/1001/#p1007\">\n    454 F.3d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1007 (9th Cir. 2006).

The court made pellucid that, although facts such as a physician's failure to meet the standard of care or to adhere to ethical standards were relevant data points, medical negligence alone was insufficient to ground a conviction. Rather, the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had written a \"prescription for other than a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice.\" It is axiomatic that instructing a jury that the government must meet its burden of proof \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" clarifies that a criminal, rather than a civil, standard applies.\n   <em>\n    McIver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5664249\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/550/#p559\">\n    470 F.3d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The coup-de-gr\u00e2ce is that the district court lucidly explained the government's burden for proving criminal intent. It stressed that the government had to prove, at a minimum, that the defendant \"was aware to a high probability the prescription was not given for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice\" and that the defendant \"consciously and deliberately avoided learning that fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Global-Tech Appliances, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    SEB S.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5960868,12459541\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/754/\">\n    563 U.S. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 766,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5960868,12459541\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/754/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5960868,12459541\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/754/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (explaining doctrine of willful blindness).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Nor was this all. To safeguard the defendant's rights, the court emphasized that \"a sincere effort to act in accordance with proper medical practice,\" even if flawed, could not undergird a guilty verdict so long as the defendant had acted in \"good faith.\" This latter instruction was important. Because good faith is a defense to criminal charges under Section 841(a) but not to civil liability for medical malpractice, \"inclusion of a good faith instruction is ... a plainspoken method of explaining to the jury a critical difference between the two standards.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673342\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/639/#p650\">\n    573 F.3d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 650 (8th Cir. 2009) (quoting\n   <em>\n    McIver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5664249\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/550/#p559\">\n    470 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   560 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The defendant has one last shot in his sling. He notes that he proposed alternative language, spurned by the district court, which would have better illustrated the distinction between criminal distribution of drugs and medical malpractice. This observation goes nowhere. Although a trial court is required to convey the proper legal standards in its jury instructions, its word choices as among acceptable formulations are largely discretionary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeStefano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179226\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/1/#p2\">\n    59 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sampson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3113708\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/13/#p38\">\n    486 F.3d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding that court was not obliged to \"parrot [defendant's] preferred wording in its jury instructions\"). On appeal, the issue is not whether the district court's choice of phrase was ideal but, rather, whether \"taking the charge as a whole, the instructions adequately illuminate[d] the law applicable to the controlling issues in the case without\n   unduly complicating matters or misleading the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    DeStefano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179226\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/1/#p2\">\n    59 F.3d at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).

The luminously clear language adopted by the district court belies the defendant's suggestion that the district court failed to convey the proper mens rea requirement to the jury.

In Counts 6 through 57, the Government alleges that on 51 separate occasions, Dr. Sabean provided prescriptions for controlled substances for other than legitimate medical purposes outside the usual course of professional practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For you to find the defendant guilty of any of these charges, you must be satisfied that the Government has proven each of the following things beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   First, that on or about the date alleged in the count, the charge, the defendant distributed a controlled substance by providing a prescription for that controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Second, that the prescription was not given for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Third, that he did it knowingly and intentionally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   For purposes of these instructions, I instruct you that Ambien, Alprazolam and Lunesta are all controlled substances under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   To \"distribute\" means to deliver a controlled substance to another person with or without any financial interest in the transaction. The Government does not have to prove that the defendant distributed the controlled substance directly. Rather, a properly licensed medical practitioner who gives somebody a prescription for a controlled substance has distributed a controlled substance in violation of federal law if he issues the prescription for other than a legitimate medical purpose outside the usual course of professional practice. The prescription is enough if it meets the rest of the criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   A controlled substance is prescribed by a physician for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice if the substance is prescribed by him in good faith as part of his medical treatment of a patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Good faith in this context means the honest exercise of professional judgment as to the patient's needs. It also means the defendant made a sincere effort to act in accordance with proper medical practice given the accepted standards in the United States at the time the doctor acted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In determining whether or not Dr. Sabean acted in good faith, you may consider all of the evidence in this case which relates\n   to that conduct. This includes evidence regarding ethical standards and the standard of care. However, I caution you that this is not a civil case involving medical negligence for which a person may recover monetary damages. Here we're talking about whether the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the physician-that violated his obligation under federal law to prescribe a controlled substance for a legitimate medical purpose in the course of professional practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Now, as used in this instruction, the word \"knowingly\" means the act was done knowingly and intentionally and not by mistake or accident. In deciding whether the defendant acted knowingly, you may infer that the defendant had knowledge of a fact if you find that he deliberately closed his eyes to a fact that otherwise would have been obvious to him. You remember I gave you this earlier on a different charge. Same thing applies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In order to infer knowledge, you must find that two things have been established. First, the defendant was aware to a high probability the prescription was not given for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice; second, that the defendant consciously and deliberately avoided learning that fact; that is to say, he will fully made himself blind to that fact. It's entirely up to you to decide whether he deliberately closed his eyes to this fact and, if so, what inference, if any, should be drawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   However, it's important to bear in mind, again, that mere negligence, recklessness or mistake in failing to learn a fact is not enough. There must be a deliberate effort to remain ignorant of the fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In this case, again, evidence has been presented that the defendant suffered from an abnormal mental condition. It's for you to decide whether the defendant, in fact, had this abnormal mental condition. If you find that he suffered from such a mental condition, you may consider whether the condition is inconsistent with acting knowingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   If, after considering all of the evidence related to defendant's abnormal mental condition, together with all the other evidence, you have a reasonable doubt that he acted knowingly you should find the defendant not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   I remind you, again, that it is the Government's burden to prove all of the elements of each charge beyond a reasonable doubt. If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant knowingly issued a particular prescription for other than a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice, you must find the defend ant not guilty on that particular count.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Some of the drug-distribution counts related to prescriptions written in S.S.'s name, while others related to prescriptions written in Karen's name but intended for S.S.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    For instance, S.S. admitted to having \"had a problem with lying [her] whole life\"; she had a prior conviction for shoplifting; and she served a six-month sentence for dissembling to her probation officer. In addition, S.S.'s friend, Dezerra Tsai, testified that she once heard S.S. admit to having fabricated the sex-abuse allegations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Relatedly, we note that in his brief, the defendant refers to a letter that S.S. purportedly authored several weeks after trial, in which she is alleged to have apologized for her testimony. Because this letter was not introduced at trial, it does not warrant consideration in connection with any of the issues developed in the defendant's appellate briefing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Carrasco-De-Jes\u00fas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3499658\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/22/#p27\">\n     589 F.3d 22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 27-28 (1st Cir. 2009).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The district court simultaneously rejected the defendant's proffer of a transcript of the audiotape.

The law requires physicians wishing to prescribe medications that are deemed controlled substances to register with the Attorney General.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20822\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7 822\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2) ;\n    <em>\n     Hoxie\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Drug Enf't Admin.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8932947\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/419/477/#p481\">\n     419 F.3d 477\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 481 (6th Cir. 2005). It is undisputed that the defendant was so registered.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Among other things, Dr. Hatfield testified that, in accordance with standard medical practice, only a physician treating a patient locally should prescribe addictive drugs on a routine basis. He also vouchsafed that physicians should not treat family members in non-emergency situations. Finally, he offered his opinion that a dermatologist lacks the necessary qualifications to write prescriptions for anti-anxiety and anti-depressant drugs on a long-term basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    To be sure, the defendant attempts to debunk the probative value of Dr. Hatfield's testimony because that testimony was not based on a review of S.S.'s patient files and, therefore, the witness was in no position to second-guess the defendant's medical judgment. This is magical thinking : where, as here, there is no evidence that the physician-defendant kept any records relating to the patient, that vacuum \"cast[s] serious doubt on whether any legitimate doctor-patient relationships existed.\"\n    <em>\n     Elder\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892095\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/1065/#p1070\">\n     682 F.3d at 1071\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The defendant's thesis, if accepted, would have the perverse consequence of rewarding unscrupulous physicians who avoid leaving a paper trail.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    In his appellate briefs, the defendant adverts to a smattering of other issues. Without exception, those issues are insufficiently developed, patently meritless, or both. None of them warrants any extended discussion here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
