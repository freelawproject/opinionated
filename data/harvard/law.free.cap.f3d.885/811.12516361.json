The transnational aspect of the facts presents a \"new context\" under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , and numerous \"special factors\" counsel against federal courts' interference with the Executive and Legislative branches of the federal government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because the plaintiffs' claims were dismissed on the pleadings, the alleged facts underlying this tragic event are taken as true.

Sergio Hernandez was a 15-year-old Mexican citizen without family in, or other ties to, the United States. On June 7, 2010, while at play, he had taken a position on the Mexican side of a culvert that marks the boundary between Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and El Paso, Texas. The FBI reported that Agent Mesa was engaged in his law enforcement duties when a group of young men began throwing rocks at him from the Mexican side of the border. From United States soil, the agent fired several shots toward the assailants. Hernandez was fatally wounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hernandez's parents alleged numerous claims in a federal lawsuit against Agent Mesa, other Border Patrol officials, several federal agencies, and the United States government. The federal district court dismissed all claims, but was reversed in part by a divided panel of this court.\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

In\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , the Court reversed the Second Circuit and refused to imply a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim against policymaking officials involved in terror\n   suspect detentions following the 9/11 attacks. The Court, however, remanded for reconsideration by the appeals court whether a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim might still be maintained against a prison warden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court's decision in this case tagged onto\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   by rejecting this court's approach and ordering a remand for us to consider the propriety of allowing\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims to proceed on behalf of the Hernandez family in light of\n   <em>\n    Abbasi's\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiffs assert that Agent Mesa used deadly force without justification against Sergio Hernandez, violating the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, where the fatal shot was fired across the international border. No federal statute authorizes a damages action by a foreign citizen injured on foreign soil by a federal law enforcement officer under these circumstances. Thus, plaintiffs' recovery of damages is possible only if the federal courts approve a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   implied cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   instructs us to determine initially whether these circumstances present a \"new context\" for\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   purposes, and if so, whether \"special factors\" counsel against implying a damages claim against an individual federal officer. To make these determinations, we review\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   's pertinent discussion about \"\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   and the ensuing cases in [the Supreme Court] defining the reach and the limits of that precedent.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , the Court begins by explaining that when Congress passed what is now\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in 1871, it enacted no comparable law authorizing damage suits in federal court to remedy constitutional violations by federal government agents. In 1971, the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   decision broke new ground by authorizing such a suit for Fourth Amendment violations by federal law enforcement officers who handcuffed and arrested an individual in his own home without probable cause. Within a decade, the Court followed up by allowing a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action for employment discrimination, violating equal protection under the Fifth Amendment, against a Congressman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court soon after approved a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim for constitutionally inadequate inmate medical care, violating the Eighth Amendment, against federal jailers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Court in\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , these three cases coincided with the \"\n   <em>\n    ancien regime\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which \"the Court followed a different approach to recognizing implied causes of action than it follows now.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The \"\n   <em>\n    ancien regime\n   </em>\n   \" was toppled step by step as the Court, starting in the late 1970s, retreated from judicially implied causes of action\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and cautioned that where Congress \"intends private litigants to have a cause of action,\" the \"far better course\" is for Congress to confer that remedy explicitly.\n   <em>\n    Cannon v.

Of course, the defining characteristic of this case is that it is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   domestic.

The Supreme Court has held that \"even in the absence of an alternative\" remedy, courts should not extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   if any special factors counsel hesitation.\n   <em>\n    Wilkie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573210\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/537/#p550\">\n    551 U.S. at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573210\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/537/#p550\">\n    127 S.Ct. at 2598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of a remedy is only significant because the\n   <em>\n    presence\n   </em>\n   of one precludes a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   extension. Here, the absence of a federal remedy does not mean the absence of deterrence.\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   acknowledges the \"persisting concern [ ] that absent a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy there will be insufficient deterrence to prevent officers from violating the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For cross-border shootings like this one, however, criminal investigations and prosecutions are already a deterrent. While it is true that numerous federal agencies investigated Agent Mesa's conduct and decided not to bring charges, the DOJ is currently prosecuting another Border Patrol agent in Arizona for the cross-border murder of a Mexican citizen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In some instances, moreover, a state-law tort claim may be available to provide both deterrence and damages. That claim is unavailable here because the DOJ certified that Agent Mesa acted within the scope of his employment, and so the Westfall Act protects him from liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), (d). The plaintiffs concede that Agent Mesa was acting within the scope of his employment. Regardless,\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   makes clear that, when there is \"a balance to be struck\" between countervailing policy considerations like deterrence and national security, \"[t]he proper balance is one for the Congress, not the Judiciary, to undertake.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the extraterritorial aspect of this case is itself a special factor that underlies and aggravates the separation-of-powers issues already discussed.

In other words, if the Clause did not immunize the defendant's conduct, then it was not a special factor. Similarly, the plaintiffs here suggest that extraterritoriality is not a \"special factor\" if the Constitution applies extraterritorially. This argument conflates the applicability of a constitutional immunity with the scope of a constitutional right, and thereby\n   turns the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   inquiry upside down.\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedies are not \"coextensive\" with the Constitution's protections.

PRADO, Circuit Judge, joined by GRAVES, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Today's en banc majority denies Sergio Hernandez's parents a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy for the loss of their son at the hands of a United States Border Patrol agent. The majority asserts that the transnational nature of this case presents a new context under\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    and that special factors counsel against this Court's interference. While I agree that this case presents a new context, I would find that no special factors counsel hesitation in recognizing a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy because this case centers on an individual federal officer acting in his law enforcement capacity. I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    I do not take issue with the majority's framework for analyzing whether there are special factors counseling hesitation. \"[S]eparation-of-powers principles are or should be central to the analysis.\"\n    <em>\n     Ziglar v.

And the majority's analysis purports to consider these principles by appropriately asking\n    \"whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/\">\n     at 1857-58\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, in conducting this analysis, the majority is quickly led astray from the familiar circumstances of this case by empty labels of national security, foreign affairs, and extraterritoriality. These labels-as we say in Texas-are all hat, no cattle.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The majority repeatedly attempts to frame this case around the issue of whether aliens injured abroad can pursue\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedies. That characterization, however, overlooks the critical who, what, where, when, and how of the lead actor in this tragic narrative. This case involves one federal officer \"engaged in his law enforcement duties\" in the United States who shot and killed an unarmed, fifteen-year-old Mexican boy standing a few feet away. The Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    went to great lengths to indicate support for the availability of a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy in exactly the circumstances presented here: an instance of individual law enforcement overreach. As the Court recently reaffirmed in no uncertain terms,\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    is \"settled law ... in [the] common and recurrent sphere of law enforcement.\"\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    , 137 S.Ct. at 1857. For the following reasons, I would retain\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    in that common sphere and recognize a remedy for this senseless and arbitrary cross-border shooting at the hands of a federal law enforcement officer.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The Supreme Court directed this Court \"to consider how the reasoning and analysis in\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    may bear on this case,\" so that is where I begin.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hernandez v.

In\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    , aliens detained for immigration violations following the September 11 attacks brought a class action suit against high-level federal executive officials and detention facility wardens. 137 S.Ct. at 1852-54. The detainees alleged that they had been detained in harsh conditions, including that they were confined in tiny cells for over 23 hours a day, subjected to regular strip searches, denied basic hygiene products and most forms of communication, and subjected to regular verbal and physical abuse by guards.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1853. Detainee-plaintiffs brought their\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    claims alleging that the detention and policies authorizing it violated their Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1853-54. After finding the case presented a new\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    context because it challenged \"confinement conditions imposed on illegal aliens pursuant to a high-level executive policy created in the wake of a major terrorist attack\"-a far cry from the three\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    cases the Court had approved in the past-the Court determined that several special factors counseled hesitation that precluded a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy against the executive officials.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 1860-63.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Supreme Court's analysis of four special factors in\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    is particularly relevant given the vastly different circumstances presented in this case. First, the\n    Court took issue with the fact that the detainees sought to hold high-level federal executive officials liable for the unconstitutional activity of their subordinates.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    , 137 S.Ct. at 1860. The Court warned that \"\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    is not designed to hold officers responsible for the acts of their subordinates.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (citing\n    <em>\n     Ashcroft v.

Relatedly, the\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    Court found it problematic that that the detainees challenged a broad governmental policy, specifically the government's response to the September 11 attacks.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1860-61.

Third, the Court disapproved of the fact that the detainees' claims challenged \"more than standard 'law enforcement operations.' \"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1861 (quoting\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Specifically, the Court found the detainees' claims involved \"major elements of the Government's whole response to the September 11 attacks, thus ... requiring an inquiry into sensitive issues of national security.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5121\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/259/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Finally, the Court found it of \"central importance\" that\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    was not a \"damages or nothing\" case.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1862. In contrast to suits challenging \"individual instances of discrimination or law enforcement overreach,\" the\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs challenged \"large-scale policy decisions concerning the conditions of confinement imposed on hundreds of prisoners\" which could be remedied with injunctive and habeas relief.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1862-63.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Not only are all four of these special factors notably absent here, but this case also presents the limited circumstances in which\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    indicated a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy would exist. First, Hernandez's parents do not seek to hold any high-level officials liable for the acts of their subordinates. Instead, and strictly comporting with\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    , plaintiffs are suing an individual federal agent for his own actions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    , 137 S.Ct. at 1860 (\"[A]\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    claim is brought against the individual official for his or her own acts.\"). Relatedly, in suing an individual officer, Hernandez's parents do not challenge or seek to alter any governmental policy. To the contrary, the constitutional constraints Hernandez's parents seek mirror existing Executive Branch policy for Border Patrol agents. Department of Homeland Security regulations and guidelines already require Border Patrol agents to adhere to constitutional standards for the use of lethal force, regardless of the subject's location or nationality.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Furthermore, as a case against a single federal officer, this suit would not require unnecessary inquiry or discovery\n    into governmental deliberations or policy-making-certainly not any more than any other regularly permissible\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    suit alleging unconstitutional use of force by a Border Patrol agent.\n    <em>\n     See,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Martinez-Aguero v.

Does\n    </em>\n    , No. 92-7772,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993%20WL%20560259\">\n     1993 WL 560259\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1-2 (5th Cir. Dec. 27, 1993). Third, this case has nothing to do with terrorism, nor does it involve a high-level governmental response to a major national security event. Rather, plaintiffs merely challenge \"standard 'law enforcement operations.' \"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    , 137 S.Ct. at 1861. While the majority attempts to link this case to border security, which I address separately below, there is no question that a case which involves only one Border Patrol agent and a fifteen-year-old boy is a far cry from\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    , which involved broad and sensitive national security policies following the deadliest terrorist attack in U.S. history. Finally, unlike the detainees in\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    , who had several alternative remedies including habeas relief, this is a \"damages or nothing\" case for Hernandez's parents.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 1862. It is uncontested that plaintiffs find no alternative relief in Mexican law, state law, the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), the Alien Tort Statute (\"ATS\"), or federal criminal law\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    for their tragic loss. Nor can injunctive or habeas relief redress the irreparable loss of life here. Indeed, individual instances of law enforcement overreach-as alleged here-are by \"their very nature ... difficult to address except by way of damages actions after the fact.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Given that a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    cause of action is plaintiffs' only available remedy, compensatory relief by way of\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    is both necessary\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    appropriate in this case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n     403 U.S. at 407\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n     91 S.Ct. 1999\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Harlan, J., concurring) (\"The question then, is, as I see it, whether compensatory relief is 'necessary' or 'appropriate' to the vindication of the interest asserted.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The special factors identified by the majority do not convince me that the Judiciary is not \"well suited ... to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed\"-particularly given the relatively straight-forward events here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    , 137 S.Ct. at 1858. I disagree that recognizing a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy in this case \"threatens the political branches' supervision of national security.\" According to the majority, national security is implicated because the events giving rise to this suit took place at the border, thereby affecting border security and the operations of the Border Patrol. Relying on the Third Circuit's rejection of\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    liability in the airport security context for a First Amendment retaliation claim, the majority also reasons that implying a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy in the transnational context \"increases the likelihood that Border patrol agents will 'hesitate in making split second decisions.' \"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Vanderklok v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264018\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/189/#p207\">\n     868 F.3d 189\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (3d Cir. 2017).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    While the shooting in this case took place at the border, it does not follow that border security and the operations of the Border Patrol are significantly implicated. As the original panel majority noted, this case \"involves questions of precisely\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    -like domestic law enforcement and nothing more.\"\n    <em>\n     Hernandez v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124498\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/249/#p255\">\n     757 F.3d 249\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 276 (5th Cir. 2014). Plaintiffs allege that an individual Border Patrol agent while on duty on U.S. soil shot and killed an unarmed fifteen-year-old boy. If recognizing a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy in this context implicates border security or the Border Patrol's operations, so too would any suit against a Border Patrol agent for unconstitutional actions taken in the course and scope of his or her employment.

In light of Agent Mesa's status as a federal law enforcement officer, the practical concerns raised in\n    <em>\n     Vanderlock\n    </em>\n    pertaining to non-officer TSA employees in the First Amendment retaliation context have little bearing here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Indeed,\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    itself cautions against taking the very path the majority errantly takes in this case. \"[N]ational-security concerns must not become a talisman used to ward off inconvenient claims-a 'label' used to 'cover a multitude of sins.' \"\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    , 137 S.Ct. at 1862 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Mitchell v.

As one prominent legal scholar has warned, \"national security\" justifications are \"increasingly becom[ing] the rule in contemporary civil litigation against government officers\" and threaten to \"dilute the effectiveness of judicial review as a deterrent for any and all unlawful government action-not just those actions undertaken in ostensibly in defense of the nation.\" Steven I.

When one looks to substantiate the invocation of national security here, one is left with the impression that this case more closely resembles ordinary civil litigation against a federal agent than a case involving a true inquiry into sensitive national security and military affairs, which are properly committed to the Executive Branch.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    , 137 S.Ct. at 1861.

Asserting that the United States is always responsible to foreign sovereigns when federal officials injure foreign citizens on foreign soil, the majority argues that extending a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy here implicates \"delicate diplomatic matters.\" However, isn't the United States equally answerable to foreign sovereigns when federal officials injure foreign citizens on domestic soil? Again, the majority's argument proves too much. As plaintiffs persuasively argue, if there is a \"U.S. foreign policy interest [implicated] in granting or denying a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    claim to foreign nationals, it is difficult to see how that interest would apply only if the injury occurred abroad.\" It also bears repeating that Agent Mesa's actions took place within the United States.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    I also fail to see how recognizing a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy here would undermine Mexico's respect for the Executive Branch or create tension between Executive and Judicial determinations. No case holds that a court must first consider whether the Executive Branch has found evidence of criminality before determining whether a civil\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy exists for a given constitutional violation. Further, the majority fails to acknowledge that distinct standards of proof govern civil and criminal proceedings making different outcomes in these proceedings hardly the stuff of an international diplomatic crisis.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Addington v. Texas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780484\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/418/#p423\">\n     441 U.S. 418\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 423-24,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780484\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/418/#p423\">\n     99 S.Ct. 1804\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780484\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/418/#p423\">\n     60 L.Ed.2d 323\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1979) (distinguishing between civil and criminal standards of proof). Even if one accepts that a Judicial finding of\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    liability combined with an Executive Branch refusal to prosecute or extradite would undermine a foreign country's respect for the Executive Branch, it is difficult to explain how such concerns are only present when a foreign national is injured abroad, but not when a foreign national is injured in the United States. It is unclear how recognizing a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy for the unconstitutional conduct of a single federal law enforcement officer acting entirely within the United States would suddenly inject this Court into sensitive matters of international diplomacy. Much as with national security, \"the Executive's mere incantation of ... 'foreign affairs' interests do not suffice to override constitutional rights.\"\n    <em>\n     Def. Distrib. v.

However, it is just as likely that by specifying \"other persons within the jurisdiction\" Congress intended to extend a \u00a7 1983 remedy beyond U.S. citizenship, rather than commenting on its availability for wrongful conduct by state actors with extraterritorial effects. Indeed, Congress enacted \u00a7 1983\"in response to the widespread deprivations of civil rights in the Southern States and the inability or unwillingness of authorities in those States to protect those rights or punish wrongdoers.\"\n    <em>\n     Felder v.

Looking to the fact that Hernandez was standing on Mexican soil when he was shot, the majority fears the uncertain scope of\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    liability-extending even to U.S.-based military drone operators-were we to recognize a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy here. The majority's concern about the effects of such a decision is understandable and I do not take it lightly. However, the limited and routine circumstances presented here of individual law enforcement action as well as established Supreme Court precedent on\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    claims in the military context assure me that there is little danger that recognizing a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy here will open a Pandora's Box of liability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    First, as I emphasize above, this case is not\n    <em>\n     sui generis\n    </em>\n    among\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    cases. In the \"common and recurrent sphere of law enforcement,\" courts across the country routinely administer\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    claims against federal officers for unconstitutional actions occurring within the United States.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    , 137 S.Ct. at 1857. I readily acknowledge Hernandez was standing on the Mexican side of the culvert when he was shot, but it cannot be forgotten that Agent Mesa was acting from the American side of the culvert. It is hard to understand how the mere fact that a plaintiff happens to be standing a few feet beyond an unmarked and invisible line on the ground would suddenly create a host of administrability concerns or a systemwide impact on governmental operations that would not otherwise exist if the plaintiff was standing a few feet within the United States. As ordinary\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    litigation against a federal law enforcement officer seeking damages for unconstitutional use of force, \"the legal standards for adjudicating the claim\n    pressed here are well-established and easily administrable.\"\n    <em>\n     Engel v. Buchan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552190\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/698/#p708\">\n     710 F.3d 698\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 708 (7th Cir. 2013) (noting that extending a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy for alleged\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    violations under the Due Process Clause presented \"no great problem of judicial interference with the work of law enforcement, certainly no greater than the Fourth Amendment claim in\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    \").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    But even the majority's concerns about liability for overseas drone operations are also unlikely to materialize. Even assuming foreign nationals injured at the hands of U.S. military personnel overseas could state valid constitutional claims-a hotly debated topic-the Supreme Court has already repeatedly rejected\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    claims in the military context.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chappell v.

Furthermore, it is likely that such claims would actually implicate various special factors counseling hesitation specifically identified in\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    such as requiring a true inquiry into national security issues, intruding upon the authority of the Executive Branch in military affairs, and actually causing officials \"to second-guess difficult but necessary decisions concerning national-security policy.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbasi\n    </em>\n    , 137 S.Ct. at 1861.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    In sum, this Court is more than qualified to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed. This case simply involves a federal official engaged in his law enforcement duties acting on United States soil who shot and killed an unarmed fifteen-year-old boy standing a few feet away. I would elect to recognize a damages remedy for this tragic injury. As Chief Justice John Marshall wrote, \"[t]he very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.\"\n    <em>\n     Marbury v.
