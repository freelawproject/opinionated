He now appeals his conviction and sentence on several grounds. First, he argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence of bank fraud conspiracy. Second, Savage argues that the district court erred in failing to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review to determine whether material required disclosure under the Jencks Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203500\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), or pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

Third, Savage argues that the district court erred by not providing his requested jury instruction on accomplice testimony, and by providing the jury with a written copy of the jury instruction on aiding and abetting liability. Finally, Savage challenges the district court's application of the sentencing guidelines on several grounds. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Between January and April 2012, Junaidu Savage, Jayad Conteh, and others devised a scheme to defraud Capital One Bank (\"Capital One\"). According to the trial testimony, Savage and a mutual friend, Mumtaz Sadique, recruited Conteh-a teller at a Capital One branch-to participate in the scheme. At Savage's direction, Conteh used her position as a teller to access customer account information on the bank's internal systems, including confidential personal identifiers necessary to make changes to an account, for accounts that contained at least $10,000. She would then send the account information to Savage or Sadique using her cell phone or by passing hard copies of the customer information. Many of these communications were with an iPhone with the number ending in 7412, which was registered to the mother of one of Savage's children. Conteh also answered questions about the accounts via text message. For each account Conteh provided information about, Savage and his co-conspirators then called Capital One, changed the contact phone number on the account, and tried to order checks to be delivered by overnight mail. These calls to Capital One were recorded and introduced into evidence. Conteh and Alimamy Jabbie, one of Savage's close friends, later identified Savage's voice on several of these phone calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A fraud investigator testified that Conteh accessed at least seven victims' accounts on multiple occasions without authorization. The evidence showed that the conspirators obtained checkbooks for at least one account, and wrote and cashed checks to empty the victim's account. The bank eventually detected the scheme, and was able to thwart the conspirators' efforts to compromise accounts by requiring customers to provide a password or physically come into the branch to conduct transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Conteh was arrested in April 2012 and was later convicted by a jury, sentenced to an aggregate term of 64 months of imprisonment, and ordered to pay $36,000 in restitution. Following her conviction, Conteh entered into a proffer agreement with the government to provide information about the conspiracy on the condition that the information she provided would not be used directly against her. The government met with Conteh four times as part of this agreement. During this period, Savage spoke to Conteh, sent her money for a new lawyer, and sent her text messages, including a message saying, \"It was never my intention, I'm sorry\" the day she reported to prison. J.A. 606. In summer 2014, Savage visited Conteh's family and discussed his involvement in the fraud; unbeknownst\n   to Savage, this conversation was videotaped. In this recording, Savage stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   I was somehow involved and I will not try to exclude myself but it was not intended for [Conteh] to end up in this situation.... [E]ven though this was a small thing that we did, it has turned out to be something big that we never imagined.... Today I am here but I could have found myself in the same situation where she is too. Because I was part of it, you understand? ... We made a big mistake and we can only look up to God to see how certain thing [sic] will turn out.... I am willing to help as much as I can. The restitution is $36,000.00 and I will not hesitate to pay for it. I don't think I made over $8,000.00 on it but I am not looking at that because I was part of it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   J.A. 139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 25, 2015, a federal grand jury for the District of Maryland indicted Savage for bank fraud conspiracy, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201349\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count One), and aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A (Counts Two and Three). In March 2016, Conteh and the government changed their proffer agreement to a cooperation agreement in which the government agreed to move for a reduction of her sentence if she adhered to their agreement and provided substantial assistance in their case against Savage in light of the factors set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, including potentially testifying against him. In anticipation of Conteh's testimony, the government provided Savage with required disclosures containing potential impeachment evidence that summarized inconsistent statements Conteh made during their meetings with her. The inconsistencies concerned matters such as the minimum balance Conteh should look for when targeting an account and whether Conteh received any money from the scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the first day of trial, Savage filed a motion to compel any materials related to interviews of Conteh or other witnesses which may contain required disclosures under either the Jencks Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203500\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), or\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963). The court dismissed the motion as moot after finding that only the government attorney's personal notes existed, and determining that they did not contain any required disclosures. At trial, Conteh testified to several details of the scheme. For example, she described how Savage and Sadique approached her about the plan, how Savage directed her to access bank accounts, and how she communicated the confidential customer account information to Savage. The prosecution and defense both questioned Conteh about her previous inconsistent statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Savage moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's case and at the close of evidence; the district court denied both motions. Savage also requested a specific jury instruction on accomplice testimony, which the district court declined to provide. The jury then requested and was provided a written copy of the jury instruction on aiding and abetting liability, which was charged in connection with the aggravated identity theft counts. The jury subsequently convicted Savage on all counts. Savage then moved for a new trial, which the district court also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced Savage to a within-Guidelines sentence of a total of 87 months of imprisonment-51 months as to Count One for bank fraud conspiracy, and a mandatory consecutive 24 months each for Counts Two and Three for aggravated identity theft, of which 12 months were to run concurrently. Savage was also sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered\n   to pay restitution of $36,400, $300 in special assessments, and forfeiture of substitute property. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We first address Savage's contention that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence of bank fraud conspiracy. We review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gillion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655352\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/284/#p294\">\n    704 F.3d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294 (4th Cir. 2012). \"We will uphold the verdict if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, it is supported by substantial evidence,\" which is \"evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655352\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/284/#p294\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655352\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/284/#p294\">\n    at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks &amp; citations omitted). \"A defendant who brings a sufficiency challenge bears a heavy burden, as appellate reversal on grounds of insufficient evidence is confined to cases where the prosecution's failure is clear.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Clarke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125586\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/288/#p297\">\n    842 F.3d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297 (4th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks, citations &amp; alterations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Savage asserts that there is insufficient evidence that he took any participatory action in the bank fraud conspiracy such that a rational factfinder could conclude that he was a knowing and willing participant in the scheme. We disagree. When considering the evidence in the totality, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to convict Savage of the charges against him. \"[T]he law in this Circuit is well settled that uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice may be sufficient to sustain a conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Manbeck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"598879\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/744/360/#p392\">\n    744 F.2d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (4th Cir. 1984). \"[O]n appeal, we are not entitled to assess witness credibility, and we assume that the jury resolved any conflicting evidence in the prosecution's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3840467\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/339/#p343\">\n    659 F.3d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 343 (4th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Conteh, a co-conspirator, testified as to Savage's involvement in the conspiracy and the steps he took to plan and carry out the scheme. Conteh also provided direct testimony that the phone number used in connection with the scheme-the number ending in 7412-belonged to \"Jay,\" which was what she called Savage. J.A. 518. Additionally, she testified it was Savage's voice on the recorded Capital One phone calls. This testimony was further supported by the testimony of Alimamy Jabbie, one of Savage's close friends, who testified that the voice on the Capital One recordings sounded like Savage's, although he was \"not too sure for a hundred percent....\" J.A. 822-23. The jury heard Conteh's testimony, along with any alleged inconsistencies, and decided that her testimony was credible. Thus, Conteh's testimony alone is sufficient to support his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The government, however, also introduced videotape evidence of Savage discussing his participation in the scheme with Conteh's family after she was arrested. In this recording, Savage made statements including, \"I could have found myself in the same situation where she is too. Because I was part of it, you understand?\"; \"[w]e made a big mistake\"; and \"I will not hesitate to pay for [Conteh's restitution]. I don't think I made over $8,000.00 on it but I am not looking at that because I was part of it.\" J.A. 139. Savage argues that this evidence is insufficient because his statements never explicitly reference the bank fraud conspiracy or his participation in it. However, in reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, \"[w]e 'consider circumstantial as well as direct evidence, and allow the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences\n   from the facts proven to those sought to be established,' and we assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the Government.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pettiford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=337%20Fed.%20Appx.%20352\">\n    337 Fed.Appx. 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355 (4th Cir. 2009) (first quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tresvant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"557307\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/677/1018/#p1021\">\n    677 F.2d 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1021 (4th Cir. 1982) ; and then citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This video evidence allowed the jury to make the reasonable inference that Savage was referring to the bank fraud scheme and his participation in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Consequently, we conclude that Savage's conviction was supported by substantial evidence and that the district court did not err in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We now turn to Savage's contention that the district court erred in failing to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review to determine whether the material gathered by the government in its meeting with Conteh, recorded in the prosecutor's personal notes, was subject to required disclosure under either the Jencks Act or\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   .

Savage specifically asserts that the district court was required to review the government attorney's personal notes from the prosecution's meetings with Conteh\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   to determine whether Conteh made any additional inconsistent statements that would qualify as required disclosures and could be used to further impeach her testimony. \"Whether, and to what extent, the material sought must be produced are questions of fact to be decided by the district court and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Savage asserts that he believes Conteh made additional inconsistent statements that could be used to further impeach her testimony, based on the inconsistent statements the government already disclosed. We conclude, however, that Savage did not meet his burden under either the Jencks Act or\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   to require the court to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When making his motion to compel production, Savage did not even attempt to argue that a Jencks Act statement existed or that the defense was entitled to view the prosecutor's personal notes, he \"just wanted for the record to request anything in writing that is contemporaneous evidence of that interview.\" J.A. 231;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   J.A. 232 (\"I don't have any authority for work product to request [the prosecutor's notes].\"). Savage did not question Conteh on cross-examination about whether she\n   reviewed these notes or adopted any statements contained within, and has not made any representations that Conteh adopted or approved any part of these notes. Similarly, Savage has not made any representation that the notes include a \"substantially verbatim recital\" of Conteh's statements. He also has not made assertions about what additional inconsistent statements exist-only that they might exist and any additional inconsistencies would be material as impeachment evidence. This is insufficient to provide the required foundation under the Jencks Act to require the court to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Savage has also failed to make a plausible showing that the files contain evidence that is material and favorable to the defense to require an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   . Savage argues that he can assume the government attorney's notes contain other inconsistencies in Conteh's testimony because of the inconsistencies already disclosed and because of the government's admissions that there were \"inconsistencies all the way through\" their meetings with Conteh, J.A. 229, and that \"other things were discussed\" in the meetings, Appellant's Br. 35. He also argues that additional impeachment evidence \"could have reasonably undermined the jury's view of [Conteh's] credibility and thus very likely the result of the trial.\" Appellant's Br. 35. This is pure speculation lacking any specificity, and is insufficient to support a finding of materiality under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   or to require an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. Additionally, these personal notes were used to create the summaries of Conteh's inconsistent statements that were disclosed to Savage. These summaries, along with the disclosure letters, were heavily relied on during Savage's cross-examination of Conteh. Thus, Savage has not made a plausible showing that not having the government attorney's actual notes prevented the defense from effectively cross-examining Conteh or otherwise materially impacting Savage's defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Consequently, we hold that Savage was not entitled to an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of these materials under either the Jencks Act or\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   . Because we conclude that the district court was not required to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the government attorney's notes, and because we give the court substantial latitude in deciding how to conduct the inquiry into whether disclosures are required, we also hold that the district court did not clearly err in failing to conduct a more thorough inquiry into whether disclosures were required under either the Jencks Act or\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, we turn to Savage's argument that the district court erred by not providing his requested jury instruction on accomplice testimony, and by providing the jury with a written copy of the jury instruction on aiding and abetting liability.

We conclude that the district court substantially covered Savage's requested instruction because it warned the jury to scrutinize all witness testimony, especially the testimony of biased or hostile witnesses, and specifically instructed the jury that it could take prior inconsistent statements into account when considering witness credibility.

The district court provided this requested written instruction to the jury, without any interlineations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Savage argues that providing only the aiding and abetting instruction prejudiced him by emphasizing this basis of conviction without taking measures to dilute any undue suggestiveness. This argument is unavailing.

The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"U.S.S.G.\") \u00a7 3C1.1 (U.S. Sentencing Comm'n 2016) provides for a 2-level enhancement when a defendant \"willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction....\" The enhancement applies when a defendant \"provid[es] materially false information to a judge or magistrate judge\" or \"to a probation officer in respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n.4(F), (H). Before applying a sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice, the court must find by a preponderance that the defendant: \"(1) gave false testimony; (2) concerning a material matter; (3) with the willful intent to deceive (rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory).\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We disagree. Savage's alleged perjurious statements were made during his interviews with pretrial services and were introduced in his pretrial detention hearing, which included a determination of whether Savage presented a risk of flight or nonappearance such that pretrial release should be denied. The district court found that Savage \"misrepresented and lied to Pretrial Services about his address, about where he lived, possessing and presenting state licensing documents that were false, and about his international travel.\" J.A. 2420. Specifically, the record indicates that Savage stated that he lives in Maryland without mentioning his Ohio address or residency (as indicated by his Ohio driver's license); did not mention that he possessed an Ohio driver's license that had the name Junaidu Savage and his picture and address on it when another driver's license with the name Junaidu Savage and an address on the same street had a picture of his friend, and that his friend's license was issued before the one in Savage's possession; and concealed his international travel to Sierra Leone where he has family and assets. At the sentencing hearing, the district court stated, \"I think that there was no confusion or mistake\" as to each lie, J.A. 2421, and also stated that these findings were \"the basis of why he is being held right now, because of the material misrepresentations,\" J.A. 2418. The district court also described how each lie contributed to the assessment of pretrial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Although broad, these statements satisfy the requirement for the district court to specifically identify the perjurious statements and make a finding that encompasses all factual elements of perjury.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Savage's possession and presentment of a false driver's license was perjurious, warranting an obstruction of justice sentencing enhancement. Savage has not presented any evidence to challenge the district court's findings that his driver's license was a false identity, and that he presented it with the willful intent to deceive. Additionally, there is no doubt that a defendant presenting false identification is material to whether the defendant is a flight risk and should be denied pretrial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Consequently, we hold that the district court did not err in applying the 2-level sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice.

U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1) provides that a sentencing court is obliged to calculate the offense level for a defendant convicted of a crime involving fraud or deceit on the basis of the amount of loss resulting from the scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elliott v.

Loss amount \"is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b) cmt. n.3(A). \"Intended loss\" is \"the pecuniary harm that the defendant purposely sought to inflict,\" including \"intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur....\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b) cmt. n.3(A)(ii);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court applied a 10-level sentencing enhancement based on its finding that the loss calculation exceeded $150,000 but was less than $250,000. This was the same loss calculation used to sentence co-conspirator Conteh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Savage argues that the district court erred in calculating the amount of intended loss in two ways: (1) in interpreting \"loss\" to include the balances in bank accounts for which the conspirators failed to get checkbooks; and (2) in using the account balances from the date on which Conteh first accessed each account's information, instead of using the date on which Savage \"possessed\" access to each account by obtaining a checkbook. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The district court did not err in including the balances in bank accounts for which the conspirators failed to get checkbooks in its calculation of intended loss because a lack of success in an attempted fraud scheme does not preclude a court from including the intended loss from the failed attempts in its calculation. This is especially true when, as here, the conspirators had already taken steps to steal from these specific victims, and their efforts were thwarted by a third party-here, when Capital One discovered the fraud and prevented the conspirators from obtaining checkbooks to these accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government presented evidence that Savage hid assets, hid transactions, hid his own name, had phones registered in multiple states (none in his name), directed actions of several other conspirators, used insider information provided by a co-conspirator bank employee, and used that information in coordinated steps to circumvent the bank's fraud countermeasures and take over the victims' accounts to conceal and execute\n   the scheme-far more than is required for a bank fraud conspiracy conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2A Kevin F.

As the district court stated, \"It was not the most complex fraud scheme, but certainly I believe that it was sophisticated enough that the Government has met its burden of proof....\" J.A. 2411. The evidence, taken together, compels us to conclude that the district court did not clearly err in applying the 2-level sentencing enhancement based on use of sophisticated means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Next, Savage asserts that the district court erroneously applied a 3-level sentencing enhancement based on his role in the offense as a manager or supervisor. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b) provides a 3-level enhancement \"[i]f a defendant was a manager or supervisor ... and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive....\" \"Factors the court should consider include the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n.4. This Court has explained that \"the enhancement is justified if the defendant managed or supervised the activities of at least one other person in a scheme that involved five or more participants.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bartley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1094438\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/230/667/#p673\">\n    230 F.3d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 673 (4th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Savage argues that there is no evidence in the record to support finding that he was a manager or supervisor; he does not challenge the district court's finding that five or more participants were involved. At a minimum, however, the trial evidence demonstrates that Savage helped recruit Conteh, directed her efforts in the scheme, and delivered proceeds from the fraud to her. This alone is sufficient to support finding that Savage managed or supervised the activities of at least one person. It is also uncontested that the scheme involved five or more participants; Savage and Sadique planned the scheme, Conteh accessed the customer accounts, and at least two other individuals redeemed fraudulent checks at Capital One locations. Therefore, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in applying a 3-level sentencing enhancement for Savage's role as a manager or supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, Savage asserts that the district court abused its discretion by requiring part of Savage's sentences to run consecutively. Savage was convicted on Counts Two and Three of aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A. Section 1028A carries a mandatory consecutive sentence of two years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(1), (b)(2). Section 1028A(b)(4) provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   a term of imprisonment imposed on a person for a violation of this section may, in the discretion of the court, run\n   concurrently, in whole or in part, only with another term of imprisonment that is imposed by the court at the same time on that person for an additional violation of this section....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In determining whether multiple counts of \u00a7 1028A should run concurrently with or consecutively to each other, the court should consider factors including the \"nature and seriousness of the underlying offenses,\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2 cmt. n.2(B)(i), and \"[w]hether the purposes of sentencing set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) are better achieved by imposing a concurrent or a consecutive sentence,\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2 cmt. n.2(B)(iii). The purposes of sentencing enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a)(2) include \"to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense\" and \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A), (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The district court determined that 12 months of the mandatory 24-month sentence for Savage's conviction on Count Three for aggravated identity theft should run consecutive to the mandatory 24-month sentence imposed on Count Two for aggravated identity theft, resulting in a combined 36-month sentence on these two counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Savage argues that the district court necessarily erred in determining that part of the sentence should run consecutively because it erred in applying the sentencing enhancements discussed above. Because we now uphold each of the challenged sentencing enhancements, however, Savage's argument collapses. Additionally, even if we had concluded that the district court erred in applying any of these challenged sentencing enhancements, there is no indication that the district court abused its discretion because it specifically identified its reasons for providing a partial-consecutive sentence, and many of these reasons were unrelated to the sentencing enhancements. For example, in considering the \u00a7 3553(a)(2) factors, the district court noted that the government had not sought the maximum sentence, that \"[t]he nature and circumstances of the offense are serious,\" that Savage \"was a leader, an organizer of a significant and fraudulent criminal group,\" that the crime compromised the victims' credit and confidence in our banking system and security, and that Savage and defendants like him need to be deterred from engaging in this kind of fraudulent conduct. JA. 2441-44. Therefore, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by requiring that part of the sentences for Counts Two and Three run consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Savage relies heavily on this Court's opinion in\n    <em>\n     Adepoju\n    </em>\n    to argue that the Court found clear error in applying a use of sophisticated means enhancement for more sophisticated means than the facts in this case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Adepoju\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897664\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/250/#p257\">\n     756 F.3d 250\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In his videotaped conversation with Conteh's mother, Savage also admitted to either storing money in Africa or having the means to disguise the source of his money.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
