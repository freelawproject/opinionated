For years, consumers have complained to the Federal Communications Commission about automated telemarketing calls and text messages that they did not seek and cannot seem to stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Congress sought to address consumers' concerns with undesired robocalls in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. The TCPA generally prohibits the use of certain kinds of automated dialing equipment to call wireless telephone numbers absent advance consent. The Act vests the Commission with authority to implement those restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this case, a number of regulated entities seek review of a 2015 order in which the Commission sought to clarify various aspects of the TCPA's general bar against using automated dialing devices to make uninvited calls. The challenges encompass four issues addressed by the agency's order: (i) which sorts of automated dialing equipment are subject to the TCPA's restrictions on unconsented calls; (ii) when a caller obtains a party's consent, does a call nonetheless violate the Act if, unbeknownst to the caller, the consenting party's wireless number has been reassigned to a different person who has not given consent; (iii) how may a consenting party revoke her consent; and (iv) did the Commission too narrowly fashion an exemption\n   from the TCPA's consent requirement for certain healthcare-related calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We uphold the Commission's approach to revocation of consent, under which a party may revoke her consent through any reasonable means clearly expressing a desire to receive no further messages from the caller. We also sustain the scope of the agency's exemption for time-sensitive healthcare calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We set aside, however, the Commission's effort to clarify the types of calling equipment that fall within the TCPA's restrictions. The Commission's understanding would appear to subject ordinary calls from any conventional smartphone to the Act's coverage, an unreasonably expansive interpretation of the statute. We also vacate the agency's approach to calls made to a phone number previously assigned to a person who had given consent but since reassigned to another (nonconsenting) person. The Commission concluded that calls in that situation violate the TCPA, apart from a one-call safe harbor, regardless of whether the caller has any awareness of the reassignment. We determine that the agency's one-call safe harbor, at least as defended in the order, is arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We therefore grant the petitions for review in part and deny them in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The federal government's efforts to combat unwanted robocalls have spanned nearly three decades, involving two federal agencies and a number of congressional enactments. In the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 1994,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206101\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 6101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , Congress empowered the Federal Trade Commission to regulate the telemarketing industry. The FTC's measures include a general bar against calling any telephone number on the \"do-not-call registry\" without consent or an established business relationship.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20310.4\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(iii)(B) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206151\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 6151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). This case does not concern the FTC's initiatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This case instead concerns the Federal Communications Commission's efforts to combat unwanted robocalls pursuant to its authority under the TCPA. Some of the Commission's restrictions on telemarketing calls mirror measures established by the FTC.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20310.4\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 310.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(iii)(B), 310.4(c),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). But the agencies' initiatives also differ in various respects. Of relevance here, only the TCPA specifically restricts the use of an \"automatic telephone dialing system\" to make calls.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A).

This case solely concerns the latter restrictions on telephone calls to wireless numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Congress, in that regard, made it \"unlawful ... to make any call (other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called\n   party) using any automatic telephone dialing system ... to any telephone number assigned to a ... cellular telephone service,\" \"unless such call is made solely to collect a debt owed to or guaranteed by the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A)(iii). The statute defines an \"automatic telephone dialing system\" (ATDS, or autodialer) as \"equipment which has the capacity-(A) to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator; and (B) to dial such numbers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 227(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In short, the TCPA generally makes it unlawful to call a cell phone using an ATDS. And an ATDS is equipment with the \"capacity\" to perform each of two enumerated functions: (i) storing or producing telephone numbers \"using a random or sequential number generator\" and (ii) dialing those numbers. The general prohibition on autodialer calls to wireless numbers is subject to three exceptions. The central exception for purposes of this case is for calls made with \"prior express consent.\" There are also exceptions for emergency calls and calls made to collect government debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The TCPA vests the Commission with responsibility to promulgate regulations implementing the Act's requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 227(b)(2). The Act also grants the Commission specific authority to fashion exemptions from the general prohibition on autodialer calls to wireless numbers, where the calls are \"not charged to the called party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 227(b)(2)(C). As Congress explained, the FCC \"should have the flexibility to design different rules for those types of automated or prerecorded calls that it finds are not considered a nuisance or invasion of privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 227 note, Pub.

In 2003, for instance, the agency concluded that the statute's restrictions on \"mak[ing] any call\" using an ATDS encompass the sending of text messages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (2003 Order),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    18 FCC Rcd. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,014, 14,115 \u00b6 165 (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Act contains a private right of action permitting aggrieved parties to recover at least $500 in damages for each call made (or text message sent) in violation of the statute, and up to treble damages for each \"willful[ ] or knowing[ ]\" violation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). There is no cap on the amount of recoverable damages. The Commission has noted a surge in TCPA lawsuits (including class actions) in recent years, likely attributable in part to the \"skyrocketing growth of mobile phones.\" In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (2015 Declaratory Ruling),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. 7961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7970 \u00b6\u00b6 6-7 (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In a Declaratory Ruling and Order issued in 2015, the Commission (with two Commissioners dissenting) addressed 21 separate petitions for rulemaking or requests for clarification. In this court, petitioners and intervenors seek review of four aspects of the Commission's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the Commission sought to clarify which devices for making calls qualify as an ATDS-i.e., equipment that \"has the capacity\" to \"store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator,\" and \"to dial such numbers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). With regard to whether equipment has the \"capacity\" to perform the enumerated functions, the Commission declined to define a device's \"capacity\" in a manner confined to its \"present capacity.\" Instead, the agency construed a device's \"capacity\" to\n   encompass its \"potential functionalities\" with modifications such as software changes. 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7974 \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Commission also addressed the precise functions that a device must have the capacity to perform for it to be considered an ATDS. The Commission reaffirmed prior orders deciding that \"predictive dialers\"-equipment that can dial automatically from a given list of telephone numbers using algorithms to predict \"when a sales agent will be available\"-qualify as autodialers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7972 \u00b6 10 &amp; n.39. The Commission further explained that a \"basic function[ ]\" of an autodialer is to \"dial numbers without human intervention.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7975 \u00b6 17. At the same time, the Commission also declined to \"clarify[ ] that a dialer is not an autodialer unless it has the capacity to dial numbers without human intervention.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7976 \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the Commission spoke to whether, and when, a caller violates the TCPA by calling a wireless number that has been reassigned from a consenting party to another person without the caller's knowledge. The Act specifically permits autodialer calls \"made with the prior express consent of the called party.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). If the \"called party\" for those purposes refers to the\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   recipient of a call or message, a caller would face no liability when using an ATDS to call a number believed to belong to a consenting party, even if the number in fact has been reassigned to another person who has not consented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Commission, though, determined that the term \"called party\" refers not to \"the intended recipient of a call\" but instead to \"the current subscriber\" (i.e., the current, nonconsenting holder of a reassigned number rather than a consenting party who previously held the number). 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7999 \u00b6 72. But the Commission did not hold a caller strictly liable when unaware that the consenting party's number has been reassigned to another person. Instead, the agency allowed one-and only one-liability-free, post-reassignment call for callers who lack \"knowledge of [the] reassignment\" and possess \"a reasonable basis to believe that they have valid consent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8000 \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the Commission clarified the ways in which a consenting party can revoke her consent to receive autodialer calls. The Commission decided that callers may not unilaterally designate the acceptable means of revocation. It also declined to prescribe its own set of mandatory revocation procedures. Rather, it concluded that \"a called party may revoke consent at any time and through any reasonable means\"-whether orally or in writing-\"that clearly expresses a desire not to receive further messages.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7989-90 \u00b6 47 ;\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 7996 \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , and finally, the Commission exempted from the autodialer provision's consent requirement certain calls to wireless numbers \"for which there is exigency and that have a healthcare treatment purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8031 \u00b6 146. It declined, however, to give the exemption the reach desired by certain parties that are in the business of healthcare-related marketing calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We will take up the challenges to those four aspects of the Commission's 2015 ruling in the same order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Under the Administrative Procedure Act, we assess whether the Commission's challenged actions in its 2015 order were \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).

We sustain, however, the Commission's ruling that a party can revoke consent through any reasonable means clearly expressing a desire to receive no further calls or texts, and we also uphold the scope of the Commission's exemption for time-sensitive, healthcare-related calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We first consider the Commission's effort to clarify which sorts of calling equipment qualify as an ATDS so as to fall subject to the general prohibition against making calls using such a device without consent. The statute defines an ATDS as \"equipment which has the capacity-(A) to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator; and (B) to dial such numbers.\" 47 U.S.C \u00a7 227(a)(1). That definition naturally raises two questions: (i) when does a device have the \"capacity\" to perform the two enumerated functions; and (ii) what precisely are those functions? We conclude that the Commission's approach to those two questions cannot be sustained, at least given the Commission's unchallenged assumption that a call made with a device having the capacity to function as an autodialer can violate the statute even if autodialer features are not used to make the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   a. In addressing what it means for equipment to have the \"capacity\" to perform the autodialer functions enumerated in the statute, the Commission rejected the arguments of various parties that a device's capacity must be measured solely by reference to its \"present capacity\" or its \"current configuration\" without any modification. 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7974 \u00b6 16. The Commission instead determined that the \"capacity\" of calling equipment \"includes its potential functionalities\" or \"future possibility,\" not just its \"present ability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7974 \u00b6 16 ;\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 7975 \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Commission reasoned that the \"functional capacity of software-controlled equipment is designed to be flexible, both in terms of features that can be activated or de-activated and in terms of features that can be added to the equipment's overall functionality through software changes or updates.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7974 \u00b6 16 n.63. And the Commission found support for its \"potential functionalities\" approach in dictionary definitions of the term \"capacity,\" one of\n   which is \"the potential or suitability for holding, storing, or accommodating.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7975 \u00b6 19 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Capacity\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/capacity (as visited May 18, 2015)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In challenging the Commission's approach, petitioners argue that the term \"capacity\" in the statutory definition of an ATDS can refer only to a device's \"present ability,\" i.e., its current and unmodified state, not its \"potential ability\" taking into account possible upgrades or modifications. It is far from clear, though, that labels such as \"present\" ability versus \"potential\" ability should carry dispositive weight in assessing the meaning of the statutory term \"capacity.\" After all, even under the ostensibly narrower, \"present ability\" interpretation advanced by petitioners, a device that \"presently\" (and generally) operates as a traditional telephone would still be considered have the \"capacity\" to function as an ATDS if it could assume the requisite features merely upon touching a button on the equipment to switch it into autodialer mode. Virtually any understanding of \"capacity\" thus contemplates some future functioning state, along with some modifying act to bring that state about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Consequently, the question whether equipment has the \"capacity\" to perform the functions of an ATDS ultimately turns less on labels such as \"present\" and \"potential\" and more on considerations such as how much is required to enable the device to function as an autodialer: does it require the simple flipping of a switch, or does it require essentially a top-to-bottom reconstruction of the equipment? And depending on the answer, what kinds (and how broad a swath) of telephone equipment might then be deemed to qualify as an ATDS subject to the general bar against making any calls without prior express consent?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   b. Here, the Commission adopted an expansive interpretation of \"capacity\" having the apparent effect of embracing any and all smartphones: the device routinely used by the vast majority of citizens to make calls and send messages (and for many people, the sole phone equipment they own). It is undisputed that essentially any smartphone, with the addition of software, can gain the statutorily enumerated features of an autodialer and thus function as an ATDS. The Commission in its ruling did not question the observation of a dissenting Commissioner that \"[i]t's trivial to download an app, update software, or write a few lines of code that would modify a phone to dial random or sequential numbers.\" 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at 8075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Comm'r Pai, dissenting). The Commission itself noted that \"[d]ialing options\" are now \"available via smartphone apps\" that enable \"[c]alling and texting consumers\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7970 \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Commission's ruling concluded that app downloads and other software additions of that variety-and the enhanced functionality they bring about-are appropriately considered to be within a device's \"capacity.\" The ruling states that equipment's \"functional capacity\" includes \"features that can be added ... through software changes or updates.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7974 \u00b6 16 n.63. As a result, \"a piece of equipment can possess the requisite 'capacity' to satisfy the statutory definition of an 'autodialer' even if, for example, it requires the addition of software to actually perform the functions described in the definition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7975 \u00b6 18. The Commission reinforced the point in an example set forth in its brief in this case: \"If I ask whether the Firefox browser has the 'capacity' to play Flash videos, it would be natural for you to answer 'Yes, if you download the Flash plug-in'-and it would be incorrect for you to answer 'No.' \" FCC Br. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   If a device's \"capacity\" includes functions that could be added through app downloads and software additions, and if smartphone apps can introduce ATDS functionality into the device, it follows that all smartphones, under the Commission's approach, meet the statutory definition of an autodialer. The Commission's ruling does not deny that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To the contrary, a number of parties specifically argued to the agency \"that a broad interpretation of 'capacity' could potentially sweep in smartphones because they may have the capacity to store telephone numbers to be called and to dial such numbers through the use of an app or other software.\" 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7976 \u00b6 21. Rather than resist that contention, the Commission assumed its correctness, responding that, even if smartphones qualify as autodialers, it was unclear to the Commission that the \"typical use of smartphones\" would be \"likely\" to give rise to \"unwanted calls\" of a kind producing \"legal action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7977 \u00b6 21. A dissenting Commissioner read that portion of the Commission's order to \"acknowledge[ ] that smartphones are swept in under its reading,\" such that \"each and every smartphone ... is an automatic telephone dialing system.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8075 &amp; n.576 (Comm'r Pai, dissenting). The Commission did not disagree or suggest otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   c. If every smartphone qualifies as an ATDS, the statute's restrictions on autodialer calls assume an eye-popping sweep. Recall that the statute generally bars the use of an ATDS to make any call (or send any text message) without prior express consent, and tags each violation with a minimum $500 penalty in damages for each individual recipient of each prohibited call or message. The reach of the statute becomes especially pronounced upon recognizing that, under the Commission's approach, an uninvited call or message from a smartphone violates the statute even if autodialer features were not used to make the call or send the message.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7976 \u00b6 19 n.70. We explore that interpretive issue in greater depth below (\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II.A.3); but for now, it suffices to appreciate the Commission's understanding that, as long as equipment has the \"capacity\" to function as an autodialer-as is true of every smartphone under the agency's view-\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   uninvited call or message from the device is a statutory violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Imagine, for instance, that a person wishes to send an invitation for a social gathering to a person she recently met for the first time. If she lacks prior express consent to send the invitation, and if she obtains the acquaintance's cell phone number from a mutual friend, she ostensibly commits a violation of federal law by calling or sending a text message from her smartphone to extend the invitation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at 8076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Comm'r Pai, dissenting). And if she sends a group message inviting ten people to the gathering, again without securing prior express consent from any of the recipients, she not only would have infringed the TCPA ten distinct times but would also face a minimum damages recovery against her of $5,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Those sorts of anomalous outcomes are bottomed in an unreasonable, and impermissible, interpretation of the statute's reach. The TCPA cannot reasonably be read to render every smartphone an ATDS subject to the Act's restrictions, such that every smartphone user violates federal law whenever she makes a call or sends a text message without advance consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   A \"significant majority of American adults\" owned a smartphone even by 2013.\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

And any uncertainty on that score would have left affected parties without concrete guidance even though several of them specifically raised the issue with the agency, and even though the issue carries significant implications-including the possibility of committing federal law violations and incurring substantial liability in damages-for smartphone owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   At any rate, even assuming the Commission's ruling could be conceived to leave room for concluding that smartphones do not qualify as autodialers, that result itself would be unreasonable and impermissible. The Commission's order, in that event, would not constitute reasoned decisionmaking and thus would not satisfy APA arbitrary-and-capricious review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States Postal Serv. v.

Precisely the same logic seemingly should compel concluding that smartphones have the \"capacity\" to function as autodialers because apps carrying the requisite features can be downloaded. If the Commission believes smartphones nonetheless do not meet the definition of an autodialer, there is no explanation of \"this differential treatment of seemingly like cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222492,4184005\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/740/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222492,4184005\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/740/\">\n    at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Commission did say in its order that \"there must be more than a theoretical potential that the equipment could be modified to satisfy the 'autodialer' definition.\" 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7975 \u00b6 18. But that ostensible limitation affords no ground for distinguishing between a smartphone and the Firefox browser. In light of the ease of downloading an app to a smartphone, there is no evident basis for concluding that the Firefox browser has more than a mere \"theoretical potential\" to play Flash videos by downloading a plug-in, but a smartphone nonetheless has only a \"theoretical potential\" to function as an autodialer by downloading an app.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The point is fortified by the sole example of a mere \"theoretical potential\" set forth by the Commission in its order. That example involves a traditional rotary-dial phone (which by now is approaching obsolescence): the Commission observed that \"it might be theoretically possible to modify a rotary-dial telephone to such an extreme that it would satisfy the definition of 'autodialer,' but such a possibility is too attenuated ... to find that a rotary-dial phone has the requisite 'capacity' and therefore is an autodialer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A rotary phone has no relevant similarity to a smartphone. To the contrary, whereas a smartphone and the Firefox browser substantially resemble one another in their amenability to an upgrade via the addition of software, they substantially differ in that regard from a rotary-dial phone, which has no such capability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In the end, then, the Commission's order cannot reasonably be understood to support the conclusion that smartphones fall outside the TCPA's autodialer definition: any such reading would compel concluding that the agency's ruling fails arbitrary-and-capricious review. The more straightforward understanding of the Commission's ruling is that all smartphones qualify as autodialers because they have the inherent \"capacity\" to gain ATDS functionality by downloading an app. That interpretation of the statute, for all the reasons explained, is an unreasonably, and impermissibly, expansive one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Recall that the statutory definition of an ATDS raises two sets of questions: (i)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   when does a device have the \"capacity\" to perform the functions of an autodialer enumerated by the statute?; and (ii) what precisely is the content of those functions? The impermissibility of the Commission's interpretation of the term \"capacity\" in the autodialer definition is compounded by inadequacies in the agency's explanation of the requisite features. Having addressed the first issue, we now turn to the second one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   a. As a threshold matter, the Commission maintains that the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain petitioners' challenge concerning the functions a device must be able to perform. The agency reasons that the issue was resolved in prior agency orders-specifically, declaratory rulings in 2003 and 2008 concluding that the statutory definition of an ATDS includes \"predictive dialers,\" dialing equipment that can make use of algorithms to \"assist[ ] telemarketers in predicting when a sales agent will be available to take calls.\" 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7972 \u00b6 10 n.39 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (2008 Declaratory Ruling),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20FCC%20Rcd%20559\">\n    23 FCC Rcd. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) ; 2003 Order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    18 FCC Rcd. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,014. According to the Commission, because there was no timely appeal from those previous orders, it is too late now to raise a challenge by seeking review of a more recent declaratory ruling that essentially ratifies the previous ones. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   While the Commission's latest ruling purports to reaffirm the prior orders, that does not shield the agency's pertinent pronouncements from review. The agency's prior rulings left significant uncertainty about the precise functions an autodialer must have the capacity to perform. Petitioners covered their bases by filing petitions for both a declaratory ruling and a rulemaking concerning that issue and related ones.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Prof'l Ass'n for Customer Engagement, Inc. Pet. 3-4; ACA Int'l Pet. 6; GroupMe, Inc. Pet. 3; Glide Talk, Ltd. Pet. 13. In response, the Commission issued a declaratory ruling that purported to \"provid[e] clarification on the definition of 'autodialer,' \" and denied the petitions for rulemaking on the issue. 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   8039 \u00b6 165 &amp; n.552.

The statutory definition says that a device constitutes an ATDS if it has the capacity to perform both of two enumerated functions: \"to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator\"; and \"to dial such numbers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A)-(B). The role of the phrase, \"using a random or sequential number generator,\" has generated substantial questions over the years. The Commission has sought to address those questions in previous orders and did so again in the 2015 Declaratory Ruling we consider here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Commission's most recent effort falls short of reasoned decisionmaking in \"offer[ing] no meaningful guidance\" to affected parties in material respects on whether their equipment is subject to the statute's autodialer restrictions.\n   <em>\n    Postal Regulatory Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222492,4184005\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/740/\">\n    785 F.3d at 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A basic question raised by the statutory definition is whether a device must\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   have the ability to generate random or sequential telephone numbers to be dialed. Or is it enough if the device can call from a database of telephone numbers generated elsewhere? The Commission's ruling appears to be of two minds on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In certain respects, the order conveys that equipment needs to have the ability to generate random or sequential numbers that it can then dial. The order twice\n   states that, to \"meet[ ] the TCPA's definition of 'autodialer,' \" the equipment in question must have the capacity to \"dial random or sequential numbers.\" 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7972 \u00b6 10 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7974 \u00b6 15. And it is clear from context that the order treats the ability to \"dial random or sequential numbers\" as the ability to\n   <em>\n    generate\n   </em>\n   and then dial \"random or sequential numbers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   To see why, it is helpful to understand that the ruling distinguishes between use of equipment to \"dial random or sequential numbers\" and use of equipment to \"call[ ] a set list of consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7972 \u00b6 10. Anytime phone numbers are dialed from a set list, the database of numbers must be called in\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   order-either in a random or some other sequence. As a result, the ruling's reference to \"dialing random or sequential numbers\" cannot simply mean dialing from a set list of numbers in random or other sequential order: if that were so, there would be no difference between \"dialing random or sequential numbers\" and \"dialing a set list of numbers,\" even though the ruling draws a divide between the two.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7973 \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14. It follows that the ruling's reference to \"dialing random or sequential numbers\" means generating those numbers and then dialing them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Commission's prior declaratory rulings reinforce that understanding. In its 2003 ruling addressing predictive dialers, the Commission observed that, \"[i]n the past, telemarketers may have used dialing equipment to\n   <em>\n    create and dial\n   </em>\n   10-digit telephone numbers arbitrarily.\" 2003 Order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    18 FCC Rcd. at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,092 \u00b6 132 (emphasis added). But the industry had \"progressed to the point where\" it had become \"far more cost effective\" instead to \"us[e] lists of numbers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, the Commission suggested it saw a difference between calling from a list of numbers, on one hand, and \"creating and dialing\" a random or arbitrary list of numbers, on the other hand. Or as the Commission has elsewhere said, numbers that are \"randomly or sequentially generated\" differ from numbers that \"come from a calling list.\" In re Implementation of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20FCC%20Rcd%2013\">\n    27 FCC Rcd. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,615, 13,629 \u00b6 29 (2012) (quoted in 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at 8077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Comm'r Pai, dissenting)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   While the 2015 ruling indicates in certain places that a device must be able to generate and dial random or sequential numbers to meet the TCPA's definition of an autodialer, it also suggests a competing view: that equipment can meet the statutory definition even if it lacks that capacity. The Commission reaffirmed its 2003 ruling insofar as that order had found predictive dialers to qualify as ATDSs. 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7972-73 \u00b6\u00b6 12-14. And in the 2003 order, the Commission had made clear that, while some predictive dialers cannot be programmed to generate random or sequential phone numbers, they still satisfy the statutory definition of an ATDS. 2003 Order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    18 FCC Rcd. at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,091 \u00b6 131 n.432 ;\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 14,093 \u00b6 133. By reaffirming that conclusion in its 2015 ruling, the Commission supported the notion that a device can be considered an autodialer even if it has no capacity itself to generate random or sequential numbers (and instead can only dial from an externally supplied set of numbers). The 2015 ruling correspondingly expresses that \"predictive dialers\" can differ from other \"dialers that utilize random or sequential numbers instead of a list of numbers.\" 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7973 \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   So which is it: does a device qualify as an ATDS only if it can generate random or sequential numbers to be dialed, or can it so qualify even if it lacks that capacity? The 2015 ruling, while speaking to the\n   question in several ways, gives no clear answer (and in fact seems to give both answers). It might be permissible for the Commission to adopt either interpretation. But the Commission cannot, consistent with reasoned decisionmaking, espouse both competing interpretations in the same order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The choice between the interpretations is not without practical significance. Petitioners and various amici describe calling equipment that they wish to use to call set lists of cellular numbers without any generation of random or sequential numbers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ACA Int'l Reply Br. 21; Am. Bankers Ass'n Amicus Br. 29-30. And at least some predictive dialers, as explained, have no capacity to generate random or sequential numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The uncertainty in the 2015 ruling, moreover, does not stop with the question of whether a device must be able to generate random or sequential numbers to meet the statutory definition. The ruling is also unclear about whether certain other referenced capabilities are necessary for a dialer to qualify as an ATDS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For instance, the ruling states that the \"basic function\" of an autodialer is the ability to \"dial numbers without human intervention.\" 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7973 \u00b6 14 ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7975 \u00b6 17. Prior orders had said the same. 2003 Order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20FCC%20Rcd%2014\">\n    18 FCC Rcd. at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,092 \u00b6 132 ; 2008 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20FCC%20Rcd%20559\">\n    23 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   566 \u00b6 13. That makes sense given that \"auto\" in autodialer-or, equivalently, \"automatic\" in \"automatic telephone dialing system,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) -would seem to envision non-manual dialing of telephone numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   But the Commission nevertheless declined a request to \"clarify[ ] that a dialer is not an autodialer unless it has the capacity to dial numbers without human intervention.\" 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7976 \u00b6 20. According to the Commission, then, the \"basic function\" of an autodialer is to dial numbers without human intervention, but a device might still qualify as an autodialer even if it cannot dial numbers without human intervention. Those side-by-side propositions are difficult to square.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Commission further said that another \"basic function[ ]\" of an ATDS is to \"dial thousands of numbers in a short period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 7975 \u00b6 17. But the ruling imparts no additional guidance concerning whether that is a necessary condition, a sufficient condition, a relevant condition even if neither necessary nor sufficient, or something else. Nor does it indicate what would qualify as a \"short period of time.\" Again, affected parties are left in a significant fog of uncertainty about how to determine if a device is an ATDS so as to bring into play the restrictions on unconsented calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In short, the Commission's ruling, in describing the functions a device must perform to qualify as an autodialer, fails to satisfy the requirement of reasoned decisionmaking. The order's lack of clarity about which functions qualify a device as an autodialer compounds the unreasonableness of the Commission's expansive understanding of when a device has the \"capacity\" to perform the necessary functions. We must therefore set aside the Commission's treatment of those matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   We briefly note an additional statutory provision affecting the scope of the TCPA's restrictions on autodialer calls to cell numbers-a provision we ultimately have no occasion to examine because of the way the case has been presented to us. Two TCPA provisions work together to establish the reach of the general prohibition against making autodialer calls without prior consent. The first provision, as\n   we have seen, defines the equipment-viz., \"automatic telephone dialing system\"-subject to the statutory prohibition.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The second provision then incorporates that definition in setting out the scope of the prohibition: \"It shall be unlawful for any person ... to\n   <em>\n    make any call\n   </em>\n   (other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called party)\n   <em>\n    using any automatic telephone dialing system\n   </em>\n   ... to any telephone number assigned to a ... cellular telephone service[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Petitioners have confined their challenge to the Commission's understanding of the first of those provisions, the statutory definition of an autodialer, and our analysis has been focused on that issue. Petitioners have raised no challenge to the Commission's understanding of the second provision-i.e., to the agency's interpretation of what it means to \"make any call using any\" ATDS. In particular, in the case of a device having the \"capacity\" both to perform the autodialer functions set out in the statutory definition and to perform as a traditional phone, does the bar against \"making any call using\" an ATDS apply only to calls made using the equipment's ATDS functionality? Or does the bar apply to all calls made with a device having that \"capacity,\" even ones made without any use of the equipment's autodialer capabilities? Or does the bar apply to calls made using certain autodialer functions, even if not all of them?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Commission's ruling endorsed a broad understanding under which the statute prohibits any calls made from a device with the capacity to function as an autodialer, regardless of whether autodialer features are used to make a call. 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7975 \u00b6 19 n.70. A dissenting commissioner, by contrast, read the pertinent statutory phrase, \"make any call,\" to mean \"that the equipment must, in fact, be used\n   <em>\n    as an autodialer\n   </em>\n   to make the calls\" before a TCPA violation can be found.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    at 8088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Comm'r O'Rielly, dissenting in part and approving in part).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The dissenting commissioner's interpretation would substantially diminish the practical significance of the Commission's expansive understanding of \"capacity\" in the autodialer definition. Even if the definition encompasses any device capable of gaining autodialer functionality through the downloading of software, the mere possibility of adding those features would not matter unless they were downloaded and used to make calls. Under the dissent's understanding of the phrase, \"make any call,\" then, everyday calls made with a smartphone would not infringe the statute: the fact that a smartphone could be configured to function as an autodialer would not matter unless the relevant software in fact were loaded onto the phone and were used to initiate calls or send messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Petitioners, however, raise no challenge to the Commission's understanding of the statutory words, \"make any call using\" an ATDS, and the parties therefore have not presented arguments on the issue in their briefing before us.

While there is no consensus about the exact numbers of reassignments, there is no dispute that millions of wireless numbers are reassigned each year. In the event of a reassignment, the caller might initiate a phone call (or send a text message) based on a mistaken belief that the owner of the receiving number has given consent, when in fact the number has been reassigned to someone else from whom consent has not been obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Does a call or message in that situation violate the statutory bar against making autodialer calls without prior consent? The Commission's answer is yes, apart from a one-call, post-reassignment safe harbor. We set aside the Commission's interpretation on the ground that the one-call safe harbor is arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The pertinent statutory language generally renders it unlawful \"to make any call (other than a call made for emergency purposes or made with the\n   <em>\n    prior express consent of the called party\n   </em>\n   ) using any automatic telephone dialing equipment or prerecorded voice.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) (emphasis added). The Commission, in its ruling, initially addressed who is properly considered the \"called party\" when a consenting party's number is reassigned to another person: does \"called party\" refer to the person the caller expected to reach (whose consent had previously been obtained), or does it refer to the person actually reached, the wireless number's present-day subscriber after reassignment (whose consent has not been obtained)?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Commission adopted the latter interpretation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7999-8001 \u00b6\u00b6 72-73. The result is that the reassignment of a wireless number extinguishes any consent given by the number's previous holder and exposes the caller to liability for reaching a party who has not given consent. An alternative approach, the Commission reasoned, would \"effectively require consumers to opt out of such calls when the TCPA clearly requires the opposite-that consumers opt in before they can be contacted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8004 \u00b6 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The agency also refused to \"place any affirmative obligation\" on new subscribers to inform callers that a wireless number now belongs to someone else.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8011 \u00b6 95.

For that one call, the Commission understood the statutory term \"prior express consent\" to refer to the consent given by the previous subscriber.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   8001 \u00b6 73 &amp; n.265 ;\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 8003 \u00b6 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Commission allowed for that one liability-free call, rather than impose \"a\n   traditional strict liability standard,\" because it interpreted a caller's ability under the statute to rely on a recipient's \"prior express consent\" to \"mean reasonable reliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 8009 \u00b6 90 n.312. And when a caller has no knowledge of a reassignment, the Commission understandably viewed the caller's continued reliance on the prior subscriber's consent to be \"reasonable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Elsewhere in the Declaratory Ruling, the Commission echoed the same \"reasonable reliance\" understanding of the statute's approval of calls based on \"prior express consent.\" The ruling accepts that a caller can rely on consent given by a wireless number's \"customary user\" (\"such as a close relative on a subscriber's family calling plan\"), rather than by the subscriber herself.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 8001 \u00b6 75. That is because the \"caller in this situation cannot reasonably be expected to divine that the consenting person is not the subscriber.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 8001-02 \u00b6 75. The Commission reiterated in that regard that, in \"construing the term 'prior express consent' in section 227(b)(1)(A), we consider the caller's reasonableness in relying on consent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8001 \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Commission thus consistently adopted a \"reasonable reliance\" approach when interpreting the TCPA's approval of calls based on \"prior express consent,\" including as the justification for allowing a one-call safe harbor when a consenting party's number is reassigned. The Commission, though, gave no explanation of why reasonable-reliance considerations would support limiting the safe harbor to just one call or message. That is, why does a caller's reasonable reliance on a previous subscriber's consent necessarily cease to be reasonable once there has been a single, post-reassignment call? The first call or text message, after all, might give the caller no indication whatsoever of a possible reassignment (if, for instance, there is no response to a text message, as would often be the case with or without a reassignment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Commission outlined a number of measures callers could undertake \"that, over time, may permit them to learn of reassigned numbers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8007 \u00b6 86. But the Commission acknowledged that callers \"may nevertheless not learn of reassignment before placing a call to a new subscriber,\" and that the first post-reassignment call likewise might give no reason to suspect a reassignment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8009 \u00b6\u00b6 88, 90 n.312. In that event, a caller's reasonable reliance on the previous subscriber's consent would be just as reasonable for a second call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   To be sure, the Commission stated that it found \"no basis in the statute or the record before [it] to conclude that callers can reasonably rely on prior express consent beyond one call to reassigned numbers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8009-10 \u00b6 90 n.312. But the Commission did not elaborate on-or otherwise support-its conclusory observation to that effect. And the statement is hard to square with the Commission's concession that the first call may give no notice of a reassignment, or with the Commission's disavowal of any expectation that a caller should \"divine from the called consumer's mere silence the current status of a telephone number.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (brackets omitted). In that light, no cognizable conception of \"reasonable reliance\" supports the Commission's blanket, one-call-only allowance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   At times, the Commission indicated that its one-call safe harbor intends to give callers additional \"opportunity\" to find out about a possible reassignment.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8009 \u00b6 89;\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 8010 \u00b6 91. There is no indication, though, that the interest in giving callers such an opportunity is independent of the interest in giving effect to a caller's reasonable reliance. After all, a caller also has an opportunity to learn of a reassignment\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the first call. The reason\n   to allow even one, liability-free, post-reassignment call-the reason the Commission cared about affording an opportunity to learn about reassignment at all-is in order to give effect to a caller's reasonable reliance on the previous subscriber's consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Indeed, the Commission's one-call safe harbor applies \"over an unlimited period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8000 \u00b6 72 n.257. If the goal were simply to provide an expanded opportunity to learn about a reassignment, the Commission presumably would have allowed for a given period of time. It declined to do so,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8009 \u00b6 89, opting instead to permit a single call regardless of whether it occurs within minutes or months of a reassignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   For substantially the same reasons, the Commission's one-call-only approach cannot be salvaged by its suggestion that callers rather than new subscribers should bear the risk when calls are made (or messages are sent) to a reassigned number.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8009-10 \u00b6 90 n.312. That consideration would equally support a zero-call, strict-liability rule.

The Commission did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Soppet\n   </em>\n   , discussed earlier, is not to the contrary. There, the court assumed that \"any consent previously given ... lapses when [a] [c]ell [n]umber is reassigned.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3876165\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/637/\">\n    679 F.3d at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court, though, did not have before it an agency interpretation under which the previous subscriber's consent does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   lapse with reassignment: the premise of the Commission's one-call safe harbor is that a caller can continue to rely on the previous subscriber's consent. The question we face is, why should that necessarily stop with a single call?\n   <em>\n    Soppet\n   </em>\n   does not speak to that question, and so does not cast doubt on our conclusion that the Commission failed to give it a satisfactory answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Finally, the Commission's failure in that regard requires setting aside not only its allowance of a one-call safe harbor, but also its treatment of reassigned numbers more generally. When we invalidate a specific aspect of an agency's action, we leave related components of the agency's action standing only if \"we can say without any 'substantial doubt' that the agency would have adopted the severed portion on its own.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

If we were to excise the Commission's one-call safe harbor alone, that would leave in place the Commission's interpretation that \"called party\" refers to the new subscriber.

Without the certainty of standardized procedures, petitioners fear, they will be able to ward off TCPA liability only by \"tak[ing] exorbitant precautions.\" ACA Int'l Br. 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   We think petitioners' concerns are overstated. The Commission's ruling absolves callers of any responsibility to adopt systems that would entail \"undue burdens\" or would be \"overly burdensome to implement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7996 \u00b6 64 &amp; n.233. In light of that assurance, callers would have no need to train every retail employee on the finer points of revocation. And callers will have every incentive to avoid TCPA liability by making available clearly-defined and easy-to-use opt-out methods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   If recipients are afforded such options, any effort to sidestep the available methods in favor of idiosyncratic or imaginative revocation requests might well be seen as unreasonable. The selection of an unconventional method of seeking revocation might also betray the absence of any \"reasonable expectation\" by the consumer that she could \"effectively communicate\" a revocation request in the chosen fashion.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Petitioners observe that the Commission's ruling itself dictates particular opt-out mechanisms for certain types of time-sensitive banking- and healthcare-related calls that the Commission exempted from the TCPA's consumer consent requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 8028 \u00b6 138 ;\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 8032 \u00b6 147. If the Commission prescribed specific opt-out methods for those types of calls, petitioners ask, then why not similarly set out standardized means of revocation for all calls?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Commission was not required to treat the two situations in a parallel manner. For the banking- and healthcare-related calls, the Commission found that the communications were sufficiently important to warrant an exemption from the otherwise-applicable obligation to obtain prior consent.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 8023 \u00b6 125. As a result, the default rule for those calls is that they should be\n   <em>\n    allowed\n   </em>\n   (without regard to consent), such that the availability of an opt-out can be conditioned on adhering to specific procedures. By contrast, the default rule for\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   -exempted calls is that they are\n   <em>\n    disallowed\n   </em>\n   (absent consent), such that the availability of an opt-out naturally could be broader. In that context, the Commission could reasonably elect to enable consumers to revoke their consent without having to adhere to specific procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Finally, petitioners object to the Declaratory Ruling insofar as it might preclude callers and consumers from contractually agreeing to revocation mechanisms. The Commission correctly concedes, however, that the ruling \"did not address whether contracting parties can select a particular revocation procedure by mutual agreement.\" FCC Br. 64 n.16. The ruling precludes unilateral imposition of revocation rules by callers; it does not address revocation rules mutually adopted by contracting parties. Nothing in the Commission's order thus should be understood to speak to parties' ability to agree upon revocation procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The last set of challenges before us, brought by petitioner Rite Aid, concerns the scope of the Commission's exemption of certain healthcare-related calls from the TCPA's prior-consent requirement for calls to wireless numbers.

We assume for present purposes that some calls concerning the \"[s]ale ... of a drug ... in accordance with a prescription\" would relate to \"billing,\" which the 2015 Declaratory Ruling did not exempt from the consent requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Rite Aid is therefore correct that, in one sense, the 2012 exemption swept more broadly than the 2015 version. We also accept that the 2012 Order cited a number of \"technology-agnostic justifications\" for exempting all prerecorded healthcare-related calls subject to HIPAA and made to residential lines. Rite Aid Br. 5. For example, the Commission believed that such calls \"ensure continued customer access to health care-related information\" and would not lead to \"coercive or abusive\" interactions. 2012 Order, 27 FCC Rcd. at 1853-54 \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The relevant question is whether the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in affording a narrower exemption for healthcare-related calls made to\n   <em>\n    wireless\n   </em>\n   numbers. We find that it did not. Even if one might hypothesize \"important reasons for treating residential and wireless telephone lines the same,\" Rite Aid Br. 9, the TCPA itself presupposes the contrary-that calls to residential and wireless numbers warrant differential treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Unlike with the autodialer restrictions on calls to wireless numbers, callers are free to use ATDS equipment to dial residential lines as long as no \"artificial or prerecorded voice\" is used.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B). The statute itself contemplates that calls to wireless numbers \"tread [more] heavily upon ... consumer privacy interests.\" 2012 Order, 27 FCC Rcd. at 1855 \u00b6 63. That concern directly informed the 2015 exemption's scope: the Commission concluded that messages \"not critical to a called party's healthcare ... do not justify setting aside a consumer's privacy interests.\" 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   8031 \u00b6 146.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In short, there is nothing inherently contradictory about easing restrictions on certain kinds of calls to landlines, but not to cellular phones. And Rite Aid fails to mention another variable that confounds direct comparisons between the two exemptions. As codified, the 2012 exemption applies only to calls that \"us[e] an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) ; the Declaratory Ruling's exemption is not so limited. We therefore reject Rite Aid's first arbitrary-and-capricious challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   b. Lastly, Rite Aid argues that the Commission acted arbitrarily by failing to recognize that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   healthcare-related calls satisfy the TCPA's \"emergency purposes\" exception to the consent requirement. As used in the Act, \"[t]he term emergency purposes means calls made necessary in any situation affecting the health and safety of consumers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(4). But Rite Aid identifies no calls satisfying that exception that were not already subject to the 2015 exemption. It would be implausible to conclude that calls concerning \"telemarking, solicitation, or advertising content, or which include accounting, billing, debt-collection, or other financial content\" are made for \"emergency purposes.\" 2015 Declaratory Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   8031 \u00b6 146. Even if accounting systems are in some sense \"necessary\" to the continued provision of healthcare, \"[t]imely delivery of these types of messages is not\n   <em>\n    critical\n   </em>\n   \" to that goal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   In marked contrast, the Commission recently exempted calls concerning certain time-sensitive risks to students' health and safety in the school setting. That list of scenarios included \"weather closures, fire, ... threats,\" \"dangerous persons, health risks (e.g., toxic spills), and unexcused absences.\" In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20FCC%20Rcd%209054\">\n    31 FCC Rcd. 9054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9061 \u00b6 17, 9063 \u00b6 21 (2016). In declining a request to interpret the emergency-purposes exception far more expansively, we are guided by its role in the statutory scheme. Consumers may find themselves wholly unable to stave off calls satisfying the exception. That is because, by definition, such calls fall outside the TCPA's consent framework; callers can make them even if recipients are known to object. Advertisements, solicitations, and post-treatment financial communications do not arise from the sorts of \"emergencies\" that would justify suspending the TCPA's consent regime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The Commission was empowered to draw the distinction it did, and it adequately explained its reasons for doing so. We therefore reject Rite Aid's arbitrary-and-capricious challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we grant in part and deny in part the petitions for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
