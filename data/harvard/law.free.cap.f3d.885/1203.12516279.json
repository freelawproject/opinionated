In 2007, Defendants founded WMCF, a non-profit foundation dedicated to teaching interested veterans the technical skills required to succeed in the film industry. After encountering fund-raising trouble, Defendants sought funding from a Department of Veteran Affairs (\"VA\") program, the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program (\"VRE Program\"). The VRE Program provides, on behalf of specific veterans, payments to the educational institutions that those veterans attend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For WMCF to receive payments, the VA had to approve its training program. Further, WMCF had to comply with a number of federal regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2021.120\">\n    38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 21.120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 21.162. As part of the approval process, WMCF submitted to the VA a curriculum, education contract, and budget. In December 2007, the VA approved the application and certified WMCF as a vendor authorized to provide training to wounded veterans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants recruited veterans eligible for the VRE Program. To authorize funding, the VA required each veteran to submit an \"individualized written rehabilitation plan.\" Defendants ultimately submitted rehabilitation plans on behalf of eight of the veterans in WMCF's inaugural class. Defendants submitted invoices to the VA for those veterans' costs, and the VA, in turn, approved the invoices. The VA also provided Defendants with accelerated payments \"to help the foundation.\" Without VA funding, WMCF was not financially viable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants repeatedly asked WMCF's board to pay them salaries and to reimburse their personal expenses. The board, however, refused to approve salaries for Defendants and declined to pay their living expenses, medical expenses, or pensions-at least until WMCF was financially solvent. Nevertheless, Defendants transferred significant sums from WMCF's account to their personal accounts. Defendants also spent large sums of WMCF's money on personal expenses such as groceries, meals, medical bills, and coffee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The government charged Defendants with, among other crimes not relevant here, wrongfully taking WMCF funds in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Counts 2-9). The jury found Defendants guilty on all \u00a7 666 counts. The district court sentenced Paixao to six months in custody and Lombard to three months in custody, and ordered both to pay restitution. Defendants timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Title\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   prohibits the wrongful taking of property from certain federally funded organizations.

There is, we think, a fundamental difference between the role that the government plays when it routinely makes the purchases required to maintain things like federal lands or buildings and the role that the government plays when it embarks on an enterprise meant to aid a particular segment of the public. The inquiry is a tricky one, though, because what may be a \"beneficial\" act in one context-granting every soup kitchen in the nation funds to purchase new ovens-may be mere maintenance in another-granting federal courthouses' cafeterias funds to replace their ovens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But even when the government acts as a benefactor, it necessarily must make the everyday purchases required to keep that enterprise afloat. And in those situations, it is not always clear whether the government has disbursed \"benefits.\" To return to the given examples, it is not immediately clear whether the ovens' manufacturer (rather than the soup kitchen or the federal courthouses) would have received \"benefits\" under the statute. The answer to\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   question would depend, among other things, on the program's purpose, organization, and structure-that is, whether the government meant to aid the manufacturer by establishing the program; whether the manufacturer had to comply with certain rules and regulations to participate in the program; and the degree to which the program required the manufacturer to work hand-in-hand with the government. Those principles, applied here, demonstrate that WMCF received \"benefits\" within the meaning of \u00a7 666(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The VRE Program's Purpose\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In establishing the VRE Program, Congress aimed \"to provide for all services and assistance necessary to enable veterans with service-connected disabilities to\n   achieve maximum independence in daily living and, to the maximum extent feasible, to become employable and to obtain and maintain suitable employment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203100\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, it is likely that Congress enacted the program without any particular educational institution in mind. But the program, as Congress described it, aims to aid veterans\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   to ensure the viability and quality of the organizations that serve those veterans.

The regulations require institutions receiving VRE Program funds to maintain a certain level of quality. Although that fact alone does little to set those institutions apart from other government contractors, the VRE Program requires more than a special level of quality from its participants. To participate in the program, institutions must engage in an ongoing back-and-forth with the federal government. That arm-in-arm approach shows that the government's interest in those institutions differs in kind from its interest in standard contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants insist that the aforementioned standards and regulations are \"not particularly rigorous.\" But the facts of this case suggest otherwise. Not even a year after WMCF began receiving payments, the VA reviewed WMCF's eligibility for funds, found issues with approval standards, and suspended WMCF's approval. The VA re-approved WMCF's funding only after WMCF acknowledged and corrected a litany of problems that the VA identified. That degree of oversight further suggests that the funds at issue were \"benefits\" and not ordinary payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The VRE Program's Structure and Operation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the VRE Program differs significantly from Medicare in its payment structure and that this case is thus distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, Defendants emphasize that the VA reimburses WMCF for\n   <em>\n    only the veteran's direct costs\n   </em>\n   (tuition, fees, and equipment), whereas Medicare reimburses providers for a wider range of costs, including some overhead and training-related costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   , however, does not suggest that an institution\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   receive reimbursement for institutional costs to qualify as receiving \"benefits.\" First, the payments at issue in\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   reflected the reasonable cost of services rendered.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508986\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/667/\">\n    529 U.S. at 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508986\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/667/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And second, as explained above, the Court looked\n   <em>\n    beyond\n   </em>\n   Medicare's reimbursement program to consider the government's purpose in making payments and the conditions under which healthcare providers received those payments. Thus, even accepting that the VRE Program is structured so differently from Medicare as to render\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   distinguishable on this point,\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   's other factors compel us to conclude that WMCF received \"benefits\" within the meaning of \u00a7 666(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wyncoop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11309232\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/11/119/\">\n    11 F.3d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1993), is unavailing. In\n   <em>\n    Wyncoop\n   </em>\n   , we held that Trend College had not received \u00a7 666(b)\"benefits\" simply by participating in federal student loan programs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11309232\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/11/119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11309232\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/11/119/\">\n    at 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Wyncoop\n   </em>\n   turned almost entirely on the fact that Trend College\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   never received or administered federal funds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11309232\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/11/119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the VRE Program works differently. As this case demonstrates, institutions participating in the VRE Program receive government funds\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   (and subsequently use them to aid veterans).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because WMCF received \"benefits\" within the meaning of \u00a7 666(b), Defendants' convictions are\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    In a separate memorandum disposition, filed this date, we address all other issues relevant to this appeal and affirm with respect to those issues.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Wyncoop\n    </em>\n    , we observed that \"there is no ... reason to conclude that Congress in enacting section 666 intended to bring employees at every college and university in the country within the scope of potential federal criminal jurisdiction.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11309232\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/11/119/\">\n     11 F.3d at 123\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But we made that observation before the Supreme Court decided\n    <em>\n     Fischer\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Fischer\n    </em>\n    makes clear that the \"benefits\" question turns on the purposes and the operation of the specific federal program at issue. Under\n    <em>\n     Fischer\n    </em>\n    , we conclude that the funds at issue here were \"benefits.\" To the extent that\n    <em>\n     Wyncoop\n    </em>\n    can be understood to contradict the Supreme Court's later holding, it no longer is binding.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Miller v.
