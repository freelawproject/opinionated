The Conspiracy Charge.\n   </em>\n   At trial, FBI Special Agent and case agent Michele Neily testified that, in 2014 and 2015, state and federal task forces investigating methamphetamine distribution in Omaha, Nebraska and Council Bluffs, Iowa identified Richard Hull, Jr. as a key distributor. Using wiretaps, physical surveillance, source information, and controlled purchases, investigators identified Espinoza and Tizoc as two of Hull's suppliers. On September 23, 2015, warrant searches at Tizoc's and Hull's residence and at a garage on Z Street in Omaha yielded distribution quantities of methamphetamine, firearms, ammunition, financial records, and other evidence of drug trafficking such as a digital scale, packaging materials, and razor blades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Richard Hull pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy and firearm charges and testified for the government at trial. In 2014, Hull began buying methamphetamine from Espinoza and his girlfriend, Claudia; they delivered two-pound quantities to Hull's residence. After Claudia moved to Mexico in 2015, Hull purchased from Espinoza directly, acquiring a pound of methamphetamine that summer. Special Agent Neily testified that three wiretapped conversations between Hull and Espinoza concerned\n   Hull's methamphetamine requirements and his ability to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jessica Moreno, Hull's live-in girlfriend, also pleaded guilty to a drug conspiracy charge and corroborated Hull's testimony. Moreno testified that, in a wiretapped call with a person she identified as Espinoza, she asked him to supply Hull a half-pound of methamphetamine. In another conversation, Espinoza instructed Moreno to have Hull meet him at a convenience store and pay what he owed Espinoza for methamphetamine. Moreno accompanied Hull to this meeting, and physical surveillance yielded a photo of Espinoza entering his car. Brandi Lopez, who pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy and firearm charges, testified that Espinoza supplied her a pound of methamphetamine every two to three days and once requested that she collect money Hull owed Espinoza for methamphetamine. Lopez sold to over 250 customers from the end of 2014 until her arrest in August 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To prove a conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, the government must prove an agreement to distribute methamphetamine that the defendant knew of and intentionally joined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088639\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/1139/#p1146\">\n    813 F.3d at 1146-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Evidence of multiple sales of resale quantities of drugs is sufficient in and of itself to make a submissible case of a conspiracy to distribute.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Espinoza argues the government's lack of direct evidence, such as controlled purchases from him or a wiretap on his phone, makes the evidence of his participation insufficient. But the government may prove a conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance through circumstantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Firearm Charge.\n   </em>\n   On August 24, 2015, while on traffic patrol, Council Bluffs Police Officer Ty Boldra stopped a black Mercedes traveling without a front license plate. A search of the driver, Manuel Espinoza, uncovered a pipe and 0.8 grams of methamphetamine in Espinoza's pockets, and Officer Boldra arrested Espinoza for possession of drug paraphernalia. An inventory search of Espinoza's car then discovered a firearm between the driver's seat and center console. Count 10 of the indictment charged Espinoza with violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2) and (3), which provide: \"It shall be unlawful for any person ... who is a fugitive from justice [or] ... who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance ... to ... possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury found Espinoza guilty of that charge. Espinoza argues the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the government's evidence was insufficient to show he was a fugitive from justice\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   an unlawful drug user when he possessed the firearm. If the evidence was sufficient to establish one of these alternative elements,\n   we need not consider the other. \"[W]hen a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive ... the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.\"\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

Moreover, Brandi Lopez testified that she used methamphetamine with Espinoza in August 2015; Hull and Moreno testified they would occasionally smoke methamphetamine with Espinoza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Alternatively, Espinoza argues the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. He asserts that \"[a] miscarriage of justice has occurred with the jury's verdict,\" presumably because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. \"Motions for new trials based on the weight of the evidence generally are disfavored, and the district court's authority to grant a new trial should be exercised sparingly and with caution.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As our brief summary of the trial evidence reflects, the verdict was not against the weight of this evidence. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Espinoza a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Suppression Issue (Espinoza)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Espinoza moved to suppress evidence seized during the August 24, 2015 traffic stop, arguing (i) Officer Boldra lacked probable cause for the initial stop; (ii) asking Espinoza to exit the vehicle and conducting a pat-down search unconstitutionally extended the traffic stop; and (iii) Espinoza did not voluntarily consent to the pat-down search. After an evidentiary hearing at which Officer Boldra testified, but Espinoza did not, the district court denied the motion, finding (i) there was probable cause to make a traffic stop when Boldra followed Espinoza's car because it lacked a front license plate and then observed its right rear brake light was not operating, as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20321.387\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 321.387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   requires; (ii) it was reasonable to ask Espinoza to sit in the police cruiser when he did not have a valid driver's license; and (iii) Espinoza voluntarily consented to a search that revealed a pipe and, after his arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia, 0.8 grams of methamphetamine. \"In considering the denial of a motion to suppress, we review the district court's factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This contention is without merit. An officer \"who observes a\n   traffic violation has probable cause to stop the vehicle and its driver.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Olivera-Mendez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733674\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/505/#p509\">\n    484 F.3d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509 (8th Cir. 2007). Boldra observed that Espinoza's rear brake light was not functioning, a violation of Iowa law. Boldra had probable cause to stop Espinoza's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (ii) Espinoza argues that Officer Boldra unconstitutionally extended the traffic stop when he requested that Espinoza accompany him to his cruiser, which was an unreasonable tactic designed to delve into subjects not related to the purpose of the stop. \"Once the officer makes the traffic stop, the officer may lawfully check the driver's license and registration, ask the driver about his destination and purpose, and request that the driver sit inside the patrol car.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, when Espinoza revealed that he lacked a valid driver's license, the request that he move to Boldra's cruiser was directly related to proper completion of the traffic stop because, without a license, Espinoza could not be permitted to drive his vehicle after the stop. Officer Boldra testified that he typically arrests the driver and impounds the vehicle when a stop reveals driver's license and equipment violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (iii) Finally, Espinoza argues Officer Boldra's pat-down search was unlawful because Espinoza did not voluntarily consent to the search. \"A search conducted pursuant to a valid consent is constitutionally permissible.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

When Espinoza had no valid driver's license, Boldra asked him to accompany Boldra to the police cruiser, intending to write traffic tickets. Espinoza agreed. Before Espinoza entered the cruiser, Boldra asked if Espinoza had any firearms or knives. Espinoza said no. Boldra then \"asked him if he would mind if I patted him down.\" In response, Espinoza lifted his arms parallel to the ground. Boldra asked if Espinoza would put his hand on the vehicle. In response, Espinoza \"turns around and puts his hands on the trunk of his car.\" Their conversation was in English, though Espinoza's English was \"broken\" and Boldra used hand gestures in communicating his requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During the pat-down search, Boldra felt a bulge in Espinoza's pocket that Boldra believed to be a glass pipe used for smoking drugs. Espinoza identified the object as a pipe, removed it from his own pocket, and placed it on his vehicle's trunk. Boldra arrested Espinoza for possessing drug paraphernalia, read him Miranda rights in English, resumed the search, and discovered 0.8 grams of methamphetamine in another pocket. Boldra requested police\n   backup, conducted an inventory search of Espinoza's car, and discovered the firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Officer Boldra testified that he routinely asks for consent to conduct a pat-down search before a person enters his police car to protect officer safety, a not unreasonable practice. In addition to saying \"no,\" it is easy for a person to respond with negative behavior to a request for consent to a pat-down search, for example, by folding one's arms to prevent the search. By contrast, Espinoza's response-raising his arms parallel to the ground-gave Officer Boldra a reasonable basis to believe Espinoza was consenting to the search, consistent with his cooperative response and demeanor during the traffic stop and reinforced by his willingness to place his hand on his vehicle's trunk, making access easier, and then retrieving the pipe from his pocket when Boldra asked what it was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Espinoza argues that, even if he consented to the search, his limited ability to speak and understand English rendered his consent involuntary. The district court found there was not \"any significant language barrier prevent[ing Espinoza] from voluntarily consenting to the pat-down search.\" Espinoza initiated a conversation in English before the stop, answered questions in English, and responded promptly to Boldra's commands and requests in English throughout their encounter. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we conclude the district court did not clearly err in finding that Espinoza voluntarily consented to the pat-down search.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Contreras,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9236716\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/974/#p977\">\n    372 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   977-78 ;\n   <em>\n    Cedano-Medina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9257941\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/682/#p688\">\n    366 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   687 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The contention is without merit. Espinoza's Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) recommended the enhancement, resulting in a total recommended offense level of 43. At sentencing, the district court\n   agreed with Espinoza's objection, declined to impose a role enhancement, and adjusted the total offense level to 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    B.

The district court varied downward and sentenced him to 300 months in prison.

Like the district court, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At trial, Diane Cervantes, Tizoc's self-described \"second mother,\" testified that Tizoc explained he laundered cash from his drug distribution operations by buying cars using drug proceeds, repairing them in Omaha, and exchanging them for drugs in Mexico. She testified that Tizoc would sometimes transport drug money to Mexico and receive shipments of Mexican-originated drugs. Tizoc argues other evidence conflicts with Cervantes's testimony-Joel Rodriguez Gomez, who worked at the Z Street garage, testified that an SUV delivered methamphetamine shipments to the garage and, on one occasion, he saw Tizoc provide the driver a suitcase containing cash. If he were paying with repaired cars in Mexico, as Cervantes testified, Tizoc argues, he would not have had to pay for the shipments.
