After stealing a firearm, he told his partner, Nicole Haberle, that he was going to commit suicide. When a police officer employed\n   by the Borough of Nazareth learned of that threat, he did not wait for trained crisis support professionals but instead knocked on the door of the apartment where Nixon was located and announced his presence. Nixon immediately shot himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ms. Haberle has sued, on her own behalf and also as the administrator of Nixon's estate, claiming that that police officer-Daniel Troxell-and other law enforcement officers, and the Borough, violated the Constitution as well as a variety of federal and state statutes. All of her claims were dismissed by the District Court, and she now appeals. Her primary argument is that Troxell unconstitutionally seized Nixon and that Nixon's suicide was the foreseeable result of a danger that Troxell created. She also argues that the Borough violated the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 213 (the \"ADA\"), by, among other things, failing to modify Borough policies, practices, and procedures to ensure that disabled individuals would have their needs met during interactions with the police. Although we recognize the grief borne by those who cared deeply for Mr. Nixon, we are nonetheless persuaded that the District Court was largely correct in its disposition of this case. But, because we conclude that Ms. Haberle should be given an opportunity to amend her complaint with respect to her ADA claim, we will affirm in part and vacate in part the District Court's rulings, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Timothy Nixon suffered from a variety of mental health problems, including depression. For years, he had lived off and on with his long-time partner, Ms. Haberle, and their two children. On May 20, 2013, he had \"a serious mental health episode involving severe depression.\" (Opening Br. at 6.) He called Haberle and told her that he was suicidal, and then broke into a friend's home and took a handgun. He next went to his cousin's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Fearing for Nixon's life, Haberle contacted the Borough of Nazareth Police Department. Officer Daniel Troxell obtained a warrant for Nixon's arrest, and, having learned that Nixon was still at his cousin's apartment, Troxell went there, accompanied by other officers from the Borough and surrounding municipalities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon arriving at the apartment, some of the officers suggested setting up a perimeter and asking the Pennsylvania State Police to send crisis negotiators. Others suggested asking Haberle to help communicate with Nixon. Troxell rebuffed those suggestions, calling the other officers \"a bunch of f[---]ing pussies.\" (App. at 7.) He declared his intention to immediately go to the apartment, because \"[t]his is how we do things in Nazareth.\" (App. at 7.) He did as he said, knocked on the door of the apartment, and identified himself as a police officer. Nixon then promptly went into one of the bedrooms of the apartment and turned the stolen gun on himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the suicide, Haberle sued Troxell, the other officers who were at the scene, the chief of police of Nazareth, the Mayor of Nazareth, and various members of the Borough Council, including the President and Vice-President, and the Borough of Nazareth itself. Her complaint, as\n   amended, included eleven counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants moved pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss the amended complaint, and that motion was granted. The District Court did not grant Haberle an opportunity to further amend her complaint, concluding that any additional amendment would be futile. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Haberle focuses on three arguments-two under provisions of the Constitution and one under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Specifically, she alleges that dismissal of her claims against Troxell was improper because Troxell's actions amounted to an unconstitutional seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. She also claims that Troxell's actions constituted a \"state-created danger\" in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, she argues that the Borough violated the ADA. None of those arguments is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Troxell's Actions Did Not Constitute an Improper Seizure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Police are entitled to \"knock and talk\" with people in a residence, and doing so is not a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Smith v.

There is no allegation that Troxell made intimidating remarks to Nixon or announced his presence in a threatening fashion.

Nixon had expressed suicidal tendencies and had stolen a deadly weapon. There was not time for casual deliberation. On the other hand, a few hours had passed since Nixon stole the gun and there was no indication that the situation was escalating or otherwise required instantaneous action by Troxell. Therefore, the District Court properly applied the intermediate standard and asked whether Troxell's actions showed conscious disregard of a great risk of harm to Nixon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The decision Troxell made to ignore the advice of other officers and knock on the apartment door falls beneath the threshold of conscious disregard. Haberle describes Troxell's actions as \"Ramboesque vigilantism,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Opening Br. at 24), but the fact that Troxell chose to immediately knock while other officers counseled waiting manifests only a disagreement over how to manage a risk, not a disregard of it. As the District Court noted, \"[u]nder the circumstances that the officers were confronting, any decision they could have made ... was not free from risk to Nixon, the other occupants of the apartment, or the officers.\" (App. at 16-17.) Nixon's suicide is surely tragic, and, in its aftermath \"it is natural to second-guess the decisions of Troxell,\" (App. at 17), but we cannot say that what he did shocks the conscience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

She argues that she is entitled to money damages because the Borough \"fail[ed] to make reasonable modifications to [its] policies, practices and procedures to ensure that [Nixon's] needs as an individual with a disability would be met.\" (App. at 87.) While we agree that, in general, the ADA applies to arrest situations, Haberle fails to state a claim for damages under that statute because she does not allege facts showing that any inaction of the Borough reflects deliberate indifference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    1.
