(\"Accuracy\"). The lawsuit sought unpaid contributions owed under the contracts governing the benefit plans that the Trusts managed for Accuracy. The Trusts argue that, pursuant to those contracts, the unpaid contributions were trust assets over which Lamek and Marshall exercised control and that the Trusts therefore could sue the individuals as fiduciaries to collect those contributions. We agree with the district court that\n   <em>\n    Bos v.

Accuracy was a party to two Master Labor Agreements (\"MLAs\") that required it to contribute to the Trusts from 2007 to 2011 and 2013 to 2015 to provide employee benefits, including health insurance and pensions. In addition, each Trust was governed by its own Trust Agreement, which purported to treat unpaid contributions as trust assets. For example, a document governing the Glazing Health and Welfare Fund stated\n   that \"monies (whether paid, unpaid, segregated, or otherwise traceable, or not) become Trust Fund assets on the Due Date.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This dispute arose when the Trusts alleged that Accuracy failed to make payments required by the MLAs. The Trusts filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, asserting claims against Lamek and Marshall, including for breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those claims were initially dismissed, but, after amendment, the fiduciary duty claim survived a second motion to dismiss. After\n   <em>\n    Bos I\n   </em>\n   was decided, however, Lamek and Marshall filed a motion for reconsideration of their second motion to dismiss in light of that decision. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the fiduciary duty claim, reasoning that, under\n   <em>\n    Bos I\n   </em>\n   , \"an employer's contractual requirement to contribute to an employee benefits trust fund\" does not make it a \"fiduciary of unpaid contributions,\" and that therefore \"Lamek and Marshall are not subject to fiduciary liability under ERISA\" for the unpaid contributions at issue.
