The merchandise consists of black wrought iron chandeliers which were classified as illuminating articles, other, under item 653.40 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) and assessed a duty at 19 per centum ad valorem.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The importer contends the merchandise is properly classifiable under item 688.40, TSUS, which provides for electrical articles and electrical parts of articles, not specially provided for, dutiable at 11.5 per centum ad valorem.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">THE STATUTES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">Tariff Schedules of the United States</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Y\">Schedule 6, Part 3, Subpart F:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">Subpart F Headnotes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">1.

(iv), and which are properly classifiable as electric articles, not specially provided for within item 688.40, as contended by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-24\">It was stipulated by the parties that the merchandise consists of black wrought iron chandeliers which illuminate, are composed of base metal, and come equipped with wire and fixtures enabling operation by electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-25\">The court below, in a long and thorough opinion by Chief Judge Rao, reviewed the legislative history and Congressional intent concerning the statutes here involved, and we do not deem it necessary to repeat the same since we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>conclude that the decision and judgment are correct. We therefore adopt the holding of the lower court as stated in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">In view of what we conceive to be the legislative intent to perpetuate all prior distinctions between lighting fixtures and electrical articles, we find no merit in the contention of plaintiff that the illuminating articles provisions of schedule 6, part 3, subpart F, should be construed as relating to nonelectrical lighting equipment and that all electrical illuminating articles not specifically enumerated in part 5 are electrical articles not specially provided for. So radical a departure from preexisting concepts must surely require a more explicit expression upon the part of Congress than the language invoked by plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag1\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-26\">.
