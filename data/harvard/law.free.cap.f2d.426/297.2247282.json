Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 8306 et seq. (1967), for an injury he allegedly sustained while working in the course of his employment. Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 8307, \u00a7 5 (1967); Commercial Standard Insurance Co. v. Cotton, Tex.Civ.App., 1969, 443 S.W.2d 423, 426. Defendant is the workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier for plaintiff\u2019s employer. After a trial to the court, the District Judge granted a judgment in favor of Vasquez in the amount of $10,244.45. Earlier, Vasquez had had a hearing before the Industrial Accident Board for the State of Texas. The Board had awarded Vasquez $140 based upon his claim. From the judgment of the District Court, the insurer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-24\">The single question presented on this appeal is whether the District Court\u2019s finding that the injury about which Vasquez complained in this suit was the same as the injury providing the basis for his claim before the Industrial Accident Board, so as to entitle Vasquez to a judgment under the Work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>men\u2019s Compensation Act, Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat.Ann. art. 8307 \u00a7 5 (1967); e. g., Huff v. Insurance Company of North America, Tex.Civ.App., 1965, 394 S.W.2d 849, 852, was clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fed. R.Civ.P. 52(a). After a careful review of the record, we are unable to conclude that this determination was wrong. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court. Cf. United States for Use and Benefit of Citizens National Bank of Orlando v. Stringfellow, 5 Cir., 1969, 414 F.2d 696, 699; Chaney v. City of Galveston, 5 Cir., 1966, 368 F.2d 774, 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-13\">. We have concluded on the merits that this case is of the character that does not justify oral argument. Therefore, we have directed the Clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties of this action in writing. 5 Cir.R. 18; see Huth v. Southern Pacific Co., 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526, 527-530; Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, 805-808.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
