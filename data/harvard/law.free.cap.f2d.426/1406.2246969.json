The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board dismissed the notice of opposition with opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1495-6\"> The board found that the third party registrations of record are themselves sufficient to establish that the word \u201cJohn\u201d has been so frequently used as a part of distilled beverage marks that it is incapable of indicating origin in any one source and that the substantial good will in the mark \u201cLONG JOHN\u201d acquired by appellant over years of use and promotion resides in the unitary mark. Further, the board was of opinion that, considered in their entireties, the differences in sound, appearance and commercial impression of the two marks are obvious and one is in no way suggestive of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-7\">We agree with, approve and adopt the opinion of the board, and its decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1495-9\">.
