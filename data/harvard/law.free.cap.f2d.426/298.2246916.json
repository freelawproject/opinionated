This question involves alleged coercion as well as a violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights due appellant under Miranda v. Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The district court did not err in admitting the statements. The evidence as to claimed coercion is such as not to require a contrary ruling, and the Miranda claim is frivolous. There are no facts whatever to support appellant\u2019s contention that his Miranda rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-25\">. We dispose of this ease on the briefs and record, without oral agument, as provided by our Local Rule 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
