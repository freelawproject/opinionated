We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1434-31\">Harbolt, represented by court appointed counsel, was convicted upon his plea of guilty of fraud by wire, a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>In his motion to vacate sentence Harbolt alleged that his counsel was ineffective because he had no experience in federal court and was unable to prepare a defense; that counsel could not defend two men (Harbolt and a co-defendant) who had conflicting interests; and that venue was not properly laid in the Middle District of Florida where the trial took place. The District Court, finding that the guilty plea was voluntarily and understanding^ entered, also found no merit to Harbolt\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-4\">The record does not bear out the assertions that defense counsel was unfamiliar with federal rules and procedures. In fact, the contrary is clearly evident. A plea of not guilty was entered at arraignment. Three weeks later Harbolt changed his plea to guilty. The District Court made a searching inquiry that fully indicated that defense counsel had advised Harbolt about the offense charged and the maximum penalty that could be imposed. Harbolt not only failed to allege that he had a defense but affirmatively stated in open court that he did not. A month later, at the time of sentencing, counsel pointed out to the court circumstances tending to mitigate punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">Harbolt\u2019s allegations that the District Court did not dispose of the issue raised by him concerning the conflicting interests of Harbolt and his co-defendant are entirely conclusory in nature and state no facts upon which relief could be granted. In any event, since \u201cthe guilty plea was voluntary the appellant must be said to have waived the conflict of interest theory.\u201d Martin v. United States, 5 Cir. 1958, 256 F.2d 345, cert. denied 358 U.S. 921, 79 S.Ct. 294, 3 L.Ed.2d 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-6\">Harbolt\u2019s challenge of the venue of the trial is also without merit. As the District Court found, Harbolt \u201cwas apprehended in Tampa, Florida, in the act of receiving electronic equipment which was the subject matter of a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by telephone communication between Macon, Georgia, and Chicago, Illinois. Venue was properly laid in the Middle District of Florida.\u201d See 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3237.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"Abz\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1434-17\">. Pursuant to our Rule 18 this case is decided without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
