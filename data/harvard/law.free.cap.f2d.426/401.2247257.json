The mark is displayed on special pumps, called \u201cblending pumps,\u201d at appellant\u2019s service stations. The application is designated a continuation of an earlier application filed July 13, 1961, in which registration on the Principal Register was sought for the same mark for gasoline and refused by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board on the ground that the mark was merely a descriptive connotation to purchasers of applicant\u2019s goods.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">In his Answer, the examiner predicated refusal of registration on the ground that CUSTOM-BLENDED is merely descriptive of appellant\u2019s goods within the meaning of section 2(e) (1) because it is so highly descriptive of appellant\u2019s blended gasoline that it is incapable of becoming distinctive as claimed. It was the examiner\u2019s opinion that the term CUSTOM-BLENDED merely informs purchasers that various grades of gasoline from appellant\u2019s blending pumps are custom blended for them; that the word \u201ccustom\u201d is commonly used to indicate things made to order; that it has very little trademark significance when used in connection with blended gasoline; that appellant is not entitled to exclusive appropriation of this term, which so aptly describes custom-blended gasoline; and that the conclusion derived from surveys conducted by appellant is that purchasers who are acquainted with appellant\u2019s Blue Sunoco gasoline know that such gasoline is custom blended.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">In affirming refusal of registration, the board stated that granted that the generic terms for appellant\u2019s blended gasolines are pump-blended and multplegrade gasolines, there is no question that \u201c\u2018CUSTOM-BLENDED\u2019 has a merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>descriptive significance in that it will immediately indicate to patrons of applicant\u2019s service stations that the various grades of gasoline dispensed thereat are custom blended to their needs and requirements\u201d; that in view thereof and the decision on applicant\u2019s prior application, it was incumbent upon applicant to show that the facts and circumstances since that decision have changed in that \u201c \u2018CUSTOM-BLENDED\u2019 now serves as an indication of origin of applicant\u2019s gasoline to the general public\u201d; that the case, therefore, turned upon the sufficiency of applicant\u2019s evidence in that regard; that \u201cthe only definite conclusion that can be drawn from the surveys is that purchasers who are acquainted with applicant\u2019s \u2018SUNOCO\u2019 gasoline know that such gasoline is custom blended\u201d; that this manifestly does not support applicant\u2019s assertion that CUSTOM-BLEND has acquired a secondary meaning as an indication of origin for gasoline, and that upon the record presented CUSTOM-BLENDED does not possess anything \u201cother than a descriptive significance to purchasers of gasoline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We have given a synoptic analysis of the board\u2019s able, well-considered and exhaustive opinion without reiterating essential facts of record. These facts are detailed in their essence and relevancy and supportive of the board\u2019s conclusions so clearly and aptly enunciated in its decision. We, therefore, incorporate herein by reference the opinion of the board and affirm its refusal of registration. The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-17\">. Serial No. 211,939 filed February 12, 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AiM\">. In re Sun Oil Company, 144 USPQ 103 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b491-7\">RICH, Acting Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ASBU\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">I agree with the result reached by the majority which is supported by an opinion largely relying on and incorporating by reference the opinion of the board. While I do not disagree with anything said in the majority\u2019s opinion, I do not accord the survey evidence, by which it was attempted to show \u201csecondary meaning,\u201d the significance apparently accorded it by the board. The examiner accorded it none. I do not agree with the board\u2019s statement that \u201cThis case turns upon the sufficiency of applicant\u2019s evidence\u201d of \u201csecondary meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The examiner in this case was of the view, as the board reported, that CUSTOM-BLENDED \u201cis so <em>highly </em>descriptive of applicant\u2019s blended gasoline that it is <em>incapable </em>of becoming distinctive as claimed.\u201d (My emphasis.) If that is so, registration must be refused under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(e) (1) no matter what evidence of alleged \u201csecondary meaning\u201d is adduced; in other words, under the facts of this case the law proscribes the <em>possibility </em>of a de jure \u201csecondary meaning,\u201d notwithstanding the existence of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(f) and a de facto \u201csecondary meaning.\u201d In re Deister Concentrator Co,, 289 F.2d 496, 48 CCPA 952, 963 et seq. (1961), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"Avfb\">In my opinion, CUSTOM-BLENDED is so highly descriptive that it cannot, under the law, be accorded trademark rights even though at some times, or to some people, or in some places, it has a de facto secondary meaning. My view was expressed by the examiner. I think that conclusively disposes of the matter. While I see no objection to pointing out &gt;to appellant that its evidence has not established \u201csecondary meaning,\u201d I am unwilling to lead appellant or others to think that the fault was in the quantity or quality of its evidence rather than in the descriptiveness of the words sought to be registered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>should not be encouraged to try again to prove \u201csecondary meaning.\u201d The only particular in which I do not fully agree with the examiner is that he said the word \u201ccustom\u201d in CUSTOM-BLENDED \u201chas very little trademark significance.\u201d I think it has none.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Appellant has argued that the descriptive term for its gasoline is \u201cpump-blended.\u201d I do not question that that is <em>a </em>descriptive \u2014 or as appellant calls it \u201cgeneric\u201d \u2014 term; but a product may have more than one generically descriptive name. Because one merchandiser has latched onto one of the descriptive terms does not mean it can force its competitors to limit themselves to the use of the others, which appellant, it seems to me, is trying to do here. <em>All </em>of the generic names for a product belong in the public domain. The product itself, for example, is called gasoline in the United States but petrol in England. Clearly both of those names must remain free of proprietary claims, in either country. So it is, in my view, with respect to pump-blended and custom-blended. The examiner stated the factual basis for this view in pointing out that \u201ccustom,\u201d as in custom-built, custom-service,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> custom-cut, custom-made, custom-tailored, custom-work, etc., merely indicates that it is done according to the customer\u2019s desire. That is exactly how appellant\u2019s gasolines are pump-blended \u2014 to give the customer what he asks for. I can think of no descriptive term which is more apt. In re Bailey Meter Co., 102 F.2d 843, 26 CCPA 1136 (1939).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-12\">. I think the solicitor erred in arguing the ease solely on the basis that the only issue before us is the sufficiency of applicant\u2019s evidence to show that CUSTOM-BLENDED now serves as an indication of origin. That was not the examiner\u2019s ground of rejection. It does not appear to me that the board ever made a different one and the examiner\u2019s refusal to register was affirmed. At best, the sufficiency of the evidence is a second-string argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\">. I take judicial notice that, as anyone can observe on the streets of Washington, if one looks past the CUSTOM-BLENDED pumps of a Sunoco station at the front of the apparently standard service station building, one sees the words CUSTOM SERVICE in red letters a foot high across the white front of the building.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b492-5\">FISHER, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ALCb\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"A_e\">Under the doctrine of \u201csecondary meaning,\u201d a trademark, though originally descriptive of a type of product, is nonetheless entitled to registration if the mark has, by association with a business, come primarily to identify its user, rather than the product, to that part of the public interested in contracting with the trademark user. Application of Automatic Radio Mfg. Co., 404 F.2d 1391, 56 CCPA 817 (1969). Whether a descriptive mark has acquired secondary meaning depends upon the particular facts of each case. W. E. Bassett Co. v. Revlon, Inc., 354 F.2d 868 (2d Cir., 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Briefly, it has been shown that appellant has used the mark in question for its gasoline exclusively and continuously over a period of some twelve years. There is evidence of extensive advertising o.f and sales of large volumes of gasoline under that mark during this period. Surveys of record suggest that in at least two areas where there are other marketers of multi-grade, pump-blended gasoline, the term CUSTOM-BLENDED is associated in the public mind with this appellant in a preponderance which can only be accounted for by recognition of origin. There is no evidence which would imply that the mark is of such a descriptive nature that granting trademark rights therein to the user would deprive others of their right to normal use of the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">In light of these facts, it is respectfully submitted that the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board should be reversed and registration granted on the basis that the mark CUSTOM-BLENDED has acquired secondary meaning within Section 2(f) of the Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(f)).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
