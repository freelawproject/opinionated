This irradiated wood-plastic combination, or \u201calloy\u201d as it was called, was named \u201cnovawood\u201d by the A.E.C. which then, in July of 1964, asked the Commissioner of Patents to place that name on file in the Trademark Division for search purposes, \u201cto be cited against applications for registration of trademarks,\u201d as the request stated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was so placed on file. The A.E.C. then released publicity on nova-wood and solicited proposals for the design of a large-scale pilot plant to make it. Lawrence G. Barrett, president of opposer, being familiar with the project, decided to form a corporation to commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>cialize novawood and organized American Novawood Corporation. Members of the A.E.C. are said to have expressed pleasure at his willingness to accept and use the term novawood. In the latter part of 1964, opposer proceeded with its plans and distributed brochures and samples of the product to the wood-fabricating industry. The samples were stamped with the name novawood and a mark adopted by opposer which consisted of a rectangular, wood-grained panel occupied by the name in capital letters and with zig-zag lines having arrow heads pointing at the opposite ends of the panel, indicative of irradiation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">United States Plywood, upon learning of the situation, called the attention of the A.E.C. to its family of \u201cNOVO\u201d marks and on January 12, 1965, the A.E.C. requested that the name novawood be withdrawn from the files of the Trademark Division, putting out a press release on the same day in which it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARf\">These [wood-plastic] combinations heretofore have been called \u201cnova-wood.\u201d As explained later, use of that term has been discontinued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-5\">Use of the term \u201cnovawood,\u201d previously employed by the Commission to describe these radiation processed wood-plastic combinations, is being discontinued to avoid any possible confusion with proprietary terms used in industry and to assure that this new product enters the market place free from discord that might inhibit its use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">As above noted, United States Plywood had begun using its NO VO WOOD mark three days earlier on January 9, 1965, applied for registration within a month, and this opposition ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">While this was going on, United States Plywood was also petitioning the Commissioner of Patents, questioning the practice of placing generic names in its trademark search files and objecting to the presence there of the name novawood. This petition was denied but on a request for reconsideration after the A.E.C. had requested that the name be withdrawn, on February 3, 1965, the First Assistant Commissioner noted in a supplemental opinion that the request to withdraw had been granted, which disposed of the matter. <em>United States Plywood, </em>supra, note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">The board found, and the record appears to support the finding, that after the A.E.C.\u2019s dropping of the name nova-wood,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-13\">* * * the designation WPC (meaning wood-plastic combination) has been used in lieu of \u201cnovawood\u201d by writers in articles as the name for the wood product developed under the sponsorship of the Atomic Energy Commission. One company, other than opposer, indicated that it had adopted \u201cLockwood\u201d as a name for this product. It does not appear that any company but applicant [opposer?] refers to this product by the term \u201cnova-wood\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-16\">* * * Apparently the trade, excepting opposer, has recognized applicant\u2019s rights by dropping \u201cnova-wood\u201d as a name and substituting \u201cWPC\u201d or some different designation therefor. In fact we note that op-poser is not wholly consistent since it too has used in correspondence \u201cWPC\u201d as a generic name. We recognize that a product may have more than one name but opposer apparently is the only one using \u201cnovawood\u201d as a name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-17\">On the basis of the foregoing factual situation, the board dismissed the opposition on the ground that opposer could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>be legally damaged by the registration of NOVOWOOD to applicant. The sole issue is whether it erred in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">We do not find that the opposer raises any substantial issue as to any of the foregoing facts. As we view the matter, the basic question is whether applicant, United States Plywood, has a right to register NOVOWOOD which is superior to opposer\u2019s asserted right to prevent registration, which opposer predicates on prior use of novawood as a generic name and as a trade name, relying on section 2(d) of the statute (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d)). On the first point, while it is clear that opposer (and others) used novawood as a name prior to applicant\u2019s use of NOVOWOOD, and attempted to make a generic name of it, that attempt failed, and was bound to fail, in view of applicant\u2019s admittedly prior rights in the mark NOVOPLY for the same goods, together with a half-dozen other \u201cNOVO\u201d marks for other wood products. As the board pointed out, applicant was selling $20,000,000 worth of particle board under the trademark NOVOPLY in the year 1965. If applicant wished to expand its line or extend its family of \u201cNOVO\u201d marks to include NOVOWOOD products, as it has done, we cannot see that the short-lived attempt of the A.E.C. and opposer to constitute novawood as a generic name could prevent it. We think that, on the facts, applicant had the right and that it is superior to any right opposer has shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">With respect to opposer\u2019s reliance on section 2(d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> opposer relies on the confusion provision and the similarity of novawood, the name, and NOVOWOOD, the trademark. We point out, however, that novawood is not \u201ca mark\u201d and is not asserted as such. Opposer asserts it only as a generic name which it has the right to use along with other members of the public. It is not seen how applicant\u2019s use of NOVOWOOD as a trademark alongside the use of novawood by others as a generic name could create any confusion as to the source of the goods. The <em>name </em>novawood, if a name, could not indicate origin in anyone. As to reliance on the trade name provision, op-poser\u2019s trade name is The American Novawood Corporation, not Novawood Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">The manner in which the board approached its decision in its opinion has given rise to opposer\u2019s principal argument. The board made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-11\">The continued use by opposer of \u201cnovawood\u201d is in contradiction to applicant\u2019s prior rights in \u201cNOVOPLY\u201d and opposer is therefore not entitled to the use thereof. Accordingly, op-poser could not be legally damaged by the registration of \u201cNOVOWOOD\u201d to applicant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Opposer argues that this was plainly a ruling <em>on infringement </em>of applicant\u2019s rights in NOVOPLY, a mark different from that sought to be registered, by opposer\u2019s use of novawood, and that this was beyond the statutory jurisdiction of the board. Opposer, at oral argument, charged the board with turning the opposition upside down. Opposer says, in effect, that the board was without \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to decide whether applicant\u2019s rights are <em>superior </em>to those of opposer because to do so is to adjudicate infringement; it complains that United States Plywood has not sued for infringement and therefore opposer has not had the opportunity to present all the defenses which would be possible in an infringement suit. It urges that the board must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>be reversed because the sole basis for its decision was an adjudication of \u201cApplicant\u2019s rights stemming from the earlier NOVOPLY trademark use and registration * * We see no merit in the argument. In a case such as this, the board is obliged to consider which party has the superior rights and to consider all of the relevant facts bearing thereon. Because one decision the board must make is the same as would be made by a court of general jurisdiction in an infringement suit does not mean it is precluded from making it. It is not adjudicating infringement in the sense of imposing any liability on opposer. All that is being decided here is whether applicant is entitled to a registration. If opposer has any defenses or rights which it could assert if sued on the NOVOPLY or NOVOWOOD marks, which it has not brought forward in this proceeding, it will still have them in the event of an infringement suit and can oppose them to the merely prima facie rights applicant will get from its registration. Clearly the board has jurisdiction to decide whether applicant should get such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">Opposer\u2019s next argument is that whether applicant\u2019s prior ownership and registration of NOVOPLY gives it rights superior to the rights of opposer in nova-wood is an issue which applicant failed to plead. We see no merit in this contention. The purpose of pleadings is to apprise a party by fair notice of the case it has to meet. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (F.R.C.P.), on which opposer is relying, reject the approach that pleading is a game of skill. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). Opposer had fair notice. The file of the opposed application, with which opposer was of course familiar, contains a requirement by the examiner \u201cthat claim should be made of record to its \u2018Novo\u2019 prefix registrations\u201d by applicant, to which applicant responded by an amendment making of record its NOVOPLY, NOVOWALL, NOVIDOR, NOVOCORE, NOVOTILE, NOVODOR, and NOVOTEX registrations. After the Notice of Opposition was filed, applicant filed a Motion to Dismiss in which reference was made to these registrations, asserting that in <em>op-poser\u2019s </em>pending application (see note 3, supra) a rejection had been based on them. Testimony of applicant\u2019s witnesses was taken with respect to its use of NOVOPLY and other \u201cNOVO\u201d marks without objection that it related to issues not raised by the pleadings. See F.R.C.P. 15(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Lastly, opposer asserts that the evidence does not justify the board\u2019s findings. Having reviewed the record, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">The concept of \u201cdamage\u201d from a trademark registration as it arises in opposition proceedings is often a difficult one to come to grips with. In this opposition it seems to take on a rather unusual twist. Opposer, in the posture of its business as it was when the record was made in 1966, was undoubtedly feeling damaged by disturbance of its belief that it was secure in the use of the name novawood that the A.E.C. had led it to think was generic and free for use by all; and at the same time United States Plywood was also feeling damaged by this very thought, foreseeing encroachment on rights attaching to its considerable family of \u201cNOVO\u201d trademarks by the possible development of a NOVA \u2014 generic name in the wood-products field. We come back to what we deem to be the only possible solution in such a situation \u2014a decision as to who has the <em>superior </em>right and hence the greater damage. The other party must yield, even though, as a practical matter, it is not entirely without damage or the possibility thereof. In this sense, then we accept the conclusion of the board that opposer \u201ccould not be <em>legally </em>damaged\u201d (emphasis ours).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Section 13 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1063), which provides for opposition to registration on the principal register, permits anyone \u201cwho believes that he would be damaged by the registration\u201d to oppose. But it does not require proof of dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>age as a condition to the sustaining of the opposition nor does it provide that anyone who shows that he will be damaged by the registration will necessarily succeed in preventing registration. This case and many others do not permit of syllogistic resolution by mere application of statutory language to the facts. If \u201cdamage\u201d be the touchstone, which we seriously doubt, then it is necessary as the board did, to qualify the term by the adjective \u201clegal\u201d when deciding that a party who clearly may suffer from the decision in its economic affairs is not going to be \u201cdamaged.\u201d This is the old legal concept expressed in the phrase <em>damnum, absque injuria, </em>loss, hurt, or harm without injury in the <em>legal </em>sense, redressible by an action. It is a matter of balancing rights and determining whose are superior; that done, the problem is solved. If it must be expressed in terms of damage, then it is appropriate to say that the loser is not \u201clegally damaged,\u201d as the board did, but we see no necessity for going beyond a conclusion as to which party has the superior right.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The decision of the board dismissing the opposition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-25\">.
