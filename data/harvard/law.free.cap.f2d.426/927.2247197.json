Accordingly, we have directed the Clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties of this fact in writing. See Huth v. Southern Pacific Co., 5 Cir.1969, 417 F. 2d 526; Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir.1969, 409 F.2d 804; 5th Cir. R. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-19\">On this direct criminal appeal, Miguel Coronado, Jr. argues (1) that there was no probable cause for his warrantless arrest, (2) that the trial judge's comments to the jury prejudiced his right to a fair trial, and (3) that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 is unconstitutional. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-20\">February 11, 1969, Gilbert Lee, Senior Patrol Inspector, United States Border Patrol, received a telephone call from a confidential informer. The informer told Lee that he had been approached by a person hired by a heroin supplier to arrange for the transportation of a quantity of heroin from Mexico to Houston, Texas. Lee in turn relayed this information to Ramiro Villarreal, a United States Customs Agent. February 12, Lee and Villarreal met the informer who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>had in his possession a package later identified as heroin. The informer stated that his instructions were to proceed to Houston, call a certain telephone number, and deliver the package to the person he had telephoned. Agent Villarreal then called the Houston office to inform the agents there of these developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Agent Villarreal and the informer arrived in Houston on February 13 and proceeded to the Customs Office where they made a duplicate package containing only a small quantity of heroin. While there, he learned that the telephone number the informer was to call was that of the defendant-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">At 8:00 o\u2019clock on the evening of February 13, the informer, from a telephone booth, called Coronado. After completing his conversation, the informer stated that Coronado would arrive in a yellow taxi cab, approximately two blocks from the telephone booth. Within minutes, a team of agents that had been stationed near the defendant-appellant\u2019s residence reported that Coronado had left his home and entered a yellow taxi cab, number 346. Shortly thereafter, that same taxi cab appeared at the designated meeting place. The person in the taxi opened the door and the informant with the duplicate package concealed in a newspaper went into the cab. Less than a minute later the informer left the taxi with only the newspaper in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">The agents allowed the taxi to proceed for a few blocks, then stopped it and arrested Coronado. He was later indicted for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 and 26 U. S.C. \u00a7 4704.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">Coronado argues, on appeal as he did below, that the arresting officers did not have knowledge sufficient to amount to probable cause to believe that he had committed an offense and therefore the arrest and the search that followed were illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-15\">This Court has recently stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-16\">In applying the standard of probable cause we determine whether \u201c[t]he arresting officers * * * possess knowledge of facts and circumstances gained from reasonably trustworthy sources of information sufficient to justify a man of reasonable caution and prudence in believing that the arrested person has committed or is committing an offense. Miller v. United States, 5 Cir.1966, 356 F.2d 63, 66, cert. denied, 384 U.S. 912, 86 S.Ct. 1357, 16 L.Ed.2d 365, Henry v. United States, 1959, 361 U.S. 98, 102, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134, 138.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-17\">United States v. Trabucco, 5 Cir.1970, 424 F.2d 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-18\">On the facts this case presents, the arresting officers could reasonably believe that Coronado was in the process of committing a narcotic violation. The realiability and trustworthiness of the informer were clearly established by the district court. United States v. Cabrera, 5 Cir. 1969,417 F.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-19\">Coronado\u2019s second point focuses on the district court\u2019s action in introducing three young men to the jury. It is argued that the judge\u2019s remarks concerning these three men prejudiced Coronado\u2019s case in that the comments impressed the jury with the district court\u2019s own belief that Coronado was not \u201cone of the good young people [of] today\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is an unwarranted inference. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>young men were simply spectators at the trial. The remarks were not directed at Coronado and did not cast a shadow on Coronado\u2019s character. These were young men; Coronado was 42 years old. There was no necessary reflection on the defendant. Although we do not view with approval this casual conduct of the trial, we find no harmful error on the part of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Coronado\u2019s last argument that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 is unconstitutional is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Turner v. United States, 1970, 396 U.S. 398, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 and this Court\u2019s decisions in United States v. Duke, 5 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 387; Jimenez v. United States, 5 Cir. 1970, 421 F.2d 1401.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">.
