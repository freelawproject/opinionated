on a judgment, as security for Henry, or that there were not assets to pay ; but avers, that in a settlement of accounts between said estates, a large balance was found due from said Nasworthy to said Henry, which balance was collected by Davis and never accounted for, as defendant believes, but, if not collected, is still due and owing the estate of Henry Hunter. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-11\">Avers, thatj many of the debts said Davis alleges he paid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Henry Hunter\u2019s estate, were contracted since the removal of Yerby from the administration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-5\">Avers, that on the last account of Davis with the Orphans\u2019 Court, a large item for interest is allowed on account of advances made in payment of debts, which ought not to be allowed, because he at all times had sufficient funds to pay said debts ; she denies the correctness of said accounts, and calls upon him to produce the vouchers-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-6\">Avers, that Daw is has never made a final settlement of his accounts with said estate, and that, when he does, he will be found largely indebted to said estate, as she believes ; she makes an exhibit of the record of the proceedings in support of all her statements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-7\">She admits, that after the death of her husband, she never rendered an account of his administration, as her husband was removed before he had fully administered upon any part of the estate ; but, as far as he had administered, had rendered an account of his actings and doings, by returning an inventory and account of sales, and all the assets, thus remaining unadministered, were delivered to said Davis, and she has never been cited <em>to </em>render any further account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-8\">x That for all the matters claimed in this suit, Davis sued her at law, and a final judgment was rendered against him in the Supreme Court, which she insists on as a bar ; she also makes her answer a demurrer, and asks leave to rest on her demurrer at the hearing of the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-9\">No proof was taken by either party, and the case was submitted for final decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-10\"><em>Henderson, </em>for complainant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-11\"><em>Winchester, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-12\">Complainant\u2019s claim to call Yerby to an account for a maladministration of the estate of Henry Hunter, in taking insufficient security for the purchase-money of lands and personal property, sold under the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, is based solely upon two facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-13\">1st. That Davis, as administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>has paid debts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>of the estate of Henry Hunter, to an amount of $2635-92, beyond the assets which ever came to his hands. That he paid, under an expectation that he could collect, out of the botes, &amp;c., delivered to him by the former administrator, enough to pay all the debts j but that, owing to the maladministration of Yerby., these notes, &amp;c., turn out to be insufficient to indemnify him for the debts he paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-5\">2d. That there is also a debt due Nasworthy Hunter, of $2311-36, with interest from the 31st of January, 1833, from the estate of Henry Hunter, which has not been paid, because there are no assets to pay, for the, same reason of maladministration on the part of Yerby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-6\">Suppose these facts existed, could Davis, as a creditor of the-estate of Henry Hunter for debts paid by him as administrator <em>de bonis </em>non, beyond assets which came to his hands, and for a debt due him as administrator of Nasworthy Hunter from the estate-of Henry Hunter, come into a court of chancery to charge Yerbjf with maladministration, waste, and embezzlement, in taking insufficient security for property sold ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-7\">2d. But it is denied the estate \u00f3f Hunter is indebted to Davis-,, for debts paid by him beyond assets which came to his hands, or that, in the settlement of the accounts between the estate of Henry Hunter and Nasworthy Hunter, the estate was indebted to Nasworthy ; but on the contrary, that Nasworthy, on said settlement,, was indebted to the estate the difference between $6675, which, Davis admits he received for him, and $2311-36, for which difference Davis has never accounted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-8\">In May, 1825, Davis admitted claims and assets in his hands,, to the amount of $28,681-57, deducting $6674-73, due from Nasworthy Hunter for property which the heirs agreed to take back,, but which it seems Nasworthy Hunter afterwards paid Dav.is.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-9\">What became of all these assets ? Davis has never reported-. them desperate or doubtful; on the contrary, he admits in his bill, he expected to collect, them. But he has only in his last account accounted for $12,828-52, and he only has charged the estate with debts, expenses, and all other charges, to the amount of $16,232, to which, if the debt claimed to be due Nasworthy Hunter were added, it would be less than $19,000, leaving,a balance of more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>$10,000 in the hands of Davis, unaccounted for, beyond all debts due from the estate, up to the 30th of June, 1830, after an administration of 7 years. No final account has as yet ever been rendered by Davis, and, admitting the accounts he has already settled to be correct, which is disputed, upon a final settlement, he must show an amount of more than $10,000 in his hands due to the heirs upon his own showing, and upon the face of the record, filed as an exhibit by Mrs. Yerby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-4\">It is plain, then, that if Yerby has been guilty of maladministration, and could be held to account in chancery for maladministration, he is not accountable to Davis, but solely to the heirs and distributees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-5\">3rd. But there is no maladministration, embezzlement, default, or waste, on the part of Yerby, in not paying the debts, or in taking insufficient security. Yerby was removed before he had the means to pay a debt, and everything was delivered into the hands of Davis, administrator <em>de bonis non. </em>The inventory, returned by Davis, shows he had received all the assets of the estate <em>; </em>all that Yerby could be called upon for, would be thcamount of his purchase at the sale of the estate. For that he is entitled, as an offset to his commissions, which would be more than the amount. This can furnish no ground to come into chancery, even by a person having a right to call him to account. If any one has a claim against him for this sum, it is the present administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>Thomas Hunter.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-6\"><em>Boyd, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b506-7\">Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"ADg2\">The complainant seeks by his bill to set up two claims, which he desires to enforce against the defendant; one in his private capacity, as a creditor of the estate of Henry Hunter, for money paid by him as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of that estate, over and above the assets of the estate that came into his hands as such administrator ; he having discharged more of the debts of that estate than there were <em>assets </em>in his hands to be administered. The other claim which he seeks to establish, is, in his character of administrator of the estate of Nasworthy Hunter, to whose estate he alleges the estate of Henry Hunter is now indebted.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The hill states, that Thomas Hunter is the present administrator of Henry Hunter, deceased, but does not make him a party to the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The defendant, as executrix of her deceased husband, denies all the allegations of the complainant\u2019s bill; asserts that her testator fully discharged his duties as administrator of Henry Hunter; and, while she insists upon the judgment in the suit at law brought by the administrator of Henry Hunter against her, in bar of the claims here attempted to be set up, she also relies upon her demurrer to the bill, which she has made part of her answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Neither party has taken any proof: I am, therefore, compell\u00e9d to decide the cause from the facts, as they are developed by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">It is clear, that Davis has no right to call for an account or a settlement from the defendant, except for'the purpose and to the extent of making available the two claims which he holds, one in his own right, and the other as administrator of Nasworthy Hunter. But can he do this ? can he press either of these claims to a settlement, without making the present administrator of Henry Hunter a party? What is he seeking to do ? It is, so far as his cl\u00e1im against the estate of Henry Hunter <em>is concernedr to coerce out of the </em>defendant a debt due to him by that estate ; and he is endeavoring to do so, without making the representative of that estate a party to the suit; and this, too, without there being any allegation of the insolvency of that estate, or that it has been finally settled. This is contrary to the rule upon that subject. The present administrator of Henry Hunter should have been made a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">If, however, this were the only objection to the complainant\u2019s bill, it would not be dismissed, but would be directed to stand over for proper parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Passing by, then, this objection, I proceed to examine the case on its merits. The bill charges, that while the defendant\u2019s testator administered the estate of Henry Hunter, he was guilty of gross neglect and mismanagement of that estate, whereby large sums of money were completely lost to it: that he sold property of the estate, and took insufficient security for the purchase-money, by means of which the debts were rendered worthless, and a loss to the estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>I can have no doubt, that if an administrator acts in bad faith in taking security which proved insufficient, he would be held liable : his liability, however, would extend no further. So, if he were guilty of any gross negligence or wilful default in collecting claims, by which they were lost, he would be chargeable, but not otherwise. The bill, in this case, while it is full of general charges of maladministration of the estate, makes no specific and definite charges on the subject. There is the general charge, of wasting and embezzling ; but this is insufficient. In 1 Molloy, 469, the question of charging an executor with default or negligence, is critically examined by the Irish Chancellor, who states the result in this general rule, that, in order to ground a direction to charge an executor for default, not only must the fact be put in issue, but some case made by evidence to show the fact is probable, and the inquiry proper ; and that inquiry must be pointed to specifications. Let us apply this rule to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">1. Is the fact of default or negligence sufficiently put in issue? It is true, the bill states he sold property to Joseph Hunter, and took his note, with Thomas Dawson as his surety, who was <em>both </em>insolvent and insane ; and that <em>he </em>sold, also, property to William Hunter, with Thomas Dogherty as his surety, who was insolvent; but it is nowhere alleged, that Yerby took these sureties knowing them to be insolvent. He may have acted in good faith, for anything that is charged in the bill on these points, which cannot be aided by the general charges of waste and negligence : but,</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\"><em>2. </em>Is there any evidence to show the fact is probable, and <em>the </em>inquiry or reference proper ? There is no testimony taken in the case, and the answer is a full denial of all the allegations of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">There is another point worthy of consideration. It is not charged in the bill, that any of the assets of the estate of Hunter came to the hands of Mrs. Yerby, as administratrix of her husband, but it simply seeks to charge Yerby\u2019s estate with liabilities alleged, generally, to have arisen from the negligence of Yerby as administrator of Hunter; and yet the bill calls upon Yerby\u2019s executrix for an account of effects received of Hunter\u2019s estate. In 3 Littell, 96, this point was presented for decision ; and it was held, that an administrator of an administrator could not be called on to account for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the estate of the first\u2019s intestate, without proof that the estate in fact came to his hands. But in this case, there is neither allegation or proof on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">If, however, these grounds did not preclude the complainant from calling for an account, there is yet another, which is fatal to the attempt set up in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Yerby, it is stated, was removed from the administration of Henry Hunter\u2019s estate in August, 1823 ; the bill was not filed until July, 1835, being a lapse of nearly twelve years. The answer states, that Yerby fully accounted, as far as he proceeded in the administration, and that the assets remaining unadministered were delivered over to the present complainant. Under such circumstances, it has been held by the Chancellor of New York, in 3 J. Ch. Rep. 578, that an executor would not be decreed to account. After so long ah interval, great difficulty would, of necessity, arise, in proving who were solvent or insolvent. Evidence once in existence, might, in the lapse of so long a period, be lost, removed, or the witnesses have died. It is, therefore, with great propriety, adjudged, that where the executor, when attempted, after so many years have passed since he ceased to act in his representative character,' to be held responsible for his acts in that character, answers that he has fully administered, he will not be decreed to account.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The complainant\u2019s bill must be dismissed, at his costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
