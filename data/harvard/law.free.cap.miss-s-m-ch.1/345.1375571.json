The commissioner declined accepting the proffered bond, and refused to execute <em>the </em>required conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">That refusal of the commissioner, and the allegation that he had advertised the mortgaged property for re-sale, constitute, if any, all the equity of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">There is nothing in the first objection : the commissioner had no right' to substitute one purchaser for another, without the entire assent of the first purchaser. The complainant had no right whatever to demand that the commissioner should receive the bond he offered nor had the commissioner any authority to receive it: he had sold the property in controversy to the defendant Sharpe, to whom, upon complying with the precedent requirements of the decree, it of course belonged ; upon his failure to comply, the property remained in the hands of the commissioner unsold, and stood as If no sale had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">There is as little in the other objection taken to the course of the commissioner. It presents the question, whether, where a commissioner appointed by a court of chancery has advertised, and fro'm any cause fails to sell, he can advertise for a resale. Whether, in other words, his power and authority are exhausted by his first attempt to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">I have previously, in another case, examined and decided this question. I then decided, that unless he was restricted by the decree on its face, or his authority was limited to a sale at a particular time expressly specified in'the decree, upon a failure to sell from accident, or the non-compliance on the part of the purchaser at the first sale, he has full power to advertise and sell again.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">He has the same powers precisely, that a sheriff has when a writ <em>o\u00ed fieri facias </em>is placed in his hands ; whose power to resell, in case of failure in the first attempt, has never, that I am aware of, been doubted.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>As a general rule, decrees of foreclosure and sale do not, specifically, fix the <em>time </em>at which the sale shall take, place. The statute requires that the <em>place </em>shall be mentioned in the decree ; but the uniform practice, and'the proper one has been, to leave the decree without limitation or prescription as to the particular time when the sale shall take place, permitting the parties interested to exercise a discretion in the matter, and only requiring that the length of time in which the advertisement shall continue, shall be clearly designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Until, therefore, a complete execution of the decree takes place, he may advertise again and again, whenever a failure occurs, until he eventually effectuates the object of his appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The bill, in this case, would have been dismissed on demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Let a decree be drawn dismissing the bill at the costs of the complainant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
