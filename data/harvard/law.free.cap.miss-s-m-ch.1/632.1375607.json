The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>complainants are two stockholders in the Rodney hank ; and, as such, they allege, that the directory called a meeting of the stockholders ; that some six or eight attended ; and that, in pursuance of a resolution made by these stockholders, the directors made a conveyance or assignment of all its property and effects, to pay its debts, to Thomas Freeland and Jno. Murdock, which, it alleges, was void. There are very extraordinary features in the bill, which will be stated, in the different points hereinafter set forth. Suffice it to say, that these two stockholders have enjoined the assignees, and all others, from paying and receiving money, collecting judgments, &amp;c., to the amount, as alleged in the bill, of $600,000 or $700,000 dollars ; and the immense damage their injunction may occasion, is secured by a bond of $2000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-4\">1st. I am desirous of having this case decided on the merits. The first point raised in the bill, is, that a majority of the stockholders did not direct the assignment to be made. To this, it is answered, the directory, without any directions of the stockholders, had ample power to make an assignment of all the property of the bank, to secure its debts. This point has so frequently been adjudicated, that a bare reference to the cases is sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-5\">All the cases were minutely examined, and the point decided, in the case of the Real Estate Bank of Arkansas, reported in pamphlet. Also, the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in the case of the assignment of the United States Bank of Pennsylvania ; and in the following cases : 7 Gill and Johns. 468 ; 6 ib. 205, 363 ; Angel\u00ed and Ames, on Corp. 59, 64, 509 ; 6 Conn. Rep. 233 ; <em>Pope </em>v. Brandon, 2 Stew. Rep. 400 ; 5 Peters, 647.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-6\">2d. It is next insisted, that the assignment is prohibited by the 7th section of the bank act of 1840. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-7\">That section, although general in its terms, was intended merely to prohibit transfers of individual notes, so as to prevent them from being paid in the paper of the bank. It never was designed to prevent an assignment of all its property, for <em>the </em>payment of its debts, where that assignment stipulated, on its'face (as this does), that the debtors of the institution might pay their debts in the paper of the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-8\">But, if it were otherwise, the act is unconstitutional. The char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>ter, vide--section, gives ample and express power to the bank to dispose of its property and effects, in any way : and if no such express power was given, it was necessarily implied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-5\">It is by virtue of this power, that the bank has authority to make a general assignment. This power being granted by the legislature, they have no power, afterwards, to prevent its exercise. <em>Vide </em>3 Story\u2019s Com. Con. 242, 243, 258, 259 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mar</em>shall., 9 Wend. 351.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-6\">. 3d. It is again objected, that the bank owed State and county taxes, which were assessed before the assignment; and, that the assignment is a fraud on the. State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-7\">If this is so, the State can protect itself. If it is a fraud on the State, it is void only as to the State; and, as these complainants are not the State, it is presumed it does them no damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-8\">But this is not so ; if anything is due for taxes, the assessment constituted a lien, or preference, in payment;- and the State can enforce this, notwithstanding the assignment. Act of 1841, page 59, sec. 19. It is not pretended, that the taxes shall not be paid ; no provision was made for the payment of the taxes, nor was any necessary, because the law had made it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-9\">4th. It is next objected, that the assignees, or trustees, gave no security, nor was any required by the deed. The law does not require trustees to give security, except executors, administrators, and guardians. If the trustees are improper persons, or do acts inconsistent with thei rduty, the Court will remove them : but it does not invalidate the trusty In none of the cases cited, in the first point, was security required, except in the Arkansas case ; and in that case, the deed of assignment made it necessary, otherwise it would not have been required. A natural or artificial person may assigti its property to trustees, both with or without imposing the condition, that security shall be given. If the trust is abused, the trustee will be removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b627-10\">5th. It is again objected, that the directors made two of their own body the assignees. It is not perceived why, if they have the power of making an assignment, they should not appoint one of their own body. Any person may act as trustee. The directory does not convey to the directory; they'convey to A. B. and C. D., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>as individuals. This precise point arose in the case of <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Brandon, 2 </em>Stew. Rep. 400.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-4\">6th. It is again charged, that an information, in the nature of a <em>quo loarranto, </em>was issued against said bank, to show by what warrant she exercised the right of banking; here it charges, that the assignment to trustees was made to forestall public justice, and to avoid the consequences of a judgment of seisure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-5\">To this novel charge, it is scarce deemed necessary to say anything. It has been heretofore considered, that an assignment made to prevent honest debts from being paid was fraudulent. But this is the first time that it has been contended, that an assignment made to pay debts was fraudulent, because a proceeding was instituted against a bank, which, if successful, would prevent it from paying its debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-6\">The law on this subject is, however, well settled ; all transfers and conveyances made by a corporation, before judgment of seisure, are valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-7\">But if there is anything in this objection, it will be high time to make it when the judgment on the <em>quo warranto </em>is given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-8\">It may be, it never will be given. And it would be a peculiar novelty to set aside a conveyance, by a corporation, upon the ground it was intended to avoid a judgment of seisure, before such judgment of seisure was rendered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-9\">Again, what right has a stockholder to complain ? He is not injured by it. He is benefited. If-this puerile objection were available at all, it could only be taken advantage of, by those <em>gentlemen debtors, </em>who rely on the <em>quo warranto </em>as a \u201c <em>new way to pay old debts.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-10\">But, if there were a judgment in the <em>quo warranto, </em>and the assignment was made with a view to prevent extinguishment of the debts, and to provide against it; so far from its being fraudulent, the purpose is a just one, and will be sustained in law. That was the object of the assignment, in the case of <em>Pope v. Brandon, 2 </em>Stew. Rep. 401. The charter was about to expire, and the debts thereby would have been extinguished, &amp;c. To prevent this effect the assignment was made.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b628-11\"><em>G. T.

The argument at the bar rested upon the following points.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">1st. The unconstitutionality of the act of 1840, providing for the appointment of a <em>special </em>chancellor, when, by reason of interest, or other cause, the chancellor is incompetent to sit.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">2d.

The power of a banking corporation to make a general assignment of its assets to trustees, for the benefit of creditors since the act of 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">1st. I will premise, in reference to the first question, that, although the inclination of my own mind should tend most strongly to the conclusion, that the act of 1840<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> is unconstitutional, I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>hesitate long before so pronouncing it. The chancellor, whose place I now temporarily occupy, has repeatedly held it to be constitutional ; and, unless the question wras made to appear so clear, as to leave not the shadow of a doubt resting upon it, I should hardly be expected to adopt a different rule of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">As presented,- it is a question of no little difficulty ; and the most enlightened members of the profession may well entertain different opinions upon it. By<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the 16th sec. of the 4th art. of the new constitution, it is provided, that \u201ca separate.superior <em>court of </em>chancery shall be established, with full jurisdiction in all matters of equity,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;c., and that \u201cthe chancellor shall be elected by the qualified electors of the whole State, for the term of six years, and shall be at least thirty years old at the time of his election.\u201d This language would seem to indicate, pretty clearly, that no one can legally occupy the chancellor\u2019s chair, unless he shall have attained the age of thirty years, and have been elected by the qual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>ified electors of the whole State. Yet we find, that in 1833, an act was passed, which, if constitutional, precludes the idea of indulging in such a construction.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> How. &amp; Hutch. Dig. 95, sec. 26. It is provided by this act, that \u201c when any vacancy shall occur in any State office, the unexpired term of which does not exceed twelve months,\u201d &amp;c., the governor may fill the same by executive appointment. Should the chancellor die, or resign, leaving an unexpired term of one year, or less, the governor is authorized to fill it by appointment. This act was passed nearly contempora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>neously with the adoption of the new constitution. In the legislature that passed it, was a large number of the delegates who framed the constitution. From that day to the present, no one has had the temerity to call in question its constitutional validity. The members of the bar, the executive of the State, the courts of justice, from lowest to highest, have all, with an unbroken unanimity, decided in favor of-its .constitutionality. There is scarcely a judicial post in the State, the incumbent of which has not, at some point of time since 1833, rested his claim to administer the law upon office, the tenure of which was thus obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">If, then, the act of 1833 be constitutional, why is not the act of 1840 ? The chancellor, who has taken his seat by virtue of an executive appointment under the act of 1833, is not elected by the qualified electors of the whole State ! any more than is the special chancellor, who takes his seat under the provisions of the act of 1840. The same rule of construction, applied to both acts, will alike render them valid or invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">But, again. In turning to the 4th section of the schedule appended to the new constitution, we find the following language : \u201c All laws now in force in this State, not repugnant to this constitution, shall continue to operate, until they shall expire by their, own limitation, or be altered or repealed by the legislature.\u201d It hence becomes necessary, to inquire how the law stood in relation to this matter before the adoption of the new constitution. The chancellor at that time, it is true, was not elected by the qualified electors of the whole Slate, but his election to office was as peremptory in its terms, and as unqualified in its results. Rev. Code, 550, sec. 6 ; 548, sec. 17 ; 84, sec. 2.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> As the chancery court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>was then established, its jurisdiction was as ample, its powers as full, and its incidents the same, as belong to it under its present organization. It will be seen, by consulting the law of that day, that whenever the chancellor was incompetent to sit in any cause, it was removed into the Supreme Court for trial and determination. Rev. Code, 86, sec. 7. The judges of that Court, under the old constitution,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> had no original chancery jurisdiction. They were appointed to fill another and distinct office ; and, unless it can be made to appear, that an election and qualification to discharge the duties of one office, <em>ipso </em>facto, renders the person elected corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>petent to discharge the duties of any or every other office in the State, it will be impossible to find a higher constitutional sanction for their acts, than for those of the present incumbent. They determined such causes, not as judges of the Supreme Court, but as special chancellors, under the act before cited. Rev. Code, 86, sec. 7. The question then recurs, is this act, of 1822, repugnant to the new constitution ? If it be, it is only so, because of the difference in the manner of the chancellor\u2019s election under the old and new constitutions. I apprehend, that this difference cannot be relied on, with any degree of plausibility, for the purpose of proving the act of 1822 incompatible with the mandate of the new constitution. If, then, the old Supreme Court, as a special chancery court, although it had no equity jurisdiction, except in cases of appeal, might try and determine chancery causes, under an act of the legislature ; and if that act is still in force by the 4th section of the schedule appended to the constitution ; and if, by the provisions of that act, the judges of the present Supreme Court.might, as special chancellors, try and determine this cause ; why may not a member of the bar, as special chancellor, under the act of 1840, passed for a similar purpose, and containing in substance the same provisions with the act of 1S22, try and determine it ? I am at a loss to perceive why he may not, unless the trappings of office, that hang around a man as judge of the Supreme Court, clothe him will) powers sufficient to try causes in any and all the courts of the Stale.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">There is another view of this question, that deserves a careful consideration. Conceding to the argument of complainant\u2019s counsel its fullest weight, it yet seems to me, that an application of an obvious rule'of construction to this question, will furnish an unerring criterion by which it may be determined. In construing a grant in the federal constitution, the power sought to be exercised must be deduced from the plain and obvious meaning of the context ; or, it must be indispensably necessary for carrying into effect the expressly delegated power. But, in giving a construction to a grant in a State constitution, a rule diametrically opposite prevails; and everything not inhibited, every power not expressly, or by necessary implication, taken away, may be exercised by the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>government. Now, although it is declared by the new constitution, that \u201c'a separate superior court of chancery shall be created, with full jurisdiction in all matters of equity,\u201d and that \u201c the chancellor shall be elected by the qualified electors of the whole State, for the term of six years,\u201d &amp;c. ; yet I apprehend, this grant does not prohibit the legislature (when the chancellor from any cause is incompetent to try a particular case, depending in his court) from providing the only means, and passing the only law, that could be passed, to insure the speedy and effectual administration of justice, in this same \u201c superior court of chancery.\u201d Unless this construction shall obtain, the 14th section in the \u201c Bill of Rights,\u201d will be most shamefully violated. For how would any person, whose interest conflicted with the chancellor\u2019s, and whose rights wrere of an equitable character, avail himself of that grant, wherein it is said, \u201c that all courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done him, in his lands, goods, person, or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial, or delay,\u201d, if it be not in the power of the legislature to provide some means of trying such cases ? If the legislature has not this power, the grant in the Bill of Rights is without meaning, and it was a work of folly and supererogation, to engraft it on the charter of our rights. I come, therefore, to the conclusion, that the act of 1S40, is constitutional, and will accordingly proceed to determine the case upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><em>2d. </em>The powers of circuit court judges, in granting injunctions, have been so repeatedly limited and defined by the decisions of this Court, that I might safely rest my opinion upon them. I will, however, refer to the statute, the positive and peremptory language of which leaves no room for doubt. By the act it is declared, that \u201c the judges of the said (circuit) courts, shall, within their respective circuits, have power to grant writs of injunction, and <em>ne exeat, </em>either in vacation, or term time, &amp;c., &amp;c. How. &amp; Hutch. Dig. 486, sec. 25. This language is susceptible of but two interpretations, to wit: either that the circuit court judge, at the time he grants an injunction, must be within the limits of his district; or the case, requiring his fiat for an injunction, .must have originated within his district. It surely need not be argued, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>that the latter is the correct interpretation. A moment\u2019s reflection, upon the extent of jurisdiction conferred by the constitution and laws upon each circuit court judge, will afford a satisfactory solution of the question. Unless the act of 1841 repealed the act just cited, there can be no doubt, that the fiat in this case was granted by an incompetent person. That act declares, \u201c that writs of injunction and <em>ne exeat, </em>orders requiring bail in chancery, &amp;c., may be granted by any circuit judge, &amp;c., in all cases in which, by law, the same may be properly granted. Sheet acts of 1841, 123 and 124, sec. 1. It is clear to my mind, that this act does not repeal the act of 1822 ; but simply gives the circuit court judges the right to grant injunctions and other remedial process in all cases, in which, by law, the same might be properly grantable; and, of course, reference must be had to the law, as it existed prior to the passage of this act, in order to give it a correct construction. It is, therefore, manifest, that Judge Brown, who granted the injunction in this case, transcended his power ; and his fiat is therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">3d. The power of a banking corporation to make assignments to trustees for the benefit of creditors, is' a principle of law too well settled to require reference to authorities to support it. Indeed, counsel for complainant admitted its correctness at the bar; but contended, that this principle of the general law had been limited, if not entirely repealed, by the act of 1840. See Sheet acts, 15, sec. 7. . By the provisions of this act, \u201cno bank in this State shall transfer, by indorsement or otherwise, any note, bill receivable, or other evidence, of debt; and if it shall appear in evidence upon the trial of any action upon any such note, bill receivable, or other evidence of debt, that the same was so transferred, the same shall abate, upon the plea of the defendant.\u201d To ascertain whether the construction put upon this statute of complainant\u2019s counsel be correct, I will apply some familiar rules of construction. 1st. What was the law before the passage of this act <em>? </em>2d. What was the mischief for which the law did not provide ? and, 3d. What remedy was attempted to be provided for the suppression of the existing evil ?</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">By the law, as it had been declared before the passage of the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>of 1840, last referred to, any of the numerous banks in this State might have transferred their notes, bills of exchange, &amp;c. by indorsement or delivery. See <em>Fleckner </em>v. <em>U. </em>S. <em>Bank, </em>8 Wheat. Rep. 335 to 363. The evil complained of was, that many of the banks, under shelter of the law thus declared, were transferring large amounts of their bills receivable, in some instances, to preferred creditors; but in many, if not in most cases, these assignments were made to nominal creditors only, for the purpose of consummating the most enormous and cunningly devised fraud upon their note-holders. This transfer of their bills receivable by the banks diminished, to an amount equal to the gross sum assigned, the legitimate fund for the redemption of their circulation. This caused a rapid and unexampled depreciation of their notes, which resulted in so much clear loss to the community ; especially, when it is,recollected, that the assignees of these bills receivable refused to take the bank circulation in payment, and insisted on gold and silver. The debtors of the banks, after notice of the assignment of their liabilities, could not procure the bank notes, and plead them as sets-off. The consequence was, that the circulating medium of the State suffered a reduction, upon its nominal value, of from 50 to 90 per cent., whilst the community, who held the bank\u2019s paper, \u2014\u25a0 in whose possession it had thus been caused to depreciate, and become comparatively valueless, and a large number of whom were also indebted to these same banks, \u2014 were compelled to discharge their assigned liabilities in gold and silver; and, at the same time, were, shut out from all hope of having the depreciated paper in their possession converted, upon presentation, into the constitutional currency, or its equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">To remedy this evil, the legislature passed the act last referred to. To manifest more clearly, if possible, its intention, a supplemental act was passed, at the same session, declaring that all banks' in this State shall, at all times, receive their respective notes at par, in liquidation of all claims due them. Sheet acts of 1840, <em>21 </em>and <em>22, </em>sec. 2. At a subsequent session, an act was passed, extending the benefits of the supplemental act to all persons, who should be garnisheed as debtors of any bank within this State. See Sheet acts of 1842, 140 and 141, sec. 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Taking, therefore, all the legislation on this subject together, it is manifest, to my mind, that the act of 1840 was never designed to operate upon or prevent such an assignment as this; but was intended alone to prevent those partial and fraudulent assignments, conceived in sin, and carried out in iniquity, the obvious tendency of which was, to depreciate and render worthless the paper of all those banks that made them, and so to diminish the fund pledged for the redemption of their circulation as to banish all hope of its ever being taken up.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">But it may well be questioned, whether the act of 1840 possesses any binding or obligatory force whatever. The Supreme Court, at its last January session, in the case of <em>The Commercial Bank of Manchester </em>v. <em>John T. Nolan, et al., </em>held that a bank is a person, artificial, it is true, but endowed with all the privileges of a natural person, except such as are expressly denied or inhibited in its charter. Now, I ask, if it be competent for the legislature, by a special act, to say that A, or A, B, and C, shall not assignor transfer any of his or their bills receivable, by indorsement or otherwise ; whilst every other man in the community is left free to do so? Would not such a law be in direct and palpable conflict with the 1st article of the \u201cBill of Rights,\u201d wherein it is declared, \u201cthat all freemen, when they form a social compact, are equal in rights?\u201d If, then, a corporation possesses every power and privilege common to a natural person ; and if the charters of the banks in this State do not prohibit them from \u201c assigning\u201d or \u201c transferring\u201d their bills receivable or other evidences of debt (and they do not), I am at a loss to perceive, \u2014 until the Supreme Court shall alter its opinion, and curtail the powers and privileges of corporations, \u2014 from what source the legislature derived its power and authority to pass the act of 1840, denying to banks the right of assigning their bills receivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In every light which I have been able to view this question, my mind has returned, after each effort, with renewed energy to the conclusion, that the assignment to Freeland and Murdock, as trustees for the benefit of the creditors of the bank, was lawfully made; that it is such a conveyance as the contracting parlies were competent to make; and is, therefore, valid in law. The injunction must, accordingly, be dissolved.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\">The following is the act of 1840, referred to by Mr. Miles:</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">\n<em>\u201cAn act to provide for the determination of certain causes in the Superior Court of Chancery.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">\u201c Section l.
