Minor, sold at sheriff sale, and bought in by her father, Samuel Gibson, since deceased. Samuel Gibson in his lifetime sold the land, and warranted the title against himself, his heirs, and all other persons. The lands have come into the hands of the complainant. Samuel Gibson died, and Mrs. Minor, as one of his heirs, received a considerable portion of estate, exceeding in amount $6000, as distributee. Her claim of dower has never been set apart to her, and yet is levied on to be sold. She is charged to be insolvent, as also the other heirs and distributees of Samuel Gibson deceased, the ancestor. Her husband has been dead upwards of twenty years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>.1. Mrs. Minor, as heir and distributee of her father Samuel Gibson, deceased, is bound in law by the covenants of her ancestor, and is bound to protect the covenants in his deed, and the action of covenant, for a breach of warranty, lies between the most remote grantor, and assignee ; for the covenant, to warrant or defend, is a covenant which runs with the land, and is intended for the benefit of the grantee, his heirs and assigns, according to the language of the covenant itself: and not even the intervention of a quitclaim deed, will defeat the action of the assignee against the most remote grantor. 5 Cow.

Rep. 439.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">An heir or devisee having a legal estate, is liable to an action for a breach of a covenant running with the land committed in their time, to wit, a breach of the covenant of their ancestor, according to all authority on the subject. 1 Chitty on PI. 43.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-6\">2. If Mrs. Minor obtains dower, or the benefit of dower in the lands, it will work a breach of her father\u2019s covenants, which she is bound to protect; and a court of equity will restrain such breach, and hold the dower as security against it; especially as she and the other heirs are insolvent. Courts of equity will entertain an injunction ivhere an action at law for a breach of the covenant will not afford an adequate compensation in damages. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. 26-29.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\">Injunctions will be granted to compel the due observance of personal covenants, when there is no effectual remedy at law, as in the case under consideration, when the ancestor is dead, and his estate distributed, and his heirs all insolvent. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. 225.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-8\">A court of equity will interpose to prevent breaches,of a covenant, although such breaches may be recompensed by action of covenant; a court of equity will interpose to prevent unnecessary litigation. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. 187 ; 2 Vesey and Beames, 302.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-9\">Again, the Court will entertain the bill on the doctrine of set-off. A court of chancery will entertain a suit for an equitable set-off, of one judgment against another. 4 Paige, Rep. 647 ; 2 Bibb, 233.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-10\">An insolvent debtor will be compelled in equity to make a set-off with his creditor. 1 Bibb, 519; Littell\u2019s Sel.

If that covenant is broken, Mrs. Minor is liable to all the grantees of the land, and becomes emphatically a debtor, and, being insolvent, comes fully within the above rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-5\">3. The claim of dower, not having been asserted for upwards of twenty years, and the property having been in the adverse possession of innocent purchasers all the while, who procured titles and proceeded under the eye and observance of the widow to make .valuable improvements, without a knowledge of her claim, she</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-6\">will be barred of her claim of dower, and perpetually enjoined from asserting the same by a court of equity. 6 Johns. Ch. Rep. 194.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-7\">4. The claim of dower cannot be levied on by an execution, because the dower has not been laid off, or set apart to the widow. At law the widow\u2019s right of dower, previous to an assignment thereof, is not an estate or freehold in the land of the deceased husband ; but is a mere right or <em>chose in </em>action, and cannot be sold on execution. 4 Paige, Rep. 448 ; 13 Wend. 526.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-8\">5. The title to the lands from Samuel Gibson to the complainant is perfect, the titles being made by the grantees of Gibson, with the exception of John Murdock, who died owning the land. But he left a will empowering his executors to sell his real estate, which they did, and which it was perfectly competent for them to do. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. 320 ; 14 John. 527; 15 John. 346.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-9\">Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"ANo\">The complainant derives title to the tract of land in controversy, indirectly, through Samuel Gibson, deceased, who conveyed by covenant of general warranty to his. vendee, binding himself and heirs. This was a real covenant running with the land, and, upon well settled principles, enured to the benefit of all subsequent vendees. This land was subsequently sold and conveyed, through an intermediate vendee, to Stephen Minor, who bad intermarried with Ann Gibson, one of the heirs of said Samuel Gibson. After the death of Minor, she filed her petition in the Probate Court of Claiborne county, to have her dower allotted to ' her in the land, which petition was allowed, but no .allotment has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>been made. The Grand Gulf and Port Gibson Banks, having judgments against Ann Minor, have levied their executions upon her dower-right, and threaten to sell the same. The object of the bill is to enjoin these sales, as well as to enjoin the widow from further prosecuting her claim of dower. 1 have no doubt of the complainant\u2019s right to relief, as to all the parties. Ann Minor is barred of her dower-right. 1. Because she is estopped by the covenant in the* deed of her ancestor, Samuel <em>Gibson, </em>which is equally binding upon her as it was upon him. The covenant would be binding upon her, to the extent of assets descended from her father, even if the title of the complainant was successfully assailed by a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><em>2. </em>The covenant in the deed is her own covenant, and a court of equity will interpose to prevent a breach of covenant, where-irreparable damage would follow such breach, as would be the case here, since it is alleged that the defendant Ann Minor, and all the other heirs of Samuel Gibson, are insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">3. She is barred by the statute of limitations, twenty years having elapsed from the death of her husband before the time of the application for dower. An action for dower is a possessory action, and is within the statute on that subject, there being no exception as to possessory actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In regard to the creditors of Ann Minor, it is sufficient to remark, that even if she had herself' a right of dower, yet while it remains unascertained, and until there has been an actual admeasurement, by metes and bounds, it is a mere potential interest, amounting to nothing more than a chose <em>in </em>action, which cannot be the subject of seizure and sale under an execution at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Let a decree be prepared granting a perpetual injunction against the claims set up at law by the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
