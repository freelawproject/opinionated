Lewis contends (1) the court should have granted his motion to sever the rape and other sexual assault charges from the murder charge; (2) the court did not adequately investigate possible juror bias; (3) the prosecutor committed misconduct in his discussion of provocation during closing argument; (4) the sexual penetration and rape of one of the victims were not separate acts, and the court therefore should not have imposed consecutive terms for the corresponding offenses; and (5) his sentence of 115 years to life violates his constitutional right against cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude that Lewis\u2019s sentence is unconstitutional and the matter must be remanded for the trial court to determine a parole eligibility date within Lewis\u2019s expected lifetime, unless it concludes that his offenses reflected such irreparable corruption that it is appropriate to preclude him from the possibility of parole during his lifetime. In all other respects, we will affirm the judgment, as we conclude in the nonpublished portion of the opinion that Lewis\u2019s remaining arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>I. <em>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In November 2009, the court granted the prosecution\u2019s motion to consolidate two complaints against Lewis: a complaint charging him with the kidnap, sexual penetration, and rape of Jane Doe 1 and the kidnap and rape of Jane Doe 2, and a complaint charging him with the murder of Robert Tibbs (Tibbs).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In May 2010, the court held Lewis, a minor at the time of the crimes, to answer to the charges as an adult. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In September 2011, Lewis was charged in an amended information with the following: in count one, the murder of Tibbs (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a));<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in count two, sexual penetration with a foreign object upon Jane Doe 1 (\u00a7 289, subd. (a)(1)); in count three, rape of Jane Doe 1 (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2)); and in count four, rape of Jane Doe 2 (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2)). In connection with the murder count, the information alleged that Lewis had personally and intentionally discharged a firearm and caused great bodily injury and death. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b)-(d) &amp; (g), 12022.7, subd. (a).) As to the sexual assault counts, the information alleged that Lewis kidnapped his victims, and perpetrated offenses against multiple victims, within the meaning of the one strike law (\u00a7 667.61).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">By motion in limine, Lewis sought an order severing the sexual assault counts from the murder count. As discussed <em>post, the court denied the motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">The matter proceeded to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">A. <em>Prosecution Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">At trial, victim Jane Doe 1 was referred to as Crystal Doe (Crystal), and victim Jane Doe 2 was referred to as Sabrina Doe (Sabrina). According to the prosecution, Lewis digitally penetrated and raped Crystal, raped Sabrina, and shot and killed Tibbs, all before he turned 18 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">1. <em>2006 Digital Penetration and Rape of Crystal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">Crystal met Lewis in 2005 or 2006. As of October 2006, she was 16 years old and he was 15 years old. Crystal was a virgin.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">Crystal testified that she received a call from Lewis in the afternoon of October 2, 2006, as she was walking with her friend Malysa. When Lewis asked Crystal to go to his house, Crystal declined but agreed to meet him at a church at \u201cEast 21st and 21st Ave.\u201d Malysa went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">Crystal met Lewis at the front steps of the closed church. When Crystal saw her brother drive by, Crystal and Lewis moved to the side steps of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>church at Crystal\u2019s suggestion, because she thought she would be in trouble if her parents learned that she was with a boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">After Lewis and Crystal talked for a while at the side of the church, Lewis put his hand on Crystal\u2019s lower back. Crystal told him to stop; Lewis stopped \u201cfor a minute\u201d but then resumed. Although Crystal attempted to push Lewis\u2019s hand away, Lewis tried to put his hand farther down her back, into her pants. Crystal told him, \u201cno.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Feeling unsafe, Crystal stood up and tried to pull a box cutter out of her back pocket, intending to cut Lewis, but the box cutter slipped from her hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">While Lewis and Crystal were on their feet near a cross, Lewis held Crystal\u2019s pants by the belt loop with one hand, forced his other hand inside her pants, and inserted one or more of his fingers into her vagina. Crystal felt pain and told him \u201cno\u201d and \u201cstop.\u201d She tried to pull Lewis\u2019s hand out of her pants, but he just dug deeper. She kept telling him to stop, but he persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Lewis kept his finger or fingers inside Crystal\u2019s vagina as he pushed or pulled her, against her will, approximately 33 feet through a gate, down a walkway, and behind the church between two windows. He then pushed her against the wall of the church, held her by her pants, and tried to bend her over as she faced the wall. By this time, Crystal\u2019s pants and underwear had come down part way. Lewis announced that he was going to \u201cstick it in from the back,\u201d and Crystal replied, \u201cno.\u201d Lewis tried to insert his penis into her vagina from behind and said: \u201c \u2018[Y]ou know you want it. Just let me put it in.\u2019 \u201d Crystal said \u201cno\u201d and told him to stop; refusing to spread her legs, she was able to prevent him from forcing his penis into her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Crystal continued to struggle with Lewis, ending up on her back on the ground. Ignoring Crystal\u2019s continued pleas to stop, Lewis pinned her down, lowered her pants and underwear, and inserted his penis into her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">After Lewis stopped his assault, he walked away laughing and called her \u201cbootsy,\u201d which is slang for \u201clame.\u201d Crystal texted Malysa that she had just been raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">At home, Crystal went to the bathroom and felt a burning sensation when she urinated. She also saw blood, apparently coming from her vagina, on her underwear. Crystal burst into tears and told her mother that Lewis had raped her. Crystal\u2019s mother called police.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Crystal was transported to Highland Hospital, where a \u201cSART\u201d (sexual assault response team) examiner found genital injuries consistent with sexual assault. Crystal\u2019s pants and underwear were collected as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The police investigation proceeded over the next two years. In October 2006, Crystal was interviewed by police. In June 2007, the SART kit was submitted for analysis. That same month, Lewis told police he did not have sex with Crystal or anyone behind a church, and he allowed the police to take a DNA sample. In August 2008, Lewis\u2019s DNA was matched to DNA collected from Crystal\u2019s underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The police presented Crystal with a photographic lineup in September 2008. She pointed to Lewis\u2019s photograph, but was tentative about the identification because, she claimed, she was reluctant to relive the incident. Crystal subsequently identified Lewis at the preliminary examination and at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">2. <em>2007 Rape of Sabrina</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Sabrina testified that after midnight on August 26, 2007, she was waiting for friends outside their Oakland apartment building, when she was grabbed from behind. She tried to hit her assailant with her purse and told the attacker to let her go. A male voice replied, \u201cWe could do it the easy way or the hard way.\u201d Sabrina was frightened.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">The man dragged Sabrina by her hair about four blocks to a dark isolated area in a park, as she struggled and continued to ask him to let her go. He pushed her onto a picnic table, so that her head was on the table and her knees were on the bench. He unbuttoned her pants and pulled down her pants and underwear. She kept saying \u201cno\u201d and was afraid she was going to die. He inserted his penis into her vagina, rubbed her breast, and tore her shirt. After moving his penis back and forth inside her vagina, he released his grip on her and she ran away. The attacker warned Sabrina that if she told anybody, he would hurt her friends, whom he named.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Sabrina nonetheless reported the rape to her friends. They took her to Highland Hospital, where she underwent a sexual assault examination and her clothes were collected as evidence. An examiner found bruises to her arm and thigh and blunt trauma to her vaginal opening\u2014injuries that he opined would not normally be caused by consensual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">The SART kit in Sabrina\u2019s case was submitted for DNA analysis in September 2007. Ultimately, the 2008 DNA analysis matching Lewis\u2019s DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>sample to Crystal\u2019s SART kit sample provided a \u201ccold hit\u201d in Sabrina\u2019s case: Lewis was the major sperm donor in two samples from Sabrina\u2019s underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">3. <em>2008 Murder of Tibbs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Tibbs, a Navy veteran and substance abuse counselor at a church, lived in a ground-floor apartment in East Oakland with his fianc\u00e9e, Pamela Davis (Davis), along with their daughter and Davis\u2019s other two children. According to Davis and Davis\u2019s sister, Tibbs was \u201claid back\u201d and neither threatening nor aggressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Davis testified about her dog, which Lewis claimed he wanted to see on the night of Tibbs\u2019s murder. She explained that, in 2007, a man named Carl Williams (Williams) had kept a pit bull in the backyard of a nearby abandoned house. In early December 2007, Davis asked to have the dog after it was nearly hit by a car, and Williams agreed. The next day, Williams was killed. Davis and Tibbs kept the dog in their apartment and named it \u201cCinnamon.\u201d In the ensuing months until May 2008, Lewis never asked to see the dog or went to Davis\u2019s apartment to visit it. Nor did he ever claim that it was his dog.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">On the night of May 21, 2008, Tibbs was in the apartment studying for his college final exams, while Davis was in another state. Tibbs was just three weeks away from graduation; the day before, he had celebrated his 41st birthday. But sometime after 11:00 p.m. on May 21, Tibbs declined to turn Cinnamon over to Lewis, and Lewis ended Tibbs\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Charles Berry, Tibbs\u2019s next-door neighbor, testified that he awoke to the sound of gunfire around 11:10 p.m. on May 21, 2008. Berry then heard \u201csome glass being broken.\u201d About two minutes after hearing the first gunshots, he heard two or three more. Berry called 911 after hearing the first shots and later spoke to 911 a second time. Looking out his window, he saw a Black male walking towards the street on Tibbs\u2019s side of the fence that divided their properties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>LaTonya Lee, Tibbs\u2019s upstairs neighbor, testified that she was in her bedroom and also heard gunshots shortly after 11:00 p.m. She called 911 (at 11:10 p.m., according to the CAD report). While she was on the 911 call, she heard glass breaking; she also heard a loud male voice that she did not recognize. When she heard another gunshot, she called the police again. Lee peeked out her window and saw someone with \u201clong dreads\u201d standing on the curb and walking between her apartment building and Berry\u2019s fence. She heard a woman near the street say \u201c \u2018come on\u2019 \u201d more than once.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Around this time, Davis and her sister received a call from Tibbs, saying that Lewis was outside, \u201c \u2018shooting up the house to get the dog.\u2019 \u201d Multiple gunshots, sounding like they were coming from outside the apartment, could be heard in the background. Davis\u2019s sister told Tibbs to call 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">At 11:12 p.m. and 11:14 p.m., 911 dispatch logged hang-up or incomplete calls from Davis\u2019s apartment phone. At 11:16 p.m. and 11:20 p.m., Tibbs connected with 911 and reported that Lewis had shot him in the chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Police officers arrived at the apartment at approximately 11:20 p.m. Through a broken window, they observed Tibbs on the kitchen floor, bleeding and moaning. Officers forcibly entered the apartment through the locked front door at 11:22 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Tibbs was transported to Highland Hospital, where he died at 11:55 p.m. An autopsy found a gunshot wound to the right side of his chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">At 11:56 p.m., Lewis and his girlfriend, Dominique Pierson, also arrived at Highland Hospital. Lewis claimed he was shot in the right hand, but his only wounds were two very \u201csuperficial\u201d lacerations, consistent with cuts from a sharp object such as glass; the treating physician testified it was unlikely that the wounds were from a gunshot or a machete blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">In a statement given to the police the day after the shooting, Pierson told officers that Lewis had been arguing with a man (Tibbs) about a dog. Lewis said, \u201c T want my fucking dog\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018Give me my fucking dog.\u2019 \u201d Tibbs said, \u201c \u2018Get the fuck out of here,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018Get the fuck from in front [of] my door,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018This ain\u2019t your dog,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018Ain\u2019t no dog here.\u2019 \u201d When Pierson tried to persuade Lewis to leave, he told her to \u201c \u2018[s]hut the fuck up, bitch.\u2019 \u201d Near the apartment door, Lewis said, \u201c \u2018You gonna play with me[?]\u2019 T want my fucking dog.\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018You, ain\u2019t gonna bring my dog outside?\u2019 \u201d By this point, Lewis had pulled out a gun. As Pierson walked away, she heard two gunshots. Lewis later ran up to her, saying, \u201c \u2018He shot me. He shot me in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>arm,\u2019 \u201d but Lewis\u2019s hand, not his arm, was bleeding, and his hand did not look like it had been shot. Pierson and Lewis then took a bus to the hospital.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Officers inspected the scene at Tibbs\u2019s apartment building. Glass from the broken kitchen window, near where Tibbs would customarily study, was both inside and outside the apartment. One bullet casing was found on Berry\u2019s driveway (on the other side of the fence from Tibbs\u2019s residence), in the general vicinity of the broken window. A second casing was found in the inside track of the broken kitchen window, consistent with a gun being fired from within the window frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">A rusted machete that Davis kept in the kitchen was found on the ground by a walkway outside, near the broken window; small pieces of shattered glass were around the machete, but the machete had no blood on it. Strike marks consistent with the machete blade were inside the apartment above the broken window and on top of a nearby fish tank, which did have blood on it. Police did not find a gun inside the apartment, and Tibbs did not own one.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Outside the apartment, a trail of blood led to a bus stop. Forensic analysis determined that it was Lewis\u2019s blood on the glass from the broken window and on the ground outside the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The gun used to shoot Tibbs was never recovered, but police found photographs of guns on Lewis\u2019s cell phone, including a semiautomatic pistol of the same caliber as the recovered casings.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">According to an investigator, Tibbs was inside the apartment, close to the window, when he was shot. Tibbs left strike marks on the inside of the window (with the machete) while Lewis was at the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">4. <em>October 2008 Police Interview with Lewis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">On October 15, 2008, Lewis was in custody in juvenile hall for the Tibbs murder. After waiving his rights, he spoke to detectives investigating the rapes of Crystal and Sabrina. Shown a photograph of Crystal, Lewis said he had not had sex with her, or that he did not remember for sure because \u201c[he] done has <em>[sic] </em>sex with a whole lot of girls.\u201d Shown Sabrina\u2019s photograph, Lewis denied dating her, talking to her, or knowing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>B. <em>Defense Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Lewis\u2019s mother, Alicia Grayson, testified that Williams had been like an older brother to Lewis and was important in his life because Lewis\u2019s father had died before Lewis was bom. Lewis helped feed and walk the dog that Williams had kept at a vacant house. When Williams was shot to death (attempting an armed robbery) in December 2007, Lewis \u201ccried like a baby\u201d and became depressed. She later suspected that Lewis started taking Ecstasy, noting his behavior had changed in that he \u201cmoved fast\u201d and \u201ctalked fast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In the afternoon of May 21, 2008, Grayson saw Lewis and Pierson on the street where Tibbs lived. Lewis was \u201cmoving fast,\u201d \u201cspeeding,\u201d and not staying still. He saw a newspaper article listing the people killed in Oakland during 2007, including Williams. Grayson left the area around dusk.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">C. <em>Jury Verdict and Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The jury acquitted Lewis of first degree murder, but found him guilty of second degree murder. The jury also found Lewis guilty of the sexual penetration and rape of Crystal and the rape of Sabrina. In addition, the jury found true the enhancement for personal use of a gun with respect to the count one murder charge, as well as the allegations of multiple victims and kidnapping as to the sexual offense counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">Lewis was sentenced to a term of 115 years to life in state prison, comprised of 15 years to life for the murder of Tibbs; a consecutive 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement; and a consecutive 25 years to life for each of the three sexual assault crimes (penetration of Crystal, rape of Crystal, and rape of Sabrina), pursuant to the one strike law (\u00a7 667.61).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">n. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">We address Lewis\u2019s contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">A.-D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">E. <em>Eighth Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">Lewis was sentenced to 115 years to life, comprised of 75 years to life for nonhomicide offenses (25 years to life for each of the digital penetration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>rape offenses) and 40 years to life with respect to the homicide offense (15 years to life for second degree murder and 25 years to life for the gun use enhancement). He contends the sentence violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, because it effectively constitutes a sentence of life without the possibility of parole (LWOP).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">1. <em>Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">An LWOP sentence may not be imposed against a juvenile offender for nonhomicide offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caballero </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 262, 268 [145 Cal.Rptr.3d 286, 282 P.3d 291] <em>(Caballero) </em>[\u201csentencing a juvenile offender for a nonhomicide offense to a term of years with a parole eligibility date that falls outside the juvenile offender\u2019s natural life expectancy constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment\u201d]; <em>Graham v. Florida </em>(2010) 560 U.S. 48, 82 [176 L.Ed.2d 825, 130 S.Ct. 2011] <em>(Graham) </em>[federal Constitution categorically bans the \u201cimposition of a life without parole sentence on a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide\u201d].) The court in <em>Caballero </em>explained: \u201cAlthough proper authorities may <em>later </em>determine that youths should remain incarcerated for their natural lives, the state may not deprive them <em>at sentencing </em>of a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate their rehabilitation and fitness to reenter society in the future.\u201d <em>(Caballero, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 268, italics added.) In so holding, <em>Caballero </em>ruled that a cumulative sentence for distinct crimes, imposing a total term of imprisonment in excess of the offender\u2019s life expectancy, is the functional equivalent of an LWOP sentence even if each of the sentences comprising the aggregate, standing alone, included the possibility of parole within his lifetime. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 267-268.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">As to homicide offenses, the United States Supreme Court has held that a state may not impose a <em>mandatory </em>LWOP sentence on a juvenile offender, although the sentencing court might impose such a sentence if it has adequately considered the offender\u2019s age and environment and found \u201c \u2018irreparable corruption.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(2012) 567 U.S. _, - [183 L.Ed.2d 407, 132 S.Ct. 2455, 2468-2469] <em>(Miller) </em>[noting LWOP sentence for a juvenile offender would be \u201cuncommon\u201d and imposed against the \u201c \u2018rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption\u2019 \u201d]; see <em>Caballero, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 268, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Lewis contends the 75-year-to-life sentence for nonhomicide offenses is unconstitutional under <em>Caballero. </em>He also contends his 115-year-to-life aggregate sentence is unconstitutional, because 115 years to life is the functional equivalent of an LWOP sentence, the sentence was mandatory under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>sentencing scheme (once the court decided that the one strike law offenses occurred on separate occasions), and the sentencing court did not consider Lewis\u2019s youth, background, and other circumstances as <em>Miller </em>requires. Respondent urges that, even if Lewis received .the functional equivalent of an LWOP sentence, the court did consider Lewis\u2019s youth and background, concluding that those factors actually pointed towards greater punishment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">a. <em>Lewis\u2019s sentence is a de facto LWOP</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Lewis\u2019s 115-year-to-life aggregate sentence, and even the 75-year-to-life component for his nonhomicide offenses, constitutes an effective LWOP. Given his presenten ce credits of 982 days, and assuming in-prison work credits at 15 percent (\u00a7\u00a7 2933.1, subd. (a), 667.5, subd. (c)), Lewis would not be eligible for parole on his 75-year-to-life sentence for roughly 63 years, when he would be approximately 84 years old. Lewis contends his life expectancy is just 64.5 years, based on a table from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; respondent counters that Lewis\u2019s remaining life expectancy at the time of sentencing was 57.82 years, according to a different table, which would give him a total life expectancy of 78 years. Under either calculation, Lewis would not be eligible for parole within his natural life expectancy, so his aggregate sentence for nonhomicide offenses constitutes the functional equivalent of an LWOP sentence. (See <em>Caballero, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at pp. 268-269 [110 years to life for three attempted murders, plus enhancements, placed parole eligibility outside his normal life expectancy]; <em>People v. Mendez </em>(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 47, 63 [114 Cal.Rptr.3d 870] [where life expectancy of 18-year-old defendant was 76 years, and eligibility for parole was at age 88 (after taking into account presentence credits and in-prison credits), sentence was \u201c \u2018materially indistinguishable\u2019 \u201d from LWOP ].) And since 75 years to life would be an effective LWOP for Lewis, so would his aggregate 115-year-to-life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>b. <em>Application of </em>Caballero <em>and </em>Miller</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The question becomes what analysis should be applied where, as here, the court has consecutively imposed both a de facto LWOP sentence for nonhomicide offenses, <em>and </em>a sentence for a homicide offense and related enhancement. The categorical ban of LWOPs and de facto LWOPs in <em>Graham </em>and <em>Caballero </em>applied to sentences that were for nonhomicide offenses only. The possibility of imposing an LWOP upon an offender of \u201cirreparable corruption,\u201d as discussed in <em>Miller, </em>applied to an actual LWOP sentence for a homicide offense only. Does the fact that Lewis committed a homicide in addition to his nonhomicide offenses mean that the court might impose a de facto LWOP upon the type of finding embraced by <em>Miller, </em>even though it was Lewis\u2019s nonhomicide offenses for which he received the de facto LWOP? Or does the absolute ban on de facto LWOP sentences under <em>Caballero </em>apply in California even though Lewis also committed a homicide?</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">One approach to this mixed-sentence situation\u2014which the People supported at oral argument on the ground that <em>Caballero </em>did not address a homicide offense and <em>Miller </em>addressed only a homicide offense\u2014is to apply <em>Caballero </em>and <em>Miller </em>to their corresponding parts of the sentence: that is, analyze the portion of the sentence attributable to nonhomicide offenses under <em>Caballero, </em>and analyze the portion of the sentence attributable to the homicide offense under <em>Miller. </em>Under this approach, we would find Lewis\u2019s sentence unconstitutional under <em>Caballero, </em>because it imposed an effective LWOP for nonhomicide offenses. We would not need to reach the constitutionality of the portion of the sentence imposed with respect to the homicide; but if we did, we would find this aspect of the sentence constitutionally permissible anyway, because 40 years to life is not an effective LWOP. Accordingly, we would vacate the sentence and remand for the court to set a probation eligibility date within Lewis\u2019s natural lifetime, as described in <em>Caballero. (Caballero, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at pp. 26S-269.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">A second approach, which Lewis supported to some extent at oral argument, is to apply <em>Caballero </em>and <em>Miller </em>to the sentence <em>as a whole. </em>Because there was a homicide, the court could first determine whether the juvenile\u2019s offenses reflected irreparable corruption. If they did, the court would impose the de facto LWOP (since <em>Miller </em>would allow an actual LWOP for such a defendant who committed a homicide, certainly it would allow a de facto LWOP for such a defendant who committed a homicide and additional crimes); if Lewis\u2019s offenses did not reflect irreparable corruption, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>would have to set a probation eligibility date within the juvenile\u2019s expected natural lifetime. Under this approach, since the sentencing court in this case did not find or even consider whether Lewis\u2019s offenses reflected irreparable corruption, we would remand for the <em>Miller </em>determination and, if no <em>Miller </em>finding is made, the court would establish a parole eligibility date within Lewis\u2019s natural life expectancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">A third approach would be to apply only the <em>Caballero </em>per se ban to the sentence as a whole, even though one of Lewis\u2019s crimes was a homicide, and reject the possibility of an LWOP sentence under <em>Miller. </em>In support of this approach, California might choose to employ a rule that is more favorable for defendant than the United States Supreme Court requires; and as a matter of policy, it might be argued, even a juvenile who has committed a homicide should be able to have a parole eligibility hearing at some point in his or her lifetime, since the difficult task of evaluating a juvenile\u2019s corruption would be unnecessary at sentencing if it could be accomplished later by a parole board.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Of interest in this regard is the recent decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 655 [162 Cal.Rptr.3d 128] <em>(Ramirez). </em><em> </em>There, two juveniles were convicted of first degree murder and second degree murder, with enhancements and special circumstances. The shooter received LWOP plus 65 years, and the nonshooter received 90 years to life. Thus, each juvenile offender had an LWOP or a de facto LWOP based purely on homicide-related offenses. The trial court did not make a <em>Miller </em>determination that the juveniles\u2019 crimes reflected irreparable corruption. <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.4th at p. 685.) </p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The appellate court in <em>Ramirez </em>reversed the sentences, holding that sentencing the juveniles to an actual or effective LWOP, without taking into consideration their youth and related factors, constituted cruel and unusual punishment under <em>Miller. (Ramirez, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.4th at pp. 683-685.)t The court further concluded that the juveniles could not be sentenced to an actual or effective LWOP upon remand. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 685.)+ The court observed that in California the ultimate decision to keep a juvenile offender in prison for life can be decided later (at a parole eligibility hearing), so \u201ca sentencing decision which forecloses a juvenile offender\u2019s options at the outset would appear inconsistent with both the spirit and rationale of <em>Graham </em>and Miller.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 686.)  Furthermore, the Legislature\u2019s enactment of section 1170, subdivision (d)(2)\u2014which guarantees a juvenile the opportunity to seek recall of an actual LWOP after serving 15 years for most offenses\u2014suggests the Legislature would not approve of imposing a theoretically lesser sentence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>a juvenile without any possibility of parole. (219 Cal.App.4th at pp. 686-687.)  The court also noted that, although there is a distinction between a homicide (in <em>Ramirez) </em>and a nonhomicide (in <em>Caballero), </em>that distinction did not bear on the offenders\u2019 relative culpability, because in both <em>Caballero </em>and <em>Ramirez </em>the offender <em>intended </em>to kill someone. In the majority\u2019s view in <em>Ramirez, Caballero </em>implied that a gang member\u2019s intent to kill rival gang members, without more, was insufficient to meet the <em>Miller </em>construct of irreparable corruption. <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.4th at p. 688.) </p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The court in <em>Ramirez </em>therefore directed the trial court to \u201cexercise its discretion to impose sentences which ensure these juvenile defendants have a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate rehabilitation and potentially obtain their release within a reasonable period of time.\u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.4th at p. 688.)  In short, the court did not remand for consideration of the <em>Miller </em>\u201cirreparable corruption\u201d finding, but to set a parole eligibility date as in Caballero.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">c. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"ACy\">In our view, the constitutionality of a parole eligibility date must be determined by looking at the sentence as a whole, since a defendant obtains a single parole eligibility date based on the entirety of his or her sentence. In this case, Lewis was convicted not just of nonhomicide offenses, but of a homicide offense as well. Our Supreme Court was careful to point out that <em>Caballero </em>did not address a situation where the juvenile offender, like Lewis, had committed a homicide. <em>(Caballero, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 268, fn. 4.)  Since the United States Supreme Court recognizes there are circumstances in which a juvenile who commits a single homicide as his only offense might be found to be of such irreparable corruption as to warrant an actual LWOP without offending the Eighth Amendment, certainly there could be circumstances in which a juvenile who commits a homicide <em>and </em>three separate one strike sexual offenses could be of such irreparable corruption as to warrant a de facto LWOP without offending the Eighth Amendment. Because the trial court in this case did not have the opportunity to make this determination under <em>Miller, </em>we will remand for the trial court to have that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>opportunity. <em>(Miller, supra, </em>567 U.S. _ [183 L.Ed.2d 407, 132 S.Ct. at pp. 2468-2469]; <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.4th at pp. 689-690 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Aronson, J.).  See <em>Caballero, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 268, fn. 4 [under <em>Miller, </em>the sentencing court must \u201c \u2018take into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison\u2019 \u201d].)  If the court does not find that Lewis\u2019s offenses reflect irreparable corruption within the meaning of <em>Miller, </em>the court shall set a parole eligibility date within Lewis\u2019s expected lifetime as set forth in <em>Caballero. (Caballero, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at pp. 268-269 [\u201cthe sentencing court must consider all mitigating circumstances attendant in the juvenile\u2019s crime and life, including but not limited to his or her chronological age at the time of the crime, whether the juvenile offender was a direct perpetrator or an aider and abettor, and his or her physical and mental development, so that it can impose a time when the juvenile offender will be able to seek parole from the parole board\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"Aqr\">HI. <em>DISPOSITION</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0X\">The matter is remanded for the trial court to determine a parole eligibility date within Lewis\u2019s expected lifetime, unless it finds that Lewis\u2019s offenses reflect his irreparable corruption within the meaning of <em>Miller v.
