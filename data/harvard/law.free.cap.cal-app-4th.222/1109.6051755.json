Hui sued defendant Beth Sturbaum for defamation, claiming Sturbaum\u2014then an insurance company claims investigator\u2014made false statements to California\u2019s Department of Insurance (DOI) and to Winne Yu, an assistant to personal injury lawyer Frank Kim. The trial court granted Sturbaum\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion, concluding Dr. Hui\u2019s claims arose from protected activity (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>also determined Dr. Hui could not show a probability of prevailing because Sturbaum\u2019s statements to the DOI were absolutely privileged under Civil Code section 47 (section 47) and her statements to Yu were protected by the qualified common interest privilege in that statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Dr. Hui appeals. He does not challenge the court\u2019s findings with respect to Sturbaum\u2019s communications with the DOI. Instead, he contends the court erred by granting the anti-SLAPP motion because Sturbaum\u2019s statements to Yu did not arise from protected activity under section 425.16, subdivision (e) and because the common interest privilege articulated in Civil Code section 47 does not protect Sturbaum\u2019s statements to Yu.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">We requested supplemental briefing on whether the protected conduct alleged in Dr. Hui\u2019s slander cause of action was merely incidental to any unprotected conduct alleged in that claim. We now affirm. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we conclude Sturbaum\u2019s communications with Yu are protected under section 425.16, subdivision (e)(4) as speech made \u201cin connection with ... an issue of public interest.\u201d In the published portion of the opinion, we conclude Dr. Hui has not established a probability of prevailing because the common interest privilege codified in Civil Code section 47, subdivision (c) protects Sturbaum\u2019s statements to Yu.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Dr. Hui graduated from chiropractic school in 1997. In 1998, he founded Pine Street Chiropractic (Pine Street). A \u201cconsiderable volume\u201d of Pine Street\u2019s business came from \u201creferrals of personal injury clients from numerous local law firms.\u201d National Legal Associates\u2014a firm run by Attorney Frank Kim\u2014referred personal injury clients to Pine Street for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">In 2003, Dr. Hui settled a civil case brought by a former patient claiming he \u201cmishandled\u201d her. Dr. Hui received a 30-day suspension of his chiropractic license and five years\u2019 probation. During that time, he could not treat female patients without a third party present. Dr. Hui\u2019s chiropractic license was \u201cfully restored\u201d in March 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">In 2008, Sturbaum was a claims representative for Federated Mutual Insurance Company (Federated). She handled liability claims submitted to Federated; she also read \u201cAlerts\u201d posted by the National Insurance Crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>Bureau (NICE) \u201cregarding potential fraudulent claims practices.\u201d Sturbaum reviewed a liability claim involving services performed by Dr. Hui at Pine Street for two women (claimants) who had been in a car accident (the claim). As she reviewed the billing invoices for the claim, she noted \u201cservices described on the invoices\u201d that she believed violated the Business and Professions Code and \u201cCalifornia Regulations governing chiropractors.\u201d Around that same time, Sturbaum learned the NICE was investing Kim, claimants\u2019 attorney. Sturbaum researched Dr. Hui with the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners and \u201cfound that he had had prior suspensions and a prior license revocation.\u201d During an August 2008 telephone conversation with Dr. Hui, Sturbaum \u201cexpressed some concern that the automobile collision in which the [claimants] had been injured was relatively minor.\u201d In response, Dr. Hui explained claimants had preexisting medical conditions aggravated by the car accident. He offered to \u201cuse apportionment in billing for these patients\u2019 treatments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In 2009, Sturbaum saw an NICE task force Alert concerning Kim and Dr. Hui. In 2010, the DOI informed Sturbaum it was \u201cinvestigating Pine Street for potential fraudulent activity\u201d and asked her to provide information. Sturbaum cooperated with the investigation and provided the requested information. In June 2010, Winne Yu, Attorney Kim\u2019s assistant, called Sturbaum to settle the claim. Yu and Sturbaum discussed Federated\u2019s position on the claim. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Hui learned about the DOI investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">\n<em>The Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In November 2010, Dr. Hui filed the operative first amended complaint suing Doe defendants for trade libel, libel per se, and slander.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In September 2011\u2014and before serving Sturbaum with the complaint\u2014Dr. Hui\u2019s attorney deposed Yu. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Hui substituted Sturbaum for Doe 1. In the \u201cfactual background\u201d allegations of the operative first amended complaint, Dr. Hui alleged he learned he had become \u201cthe target of a DOI investigation \u2018pursuant to false reports\u2019 \u201d submitted by defendants who claimed he \u201cwas running a fraudulent chiropractic business, conducted intentional overcharges for services, engaged in fraudulent or improper billing, and conducted unnecessary and/or unauthorized treatments.\u201d Dr. Hui also alleged defendants told personal injury attorneys in the area \u201cnot to send their clients to [him] because various insurance companies and/or the DOI were going to put [him] out of business for the improper acts falsely ascribed to [him]. Personal injury attorneys also learned independently of the false accusations ascribed to [Dr. Hui] and subsequent inquiries by the DOI into [Dr. Hui\u2019s] business practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>Dr. Hui\u2019s cause of action for trade libel alleged the reports submitted by-defendants to the DOI were false and \u201clibelous on their face\u201d because they charged him with \u201ccommitting fraud and dishonesty.\u201d Similarly, the libel per se claim alleged the DOI reports were false and that defendants knew they \u201cwould be viewed or heard by persons who were existing clients or potential clients.\u201d Dr. Hui\u2019s slander cause of action alleged defendants \u201cconspired to make repeated defamatory and false oral statements regarding [Dr. Hui] to the DOI, insurance companies and personal injury attorneys in the area.\u201d According to the complaint, \u201c[tjhese oral statements\u201d were false and unprivileged and \u201chave been seen and heard ... by the DOI, insurance companies and personal injury attorneys in the area. In addition, Defendants made defamatory oral statements to individuals with personal, business and professional relationships with [Dr. Hui].\u201d Dr. Hui sought compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">\n<em>The Anti-SLAPP Motion, Opposition, and Reply</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Sturbaum moved to strike the operative complaint pursuant to section 425.16.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She argued her \u201c[communications designed to curb insurance fraud\u201d were \u201cspeech \u2018in connection with a public issue\u2019 \u201d under section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3); she claimed any statements made to third parties about Dr. Hui \u201cwould have been made for the purpose of alerting potential victims and participants of [Dr. Hui\u2019s] suspected fraudulent activities. Thus, they are statements made in connection with a public issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Sturbaum also argued Dr. Hui could not establish a probability of prevailing on the merits because, among other things, her statements to the DOI were absolutely privileged under Civil Code section 47 and because her statements to any third parties were privileged under subdivision (c) of that statute, which provides a conditional privilege for \u201ccommunications to interested persons\u201d made without malice. Sturbaum contended there was no evidence her statements were \u201cmotivated by hatred or ill will toward\u201d Dr. Hui because she \u201chad a very limited connection with [him], on a purely professional level, and thus had no reason to form hatred or ill will toward him.\u201d Finally, she claimed her statements were based on a reasonable belief in their truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Sturbaum submitted a declaration in support of the motion averring she believed the billing invoices submitted by Dr. Hui for claimants\u2019 treatment violated California regulations and the Business and Professions Code. She also stated she learned Kim was being investigated by the NICE and that Dr. Hui\u2019s license had been suspended and revoked in 2008. Sturbaum averred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>she cooperated with the NICE and DOI investigation of Kim and Dr. Hui. Finally, she testified she never \u201ctold any personal injury attorney not to send . . . clients to [Dr. Hui].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In opposition to the motion, Dr. Hui argued Sturbaum\u2019s statements to third parties were not protected under section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3) because they were not made in a public forum and because the \u201cgeneral topic of insurance fraud\u201d is not an issue of public interest. As Dr. Hui explained, \u201c[t]he false statements about Dr. Hui\u2019s billing being fraudulent and improper, false allegations of sexual misconduct, and damaging instructions to avoid doing business with him are more accurately seen as matters of concern to a few people rather than the public at large, and the defamatory statements are not sufficiently close to the general topic of combatting insurance fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Dr. Hui also argued he had a probability of prevailing because neither Sturbaum\u2019s communications with the DOI, nor her statements to Yu, were privileged under Civil Code section 47. Dr. Hui argued the qualified common interest privilege in section 47, subdivision (c) did not apply to Sturbaum\u2019s conversation with Yu because Sturbaum acted with malice and because Dr. Hui and \u201cthe third party personal injury attorneys are not interested in Dr. Hui in the same manner, are not interested in any DOI investigation of Dr. Hui in the same manner, are not mutually interested in allegations of sexual misconduct by Dr. Hui, and are not mutually interested in assertions that they should avoid doing any business with Dr. Hui.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Dr. Hui submitted a transcript of Yu\u2019s deposition, taken before Sturbaum was named as a defendant and served with the complaint. At her deposition, Yu testified Kim asked her in June 2010 to call Federated to \u201csettle the case and obtain the necessary documents to resolve [the claim].\u201d During a conversation with Yu, Sturbaum said \u201cthe case was not worth money because . . . this was a small impact matter. So she . . . questioned ... the medical treatment.\u201d Sturbaum also \u201cmay have\u201d mentioned \u201cthat the billing could have been fraudulently billed. [][] She mentioned that [Dr.] Hui. . . had misconduct or some sort of complaint . . . that [he] should have stopped seeing female patient[s].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sturbaum also stated the billings were \u201cexcessive because of the type of impact\u201d in the car accident and that the billings \u201ccould be fraudulent.\u201d Yu assumed Sturbaum thought claimants should not have been injured because the property damage to the vehicle was \u201cminimal.\u201d Finally, Sturbaum \u201cmentioned that she . . . made a complaint or [was] going to make a complaint [about] Dr. Hui.\u201d Yu thought Sturbaum \u201cmay have suggested that we shouldn\u2019t have any business to do with Dr. Hui.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>Yu thought the conversation was \u201cunusual\u201d because Yu\u2019s \u201cpurpose was to hopefully resolve this matter with her. [CJ[] But on the other hand, [Sturbaum] was saying a lot of things that may not be relevant to the case.\u201d Yu told Dr. Hui that \u201can adjuster [was] making these allegations about his practice . . . .\u201d After her conversation with Sturbaum, Yu initially was \u201chesitant\u201d to refer patients to Dr. Hui but she eventually decided Sturbaum\u2019s statements were \u201cprobably false,\u201d which \u201cstopped\u201d her from reconsidering referrals to Dr. Hui. Yu could not remember whether she declined to provide a referral to Dr. Hui after talking with Sturbaum. She explained it was Kim\u2019s practice to only \u201c[occasionally\u201d refer clients to specific doctors; instead, his office \u201cgives names of doctors for clients to choose, and clients may pick one that may be close to their work or residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Dr. Hui offered a declaration in opposition to the motion averring he was surprised to learn the DOI was investigating Pine Street \u201capparently based on one or more reports that claimed [he] was running a fraudulent chiropractic practice, creating intentional overcharges for services, engaging in fraudulent or improper billing, or performing unnecessary and unauthorized treatments.\u201d Dr. Hui stated he learned an insurance company adjuster \u201chad told personal injury attorneys that [his] billing was fraudulent and that they should not send [Mm] any business.\u201d According to Dr. Hui, the adjuster told National Legal Associates \u201cnot to continue doing business with [his] practice and to stop sending referrals to Pine Street . . . because of fraudulent billing and sexual misconduct.\u201d Dr. Hui further averred he experienced a \u201csudden downturn\u201d in Ms business beginning in June 2010, including \u201cdramatically fewer client referrals from National Legal Associates after June 2010.\u201d The \u201cdrastic decrease in new business . . . forced\u201d him to stop making mortgage payments on Ms house, to file for bankruptcy, and to close Pine Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">In reply, Sturbaum argued her communications with the DOI and \u201cwith an interested party concerning [Dr. Hui\u2019s] billing practices and Ms prior sexual misconduct\u201d were protected under section 425.16, subdivision (e)(1), (2), and (4) and were privileged under Civil Code section 47. She also claimed Dr. Hui could not establish a probability of prevailing on the merits because (1) her statements to Yu were privileged; (2) the statements were true and made without malice; and (3) Dr. Hui could not establish her statements damaged Mm because Yu testified she continued to refer patients to Dr. Hui after the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">\n<em>The Order Granting the Anti-SLAPP Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">Following a hearing, the court granted the motion. The court concluded Dr. Hui\u2019s claims were \u201cbased on non-incidental allegations arising from protected activity covered by the anti-SLAPP statute. ... To the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>Dr. Hui\u2019s claims are based on communications between Ms. Sturbaum and the Department of Insurance, those claims are barred by the absolute litigation privilege.\u201d The court also determined Dr. Hui could not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits \u201cthrough the deposition testimony of Ms. Yu that Ms. Sturbaum spoke to Ms. Yu about Dr. Hui.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It explained Yu\u2019s deposition testimony was \u201cinsufficient to show that there is any merit to any of Dr. Hui\u2019s claims\u201d because the conversation was covered by the qualified common interest privilege set forth in Civil Code section 47, subdivision (c). According to the court, Yu\u2019s deposition testimony would not allow a reasonable juror to conclude Sturbaum said anything to Yu \u201cwith malice such as to defeat the qualified [section] 47(c) privilege.\u201d The court awarded attorney fees to Sturbaum and took Sturbaum\u2019s demurrer and motion to strike portions of the operative complaint off calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">\u201cIn ruling on a special motion to strike, the trial court follows a two-step analysis that involves shifting burdens. [Citation.] The moving defendant carries the initial burden to show the challenged cause of action arises from protected free speech or petitioning activity. [Citation.] The burden is satisfied by demonstrating that the conduct underlying the plaintiff\u2019s claim fits into a category of protected activity set forth in section 425.16, subdivision (e). [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Castleman </em>v. <em>Sagaser </em>(2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 481, 489 [156 Cal.Rptr.3d 492], fn. omitted <em>(Castleman).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">\u201cIf the court finds the defendant\u2019s threshold showing has been made, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to produce evidence establishing a probability of prevailing on the cause of action. [Citation.] To meet this burden, the plaintiff must plead and substantiate a legally cognizable claim for relief. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cPut another way, the plaintiff \u2018must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Castleman, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.4th at p. 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">\u201cOnly a \u2018 \u201cminimum level of legal sufficiency and triability\u201d \u2019 is needed to satisfy the second prong of the anti-SLAPP statute. [Citation.] The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>favorable to the plaintiff is accepted as true, while the defendant\u2019s evidence is evaluated to determine if it defeats the plaintiff\u2019s claim as a matter of law, e.g., on grounds of privilege or immunity. [Citation.] The motion will not be granted unless both prongs of the statute are established; the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action must arise from protected speech or petitioning and lack even a minimal degree of merit. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Castleman, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.4th at p. 490.) We review an order on an anti-SLAPP motion de novo: \u201cwe engage in the same two-step process as the trial court to determine if the parties have satisfied their respective burdens.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">\n<em>Sturbaum Met Her Burden of Demonstrating the Complaint Arises From Protected Activity</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">\n<em>Dr. Hui Has Not Established a Probability of Prevailing Because the Common Interest Privilege in Civil Code Section 47 Protects Sturbaum\u2019s Statements to Yu</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">As noted above, the court determined Sturbaum\u2019s communications with the DOI were absolutely privileged. It also concluded Sturbaum\u2019s statements to Yu were protected by the common interest privilege codified in Civil Code section 47, subdivision (c). Dr. Hui does not challenge the court\u2019s findings with respect to Sturbaum\u2019s communications with the DOI. Instead, he contends Sturbaum\u2019s statements to \u201clocal personal injury attorneys and similar third parties\u201d are not protected by the common interest privilege in section 47. Accordingly, we determine whether Dr. Hui has carried his burden to establish the probability of prevailing on his slander claim. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) \u201cThe tort of defamation \u2018involves (a) a publication that is (b) false, (c) defamatory, and (d) unprivileged, and that (e) has a natural tendency to injure or that causes special damage.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Taus v. Loftus </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 720 [54 Cal.Rptr.3d 775, 151 P.3d 1185] <em>(Taus).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Civil Code section 47 \u201cextends a conditional privilege against defamation to statements made without malice on subjects of mutual interests. [Citation.] This privilege is \u2018recognized where the communicator and the recipient have a common interest and the communication is of a kind reasonably calculated to protect or further that interest.\u2019 [Citation.] The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>\u2018interest\u2019 must be something other than mere general or idle curiosity, such as where the parties to the communication share a contractual, business or similar relationship or the defendant is protecting his own pecuniary interest. [Citation.] Rather, it is restricted to \u2018proprietary or narrow private interests.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Hawran v. Hixson </em>(2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 256, 287 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 88].) \u201c \u2018One authority explains the statutory interest as follows: (1) The \u201cinterest\u201d applies to a defendant who \u201cis protecting his own pecuniary or proprietary interest.\u201d (2) The required \u201crelation\u201d between the parties to the communication is a contractual, business or similar relationship .... (3) The \u201crequest\u201d referred to must have been in the course of a business or professional relationship. [Citation].\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kashian v. Harriman </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 914 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 576] <em>(Kashian).) </em>\u201c \u2018The defendant has the initial burden of showing the allegedly defamatory statement was made on a privileged occasion, whereupon the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the defendant made the statement with malice. [Citation.] The existence of the privilege is ordinarily a question of law for the court. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mann </em>v. <em>Quality Old Time Service, Inc. </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 90, 108 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 215] <em>(Mann).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Dr. Hui contends the court erred by applying the common interest privilege to Sturbaum\u2019s statements to Yu. We disagree. Sturbaum\u2019s employer, Federated, shared a business relationship with Kim, the attorney retained by claimants. <em>(King v. United Parcel Service, Inc. </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 426, 440 [60 Cal.Rptr.3d 359] [\u201c[pjarties in a business or contractual relationship have the requisite \u2018common interest\u2019 for the privilege to apply\u201d].) In addition, Sturbaum\u2019s statements were \u201creasonably calculated to protect or further a common interest.\u201d <em>(Williams v. Taylor </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 745, 752 [181 Cal.Rptr. 423] <em>(Williams).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">During their conversation, Sturbaum \u201cmay have\u201d told Yu the claim \u201ccould have been fraudulently billed\u201d and \u201cmay have\u201d mentioned the billing \u201ccould be fraudulent.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She also \u201cmay have suggested that [Kim] shouldn\u2019t have any business to do with Dr. Hui.\u201d If Dr. Hui was engaging in fraudulent or unethical activity, it was important for Sturbaum to notify those with whom Dr. Hui did business and who were affected by the improprieties, particularly Kim. In addition, Sturbaum had a direct and immediate concern in protecting Federated\u2019s interest in settling meritorious claims. (See <em>Williams, supra, </em>129 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>Cal.App.3d at p. 752 [privilege applied where defendant automobile shop made, to claims adjuster with whom body shop did business, statements concerning plaintiff body shop manager\u2019s termination for irregularities in records concerning work performed].) Assuming it occurred, Sturbaum\u2019s suggestion that Kim\u2019s firm \u201cshould stop doing business with Dr. Hui\u201d was not extraneous or irrelevant to protecting Federated\u2019s pecuniary interests and its business relationship with National Legal Associates. <em>(Kashian, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 914.) The same is true with respect to Sturbaum\u2019s purported comment that \u201c[Dr.] Hui . . . had misconduct or some sort of complaint . . . that [he] should have stopped seeing female patient[s].\u201d Yu was \u201cnot sure if [Sturbaum] actually said that . . . specifically.\u201d Assuming it occurred, this statement was made in the course of Federated\u2019s business or professional relationship with National Legal Associates. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">We are not persuaded by Dr. Hui\u2019s reliance on a portion of the opinion in <em>Mann, </em>where the court determined the common interest privilege did not apply to statements defendants made to customers of a competing company, Water Systems Support Inc. (WSSI). <em>(Mann, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 109.) The <em>Mann </em>court rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that their statements were privileged under Civil Code section 47, subdivision (c), explaining: \u201cDefendants presented no evidence showing they had any type of relationship with WSSI\u2019s customers or that WSSI\u2019s customers requested the information. Because defendants and WSSI are business competitors, it is not reasonable to assume that the motive of the communication was innocent; rather, it appears defendants\u2019 only interest was to gain WSSI\u2019s customers as their own. If we were to accept defendants\u2019 unsupported argument, business competitors would be free to publish defamatory statements about the business practices of a rival to its rival\u2019s customers by merely contending the customers were \u2018interested\u2019 in the subject matter of the communication.\u201d (120 Cal.App.4th at p. 109.)</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Here and in contrast to <em>Mann, </em>Federated shared a business relationship with Kim. In addition, Yu testified her employer, Kim, <em>directed </em>her to call Sturbaum to \u201csettle\u201d the claim and \u201cobtain the necessary documents to resolve\u201d it, suggesting Yu asked for information about Federated\u2019s position on the claim and any impediments to securing payment of the outstanding bill. According to Yu, Sturbaum explained why the claim \u201cwas not worth money\u201d and questioned the treatment Dr. Hui provided. This is not a situation like the one in <em>Mann, </em>where one company disparaged its competitor. Here, Sturbaum told Yu the claim <em>\u201ccould </em>have been fraudulently billed\u201d and was \u201cexcessive\u201d and <em>\u201ccould </em>be fraudulent.\u201d (Italics added.) Both Sturbaum and Kim shared a common interest in resolving the claim and Sturbaum\u2019s comments were reasonably calculated to further that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>Having established the statements at issue are privileged, Dr. Hui bears the burden of showing the statements were made with malice. <em>(Lundquist </em>v. <em>Reusser </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1193, 1208 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 776, 875 P.2d 1279].) \u201c[M]alice,\u201d within the meaning of Civil Code section 47, subdivision (c), is \u201c 1 \u201cestablished by a showing that the publication was motivated by hatred or ill will towards the plaintiff <em>or </em>by a showing that the defendant lacked reasonable grounds for belief in the truth of the publication and therefore acted in reckless disregard of the plaintiffs rights <em>(Noel </em>v. <em>River Hills Wilsons, Inc. </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1370 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 216], quoting <em>Sanborn v. Chronicle Pub. Co. </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 406, 413 [134 Cal.Rptr. 402, 556 P.2d 764].) Dr. Hui has failed to present evidence of malice. Nothing in Dr. Hui\u2019s declaration or in Yu\u2019s deposition transcript remotely suggests Sturbaum\u2019s conversation with Yu was \u201cmotivated by hatred or ill will\u201d or that she acted in \u201creckless disregard\u201d of Dr. Hui\u2019s rights. A party\u2019s \u201cbare assertion\u201d that statements made are false does not make them so, \u201cmuch less establish\u201d they were made maliciously. <em>(Kashian, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 932.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The trial court\u2019s order granting the anti-SLAPP motion (Code Civ.
