Millbrook shot and gravely injured Sione Manoa, a fellow guest at a house party, during a heated exchange. In addition to injuring Manoa, the bullet struck the hand of Matthew Galvan, a friend of Manoa who was trying to prevent the argument from escalating into a physical fight. A jury convicted Millbrook of one count of attempted murder of Manoa, one count of assault with a firearm on Manoa, and one count of assault with a firearm on Galvan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It also found true various enhancements that are not directly at issue in this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury was unable, however, to reach a verdict on an allegation that the attempted murder was willful, deliberate, and premeditated (\u00a7 664, subd. (a)), and the trial court accordingly dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">The trial court sentenced Millbrook to a total term of 35 years four months to life. This sentence included a term of seven years for the attempted murder, a consecutive term of 25 years to life because a firearm was used in the attempt, and a term of three years four months for the assault on Galvan and related enhancements. The court stayed the sentences for the conviction of assault on Manoa and its related enhancements and for the infliction of great bodily injury enhancement related to the attempted murder conviction. Millbrook timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">On appeal, Millbrook argues that (1) the jury should have been instructed on attempted voluntary manslaughter based on a sudden quarrel or heat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>passion; (2) insufficient evidence supported his conviction for attempted murder; (3) testimony about a prior uncharged act was improperly admitted into evidence; (4) a juror should have been dismissed after he submitted a note questioning defense counsel\u2019s tactics; and (5) the cumulative effect of these errors amounted to a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude that Millbrook\u2019s conviction for attempted murder cannot be sustained because the jury was not instructed on attempted voluntary manslaughter based on a sudden quarrel or heat of passion, and we conclude that this error was prejudicial. The People may retry Millbrook for attempted murder, however, because we also conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented to support the charge. If the People elect not to retry Millbrook, we direct that the judgment be modified to reflect a conviction for attempted voluntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reject Millbrook\u2019s remaining claims and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">At trial, witnesses gave varying accounts of the shooting and the events leading up to it. We begin by discussing some of the uncontroverted facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">A. <em>The Party.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Fernanda Placencia invited guests to her San Leandro home for a party on December 19, 2009, to celebrate her birthday. About 40 people attended the party, the majority of whom were her coworkers at a Target store in Hayward.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Manoa, who was 20 years old, and Galvan were friends of Placencia who had security jobs at Target. At the time, Manoa was approximately five feet 10 inches tall, weighed approximately 235 pounds, and played football for his junior college. Because the men worked in security, Placencia had asked them to make sure that the party went smoothly and that everyone followed the rules. Galvan did not interpret this as a serious request for special assistance, however, and assumed he and Manoa were going to the party to have fun like everyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>Manoa and Galvan arrived at Placencia\u2019s house between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m. At first, the two men were in the garage, where most of the Target employees had gathered. Six to 10 of Placencia\u2019s other friends, who were unknown to Manoa and Galvan, were on the house\u2019s back porch. The two groups were not interacting, but everyone was having fun, and the party was going well.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Manoa testified that he rarely drank alcohol, and he recalled having only two beers at the party. He could not remember preparing or drinking any mixed drinks. Galvan, however, testified that over the course of the night, he and Manoa each drank three to four beers and one mixed drink, which Manoa prepared. Manoa acknowledged he was intoxicated at the party, but he testified that the alcohol did not change his mood, and he was calm for most of the night. Galvan agreed that Manoa did not seem to be unduly intoxicated, although in his statement to the police after the shooting Galvan said that Manoa had been \u201cdrinking heavily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Meanwhile, Millbrook had also arrived at Placencia\u2019s residence with his girlfriend, Jennifer Diaz, a close friend of Placencia. Millbrook was 18 years old and attended community college. At the time, he weighed 160 to 165 pounds and was \u201cvery\u201d thin. He parked his car, a Porsche Cayenne, in the driveway, and he remained with Diaz in the car for a while. He testified that he was reluctant to go into the party, and he implied this was because a group of men with whom he had an ongoing conflict often hung out near Placencia\u2019s house. Susan Cesena, one of Diaz\u2019s friends, joined Millbrook and Diaz while they were in the parked car, and the three smoked marijuana. Cesena corroborated Millbrook\u2019s testimony that he was reluctant to attend the party. She gave a shot of alcohol to Millbrook, but he testified that he did not drink it. Eventually, the women convinced Millbrook to go to the party, and the three went into the garage to dance.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Millbrook brought a gun into Placencia\u2019s party and kept it in his waistband. He testified that he brought the gun because he did not know who would be at the party, and he was scared and wanted to protect himself should any threats arise. After dancing in the garage, Millbrook sat on the back porch and smoked more marijuana.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Placencia did not want the partygoers to go into the house other than to use the bathroom. Nevertheless, a group of five or six men\u2014including Cesar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>Leyva (Cesar), who was dating Placencia and worked at Target, and Cesar\u2019s brother, Adrian Leyva (Adrian)\u2014congregated in the house around the dining room table. Manoa and Galvan went inside to talk to Cesar and joined this group.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Placencia had had too much to drink and became sick. For a while, she was in the bathroom. Some of her nonwork friends, including Diaz and Cesena, eventually helped her to her bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">A man who had been on the back porch approached the group gathered around the dining room table and told them that they should not be in the house. The man left after Cesar told him that everything was fine, and a woman told him that Placencia knew Cesar and that it was all right for the group to be inside. Manoa and Galvan then went into the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">B. <em>Manoa Argues with Diaz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Diaz went to the kitchen after leaving Placencia\u2019s bedroom, and she and Manoa began to argue. Four witnesses testified about the argument: Manoa, Galvan, Cesar, and Adrian.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They generally agreed that Manoa and Diaz began swearing and yelling at each other and got increasingly angry and loud. According to Manoa, Diaz approached him and Galvan and told them, \u201cEverybody needs to get the fuck out of the house.\u201d Manoa testified that he felt defensive and upset because he did not think she had a right to tell him to leave. He could not recall everything he said to Diaz, but he did remember saying, \u201cFuck you, bitch. Don\u2019t talk to me like that. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Manoa and Cesar testified that Manoa and Diaz were standing apart from each other during the argument. Galvan, however, testified that Manoa and Diaz \u201cstarted off ... a couple of feet from each other but ultimately they were in each other\u2019s face[s.]\u201d In Galvan\u2019s statement to the police, he characterized Manoa as being \u201cbelligerent\u201d during this argument and throughout the night. Galvan believed that the argument was serious enough that he needed to intervene. He escorted Diaz outside to the back porch while another Target coworker tried to calm Manoa. Galvan returned to the kitchen and spoke to Manoa, who had an \u201cintense\u201d presence and was \u201cbreathing hard\u201d but seemed to be calming down. Cesar estimated that the argument between Manoa and Diaz lasted about a minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">C. <em>Manoa Argues with Bianca Velez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">According to Manoa, about five to 10 minutes after his argument with Diaz, another friend of Placencia, a woman later identified as Bianca Velez, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>entered the kitchen and asked him why he had spoken to Diaz that way. She seemed upset that Manoa had cursed at Diaz and had called her names, and she told him he needed to leave. Manoa got into an argument with Velez, although Manoa testified that it was not as intense as his argument with Diaz. Galvan did not remember an argument between Manoa and Velez but testified that it could have happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Millbrook testified that he was inside the house waiting to use the bathroom while Manoa and Velez were arguing, and he described the argument as \u201cvery intense.\u201d He was concerned that the argument would escalate because Manoa was \u201cvery aggressive.\u201d Millbrook had \u201cnever seen anyone so angry ... in such a little space, [and] it seemed like [Manoa] was larger than fife.\u201d Millbrook testified that Diaz was trying to stop the fight, and she eventually escorted Velez outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Millbrook claimed that he thought Manoa was dangerous because of his earlier observation of Manoa while Millbrook and Diaz were still on the porch. Millbrook testified that he saw Manoa, who was standing in the driveway, clutch his waistband and say loudly into his phone, \u201cI got my thing. I got my thing,\u201d which Millbrook interpreted to mean that he had a gun. Manoa denied making any phone calls during the party or saying, \u201cI got my th[i]ng.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Cesena testified that while she was in the bedroom helping Placencia she heard Velez arguing with a man, presumably Manoa, whom Velez had asked to leave. According to Cesena, the man stated, in apparent references to Placencia and Velez, \u201c[W]ake that ho up . . . wake her up. She needs to kick this bitch out.\u201d Cesena testified that the man and his group of friends \u201cweren\u2019t being peaceful\u201d and that she had previously heard him arguing and seen him exhibiting \u201cobnoxious behavior ... all over the house.\u201d She and her friends wanted the group of men to leave because no one was supposed to be in the house and Placencia was too intoxicated to control the party. According to Cesena, the men \u201cdidn\u2019t want to leave the house\u201d and \u201cessentially were the cause of everything.\u201d She never saw Millbrook fight with anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Cesena testified that after overhearing the argument involving Velez, she went outside to try to end the party before somebody became violent. She remembered Velez being on the back porch and \u201ctelling the guys\u201d that the other group did not want to leave the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">At this point, accounts of what happened diverge significantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">D. <em>Manoa Argues with Millbrook.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Manoa testified that while he and Velez were arguing, Galvan suggested to Manoa that they leave the party, and Manoa agreed. They began walking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>toward the door when Millbrook entered the kitchen from the back porch with a few male friends. Manoa remembered that Diaz also had returned to the kitchen and was standing near Millbrook. Millbrook then asked Manoa, whom he had not previously met, \u201cWhy the fuck you talk to my girl like that?\u201d Millbrook was \u201cbeing a boyfriend trying to figure out what was going on.\u201d Manoa testified that he explained that Diaz had yelled at him, and they had started arguing. Manoa and Millbrook started arguing and swearing at each other, becoming increasingly upset, and Diaz also started yelling. Manoa did not remember Millbrook saying he had a gun or otherwise threatening him.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Galvan testified that when Millbrook and his friends entered the kitchen, they were calm. He testified that the situation escalated, however, when no one answered Millbrook\u2019s repeated questions about what had happened, and Manoa said, \u201cHey, this is none of your business.\u201d Eventually, Galvan thought the argument had reached a point \u201cthat there was not going to be a way to de-escalate\u201d it, and he determined he needed \u201cto separate the two parties\u201d or else they would start physically fighting. Galvan was facing Manoa with his back to Millbrook, and he had his hand on Manoa\u2019s chest as he tried to break up the argument and to get Manoa to leave the party. Galvan recalled that Manoa\u2019s \u201cshoulders were real tense,\u201d and \u201che had his arms at his side, and they were balled up in fists\u201d throughout the argument. Manoa\u2019s facial expression was \u201cupset and angry.\u201d Galvan also testified that Manoa \u201cwas trying to stick his head around\u201d Galvan, who is six feet four inches tall, so Manoa could still see Millbrook and \u201ccontinue to argue with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">According to Millbrook, after Diaz took Velez outside, he was in the kitchen with several people he did not know, including Manoa and Galvan. Manoa was still angry from the fight with Velez, and Manoa\u2019s Mends were \u201cclosing in\u201d to find out what had happened. Millbrook testified that he felt \u201csurrounded.\u201d Describing his mental state, he said, \u201c[IJt\u2019s a small area. Everybody was against me. Everybody was [Manoa\u2019s] friend. No one\u2019s going to stick up for me. No one\u2019s going to take my side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Millbrook testified that he asked Galvan what was wrong. Even though Millbrook had not addressed Manoa, Manoa responded by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know who the fuck he is. Shut the fuck up. Don\u2019t worry about it, and get the fuck out of here.\u201d According to Millbrook, Galvan told him that he should leave Manoa alone and that he did not want to mess with Manoa. Millbrook recalled that he became \u201chumble\u201d and \u201creal quiet,\u201d afraid because he thought Manoa had a gun based on his earlier behavior. He also explained that he did not try to leave the house at this point because he would have had to walk by Manoa and because he was waiting for Diaz to shut down the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>Millbrook testified that Diaz came back into the kitchen and also asked what had happened. He characterized her as being \u201cvery calm,\u201d but Manoa was \u201cstill in a rage\u201d and told her, \u201cShut the fuck up, bitch. This ain\u2019t none of your business.\u201d According to Millbrook, he was angry that Manoa had called Diaz a \u201cbitch,\u201d and he felt that he needed to defend her. Millbrook tried to get Diaz to stop arguing with Manoa, pulling her toward him.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Millbrook testified that when Manoa did not calm down he began cursing at Manoa, and the men exchanged words. Millbrook remembered telling Manoa, \u201cFuck you. You need to get out. This is where the party is being shut down.\u201d He remembered Manoa responding, apparently referring to Placencia, \u201cI run this shit. This is my fucking house. I run this shit. Tell that bitch to wake up. Tell that bitch to come out. She needs to take care of me.\u201d Manoa was moving toward Millbrook, \u201creaching, long steps, hands in the air, gestures\u201d and trying to get around Galvan as Galvan held him back. Other people were closing in around Millbrook, laughing and yelling. Millbrook testified that he was scared.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">In explaining his fear in the moments before the shooting, as well as his reluctance to attend the party in the first place, Millbrook described at length his history of being threatened by a contemporary of his, Michael Pina, and several others, known collectively as \u201cthe Gun Boys,\u201d whom he often ran into in and around his hometown of San Lorenzo. Little evidence was presented to contradict Millbrook\u2019s testimony about being threatened by Pina and the Gun Boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Millbrook testified that he and Pina attended San Lorenzo High School together. One day, Pina and three others jumped Millbrook at school and, after that, the conflict escalated. Millbrook described one occasion in July 2008 when he was stopped at a light while driving and Pina, Bernardo Sandoval, and several others drove by, turned around, and pulled up next to him. He thought they were going to carjack him, and he sped away. The next day, Millbrook was driving and passed the same car, which was traveling in the opposite direction. The car made a U-tum and stopped in front of Millbrook\u2019s car, blocking it. Sandoval got out of the car, approached Millbrook, and pulled out a gun. Millbrook \u201chit the gas\u201d and got on the freeway. When he got home, Millbrook noticed that the driver\u2019s side door of his car had a bullet hole in it, and he realized Sandoval had shot at him. Millbrook reported the incident to the police, but his problems with Pina and the Gun Boys continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">A detective with the Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s Office testified and confirmed that Millbrook reported the incident. The detective observed and photographed the bullet hole in Millbrook\u2019s car. The detective then searched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>Sandoval\u2019s house, found two Uzis and multiple other weapons, and arrested him. Sandoval was eventually prosecuted for shooting at Millbrook.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Millbrook testified that he transferred to a different school and sought counseling as a result of his problems with Pina and his friends. He stopped going out and socializing as much, and he changed his driving routes because he was afraid to run into the Gun Boys. Due to the \u201cconstant!] . . . harass[ment]\u201d from the group, he also felt he had to get a gun to protect himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">According to Millbrook, his confrontation with Manoa in Placencia\u2019s kitchen brought to mind being victimized by Pina and his friends because of the people surrounding him, the high tension, and the yelling and shouting.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">E. <em>The Shooting.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">The prosecution\u2019s witnesses who testified about the shooting were Manoa, Galvan, Cesar, Adrian, and Sonia Gonzalez, another one of Placencia\u2019s coworkers. Their accounts varied in some respects, but they uniformly contradicted Millbrook\u2019s testimony that Manoa had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Manoa testified that very quickly after he began arguing with Millbrook, he saw Millbrook\u2019s friends move out of the way. Millbrook \u201clunged\u201d toward Manoa with his arm fully extended and shot him from about two feet away. Manoa denied saying or doing \u201canything threatening\u201d before Millbrook shot him. He also could not remember having threatened Diaz. He testified that he had never possessed or shot a gun in his life, and he repeatedly denied having had a gun that night or having made any movement with his hand to indicate he had a gun before he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Galvan, who had his back to Millbrook, testified that, within 20 to 25 seconds after the argument started, he saw Manoa take a step backward. Manoa then brought his hands up to his face, \u201cas if he was going to try to deflect a punch.\u201d Galvan pivoted to get out of the way because he thought a punch was being thrown. He felt a \u201cconcussive force\u201d near his face, heard a sound like a balloon popping, and felt something hit his hand, which was still close to Manoa\u2019s chest. He did not remember Manoa or Millbrook threatening the other, and he did not remember Manoa reaching for his waistband or saying he had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Cesar testified that he was surprised when he saw Millbrook pull out a gun and shoot Manoa because he did not think the argument had gone that far. He did not see Manoa move as if reaching for a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>Adrian testified that he saw Millbrook trying to calm Diaz. According to Adrian, Manoa told Millbrook, \u201cYou better check your bitch,\u201d meaning that he should quiet Diaz. Manoa testified that he could not remember saying this to Millbrook, although it was possible he had. Adrian recalled that Millbrook responded that Manoa should not talk to his girlfriend like that. Millbrook then reached for his gun, cocked it, and pointed his arm straight out and fired the gun toward Manoa. As was Cesar, Adrian was surprised when the gun came out because he did not believe that Manoa and Millbrook were on the verge of a physical fight. Adrian never saw Manoa with a gun and never heard him say anything to indicate he had one. He also never saw Millbrook \u201clunge\u201d with the gun or move toward Manoa, and he did not hear Millbrook threaten to kill Manoa.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Gonzalez testified that she heard Manoa say to Diaz, \u201cShut up, I\u2019m going to get somebody to beat your bitch-ass up.\u201d According to Gonzalez, Millbrook then pulled out his gun, pointed it with his arm straight out, and fired it. She did not remember seeing Millbrook cock the gun or lunge at Manoa, and she did not remember Millbrook saying anything before firing. She was also surprised when she saw the gun, because it was \u201c(j]ust a regular argument.\u201d She did not see Manoa make any aggressive movements or indicate that he had a gun. She did not remember whether Manoa had clenched fists.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Millbrook was the only defense witness to testify about the shooting.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He testified that Manoa was about 10 to 12 feet away from him. About 15 to 25 seconds after the argument started, Millbrook focused on Manoa\u2019s hands and saw him \u201cstarring] to clench one fist and essentially grasp something with the other.\u201d Although Millbrook could not see Manoa well because Galvan was in the way, it looked to Millbrook as if Manoa was grabbing a gun and preparing to shoot him or Diaz, who was slightly behind Millbrook. Millbrook testified that he saw Manoa pull out a gun and Galvan step to the side. Millbrook then saw Manoa point a nickel-plated, \u201cfairly big\u201d semiautomatic under Galvan\u2019s shoulder with his arm fully extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Millbrook testified that he became scared, and he panicked. He felt \u201ca rush of anxiety and adrenaline\u201d and pulled out his gun. He claimed that as he pulled out his gun from his waistband the slide caught in his pants, cocking the gun. He testified that he instinctively raised the gun, intentionally aimed it at Manoa, closed his eyes, and purposely shot it once. He opened his eyes and saw Manoa falling backward, still holding a gun. According to Millbrook, he did not cock or shoot his gun again.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>Millbrook testified that as he was pulling out the gun, he was \u201ctrying to stop\u201d Manoa. \u201cI was not trying to feel what [getting shot] felt like. I was not trying to be a victim again.\u201d He testified, however, that it was not his intent to kill Manoa. Millbrook testified that he loved Diaz and did not like it when other people treated her disrespectfully, but he denied shooting Manoa because he called Diaz a \u201cbitch\u201d or because he did not show her respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">F. <em>The Aftermath.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">After the gunshot, everyone in the room \u201cscatter[ed]\u201d out of the kitchen. Manoa and Galvan ran out the back door. A friend of Manoa took him to the hospital. Galvan drove himself to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Millbrook ran out the front of the house to his car. As he and Diaz were getting in the car, Diaz yelled, \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Cesar also ran outside and saw a Porsche Cayenne drive out of Placencia\u2019s driveway, hitting another car on the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">The police recovered one cartridge case from a fired bullet and one unfired bullet and cartridge case in Placencia\u2019s kitchen. Based on information from Diaz, they also recovered a gun, bullets, and a magazine from a roadside in Castro Valley. There is no indication in the record that a gun matching Millbrook\u2019s description of Manoa\u2019s weapon was ever recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">A ballistics expert testified that if a live bullet was in the chamber of a gun like Millbrook\u2019s and the slide was pulled back, the bullet would eject without firing. If the gun was fired, a cartridge case would fall out and another bullet would be chambered. In the former case, it would require \u201ca certain amount of force\u201d to pull back the slide in order for a chambered round to fall out, although the expert could not tell whether Millbrook\u2019s gun had any malfunctions that might make accidental cocking easier. Thus, the evidence recovered from Placencia\u2019s kitchen and the ballistics expert\u2019s testimony tended to suggest that Millbrook\u2019s gun had a bullet in the chamber when he pulled it out, that it was unlikely that the slide went back accidentally when the gun was pulled out, and that Millbrook shot only one bullet.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Manoa was shot in the chest, and the bullet lodged in his spine.

The jury was properly instructed that Millbrook was not guilty of attempted murder if he acted reasonably in self-defense and that he was alternatively guilty of the lesser included offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter if he acted unreasonably in self-defense (imperfect self-defense). (See <em>People v. Humphrey </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1073, 1082 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 142, 921 P.2d 1].) But Millbrook did not ask for, and the trial court did not on its own initiative give, an instruction that he was guilty of attempted voluntary manslaughter if he acted \u201cupon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion\u201d (a heat-of-passion instruction). (\u00a7 192, subd. (a).) On appeal, he argues that his conviction for attempted murder must be reversed because the jury was not instructed on this form of attempted voluntary manslaughter. We agree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">1. <em>The elements of attempted murder and attempted voluntary manslaughter are well established.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">We begin by reviewing the elements of attempted murder and attempted voluntary manslaughter. \u201cMurder is the unlawful killing of a human being . . . with malice aforethought.\u201d (\u00a7 187, subd. (a).) \u201cAn attempt to commit a crime consists of two elements: a specific intent to commit the crime, and a direct but ineffectual act done toward its commission.\u201d (\u00a7 21a.) Thus, \u201c \u2018[attempted murder requires the specific intent to kill and the commission of a direct but ineffectual act toward accomplishing the intended killing.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

In particular, even if the defendant testifies to a state of mind inconsistent with the theory of a lesser included offense, substantial evidence may still support an instruction on that offense. <em>(Breverman, </em>at p. 163, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Turning to the case before us, we first observe that there is nothing in the jury\u2019s verdict that is inconsistent with the need for a heat-of-passion instruction. If the jury had returned a verdict on the allegation that Millbrook\u2019s attempted murder of Manoa was willful, premeditated, and deliberate, the finding would have been \u201cmanifestly inconsistent with having acted under the heat of passion.\u201d <em>(People v. Wharton </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 522, 572 [280 Cal.Rptr. 631, 809 P.2d 290].) But the jury was unable to return such a verdict. And although the jury must have found that Millbrook intended to kill since such a finding is a prerequisite for a conviction of attempted murder, the finding does not rule out the possibility that Millbrook acted upon a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion. (See <em>Beltran, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 942.) This possibility was similarly not ruled out by the jury\u2019s rejection of the two self-defense theories upon which it was instructed\u2014that Millbrook was not guilty of attempted murder because he acted in reasonable self-defense and, in the alternative, that Millbrook was guilty only of attempted voluntary manslaughter because he acted in imperfect self-defense. Indeed, \u201c \u2018[i]n the usual case,\u2019 \u201d a heat-of-passion instruction \u201c \u2018supplements the self-defense instruction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. St. Martin </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 524, 531 [83 Cal.Rptr. 166, 463 P.2d 390]; see, e.g., <em>Breverman, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 148, 162-164 [error not to give heat-of-passion instruction where jury instructed on both theories of self-defense]; <em>Barton, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at pp. 202-203 [sufficient evidence supported giving both heat-of-passion and imperfect self-defense instructions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">We recognize that a heat-of-passion instruction is not always warranted \u201cwhere the same facts\u201d supporting it \u201cwould give rise to a finding of reasonable self-defense.\u201d <em>(People v. Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 328 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311].) But this is not such a case. Millbrook\u2019s testimony that Manoa pulled out a gun and that he thought Manoa was going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>to shoot him would have supported a finding of self-defense. Even if the jury did not believe that Millbrook shot in self-defense, however, it still could have concluded that he shot in the heat of passion arising from Manoa\u2019s treatment' of him or Diaz or from a fear that did not rise to the level of fear required to establish self-defense. (See <em>People v. Mitchell </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 237, 252 [93 P.2d 121] (dis. opn. of Houser, J.) [\u201c[h]eat of passion may be produced by fear as well as by rage . . . ,\u201d and \u201c[provocation sufficient to produce a heat of passion . . . may, under slightly varied circumstances, justify a person in killing in self-defense\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Having concluded that nothing in the jury\u2019s verdict is inconsistent with the need for a heat-of-passion instruction,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we next consider whether there was substantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Millbrook, to support such an instruction. We conclude there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Attempted manslaughter based on a sudden quarrel or heat of passion has both a subjective and an objective component (see <em>People v. Moye </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 537, 549 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 113, 213 P.3d 652] <em>(Moye)), </em>and we consider each in turn. To satisfy the subjective component, the defendant must have attempted to kill \u201cwhile under \u2018the <em>actual </em>influence of a strong passion\u2019 induced by [adequate] provocation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 550, italics added.) As a result, \u201c[i]f sufficient time has elapsed for one\u2019s passions to \u2018cool off\u2019 and for judgment to be restored,\u201d malice is not negated. <em>(Beltran, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 951.) \u201cNo specific type of provocation is required, and \u2018the passion aroused need not be anger or rage, but can be any \u201c \u2018 \u201c[vjiolent, intense, high-wrought or enthusiastic emotion\u201d \u2019 \u201d [citations] other than revenge.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

(See <em>People v. Humphrey, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 1082.) But substantial evidence was presented upon which the jury could nonetheless have found that Millbrook was acting under the actual influence of extreme emotion. This evidence included testimony that Manoa had acted belligerently throughout the party and had engaged in intense arguments with Diaz and Velez; testimony that Manoa was the one who escalated the fight with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>Millbrook; testimony that Manoa, who was much bigger than Millbrook, had clenched his fists and \u201clunged\u201d at Millbrook before being shot; testimony that Galvan intervened in the argument and had his hand on Manoa to prevent a physical altercation; testimony that Manoa had threatened to get someone to beat Diaz and told Millbrook to \u201ccheck your bitch\u201d immediately before the shooting; testimony that Millbrook was angered by Manoa\u2019s treatment of Diaz; and testimony that Millbrook had been threatened in violent incidents in the past and was intimidated by Manoa\u2019s size and by being surrounded by Manoa\u2019s friends. Although Millbrook denied shooting Manoa because Manoa disrespected Diaz, the jury was entitled to disbelieve Millbrook\u2019s <em>reason </em>for shooting and to rely on the other evidence we have identified to find that Millbrook shot spontaneously and under the influence of extreme emotion. <em>(Breverman, </em>supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 163, fn. 10; see, e.g., <em>People v. Logan </em>(1917) 175 Cal. 45, 46-47, 50 [164 P. 1121] [defendant entitled to heat-of-passion instruction where evidence demonstrated victim\u2019s \u201cphysical superiority\u201d and defendant\u2019s \u201cfear that he was about to be subjected to a second humiliating beating\u201d at victim\u2019s hands]; <em>People v. Anderson </em>(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 430, 443, 446-447 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 910] [evidence that \u201cfatal chokehold was motivated by rage at the victim\u2019s unprovoked attack\u201d sufficient to require heat-of-passion instruction].)</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">There was also substantial evidence presented to support the objective component of heat of passion. To satisfy this component, \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe accused\u2019s heat of passion must be due to \u2018sufficient provocation.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Moye, </em>supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 549.) The victim must cause the provocation or the defendant must reasonably believe that the victim caused it. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 549-550.) \u201cThe provocative conduct by the victim may be physical or verbal, but the conduct must be sufficiently provocative that it would cause an ordinary person of average disposition to act rashly or without due deliberation and reflection.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 550; see <em>Beltran, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 949 [\u201cthe provocation must be one that would cause an emotion so intense that an ordinary person would simply <em>react, </em>without reflection\u201d (original italics)].) As our Supreme Court recently clarified, in determining whether the conduct was adequately provocative, the question is whether it would cause an ordinary person of average disposition \u201cto react from passion and not from judgment,\u201d <em>not </em>whether it \u201cwould cause an ordinary person of average disposition <em>to </em>kill\u201d (or attempt to kill). <em>(Beltran, </em>at pp. 939, 938, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">\u201cGenerally, it is a question of fact for the jury whether the circumstances were sufficient to arouse the passions of the ordinarily reasonable person.\u201d <em>(People v. Fenenbock </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1688, 1705 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 608]; see <em>Beltran, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at pp. 950-951.) While it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>true that a court may decide the issue of adequate provocation if \u201cthe provocation is so slight. . . that reasonable jurors could not differ on the issue of adequacy . . .\u201d <em>(Fenenbock, </em>at p. 1705), the provocation shown here is not so slight that we can conclude, as a matter of law, that a reasonable jury would have been unable to find that Millbrook acted upon a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The jury could have found adequate provocation in several ways. To begin with, the jury could have found it based on the evidence presented of Manoa\u2019s treatment of Diaz. Several witnesses testified that Diaz and Manoa had a serious argument, which Millbrook likely knew about. In addition, two witnesses testified that Manoa said something insulting about or to Diaz immediately before being shot: \u201cYou better check your bitch,\u201d according to Adrian, and \u201cShut up, I\u2019m going to get somebody to beat your bitch-ass up,\u201d according to Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The jury also could have found adequate provocation based on Manoa\u2019s other belligerent and threatening behavior. As mentioned above, this evidence included testimony that Manoa had been aggressive throughout the night, including engaging in shouting matches with Velez in addition to Diaz; testimony that Manoa was the one who escalated the fight with Millbrook; testimony that Manoa had his hands clenched and \u201clunged\u201d at Millbrook immediately before being shot; and testimony that Galvan intervened right before the shooting with his hand on Manoa to prevent an escalation of the argument. In short, evidence of Manoa\u2019s treatment of Diaz and of Manoa\u2019s menacing behavior was sufficient to permit a jury to conclude that a reasonable person in Millbrook\u2019s position could have acted in the heat of passion.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Decisions in cases with similar facts support our conclusion that sufficient evidence of provocation was presented. In <em>Barton, </em>the defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and argued on appeal that the trial court erred by giving a heat-of-passion instruction over his objection. <em>(Barton, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at pp. 190, 201.) Our Supreme Court disagreed, concluding that \u201c[t]he record contained] substantial evidence, some of it offered by the prosecution and some by the defense,\u201d to support a heat-of-passion instruction. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 202.) That evidence showed that shortly before the defendant shot the victim, the defendant\u2019s daughter had told him that the victim tried to run her car off the road and had spat on her car window. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant and his daughter then confronted the victim, at which point the victim called the daughter a \u201c \u2018bitch\u2019 \u201d and acted \u201c \u2018berserk.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant and the victim then confronted each other, with the victim assuming a \u201c \u2018fighting stance.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>After the defendant asked his daughter to call the police, the victim tried to leave in his car and the defendant asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>him where he was going. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The victim \u201creplied, \u2018none of your fucking business,\u2019 and taunted [the] defendant by saying, \u2018Do you think you can keep me here?\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant began \u201c[streaming and swearing\u201d and threatened to shoot if the victim did not drop his knife (although the evidence conflicted as to whether the victim actually had one). <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, as here, testimony was presented that a person close to the defendant was threatened or disrespected, the defendant and the victim argued, and the defendant felt threatened when he shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">In a recent decision from this appellate district also involving a fight that led to a shooting, our colleagues in Division Three reversed a conviction for second degree murder because the jury was not given a heat-of-passion instruction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 630, 633 [160 Cal.Rptr.3d 468], review den. Oct. 30, 2013, S213262) <em>(Thomas).) </em>In <em>Thomas, </em>the defendant engaged in a \u201c \u2018pretty heated\u2019 \u201d argument with the victim and the victim\u2019s friends after the defendant blocked in the friends\u2019 car. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 634-635, 645.) Witnesses agreed that at least one of the victim\u2019s friends punched and beat the defendant. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 635, 639, 645.) Testimony was presented that the defendant then went to his car and retrieved a gun, that the defendant seemed angry, and that the defendant\u2019s father tried to calm him. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 645.) According to the defendant, the victim then approached and \u201clunged at him,\u201d making the defendant believe the victim was trying to get the defendant\u2019s gun. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant testified that \u201c[h]e fired because he was afraid, nervous and not thinking clearly.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">As in our case, prosecution and defense witnesses in <em>Thomas </em>agreed that a sudden quarrel preceded the shooting, and evidence was presented that the defendant felt both angered and threatened by the victim. But in our case it was the victim himself who was belligerent and threatening rather than the victim\u2019s friends. And whereas the defendant in <em>Thomas, supra, </em>218 Cal.App.4th 630 had some time to \u201c \u2018cool off\u2019 \u201d while retrieving his gun and speaking with his father <em>(Beltran, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 951), Millbrook shot Manoa in the midst of their argument. Thus, the evidence of provocation in the case before us is more compelling than it was in <em>Thomas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The circumstances here\u2014Manoa\u2019s disrespectful treatment of Diaz, the sudden quarrel between him and Millbrook, and Manoa\u2019s threatening behavior before and during the argument\u2014also distinguish our case from decisions holding that insults alone are insufficient to constitute adequate provocation. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Enraca </em>(2012) 53 Cal.4th 735, 743-744, 759 [137 Cal.Rptr.3d 117, 269 P.3d 543] [gang-related insults]; <em>People v.

While our conclusion that a jury could have found adequate provocation might be different if Manoa had merely cursed or insulted Millbrook, various witnesses\u2019 testimony about Manoa\u2019s statements to and about Diaz and his threatening behavior throughout the night and immediately before the shooting were sufficient under California law to require the trial court to give a heat-of-passion instruction sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">3. <em>Whether trial courts ever have a duty under the federal Constitution to give sua sponte a heat-of-passion instruction in a noncapital case is unresolved.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Millbrook contends that the failure to instruct the jury on the heat-of-passion form of attempted voluntary manslaughter violated his federal constitutional rights. He argues that, as a result, the federal constitutional standard for assessing prejudice applies, requiring reversal unless it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict. <em>(Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824] <em>(Chapman).) </em>This federal standard contrasts with the less stringent standard for assessing prejudice from a state constitutional error, which requires reversal only if there is a reasonable probability that the error contributed to the verdict. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243] <em>(Watson).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Whether the federal standard applies in assessing prejudice when a trial court fails to give sua sponte a heat-of-passion instruction in a noncapital murder case is unresolved. Although we ultimately conclude that Millbrook was prejudiced under the state standard, we take a moment to consider the federal constitutional issues because the case authority on this important question is inconclusive and because, as we discuss below, our Supreme Court in <em>Thomas </em>explicitly directed the Court of Appeal to consider the federal constitutional issues. (Supreme Ct. mins., <em>People v. Thomas, </em>Aug. 29, 2012, S203557, p. 1518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">We begin with <em>Breverman. </em>In that case, our Supreme Court applied the <em>Watson </em>standard <em>(Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 299 P.2d 243) to assess the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>trial court\u2019s failure to give sua sponte a heat-of-passion instruction in a noncapital case. <em>(Breverman, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 148-149, 165.) In broad language, the court \u201crejected] any implication that the alleged error at issue in this case\u2014the failure to instruct sua sponte on an uncharged lesser included offense, or any aspect thereof\u2014is one which arises under the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 165.) It observed that \u201cthe United States Supreme Court has expressly refrained from recognizing a federal constitutional right to instructions on lesser included offenses in noncapital cases\u201d in two cases in which the defendants had requested such instructions. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 165-166 &amp; fn. 14.) Our Supreme Court explained that in one of those cases, <em>Beck v. Alabama </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 625 [65 L.Ed.2d 392, 100 S.Ct. 2382] <em>(Beck), </em>the United States Supreme Court \u201cacknowledged that in particular circumstances, the denial of instructions on lesser included offenses <em>in a capital case </em>would violate the federal Constitution.\u201d <em>(Breverman, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 166, original italics.) But our Supreme Court pointed out that subsequent decisions limited <em>Beck </em>and \u201csuggested the United States Supreme Court\u2019s] reluctance to formulate any general constitutional right to instructions on lesser offenses.\u201d <em>(Breverman, </em>at p. 166.) Our Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthe high court\u2019s decisions leave substantial doubt that the federal Constitution confers <em>any </em>right to lesser included offense instructions in noncapital cases\u201d and \u201cprovide no basis whatever for a conclusion that the federal charter would require such instructions, as does California, <em>on the court\u2019s own motion.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> (Breverman, </em>at p. 168, original italics.) Accordingly, the <em>Breverman </em>court \u201caffirm[ed] that the rule requiring sua sponte instructions on all lesser necessarily included offenses supported by the evidence derives exclusively from California law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">This discussion would seem to have resolved the question whether a failure to give sua sponte a heat-of-passion instruction implicates the federal Constitution. But another portion of <em>Breverman </em>makes clear that it did not. In a footnote, the court expressly declined to decide whether such a failure to instruct could constitute a federal constitutional error on the theory that it presented to the jury an incomplete definition of malice, which is an element of the charge of murder, and thus relieved the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving all elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Breverman, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 170, fn. 19 [observing that \u201c[t]he issues presented by such a claim must properly await a case in which they have been clearly raised and fully briefed\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at pp. 189-190 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.) [arguing that the instructional error violated the federal Constitution for this reason].) Our Supreme Court has subsequently reaffirmed that this issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>remains open. (See <em>Moye, supra, </em>47 Cal.4th at p. 558, fn. 5 [declining to decide the issue because the defendant had not properly preserved the claim of federal constitutional error]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Lasko, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 113 [explaining that <em>Breverman </em>\u201cdeclined to consider whether [the] error violated the federal Constitution by giving the jury an incomplete definition of malice\u201d].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">In <em>Thomas, </em>the Court of Appeal ultimately concluded in a published opinion that a trial court\u2019s failure to give a requested heat-of-passion instruction in a noncapital case amounted to a federal constitutional error subject to review under <em>Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18. <em>(Thomas, supra, </em>218 Cal.App.4th at pp. 642-644.) In doing so, the court relied on <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 684, 704 [44 L.Ed.2d 508, 95 S.Ct. 1881] <em>(Mullaney), </em>in which the United States Supreme Court held that federal due process \u201crequires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of the heat of passion on sudden provocation when the issue is properly presented in a homicide case.\u201d Justice Kennard also relied on <em>Mullaney </em>in her dissent in <em>Breverman. (Breverman, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 190 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The procedural history of <em>Thomas, </em>both before and after the Court of Appeal reached its ultimate conclusion that <em>Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18 applies, reinforces the uncertainty whether a failure to give a heat-of-passion instruction implicates the federal Constitution. When the defendant in <em>Thomas </em>first appealed, the Court of Appeal affirmed his conviction of second degree murder by relying on <em>Breverman </em>and concluding in a nonpublished opinion that the trial court\u2019s failure to give a requested heat-of-passion instruction was harmless under <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818. <em>(Thomas, supra, </em>218 Cal.App.4th at p. 633; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(May 16, 2012, A129933) [nonpub. opn.].) Our Supreme Court granted the defendant\u2019s petition for review and remanded the case back to the Court of Appeal \u201cwith directions to address defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct on heat of passion voluntary manslaughter constituted federal constitutional error.\u201d (Supreme Ct. mins., <em>People v. Thomas, </em>Aug. 29, 2012, S203557, p. 1518.) Acting on this remand, the Court of Appeal then reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction of second degree murder by concluding that the failure to give a heat-of-passion instruction was a federal constitutional error subject to review under <em>Chapman. (Thomas, supra, </em>218 Cal.App.4th at pp. 633, 642-644.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>Attorney General\u2019s petition for review of the revised <em>Thomas </em>decision was denied. (Supreme Ct. mins., <em>People v. Thomas, </em>Oct. 30, 2013, S213262, p. 1794.)</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The full import of <em>Thomas </em>is thus unclear. The Court of Appeal apparently viewed our Supreme Court\u2019s directions in its remand as a signal to consider the issue\u2014similar to the one reserved in footnote 19 of <em>Breverman, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at page 170\u2014whether the failure to give a heat-of-passion instruction violates the federal Constitution under <em>Mullaney, supra, </em>421 U.S. 684 because it does not ensure that the jury finds true beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the charged offense. The Court of Appeal answered in the affirmative.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But the remand and subsequent denial of the petition to review the Court of Appeal\u2019s application of <em>Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18 could alternatively indicate that a <em>refusal </em>to give a requested heat-of-passion instruction in a noncapital case may violate the federal Constitution for some reason other than that suggested by <em>Mullaney </em>and that is inapplicable in a sua sponte case. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 826, 871-872 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 141 P.3d 135] [considering the possibility that the failure to give a requested instruction on a lesser included offense \u201cembodying the defense theory of the case and around which the defendant had built his or her defense\u201d may \u201cviolate[] the defendant\u2019s due process right to present a complete defense\u201d]; <em>Solis v. Garcia, supra, </em>219 F.3d at p. 929 [same].) Ultimately, we need not decide the difficult issue whether the error here violated the federal Constitution and should be evaluated under <em>Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18 because we conclude that the error was prejudicial even under the less stringent <em>Watson </em>standard <em>(Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818 [299 P.2d 243]).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">4. <em>The instructional error was prejudicial under </em>Watson.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">An error is prejudicial under <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818 if, \u201c \u2018 \u2018 \u201cafter an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence,\u201d [the reviewing court] is of the \u201copinion\u201d that it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilkins </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 333, 351 [153 Cal.Rptr.3d 519, 295 P.3d 903].) As our Supreme Court has \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018made clear[,] ... a \u201cprobability\u201d in this context does not mean more likely than not, but merely a reasonable chance, more than an abstract possibility.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>We conclude that there is a reasonable chance that the jury would have convicted Millbrook of attempted voluntary manslaughter based upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion if it had been given the opportunity to do so. The evidence conflicted as to what prompted Millbrook to shoot Manoa and what his state of mind was when he fired the shot. While there was little evidence that Manoa had a gun or that Millbrook acted in self-defense, the jury could not agree that the shooting was willful, deliberate, and premeditated. Keeping in mind the evidence favorable to Millbrook, including the evidence that Manoa provoked their quarrel and that Millbrook spontaneously shot him, we conclude that there is more than an abstract possibility that the jury would have found Millbrook guilty of the lesser included offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter if it had been given a heat-of-passion instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The likelihood of prejudice was enhanced because the prosecutor argued in closing that Millbrook shot Manoa out of anger after being provoked. The prosecutor argued, \u201c[Millbrook] has no defense. Because he got mad. He got mad when Sione Manoa used the word \u2018bitch\u2019 and he pulled that gun out and shot Mr. Manoa in the chest.\u201d The prosecutor also said, in arguing that Millbrook had not acted in self-defense, \u201cYou\u2019ll be told that words do not justify this type of act of violence. They can\u2019t. Otherwise, it\u2019s the wild, wild west out there. You say something about my mama, I get to shoot you. Aoid then you say, Hey, it was self-defense. I get to bring a gun around until somebody says something I don\u2019t like and calls me a bitch or calls the woman I love a bitch, and then I get to shoot them . . . and try to claim it\u2019s self-defense. None of us are signed up for that.\u201d But while words alone may not justify self-defense, they may be sufficiently provocative to support a jury\u2019s finding that a defendant acted in the heat of passion <em>(Moye, supra, </em>47 Cal.4th at p. 550; 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (4th ed. 2012) Crimes Against the Person, \u00a7 236, p. 1059), especially when they are coupled with evidence of the kind of threatening behavior that witnesses testified occurred in this case. Thus, if it had been given a heat-of-passion instruction, the jury could have accepted the prosecutor\u2019s basic theory of the case and still concluded that Millbrook was only guilty of attempted voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Citing <em>Moye, </em>the Attorney General argues that when a jury rejects both reasonable and imperfect self-defense, \u201cit is unlikely that a defendant could have obtained a more favorable result with an instruction on heat-of-passion voluntary manslaughter.\u201d In doing so, she relies on <em>Moye\u2019s </em>conclusion that the failure to give a heat-of-passion instruction in that case was harmless under <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818 because, once the jury rejected the factual basis for both theories of self-defense, \u201cthere was little if any independent evidence remaining to support [the defendant\u2019s] further claim that he killed in the heat of passion, and no direct testimonial evidence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>defendant himself to support an inference that he subjectively harbored such strong passion, or acted rashly or impulsively while under its influence for reasons unrelated to his perceived need for self-defense.\u201d <em>(Moye, supra, </em>47 Cal.4th at p. 557, italics omitted.) But this discussion was based on the facts, and the facts are different here. The only evidence supporting a heat-of-passion instruction in <em>Moye </em>was the defendant\u2019s own testimony that he acted in self-defense. Thus, in rejecting the self-defense argument, the jury in <em>Moye </em>necessarily rejected the only evidence that would have supported a heat-of-passion instruction. In contrast, the jury here did not necessarily reject all the evidence supporting a heat-of-passion instruction by refusing to find that Millbrook acted in self-defense. Although it almost certainly rejected Millbrook\u2019s testimony that Manoa was holding a gun at the time of the shooting, there was significant other evidence supporting a theory of attempted voluntary manslaughter on the basis of heat of passion. <em>Moye </em>does not hold that a failure to instruct on heat of passion can never be prejudicial when a jury rejects a finding of self-defense, and neither will we.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Finally, the Attorney General argues that it is \u201chighly improbable\u201d the jury would have found that Millbrook shot Manoa in a heat of passion because if he had, \u201che would have stayed at the scene and explained the shooting to the police\u201d instead of fleeing. It is true that immediate flight may reflect a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt, and the jury was so instructed. (\u00a7 1127c; <em>Beltran, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 957.) But the Attorney General fails to cite any authority, and we are aware of hone, supporting the proposition that defendants tend to flee only when they have committed certain crimes but not others. We do not buy the argument that Millbrook\u2019s flight demonstrates an awareness of guilt of attempted murder but not of attempted voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Even though substantial evidence was presented that Millbrook may have been acting on a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion when he shot Manoa, the instructions were \u201cbereft of any indication that the jury could consider [Millbrook\u2019s] emotional excitement as a factor that could reduce his criminal culpability.\u201d <em>(Thomas, supra, </em>218 Cal.App.4th at p. 645.) We conclude that there is a reasonable probability that, had it been given the opportunity, the jury would have found that Millbrook was guilty of attempted voluntary manslaughter because he was acting upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion. Accordingly, Millbrook\u2019s conviction for attempted murder cannot be sustained.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>B. <em>Millbrook\u2019s Conviction for Attempted Murder Was Supported by Sufficient Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">We next turn to whether Millbrook\u2019s conviction for attempted murder was supported by sufficient evidence. Even though we have reversed the conviction, we must decide this issue because the People are permitted to retry Millbrook for the charge only if sufficient evidence was presented in the first trial to support it. <em>(United States v. DiFrancesco </em>(1980) 449 U.S. 117, 131 [66 L.Ed.2d 328, 101 S.Ct. 426]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1, 6-7 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 514, 64 P.3d 800].) We conclude that sufficient evidence was presented to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">In evaluating whether sufficient evidence supports a conviction, we \u201c \u2018 \u201creview the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Clark </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 856, 942-943 [131 Cal.Rptr.3d 225, 261 P.3d 243].) We consider all the evidence presented, including circumstantial evidence, and \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">\u201c[IJntent to kill or express malice, the mental state required to convict a defendant of attempted murder, may in many cases be inferred from the defendant\u2019s acts and the circumstances of the crime.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 733, 741 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 163, 124 P.3d 730].) In particular, \u201c \u2018[t]he act of firing toward a victim at a close, but not point blank, range \u201cin a manner that could have inflicted a mortal wound had the bullet been on target is sufficient to support an inference of intent to kill . . .\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid), </em>even if the defendant shoots \u201cwithout advance consideration.\u201d <em>(People v. Arias </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 92, 162 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 913 P.2d 980].)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Here, Millbrook admitted pointing the gun at Manoa and intentionally shooting it, and Manoa testified that the gun was no more than two feet away from him when Millbrook fired. Neither the fact that Manoa survived nor the fact that Millbrook shot only once \u201ccompel[s] the conclusion that [Millbrook] lacked the animus to kill in the first instance.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 741.) The evidence that Millbrook intentionally shot at Manoa\u2019s chest at close range was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that Millbrook had the requisite express malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Millbrook acknowledges the principle \u201cthat [an] intent to kill can be inferred from a potentially fatal shooting at close range,\u201d but he argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>this case is distinguishable because the shooting occurred during a fight in which Millbrook felt threatened, and \u201cthe drawing of his weapon and shooting it [did] not demonstrate an intent to kill, but rather demonstrated a reflexive type of reaction to protect himself and [Diaz] from harm.\u201d We disagree. This contention is tantamount to arguing that Millbrook acted in self-defense when he shot Manoa. But because the jury rejected a finding of either form of self-defense, Millbrook cannot now essentially claim that the evidence shows that he acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">In addition, while it is true that shooting reflexively, without thought, does not establish an intent to kill (see <em>People v. Arias, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 162), Millbrook\u2019s testimony that he intentionally pulled the gun from his pants, aimed it at Manoa, and shot it was sufficient for the jury to have concluded that the shooting was not reflexive. Even if there was some evidence that the shooting was reflexive, we cannot disregard the substantial other evidence supporting the determination that Millbrook had an unlawful intent to kill when he shot Manoa. (See <em>People v. Lee </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 620, 632 [122 Cal.Rptr.3d 117, 248 P.3d 651] [evidentiary conflicts do not justify reversal when reviewing for sufficiency of the evidence].)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Millbrook also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument improperly told the jury that it could convict Millbrook of attempted murder if it found he acted with a conscious disregard for life. He takes issue with the prosecutor\u2019s statements that (1) \u201ceverybody knows when you point a gun at somebody and it goes off, horrible, horrible things happen\u201d; (2) \u201c[w]hen you point a gun at somebody\u2019s chest and pull the trigger, what else are you trying to do?\u201d; (3) \u201c[w]hat did [Millbrook] think was gonna happen? You shoot a man in the chest. He is trying to stop [Manoa] permanently\u201d; and (4) \u201cwe don\u2019t have a window in[to] people\u2019s minds. The instructions basically allow you to consider their conduct [in determining intent]. And if any of us are standing there and watching me shoot somebody from this distance, there would be no question. Of course I\u2019m trying to kill [Manoa] when shooting him in the chest from this far.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">We do not perceive how these remarks bear on whether the evidence was sufficient to support Millbrook\u2019s conviction of attempted murder. The prosecutor made the statements in closing argument, and they were not evidence, as the jury was instructed. <em>(People v. Stanley </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 913, 961, fn. 10 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 420, 140 P.3d 736] [\u201c \u2018[i]t is axiomatic that argument is not evidence\u2019 \u201d].) To the extent Millbrook attempts to suggest that the remarks constituted prosecutorial misconduct, he has waived the claim by not previously objecting to them. (See <em>People v. Gray </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 168, 215 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 451, 118 P.3d 496].) And even if he had preserved the claim, we would reject it on its merits. The prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>statements accurately reflect the principles that \u201c \u2018[a] defendant\u2019s specific intent to commit a crime may be inferred from all of the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Scott </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 452, 488 [129 Cal.Rptr.3d 91, 257 P.3d 703]) and that, in particular, \u201cthe act of purposefully firing a lethal weapon at another human being at close range, without legal excuse, generally gives rise to an inference that the shooter acted with express malice.\u201d <em>(People v. Smith, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 742.) The jury was expressly instructed that to find Millbrook guilty of attempted murder it had to find that he intended to kill Manoa. There was no misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">We conclude that sufficient evidence supports Millbrook\u2019s conviction for attempted murder. Thus, the People may retry him on this charge if they elect to do so. But if they do not elect to do so, we order that the judgment be modified to reflect a conviction of attempted voluntary manslaughter. We are \u201c \u2018not restricted to the remedies of affirming or reversing [the] judgment. Where the prejudicial error goes only to the degree of the offense for which the defendant was convicted, the appellate court may reduce the conviction to a lesser degree and affirm the judgment as modified, thereby obviating the necessity for a retrial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 107, 118 [216 Cal.Rptr. 397, 702 P.2d 555]; see <em>Thomas, supra, 218 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 647; \u00a7 1260.) Accordingly, the People will have the option of retrying Millbrook for attempted murder or accepting a modification of the judgment to reflect a conviction for attempted voluntary manslaughter and to strike the enhancement allegation under section 12022.53, subdivision (d).
