Thus, we vacate the order granting summary adjudication in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">A. <em>The 1981 Excess and Umbrella Insurance Policy Transport Issued to Vulcan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">Petitioner Transport Insurance Company (Transport) issued to Vulcan Materials Company (Vulcan)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a commercial excess and umbrella liability insurance policy (policy No. XGL-731-81-1), for the period January 1, 1981, to January 1, 1982 (Transport Policy). Endorsement No. 40 to the Transport Policy named R.R. Street &amp; Co., Inc. (Street), as an additional insured with respect to its distribution or sale of perchloroethylene (PCE), a solvent used in the dry cleaning industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">The insuring provision of the Transport Policy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-12\">\u201cCoverage A\u2014Personal Injury Liability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-13\">\u201cCoverage B\u2014Property Damage Liability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-14\">\u201cCoverage C\u2014Advertising Liability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-15\">\u201cThe Company will indemnify the Insured for ultimate net loss in excess of the retained limit hereinafter stated which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-16\">\u201cA. personal injury or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-17\">\u201cB. property damage or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>\u201cC. advertising injury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-4\">\u201cto which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-5\">\u201c(1) With respect to any personal injury, property damage or advertising injury not within the terms of the coverage of underlying insurance but within the terms of coverage of this insurance; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-6\">\u201c(2) If limits of liability of the underlying insurance are exhausted because of personal injury, property damage or advertising injury during the period of this policy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-7\">\u201cThe Company will</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-8\">\u201c(a) have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such personal injury, property damage or advertising injury, even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent, and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient; but the Company shall not be obligated to pay any claim or judgment or to defend any suit after the Company\u2019s limit of liability has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">The Transport Policy\u2019s schedule of underlying insurance, schedule A, identified nine insurance policies issued to Vulcan, including three Aetna insurance company policies for automobile and general liability. Street was not an insured under any of the Aetna insurance company policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">B. <em>The Underlying Actions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">Vulcan and Street were named as defendants in actions entitled <em>City of Modesto v. Dow Chemical Co. </em>(Super. Ct. S.E City and County, 2011, No. CGC98999345), <em>City of Modesto v. Dow Chemical Co. </em>(Super. Ct. S.E City and County, 2011, No. CGC98999643), and <em>City of Modesto </em>v. <em>Dow Chemical Co. </em>(Super. Ct. Contra Costa County, 2010, No. MSC06-01019) (collectively, the Underlying Actions).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs in the Underlying Actions alleged that Vulcan manufactured, distributed, and sold PCE, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>Street distributed or sold or both distributed and sold to dry cleaners in Modesto PCE manufactured by Vulcan. The plaintiffs in those actions further alleged that PCE was released into the soil and groundwater and sought recovery for, inter alia, property damage caused by the resulting environmental contamination. National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (National Union), provided a defense to Street in the Underlying Actions pursuant to the National Union general liability policies in effect from December 31, 1986, through October 1, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">C. <em>Legacy Vulcan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">In <em>Legacy Vulcan Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 677 [110 Cal.Rptr.3d 795] <em>(Legacy Vulcan),</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Transport brought a declaratory relief action concerning its and Vulcan\u2019s rights and obligations under the Transport Policy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 685.) Vulcan and Transport submitted to the trial court three stipulated legal questions that concerned the scope of Transport\u2019s duty to defend Vulcan under the Transport Policy. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 681, 685.) As relevant here, one of the questions concerned the meaning of the phrase \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d as used in the provision that established a duty to defend with respect to umbrella coverage under the policy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 685.) The trial court ruled that because the Transport Policy \u201cdid not expressly define the term \u2018underlying insurance\u2019 to include only those policies listed in Schedule A, that term should be interpreted to include all primary policies in effect at any time during the period of a continuous loss.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 686.) Vulcan filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the trial court\u2019s order, and the Court of Appeal issued an order to show cause. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 687.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">In its writ petition, Vulcan contended that the term \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d included only the policies listed in schedule A, rather than all primary policies in effect during the period of a continuous loss. <em>(Legacy Vulcan, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th at p. 688.) The Court of Appeal noted that insurance policies are interpreted using the same rules of interpretation applicable to other contracts, the terms of an insurance policy are ambiguous if susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, and any \u201c \u2018ambiguity must be resolved in a manner consistent with the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured in light of the nature and kind of risks covered by the policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Legacy Vulcan, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th at p. 688.) The court also pointed out that the interpretation of a policy is a judicial function unless the interpretation turns on the credibility of extrinsic evidence. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">The Court of Appeal held that the term \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d was ambiguous as it was used in the provision establishing a duty to defend with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>respect to umbrella coverage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Legacy Vulcan, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th at pp. 682, 688, 690.) That is, because the term \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d was an expressly qualified term under other provisions in the policy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but not with respect to umbrella coverage, \u201cthe term \u2018underlying insurance\u2019 as used in the policy should be considered a generic term that, absent an explicit qualification, is neither limited to the underlying insurance listed in Schedule A nor encompasses all underlying insurance. This creates an ambiguity as to the meaning of the unqualified term \u2018underlying insurance.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 690.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The Court of Appeal stressed that insurance policy ambiguities are resolved \u201cin favor of the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured\u201d <em>(Legacy Vulcan, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th at p. 691), and that absent extrinsic evidence to the contrary, the ambiguous term had to be interpreted in Vulcan\u2019s favor to encompass only the underlying policies described in schedule A of the Transport Policy, rather than to all of the collectible primary insurance available to Vulcan <em>(id. </em>at pp. 685, 691). The court noted that the parties, in connection with their submission of the three stipulated legal questions, did not present extrinsic evidence to assist in interpreting the Transport Policy\u2019s language and neither expressly waived nor reserved the right to present such evidence in further proceedings in the trial court. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 691, fn. 7.) The court stated that in further trial court proceedings, the trial court was to consider whether the parties waived or preserved the right to present extrinsic evidence in interpreting the policy, and if it decided to consider such evidence, it was to interpret the Transport Policy in light of that evidence. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court did not decide the ultimate issue of whether Transport had a duty to defend under the Transport Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">D. <em>The Summary Adjudication Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Transport brought a declaratory relief action against real parties in interest Street and National Union seeking a declaration, inter alia, that Transport did not have a duty to defend Street in certain actions under an insurance policy issued to Vulcan that named Street as an additional insured. Street ultimately filed a first amended cross-complaint against Transport seeking a declaration that Transport had a duty to defend Street in some of the actions identified in Transport\u2019s complaint as well as in other actions. National Union also filed a cross-complaint against Street for reimbursement and contribution, presumably concerning defense fees and costs expended on Street\u2019s behalf in certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>of the underlying actions, and for a declaration that Transport had a duty to defend and/or indemnify Street in certain underlying actions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Street and National Union brought a motion for summary adjudication concerning Transport\u2019s duty to defend three of the actions identified in Transport\u2019s complaint. Street and National Union argued that the court in the separate and related action of <em>Legacy Vulcan, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th 677, considered the scope of Transport\u2019s duty to defend the Underlying Actions, and held that the umbrella portion of the Transport Policy provided primary coverage for claims that were potentially covered under the Transport Policy and were not within the terms of coverage of the underlying insurance specifically identified in schedule A of the Transport Policy. They contended that Transport, real party in interest in <em>Legacy Vulcan, </em>was collaterally estopped from contending in this action that \u201cthe term \u2018underlying insurance\u2019 in clause (1) refers to anything other than the policies listed in Schedule A.\u201d Accordingly, Street and National Union argued that the claims in the Underlying Actions were potentially covered by the Transport Policy. They contended the schedule A underlying insurance did not provide coverage for those actions as Street was not an insured under any of those policies. Thus, the umbrella portion of the Transport Policy provided primary coverage for Street for the Underlying Actions and required Transport to provide a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">The respondent trial court granted the summary adjudication motion, apparently ruling, inter aha, that Transport was collaterally estopped by the decision in <em>Legacy Vulcan, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th 677 from arguing that the term \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d referred to insurance other than the policies listed on schedule A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court denied Transport\u2019s request to continue the hearing on the summary adjudication motion so that it could conduct discovery relevant to the interpretation of the term \u201cunderlying insurance,\u201d which discovery Transport claimed was necessary to oppose the motion. Transport petitioned this court for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order granting Street and National Union\u2019s summary adjudication motion and to enter an order denying the summary adjudication motion and permitting Transport to conduct discovery relevant to the interpretation of the term \u201cunderlying insurance.\u201d We issued an order to show cause why the petition should not be granted. We review legal issues and the summary adjudication de novo. <em>(Powerine Oil Co., Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 377, 390 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 562, 118 P.3d 589]; <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Steadfast Ins. Co. </em>(2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 668, 679 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 363].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>After argument, we grant the petition in part and issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order granting Street and National Union\u2019s motion for summary adjudication and enter a new and different order denying that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">A. <em>The Trial Court Erred When It Relied on Vulcan\u2019s Objectively Reasonable Expectations of Coverage Rather Than on Street\u2019s Objectively Reasonable Expectations of Coverage in Interpreting the Term \u201cUnderlying Insurance\u201d with Respect to Umbrella Coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Transport contends that the trial court erred in relying on the holding in <em>Legacy Vulcan, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th 677 that the term \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d with respect to umbrella coverage encompassed only the underlying policies described in schedule A of the Transport Policy. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 685, 691.) The <em>Legacy Vulcan </em>holding, Transport argues, was based on Vulcan\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations of coverage because Vulcan was the insured whose coverage was at issue. Here, Transport argues, the trial court should have considered Street\u2019s reasonable expectations of coverage in interpreting the term \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d in the umbrella clause because it is Street\u2019s coverage that is at issue. Accordingly, Transport argues, the trial court erred in ruling that Transport had a duty to defend Street in the Underlying Actions. Street and National Union argue that the trial court properly ruled that it was bound by the doctrine of collateral estoppel to follow the <em>Legacy Vulcan </em>interpretation of the term \u201cunderlying insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">The Supreme Court has said, \u201cCollateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings. [Citation.] Traditionally, we have applied the doctrine only if several threshold requirements are fulfilled. First, the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation must be identical to that decided in a former proceeding. Second, this issue must have been actually litigated in the former proceeding. Third, it must have been necessarily decided in the former proceeding. Fourth, the decision in the former proceeding must be final and on the merits. Finally, the party against whom preclusion is sought must be the same as, or in privity with, the party to the former proceeding. [Citations.] The party asserting collateral estoppel bears the burden of establishing these requirements. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lucido </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 341 [272 Cal.Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223], fn. omitted.) When a party uses collateral estoppel offensively\u2014i.e., against a party who has litigated and lost the issue to another party in a separate proceeding\u2014we review the application of collateral estoppel de novo. <em>(Smith v. ExxonMobil Oil Corp. </em>(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1407, 1414-1415 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 69].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>Transport assumes for purposes of its writ petition, but does not concede, that the term \u201cunderlying insurance\u201d is ambiguous as to Street. We resolve ambiguities in an insurance policy in a manner consistent with the objectively reasonable expectations of the \u201cparty claiming coverage.\u201d <em>(St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. American Dynasty Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1058 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 818] <em>(American Dynasty).) </em>When the party claiming coverage is an additional insured, it is the additional insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations of coverage that are relevant, and not the objectively reasonable expectations of the named insured. <em>(Ibid.; St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Frontier Pacific Ins. Co. </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1234, 1245, fn. 5 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 416] <em>(Frontier Pacific)', </em>see <em>Pardee Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of the West </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1340, 1361 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 443]; <em>BP A.C. Corp. v. One Beacon Ins. Group </em>(2007) 8 N.Y.3d 708 [840 N.Y.S.2d 302, 307, 871 N.E.2d 1128]; but see <em>Merced County Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. State of California </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 765, 775 [284 Cal.Rptr. 680] [in dicta, the court stated, \u201cAn additional insured added by endorsement is a third party beneficiary of the insurance contract between [the insurer] (promisor) and [the insured] (promisee). As such, the third party beneficiaries\u2019 rights are derivative. [Citation.]\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The California Supreme Court in <em>Garcia v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 426, 436 [204 Cal.Rptr. 435, 682 P.2d 1100] <em>(Garcia) </em>said in dicta that the rights, if any, of a doctor as a third party beneficiary under an insurance policy were \u201cpredicated upon the contracting parties\u2019 intent to benefit him.\u201d (See Cornblum, Cal. Insurance Law Diet, and Desk Reference (2013) \u00a7 A 19:01.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But <em>Garcia, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 426 involved an unnamed third party beneficiary, rather than, as here, a named additional insured. As one authority has written, \u201cThe status of the additional named insured is unique . . . because of several significant differences between its situation and that of the standard third party beneficiary. For example, a classic issue is whether the third party has a right to enforce the contract against the promisor. This depends on whether the promisee intended to benefit the third party. In an additional named insured controversy, however, there is no question that the named insured (promisee) intends to benefit the additional named insured (third party beneficiary) by contracting with the insurer (promisor); the concern is solely with the construction of the contract itself. In addition, in the usual case there is no evidence of the promisee\u2019s intent regarding the rights of the beneficiary except for the contract between the promisor and the promisee. An additional named insured, however, expressly bargains with the named insured for the benefit of coverage; the agreement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>procure thus provides evidence of the named insured\u2019s intentions and purposes outside of the contract with the insurer. Finally, unlike situations involving a standard third party beneficiary, the special rules applicable to insurance contracts must be considered.\u201d (Note, <em>Recognizing the Unique Status of Additional Named Insureds </em>(1984) 53 Fordham L.Rev. 117, 125, fns. omitted.) That authority went on, \u201cThe intent of the insureds is reflected by the language of, and the circumstances surrounding, the agreement to procure. Despite the fact that the additional named insured is not a party to the insurance contract, his intent is relevant to the constmction of that contract because the intent of the named insured in requesting the added coverage is directly dependent on the bargain that the additional named insured made with the named insured.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 129, fn. omitted.) We agree with this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">It is arguable that Street would not expect the Transport excess and umbrella policy to move into first position ahead of Street\u2019s own commercial liability policies. Transport in its petition does not, however, request that we determine Street\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations of coverage. Rather, it requests that we grant a writ of mandate compelling respondent trial court to set aside its order granting summary adjudication and to issue a new order denying summary adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Street and National Union\u2019s summary adjudication motion concerned Transport\u2019s duty to defend Street in the Underlying Actions as an additional insured under the Transport Policy. Street, an additional insured, and not Vulcan, a named insured, was the party claiming coverage. Thus, the trial court erred when it failed to consider Street\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations of coverage and, instead, relied on Vulcan\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations of coverage. <em>(American Dynasty, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 1058; <em>Frontier Pacific, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.4th at p. 1245, fn. 5.) Because the relevant inquiry in this case was Street\u2019s and not Vulcan\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations of coverage, a matter not litigated in <em>Legacy Vulcan, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th 677, the trial court was not bound by collateral estoppel to rely on Vulcan\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations as found by the Court of Appeal in <em>Legacy Vulcan. (Lucido v. Superior Court, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 341.) Because the trial court erred, the summary adjudication in favor of Street and National Union is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">B. <em>Transport\u2019s Request for a Continuance to Conduct Discovery</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The petition is granted in part and a peremptory writ of mandate hereby issues directing the trial court to vacate its order granting Street and National Union\u2019s motion for summary adjudication and enter a new and different order denying that motion. Transport is awarded its costs in this writ proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Turner, P. J., and Kriegler, 1, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">The petition of real parties in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 9, 2014, S216686.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1001-18\"> For reasons unclear from the record before us, the parties refer to Vulcan as Vulcan Materials Corporation rather than Vulcan Materials Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1002-12\"> According to Transport\u2019s complaint, Street also was named as a defendant in actions entitled <em>Estate of Garcia </em>v. <em>Dow Chemical Co. </em>(Super.
