J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AnJ\">Defendants were convicted under an indictment charging them with having in their possession obscene moving picture films \u201cwith intent to utter or expose [the same] to the view of another,\u201d contrary to the provisions of <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:115-2. They appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The films, eight millimeters in size, were part of the stock in trade of a retail novelty store in Union City, N. J. operated by defendants, who were respectively the owner of the store and his clerk. At the opening of the trial below, defendants admitted possession of the movies with intent to sell the same. Furthermore, in response to the court\u2019s question, they through their attorney then agreed that the case involved but a single question, namely, whether or not the films were obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Three rolls of these films were exhibited to the trial court (which heard the case without a jury) on the representation made by a State\u2019s witness that they were typical of the films found by the police at the store. In fact, the defendant who owned the store testified later that the three rolls, which he had seen at the time they were exhibited to the court, and the other rolls which were taken by the police from the store were all of the same character (and it may be noted, by the way, in answer to one of the arguments advanced on behalf of that defendant, that this very testimony contains an implication that he possessed actual knowledge of the character of these films). At the time of the oral argument before us we also, on the special request of defendants\u2019 counsel, viewed these three films.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\"> Defendants have devoted a good part of their brief to a consideration of authorities and law review articles dealing with the law of obscenity. But this is no case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>which to enter upon a discussion of that subject; there is no borderline question here. In fact, we see no reason even to state the nature of the three movies. It is sufficient merely to say, with respect to at least two of the three films, that the motion for acquittal made below on the ground that these films were not obscene was properly denied. The test question on the issue of obscenity, as stated in <em>Adams Theatre Co. v. Keenan, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>267, 272 (1953),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201cis whether the dominant note o\u00ed the presentation is erotic allurement \u2018tending to excite lustful and lecherous desire,\u2019 dirt for dirt\u2019s sake only, smut and inartistic filth, with no evident purpose but \u2018to counsel or invite to vice or voluptuousness.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\"><em>Cf. Bantam </em>Books, <em>Inc. v. Melko, 25 N. J. Super. </em>292 <em>(ch. Div. </em>1953), modified 14 <em>N. J. </em>524 (1954). Not only the dominant note, but indeed the sole crude note of those two movies was erotic allurement of a pornographic character, within the standard above laid down. It could not be pretended that the sale of these films served any socially defensible purpose, <em>State v. Weitershausen, </em>11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>487, 491 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), nor, in our view, any venial purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Counsel for defendants raise other questions on the appeal. But, as above indicated, all other issues were eliminated from the case by agreement of the attorney who appeared for defendants below. There is, to be sure, a rule \u2014usually applicable where the attorney for a party is silent <em>(i. e., </em>fails to object) in the face of action taken or omitted below \u2014 which enables an appellate court under certain conditions to notice plain errors not brought to the trial court\u2019s attention. <em>12. R. </em>1:5-1 (a). But where the State does not attempt to bring in proof as to various issues because of an express waiver by defendants\u2019 attorney, an appellate court will not grant a new trial calling for proof of those issues\u2014 except in that unusual case where, after taking the waiver into account, it very definitely appears that the defendant has been convicted unjustly. <em>Cf. State v. Haines, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>550, 565 (1955); <em>State v. Picciotti, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>205, 211 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>(1953); <em>State v. Ferrell, </em>29 <em>N. J. Super. </em>183, 187, 188 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954). Applying this rather rigorous standard, we find none of the other contentions, now presented, to he deserving even of attention, except possibly7 one.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">This contention is that the State did not, and probably could not, establish an intention on defendants\u2019 part to <em>utter and expose the films to the view of others, </em>as charged in the indictment; for their purpose was but to <em>sell </em>the films.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In examining this contention we may exclude from consideration the alleged intent to expose the films to others. For where an indictment, such as the one before us, charges a defendant with having the possession of an article with an intent to utter it and also with an intent to expose it to others, a conviction thereunder is sustainable even though the proofs establish only one of these intents. <em>State v. Hill, </em>73 <em>N. J. L. </em>77 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1906), affirmed 74 <em>N. J. L. </em>689 <em>(F. &amp; A. </em>1907). It was there held with respect to this statute that an utterance, an exposure to the view of others, and a possession with the intent to utter or expose to view or to sell, \u201ceach * * * may be considered as representing a phase of the same offense\u201d (73 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>79); and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201c* * * when an offense may be committed by doing one of several things, the indictment may in a single count group them together and charge the defendant with having committed them all, and a conviction may bo had on proof of any one of these things without proof of the commission of the others.\u201d 73 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>81.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-8\"> The issue before us then comes down to this, namely, whether the proof or the admission of the intent to sell establishes the intent to utter alleged in the indictment. What is the meaning of <em>utter </em>as used here? In <em>Hill </em>the court held, dealing with this statute, that utter means \u201cto put out, to pass off.\u201d The intent of the defendants in this case to <em>sell </em>at retail these films which formed a part of their stock in trade would seem to constitute an intent to \u201cput out\u201d the films \u2014 to hand over the possession of the same, as well as the title, to the retail purchaser. <em>Cf. State v. Hill, supra, </em>73 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>80. Hence the word \u201cutter,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>taking it in its natural sense, embraces the sales under contemplation. <em>People v. Rathbun, </em>21 <em>Wend. </em>509, 527, 528, 533 <em>(N. Y. Sup. Ct. </em>1839); <em>United States v. Fout, </em>123 <em>F. </em>625, 628 <em>(D. C. Mo. </em>1903); <em>State v. Mills, </em>146 <em>Mo. </em>195, 47 <em>S. W. </em>938, 941 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1898). In accord, see the authorities holding that the verb \u201cutter\u201d means \u201cto cause to pass in trade.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d </em>ed.); <em>People v. Descant, </em>51 <em>Cal. App. 2d </em>343, 124 <em>P. 2d </em>864, 867 <em>(D. Ct. App. </em>1942); <em>State v. Hartman, </em>364 <em>Mo. </em>1109, 273 <em>S. W. 2d </em>198, 206 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Defendants, however, seem to claim that under this statute, <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:115-2, an utterance includes every species of putting out, other than a sale. The critical statutory words are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">\u201cAny person who, without just cause, utters or exposes to the view of another, or possesses with intent to utter or expose to the view of another, or to sell, any obscene or indecent book, pamphlet, picture or other representation, however made, * * * is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Tlie defendants rest their argument on the history of the statute. They seem to contend that the verbal expressions in <em>Rev. </em>1877, 234, \u00a7 44\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\u201cutter or expose to the view of another, or have in his possession with intent so as to utter or expose to view\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">and those in <em>Rev. </em>1877, 235, \u00a7 45\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">\u201cshall sell or offer to sell, or shall give away or offer to give away * * * or have in his or her possession with intent to sell or give away\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">must be given mutually exclusive significations because they appear in separate sections, standing side by side. The Crimes Act of 1898, they say, merely brought together into one section, <em>L. </em>1898, <em>c. </em>235, \u00a7 53 (in language which in substance remains with us today in <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:115-2) these expressions, in particular the words \u201cutter\u201d and \u201csell\u201d; and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>therefore must have continued the mutually exclusive significations theretofore attaching to those two words.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">But this overlooks the earlier history of our present statute on obscene literature and pictures. It originated in three acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\"><em>L. </em>1868, c. 536, which made it a crime to \u201csell, or expose for sale, or give, or permit to be taken from his or her premises or possession any obscene book\u201d or other article enumerated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\"><em>L. </em>1869, c. 440, \u00a7 1, which made it a crime to \u201csell, or offer to sell, or * * * give away, or offer to give away, or have in his</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">or her possession with intent to sell or give away, any obscene and indecent book\u201d or other article enumerated; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\"><em>L. </em>1873, c. 408, \u00a7 1, which made it a crime to \u201csell or offer to sell, or * * * give away or offer to give away any, or have in his or her possession with intent to sell or give away, or use any obscene or indecent book\u201d or other article enumerated. (This last section became in substance <em>Rev. </em>1877, 235, \u00a7 45, above cited.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The acts of 1868 and 1869 were, according to a marginal note in the <em>Revision of </em>1877 (these notes were prepared by the distinguished revisers, Mercer Beasley, David A. Depue and Cortlandt Parker, with the assistance of the reporters, Mr. G. D. W. Vroom and Mr. John H. Stewart; see prefatory note to the <em>Revision), </em>\u201ccombined\u201d to form <em>Rev. </em>1877, 234, \u00a7 44. In other words, the verbal expressions \u201csell,\u201d \u201cexpose for sale,\u201d \u201cgive,\u201d \u201cpermit to be taken from his or her premises or possession,\u201d \u201chave in his or her possession with intent to sell or give away,\u201d were replaced in the <em>Revision </em>by the provision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">\u201cutter or expose to the view of another, or have in his possession with intent so as to utter or expose to view.\u201d <em>Rev. </em>1877, 234, \u00a7 44.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Having in mind that the statutes were intentionally \u201ccombined\u201d here, it can be said with considerable force that the word \u201cutter\u201d in the <em>Revision </em>was intended to include a retail sale. Changes in language made by a revision will not be deemed to have effected changes in substance unless it is clear or beyond a reasonable doubt that such was the purpose. <em>State v. Anderson, </em>40 <em>N. J. L. </em>224, 226 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1878); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>Crater v. County of Somerset, </em>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>407, 414 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1939). We might add at this point that we do not pass on the effect of a marginal note from a less authoritative source. <em>State v. </em>Burrell, 120 <em>N. J. L. </em>277, 283 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">It may be that the reason why <em>Rev. </em>1877, 235, \u00a7 45 was retained in the <em>Revision of </em>1877 as a separate section immediately following \u00a7 44 was because of the special provision therein made for dividing any fine imposed, among certain recipients, including informers who aided in bringing to justice these offenders against society. In any event, if the word \u201cutter\u201d as used in <em>Rev. </em>1877, 234, \u00a7 44 embraced a sale, it continued to have the same force not only in the Crimes Act of 1898 (c. 235, \u00a7 53), which was palpably an amalgamation of the verbal expressions in <em>Rev. </em>1877, 234, \u00a7 44 and 235, \u00a7 45, but also in the reenactments in substance of the amalgamated expression, which are to be found in <em>R. S. </em>2:140-2 and <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:115-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">With this historical background in mind, we think little stress can be put by defendants on the configuration of the present statutory words</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\u201cutters or exposes to the view of another, or possesses with intent to utter or expose to the view of another, or to sell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">That is, we think that in view of this history it would be difficult to establish that the concept <em>sell </em>is to be excluded from the concept utter, merely because they appear in this context somewhat removed from each other and because the words \u201cor to sell\u201d axe set off with a comma and introduced by a separate preposition \u201cto.\u201d We may add also that defendants themselves urge (in another aspect of the argument) that while it may well be that an utterance cannot be effected unless there is a manual transfer of possession (except where there is a cheat. <em>State v. Hill, </em>supra, 73 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>80), nevertheless a sale <em>(i. e., </em>a transfer of title) can be effected conceivably without any actual manual tradition. It follows, therefore, that the word \u201csell\u201d may have at times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>a significance of its own, not embraced in the word \u201cutter,\u201d which amply explains its inclusion in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The point need not be labored further. We may say that in any event the arguments based on the history and the collocation of the statutory words are so inconclusive as to leave us quite unpersuaded that the word \u201cutter,\u201d whether in the statute or an indictment returned thereunder, should be read so as to exclude a sale. We should always have in view some fairly satisfactory reason before we contract or alter the natural significance of a word.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We conclude, therefore, that proof or (as here) an admission of an intent to sell establishes an intent to utter within the indictment before us. That disposes of the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
