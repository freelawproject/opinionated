Unless waived, such a failure normally requires dismissal of the action against a party so joined <em>(see, Camacho v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>115 AD2d 691, 692; <em>McDaniel v Clarkstown Cent. Dist. No. 1, </em>83 AD2d 624; <em>Catanese v Lipschitz, </em>44 AD2d 579). However, the failure to obtain leave of the court is not a fatal defect in all cases <em>(see, Gavigan v Gavigan, </em>123 AD2d 823; <em>McDaniel v Clarkstown Cent. Dist. No. 1, supra), </em>and \"CPLR 1001 and CPLR 1003 give a court wide latitude and are to be liberally construed\u201d <em>(Micucci v Franklin Gen. Hosp., </em>136 AD2d 528, 529).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The central issue in this appeal is whether the conduct of the appellants is sufficient to constitute a waiver of their right to object to being joined as parties without prior leave of the court. Documentary evidence and the examinations before trial show that the appellants\u2019 parent corporation\u2019s predecessor in interest was served and answered for the appellants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The appellants also participated in discovery, without objection. Thus, the Supreme Court properly found that the appellants waived their right to object to the allegedly improper joinder <em>(see, Rubino v City of New York, </em>145 AD2d 285). Under these circumstances, the appellants cannot claim prejudice or surprise by the plaintiffs\u2019 delay in seeking leave to serve the supplemental summons and complaint joining them as parties nunc pro tunc <em>(see, Fahey v County of Ontario, </em>44 NY2d 934).
