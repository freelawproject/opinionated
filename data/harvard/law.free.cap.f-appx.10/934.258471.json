Helms, on behalf of her deceased son, Zachary Helms, appeals the May 26, 2000, decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims, denying Ms. Helms\u2019 petition for compensation under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-l \u2014 300aa-34 (1994) (the Vaccine Act). The Court of Federal Claims affirmed the January 28, 2000, decision of the special master, who concluded that Ms. Helms did not meet her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a vaccine caused her son\u2019s death. Because the special master and the court properly assessed the testimonial and medical evidence, this court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">On January 25, 1995, about a month after his second birthday, Zachary received a vaccination injection for Polio/DPT/HIB/MMR (poho/diphtheria-per-tussis-tetanus/hemophilus influenza-b/measles-mumps-rubella). Less than two days later, on the morning of January 27, 1995, Zachary was found dead in his crib. An autopsy indicated that he had died of a general cerebral edema. The coroner stated that the cause of death was \u201cundetermined\u201d and that \u201cno connection had been made to associate the vaccines with [Zachary\u2019s] death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-14\">Ms. Helms filed suit against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on August 19, 1996, alleging that Zachary suffered a fatal toxic encephalopathy due to the vaccine. Zachary\u2019s alleged encephalopathy did not satisfy the definition of encephalopathy under the Vaccine Injury Tables, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-14(a). Ms. Helms, therefore, proceeded under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-ll(c)(l)(C)(ii)(Z), which required her to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the vaccine in fact caused Zachary\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-15\">During an entitlement hearing with the special master, Ms. Helms presented an expert witness, Dr. Richard Defendini, a lecturer in neuropathology at Columbia University. Dr. Defendini testified that Zachary\u2019s death was caused by an \u201cacute toxic encephalopathy,\u201d which, in turn, was caused by the vaccine administered two days before his death. Dr. Defendini ruled out an ischemic event, such as a blood deficiency, based on the absence of \u201chot pink\u201d nerve cells (a coloration of brain cells caused by acute ischemic necrosis) in autopsy slides. Dr. Defendini also rejected the hypothesis that Zachary died of suffocation, finding it improbable that a two-year old would die from having his face buried in a pillow.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-16\">HHS presented an expert witness, Dr. Lucille Rorke, a board certified pediatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>neuropathologist. In contrast with Dr. Defending Dr. Rorke stated that Zachary\u2019s death was most likely caused by suffocation, not encephalopathy. Dr. Rorke referred to evidence of cellular degeneration, including damage to Purkinje cells in Zachary\u2019s cerebral cortex, indicating that he died of acute asphyxial damage to the brain. Dr. Rorke also testified that the Polio/DPT/HIB/MMR vaccine had not been shown to cause toxic encephalopathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">After holding an entitlement hearing, the special master denied Ms. Helms compensation under the Vaccine Act. After Ms. Helms filed a Motion for Review, the Court of Federal Claims vacated the special master\u2019s decision and remanded for further findings, stating that it was \u201cunclear how the Special Master, in applying <em>Daubert </em>[509 U.S. 579, 588, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) ], took into consideration the numerous articles presented by the petitioner noting a causal connection between the administration of DPT vaccines and major neurological events, expressly including toxic encephalopathies.\u201d On remand, the special master again denied Ms. Helms compensation. The Court of Federal Claims affirmed the special master\u2019s second decision, stating that \u201cthe Special Master, on remand, rationally analyzed the medical evidence in concluding that the Petitioner failed to carry her burden of proof to show that the vaccine had caused Zachary\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Under the Vaccine Act, the Court of Federal Claims may not disturb the factual findings of the special master unless they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(B). This court reviews <em>de novo </em>the Court of Federal Claim\u2019s affirmance of the special master\u2019s factual determinations, reapplying that court\u2019s standard of review. <em>Hines v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>940 F.2d 1518, 1524 (Fed.Cir.1991). In other words, this court essentially reviews the underlying decision of the special master under the arbitrary and capricious standard. <em>Patton v. Sec\u2019y of the Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>25 F.3d 1021, 1025 (Fed.Cir.1994). As a consequence, this court\u2019s review of the special master\u2019s fact-finding is highly deferential. \u201cIf the special master has considered the relevant evidence of record, drawn plausible inferences and articulated a rational basis for the decision, reversible error will be extremely difficult to demonstrate.\u201d <em>Hines, </em>940 F.2d at 1528.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">As conceded by Ms. Helms, Zachary\u2019s alleged encephalopathy did not satisfy the definition of encephalopathy under the Vaccine Injury Tables. Thus, the inquiry in this case is whether Ms. Helms showed by a preponderance of the evidence that the vaccine actually caused Zachary\u2019s injury or condition. <em>Bradley v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>991 F.2d 1570, 1575 (Fed.Cir.1993); <em>Munn v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>970 F.2d 863, 865 (Fed.Cir.1992) (stating that petitioner \u201cmust prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the vaccine, and not some other agent, was the actual cause of the injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Ms. Helms asserts on appeal that the special master erred in relying on Dr. Rorke\u2019s testimony rather than the testimony of her expert, Dr. Defendini. As long as the special master considered the facts and circumstances surrounding the witnesses\u2019 testimony, however, the special master\u2019s refusal to rely on the opinion of Ms. Helms\u2019 expert is virtually unreviewable. <em>Bradley, </em>991 F.2d at 1575. A special master may reject an expert\u2019s testimony when it is reasonable to do so. A reasonable basis includes those circumstances in which a special master finds one expert to be more persuasive than another. <em>Burns v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>3 F.3d 415, 417 (Fed.Cir.1993). The special master discussed both Dr. Defendini\u2019s and Dr. Rorke\u2019s opinions in his decision, and indicated that he did not find Dr. Defendini\u2019s opinion to be convincing evidence that Zachary suffered from encephalopathy, rather than suffocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">Under the statutorily prescribed, deferential standard of review, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the special master. <em>Citizens to Pres. Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971) (holding that reviewing courts may not substitute their judgment for that of the decision-maker under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review). While this court appreciates Ms. Helms\u2019 position, and recognizes that she was not in any way responsible for Zachary\u2019s death, the special master did not abuse his discretion by finding Dr. Rorke to be more persuasive than Dr. Defendini. Because the special master\u2019s decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion, this court affirms the decision of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
