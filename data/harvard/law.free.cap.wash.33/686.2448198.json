Immediately upon my return home I had surveys and an examination of the route made and concluded at once to establish it as you see here shown. I enclose you also a deed to be placed in escrow with the Kational Bank of Commerce, both of which you may execute and send to them. Insert such lots as you think proper under the circumstances. I am willing to trust your judgment and know you will do the fair thing. I am sorry I did not see you on leaving St. Paul.

There is a little mtge. on that piece of land\u2014I cannot give you a title, but am perfectly willing to do anything so you will get the subsidy at the proper time. I would like to ask when you expect to have the line in operation; there are several inquiries I would like to propound to you in this connection. Do you calculate to come east soon ?

In reply will say that I have requested, and with two exceptions, have received from each property holder along the line one-eighth of all their holdings. This is the basis upon which we have \u2019proceeded in the construction of the road. We expect to have the road in operation on or about the 1st of Eebruary. In reply to your inquiry whether I expect to be east soon will say that it is likely that I will within the next 30 or 60 days. The mortgage to which you refer on your tract need cut no figure if you will except and warrant against the same in your deed to us. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Knowing that you will do what is right I have only to consent to leaving the matter to your own good judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">\u201cVery truly yours, T. 0.

Am pleased to be able to aid the enterprise and recognize the benefit it will be to my tract\u2014and admit that without a quick transit scheme the land is of little value. Just at this time I am meeting several mortgages and do not want to put a contract on paper that may have have to stand against the property. On my aid, to the extent that others have given, you may rely as above stated I want the line to strike my corner. In another month or a little later, shall be in a position to say if I can pay cash or if will give land and I trust neither interest will be prejudiced by asking you to permit me to stand you off until I see my way a little clearer as to what is the best way for me to perform the proper caper. Dope I may see you when you come east again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">\u201cYours very truly, Kewman Kline.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">\u201c(4) That said Tacoma &amp; Steilacoom Kailway Company, pursuant to said agreement, did construct its said railroad from the city of Tacoma to the town of Steilacoom, so that the said road ran by the southeast corner of defendant\u2019s said premises. But that defendant has failed and neglected to convey one-eiglith of said premises to said Tacoma &amp; Steilacoom Kailway Company, or to plaintiff, but on the contrary has sold and conveyed all of said premises to other parties, and has also failed and neglected to pay one-eighth of the value of said premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">\u201c(5) That prior to the commencement of this action, said Tacoma &amp; Steilacoom Kailway Company assigned all its right and interest under said agreement to plaintiff, who is now the owner thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">\u201c(6) That plaintiff has demanded of defendant the payment of a sum equal to one-eighth of the value of said premises, but that defendant neglected and refused to pay the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>\u201cWherefore, plaintiff demands judgment against the defendant for the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000), and for costs and disbursements of this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">A demurrer was interposed to this complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that the action had not been commenced in the time limited by law, which demurrer was sustained. Plaintiff offered to file a second amended complaint, which the court refused to permit. Judgment was entered, and from judgment of dismissal the appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">We think the demurrer was properly sustained. We have examined all the cases cited by the appellant, in both his original and reply briefs, and none of them, we think, sustain a cause of action where the agreement was as indefinite and uncertain as the agreement set forth in the complaint. The question of part performance upon which the appellant relies does not, it seems to us, enter into this case under the allegations of the complaint, for it appears from the appellant\u2019s letter of September 16 that the announcement was made, when the information was conveyed to the respondent, that the line of definite location had been determined upon, and that by such determination the road ran to the southeast corner of the respondent\u2019s tract. So that it must appear that the establishment of the road to that point was not the result of the written agreement upon which the action is based, but that it was the result of some oral conversation between the appellant and respondent at some past time, which agreement does not appear. The appellant recognized at thqt time the fact that no binding agreement had been made, for he states that he inclosed an agreement for the respondent to sign, and in addition to that he leaves it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>open to the respondent to do what he thinks is proper under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The balance of the correspondence is as uncertain and indefinite as is the first part, and the last letter written by the respondent on October 3 plainly indicates that the respondent, while he is willing to do something, has not yet made up his mind just what that something'will be, and we hardly see how it would be possible for a court to gather from this correspondence an agreement which could be specifically enforced. If the property remained in the possession of the respondent, and an action were brought for specific performance, it seems to us clear that the contract relied upon was not sufficiently definite and certain to sustain such an action. The fact that the property has passed from the possession of the respondent, and that the remedy is asked in a different form, would not warrant a more liberal construction of the correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">We are not disposed to interfere with the discretion which the trial court exercised in not allowing a further amended complaint to be filed, although an examination of that complaint satisfies us that even it does not allege an enforcible contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
