Libelous charges, imputing that plaintiffs are deliberately delinquent and indifferent taxpayers, threatened with a discontinuance of water supply, reported as a news item without basis in fact, are not fair comment as matter of law. The publications are defendants\u2019 own misstatements of fact to which the defense of fair comment does not apply. <em>(Bingham </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>203 N.

The following, then, is the narration of facts according to which the defendants are to be adjudged in libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The plaintiff conducted in the village of Briarcliff Manor, Westchester county, a hotel known as Briarcliff Lodge. For more than a year prior to the publication alleged in the complaint it had purchased and used water 1 that it needed for its guests from the Municipal Board of the village of Briarcliff Manor. This Board operated the water supply system of the village and received and collected pay therefor. Bills for water consumed were sent in February, May, August and November for user during the previous three months. Shortly after May 31, 1930, the Municipal Board sent to the plaintiff a bill for $2,134.67 for water consumed by it during the three months ending May 31st, and another bill, August 31, 1930, in the sum of $3,118.22, for the three months ending August 31, 1930, and on November 30, 1930, another bill for $2,268.03 for water used during the three months ending November 30, 1930. At the time of the alleged publication there was due from the plaintiff the total sum of $7,520.92 for water used from March 1, 1930, to November 30, 1930, and the plaintiff still continued to purchase and use water up to the time of the publication. An ordinance of the village of Briarcliff Manor provided in part as follows: \u201cIf any charge for water supplied is allowed to remain unpaid for a period of six months from the date of said bill, then and in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>event, the Superintendent is authorized to discontinue the use of water to said premises, within ten days after the mailing of notice to that effect to the water consumer of said premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">On January 10, 1931, the Municipal Board wrote to the plaintiff demanding payment. On January 12th the plaintiff wrote to Henry H. Law, the Mayor of the village, and asked him if it could not be arranged with the Municipal Board that said water bills be paid in installments. Law communicated by letter with the board, inclosing the plaintiff\u2019s letter. Thereafter, and on February 10, 1931, the Municipal Board held a meeting, discussed the bills, and directed a notice to be sent to the plaintiff, stating that if that portion of said water bills which was more than six months past due was not paid in ten days, the water supply to the plaintiff\u2019s premises would be discontinued, and also directed that the Mayor be advised accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">On February 11th, the President of the Municipal Board sent a letter to Law informing him of this action taken by the Board at its meeting, and stated that if the plaintiff did not comply with the demand, its water supply would be discontinued. Law thereupon notified the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The Board of Trustees of the village at a meeting held on the evening of February 11, 1931 (which must have been after the publication'in the case of Citizen-Sentinel Publishers, Inc.), read and discussed the letter of the Municipal Board to the Mayor and referred the matter to him at his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">This is the full recital of the facts which we must assume was in the possession of the defendant newspaper at the time of its publication. It thereupon printed the following, which is said to be false and libelous. It must here be written in full, as we are obliged to make comparison between the facts and what the defendant published as the facts, with its comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u201c Lodge Facing Loss of Water. Owes Big Sum \u201d \u201c Bbiabcliff Board Delivers Ultimatum. $2100 Bill Must Be Paid \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">\u201c Briarcliff Lodge has been using Briarcliff water for six months and hasn\u2019t paid a cent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">\u201c The Lodge, nationally known for various things, owes the Briarcliff Water Board just $2100, not a large sum of money for that lodge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">\u201cAnd if the Lodge fails to pay its bill in 10 days the board will peremptorily turn the water off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">\u201cAnd what will the Lodge do for its guests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">\u201c That is a thing that isn\u2019t troubling the Municipal Board of Briarcliff at all. In fact, members of the Board aren\u2019t interested in what the Lodge will do. All they want is the $2100.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">\u201c But it may trouble officers of the hostelry when they receive the ultimatum of the Water Board, probably today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">\u201c The matter goes back to last Fall when the Lodge failed to pay the first bill rendered for the season. The officers ignored a'subsequent bill arid the Water Board \u2018 held its peace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">\u201c But in these times of depression, $2100 is - a lot of money. If the Water Board permitted the Lodge to continue using the water without payment, it will have to collect $5200 by the end of the month, for- another bill will then be six months old. Which is also a lot of money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">\u201c So the Water Board is eagerly awaiting -a reply, preferably a check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">\u201c Board members are certain that the situation will be averted, and that the Lodge will pay its long past due bifi.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">Let us make the comparison between the article and. the -facts. The heading is. true. .The statement that. \u201c Briarcliff Lodge has been using Briarcliff water for six months and hasn\u2019t paid a cent,\u201d is also true. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the lodge is <em>\u201c </em>nationally known \u201d is a puff and not a libel; and the statement \u201c $2100, not a large sum for that lodge,\u201d is a financial compliment. We then have this statement: \u201cAnd if the Lodge fails to pay its bill in 10 days the board will peremptorily turn the water off.\u201d This is not a statement of a fact so much as a prophecy of a future event; it is not a comment, but a statement of what the municipal authorities will do in ten days. Was it justified? We must assume that the newspaper had in its possession the ordinance giving the village the power to do this thing within ten days after mailing of notice. The newspaper also had before it the written notice sent the Mayor, and by him sent to the plaintiff. This notice from the Municipal Board to the plaintiff said that if the six months\u2019 water bills, past due, were not paid within ten days, the water supply to the plaintiff\u2019s premises would be discontinued. Here was the notice required by the ordinance and the newspaper was justified in printing what the notice said, or, in other words, to state, \u201c if the Lodge fails to pay its bills in 10 days the board will peremptorily turn the water off.\u201d This is exactly what the Board did say it would do and the paper was merely publishing the Board\u2019s declaration. Here was action taken by an official body given as news to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Next \u2014 \u201cAnd what will the Lodge do for its guests? \u201d\u2014 a most natural question and fair comment. Then we have this statement: \u201c That is a thing that isn\u2019t troubling the Municipal Board of Briarcliff at all. In fact, members of the Board aren\u2019t interested in what the Lodge will do. All they want is the $2100.\u201d This is not a statement regarding the plaintiff, but relates to the attitude of the Board, and is a newspaper comment on their action. Continuing: \u201c But it may trouble officers of the hostelry when they receive the ultimatum of the Water Board, probably today.\u201d Can we say as matter of law that such an aside in a newspaper article on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>official action of a public matter is not fair comment or <em>just </em>criticism on the action of a delinquent taxpayer? The comment does not impress us as being at all unreasonable or unfair, but, rather, the result to be expected from such a notice, in view of all the circumstances, and the delay in paying the water charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Then comes the following: <em>\u201c </em>The matter goes back to last Fall when the Lodge failed to pay the first bill rendered for the season. The officers ignored a subsequent bill and the Water Board held its peace.\u201d The claim of the plaintiff is that this is libelous because the word \u201c ignored \u201d means something more than <em>\u201c </em>failed to pay.\u201d The innuendo is that it casts aspersions upon the officers of the plaintiff, indicating that they refused and neglected to pay any attention to another bill rendered to it. To make this a libel by any such innuendo is refining libel law beyond all means of practical application. Whether or not the word <em>\u201c </em>ignored \u201d was used in any such sense was at least a question for the jury to pass upon, and cannot be taken as libelous as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Again, as we approach the end, we find these words: <em>\u201c </em>But in these times of depression, $2100 is a lot of money.\u201d Who will deny it? <em>\u201c </em>If the Water Board permitted the Lodge to continue using the water without payment, it will have to collect $5200 by the end of the month, for another bill will then be six months old. Which is also a lot of money.\u201d All of this is true. \u201c So the Water Board is eagerly awaiting a reply, preferably a check.\u201d Can this be doubted? <em>\u201c </em>Board members are certain that the situation will be averted, and that the Lodge will pay its long past due bill.\u201d A generous hope, reflecting a belief in the plaintiff\u2019s good, and not bad, intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Thus analyzing the publication in the light of conceded facts, there is no libel in it, and, at most, the innuendo regarding the use of the word <em>\u201c </em>ignored \u201d creates a question of fact as to whether or not it casts any aspersion upon the honor or integrity of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>This answer, therefore, is good as a justification; it is good as fair comment, in the very meager instances where comment is made; and it is good as a fair and true report of official proceedings taken by the Municipal Water Board regarding the plaintiff\u2019s over-due bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The first, second and third defenses in the answer in this case against the Citizen-Sentinel Publishers, Inc., should, not have been stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">There are three publications and four libel actions coming up on this appeal. We have dealt here with the complaint in the action against the Citizen-Sentinel. Publishers, Inc., as being typical. Counsel have submitted the four cases as if they were one, and dealt with the points in only one brief. The other publications vary in literary style but not in substance. The Tarry-town editorial heads the article, <em>\u201c </em>Who Pays for Water? \u201d and follows it with a philosophical utterance regarding the attention which individuals give to human affairs. As to the plaintiff, it says: <em>\u201c </em>and still others, perhaps a larger class, reveal a remarkable listlessness to bills. According to dispatches Briarcliff Lodge is in the latter group in regard to the payment of water bills.. Advices from the Water Board of that Village disclose that the Lodge is in arrears to the extent of $2,100 for water furnished since last Fall. And the Board advises further that unless the Lodge pays and pays that the water will be turned off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The defendants in all these cases pleaded the same defenses. This latter publication is a true statement of facts with a brief comment on the failings of humanity generally. Nothing libelous here, which is not fully met by these answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The <em>Yonkers Statesman and Daily Argus </em>printed an article in which the heading is true, and facetiously stated in its news item \u201c' Water, water, everywhere, but never a drop to drink \u2019 will be the cry at Briarcliff Lodge in a short while, according to the Briarcliff Manor Village Board, if Chauncey Depew Steele and his asso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>dates at the exclusive and expensive hostelry do not pay their water bill.\u201d The rest of the article contains a fair comment and statement of the action of the Municipal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">By this comparison of the answers with the alleged publications it must be quite evident that the matter set up in defense was sufficient at law and should not have been stricken out. The payment of taxes is a matter quite vital to all of us. Where all are expected to pay on the due date, it is a matter of public concern, and surely of public' interest, to know whether a large amount of taxes, especially in small communities, remains unpaid. To furnish the news upon these matters is the justification for the existence of a newspaper. These matters constitute news and may be printed, when accurately stated, with impunity. Village officers have a duty to perform which must be impartially administered. The fact that the press is ever ready to publish any irregularities or acts of favoritism has a tendency to keep officials up to the high mark of their calling. A water board, having the power to collect bills or turn off a supply of water, is a public official whose proceedings and action may not only be given as news, but, under section 337 of the Civil Practice Act, may be fairly and truly reported, without being libelous. And a fair and true report admits of some liberality; the exact words of every proceeding need not be given if the substance be substantially stated. True also is it that the action of such public officials, and the delay in the collection of taxes, are matters about which a paper, either in its news items or editorially, may make comments as long as they are fair and just. <em>(Hoeppner </em>v. <em>Dunkirk Printing Co., </em>254 N. Y. 95.) A comment is fair when it is based on facts truly stated and free from imputations of corrupt or dishonorable motives on the part of the person whose conduct is criticized, and is an honest expression of the writer\u2019s real opinion or belief. Mere exaggeration, slight irony or wit, or all those delightful touches of style <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>which go to make an article readable, do not push beyond the limitations of fair comment. Facts do not cease to be facts because they are mixed with the fair and expectant comment of the story teller, who adds to the recital a little touch by his piquant pen.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">These actions against the individual, J. Noel Macy, charged him also, as editor and publisher of these various papers, so that what is here stated regarding the corporations, applies also to him and to his individual answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The orders of the Appellate Division, striking out the first, second and third complete defenses in the answers, should be reversed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division, and the questions certified by the Appellate Division should all be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Pound, Ch. J., Kellogg, O\u2019Brien, Hubbs and Crouch, JJ., concur; Lehman, J., dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
