In June, 1896, appellant wrote informing appellee that October 9,1894, it had shipped the articles in controversy and had since been informed by the Illinois Central Railroad Company that they had been sold for charges in August, 1895. Upon the trial it was stipulated that the value of the lost articles was $600, and judgment was rendered in appellee\u2019s favor for that amount.</p><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-5\" pgmap=\"179\">Grant If swell, attorney for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-6\" pgmap=\"179\">Beach &amp; Beach, attorneys for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b179-7\" pgmap=\"179\">Mr. Justice Freeman</author> <p id=\"A85\" pgmap=\"179\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b179-8\" pgmap=\"179\">The ground upon which it is sought to reverse this judgment is that \u201c there was not a sufficient showing on the part of the plaintiff with reference to the matter of demand.\u201d As the abstract fails to disclose the character of much of the evidence, we ought to presume that the judgment of the Circuit Court is correct and would so appear if the evidence had been properly abstracted for our consideration. It does, however, appear that there is evidence tending to show a demand made before suit was brought; and it appears that the record shows appellant had admitted it received the goods for storage, retained them in its custody for a considerable time, collected storage charges therefor, negligently delivered them without orders and by mistake at the wrong place, where they were finally sold as unclaimed property to pay charges, and were thus wholly lost. An action of trover lies against a warehouseman who, by mistake, delivers goods to a wrong person, and he will be responsible for the loss as upon a wrongful conversion. I. &amp; St. L. R. R. Co. v.
