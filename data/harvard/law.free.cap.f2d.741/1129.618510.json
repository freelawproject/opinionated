WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1173-26\">Manuel Lucero filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that officials at Montana State Prison violated his constitutional rights by administratively transferring him to maximum security without a hearing. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal' of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-27\">The Due Process Clause protects only property and liberty interests arising from (1) the Due Process Clause itself or (2) state law. <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 466, 103 S.Ct. 864, 869, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). Lucero\u2019s administrative transfer was well within the terms of confinement ordinarily contemplated by a prison sentence and did not infringe on any liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 869-70. Lucero has not shown that Montana, through its laws or regulations, has created a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-28\">Prison officials have broad administrative authority over the prisons they manage while inmates retain only a narrow range of protected liberty interests. <em>Id. </em>at 869. To hold that <em>\u201cany </em>substantial deprivation imposed by prison authorities triggers the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause would subject to judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>review a wide spectrum of discretionary actions that traditionally have been the business of prison administrators rather than of the federal courts.\u201d <em>Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 225, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 2538, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976). The day-today operation of state prisons is not the business of federal judges. <em>Id. </em>at 228-29, 96 S.Ct. at 2540-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">We also find no support for Lucero\u2019s contentions that prison officials coerced his guilty plea or used the label \u201cadministrative\u201d to evade due process hearing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
