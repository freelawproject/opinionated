In late 1980, Daniel Cowin, a Bres-ler &amp; Reiner shareholder, sued the company and its directors on his own behalf. Cowin has a minority interest in the company. The individual directors-appellees, with their families, own in excess of 79% of the company\u2019s stock. Appellees Bresler and Reiner together hold more than 70% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares, and their control of the corporation is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">The thrust of Cowin\u2019s charges is that the appellees have manipulated the business for their personal profit at the expense of the minority shareholders. The complaint alleges numerous instances of corporate mismanagement, fraud, and self-dealing, all in breach of the common law fiduciary duty owed by the directors of the company to the appellant as a shareholder. Several of the challenged transactions involve deals between the company and certain limited partnerships in which the appellees, including Bresler and Reiner, have significant interests. The complaint also charges Bresler and Reiner with forcing the company to engage in a stock repurchase program at a time when the company was in default on its notes payable and having severe cash flow problems. Cowin alleges that appellees used, and are still using, the repurchase plan to \u201cseverely limit[] the public market for trading in Company stock\u201d; according to appellant, their ultimate intent is to \u201ccovert[ ] the Company to a private corporation owned solely by\u201d them for their own benefit. Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant at 14. To remedy the alleged common law violations, Cowin seeks damages for the diminished value of his stock and injunctions against the allegedly wrongful transactions. He also requests the appointment of a receiver to liquidate the company for his benefit and the benefit of the other.shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">The remainder of the complaint charges appellees with violations of the federal securities laws, primarily in connection with the transactions detailed above. Specifically, Cowin claims that Bresler and Reiner caused the company to \u201cdisseminate reports to the public shareholders which were materially deceptive\u201d and concealed material information in violation of Rule 10b-5 and section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) (1982). Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant at 15. The complaint also charges appellees with violating section 14(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a) (1982), by causing the company to issue deceptive proxy materials. Cowin seeks to require the disclosure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>the material concealed in alleged violation of the Act and, among other things, to invalidate the elections for directors based on the alleged proxy violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Appellees moved promptly to dismiss the complaint. They also sought, and received from the district court, an order barring all discovery pending disposition of the motion to dismiss. As a result, no discovery was permitted during the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In its first order, entered December 23, 1981, the district court ruled that while Cowin could legally seek the appointment of a receiver for a solvent corporation in his individual capacity, he had failed to allege the \u201cextreme circumstances showing imminent danger of great loss\u201d-necessary to support such drastic relief. <em>Cowin v. Bresler, </em>No. 80-2230, mem. op. at 3 (D.D.C. Dec. 23,1981); Record Excerpts (\u201cR.E.\u201d) at 32. The court then dismissed appellant\u2019s common law claims because, in its view, both federal and common law required Cowin to \u201cbring ... a derivative suit to recover damages for a decline in the value of stock\u201d due to alleged corporate mismanagement and fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 35. The court would \u201cnot permit [Cowin] to elevate form over substance in order to escape the requirements of a derivative suit merely by attaching an unjustified request for the appointment of a receiver ... to his complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">The district court also dismissed most of appellant\u2019s Rule 10b-5 claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green, </em>430 U.S. 462, 97 S.Ct. 1292, 51 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977), the court held that the \u201creincorporation [into federal securities law claims] of \u25a0[Cowin\u2019s] common-law claims for breaches of fiduciary duties as well as the alleged \u2018nondisclosures\u2019 ... must be dismissed as unsuccessful attempts to create a 10b-5 cause of action out of claims of corporate mismanagement.\u201d R.E. at 40. Certain other alleged securities law violations were dismissed for lack of specificity under Fed. R.Civ.P. 9(b). R.E. at 40 n. *, 42-43. The court did not dismiss Cowin\u2019s section 14(a) proxy disclosure claims, however, nor did it dismiss that portion of appellant\u2019s Rule 10b-5 claims that did not \u201cintegrally relate[] to [the] allegations of the nondisclosure of certain breaches of fiduciary duty.\u201d R.E. at 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">Appellees answered those portions of the complaint that survived the lower court\u2019s order and moved for summary judgment on the section 14(a) claim. In its second order, entered April 21, 1983, the district court granted summary judgment for appellees on that claim, holding that Cowin had no standing to challenge, on an individual basis, the allegedly misleading nature of proxy solicitations because he had not personally relied on them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We agree with the district court\u2019s holding that appellant\u2019s common law claims for damages and injunctive relief must be pursued, if at all, on a derivative basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both case law and sound policy support this conclusion. In <em>Bokat v. Getty Oil Co., </em>262 A.2d 246, 249 (Del.1970), plaintiff shareholder charged that Getty Oil had, among other things, forced its wholly-owned subsidiary to purchase oil from Getty at an inflated price. Delaware\u2019s highest court characterized this claim as one \u201cseekpng] money damages for improper management\u201d and held that such claims belonged to the corporation and not to its minority stockholders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">When an injury to corporate stock <em>falls equally upon all stockholders, </em>then an individual stockholder may not recover for the injury to his stock alone, but must seek recovery derivatively in behalf of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 249 (emphasis added). The court concluded that \u201c[mjismanagement which depresses the value of stock is a wrong to the corporation; i.e., the stockholders collectively, to be enforced by a derivative action.\u201d <em>Id. See also Crane Co. v. Harsco Corp., </em>511 F.Supp. 294, 304 (D.Del.1981); <em>Elster v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>34 Del.Ch. 94, 98-99,100 A.2d 219, 222 (1953).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">The logic of <em>Bokat </em>is compelling. Claims of corporate mismanagement must be brought on a derivative basis because no shareholder suffers a harm independent of that visited upon the corporation and the other shareholders. Because each shareholder has been injured in proportion to his equity ownership, \u201ceach will be made whole if the corporation obtains compensation or restitution from the wrongdoer.\u201d <em>Empire Life Insurance Co. v. Valdak Corp., </em>468 F.2d 330, 335 (5th Cir.1972). A contrary rule \u201cwould authorize multitudinous litigation and ignore the corporate entity.\u201d <em>Sutter v. General Petroleum Corp., </em>28 Cal.2d 525, 530, 170 P.2d 898, 901 (1946). <em>See also Brooks v. Land Drilling Co., </em>564 F.Supp. 1518, 1521 (D.Colo.1983); 13 W. Fletcher, <em>Cyclopedia on the Law of Corporations </em>\u00a7 5911 (Perm. ed. 1980). Requiring derivative enforcement of claims belonging in the first instance to the corporation also prevents an individual shareholder from incurring a benefit at the expense of other shareholders similarly situated. <em>See </em>13 W. Fletcher, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5915, at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">This general rule is the law of several jurisdictions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There are, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>certain circumstances in which a shareholder may proceed against his company on an individual basis. In <em>Elster v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>the Delaware chancery court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">There are cases, of course, in which there is injury to the corporation and also <em>special injury </em>to the individual stockholder. In such cases a stockholder, if he should so desire, may proceed on his claim for the protection of his individual rights rather than in the right of the corporation. The action would then not constitute a derivative action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">34 Del.Ch. at 99, 100 A.2d at 222 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">A fair reading of the \u201cspecial injury\u201d eases shows that a personal cause of action is properly pursued in two situations\u2014 where the allegedly wrongful conduct violates a duty to the complaining shareholder independent of the fiduciary duties owed that party along with all other shareholders, or, where the conduct causes an injury to the shareholders distinct from any injury to the corporation itself. In cases of the first sort, the complaining shareholder may sue as an individual only because he stands, and has been injured in his relationship to the corporation, in a capacity other than that of a shareholder. In <em>Sedeo International, S.A. v. Cory, 522 </em>F.Supp. 254 (S.D. Iowa 1981), <em>aff'd, </em>683 F.2d 1201 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>459 U.S. 1017, 103 S.Ct. 379, 74 L.Ed.2d 512 (1982), for example, a shareholder was permitted to bring a personal action against the company because he was injured in his capacity as a creditor of the corporation; his status as a shareholder was irrelevant to his right to pursue a creditor\u2019s remedy. The court found that the \u201cright to recovery asserted is entirely independent of Carver\u2019s status as a shareholder\u201d and held that \u201chis dual capacity\u2014 as creditor and shareholder \u2014 [did not] operate[ ] to cut off his rights as a creditor and vest them in the corporation itself.\u201d 522 F.Supp. at 314. <em>Empire Life </em>is to a similar effect. The Fifth Circuit recognized the \u201cestablished rule that if a plaintiff sues in a stockholder capacity for corporate mismanagement, he must bring the suit derivatively in the name of the corporation.\u201d 468 F.2d at 335. In that case, however, the counterclaiming defendant had alleged not only that the plaintiff had violated fiduciary duties owed defendant as a shareholder but also that the plaintiff had violated an independent duty \u2014 as pledgee in a loan transaction with the defendant \u2014 not to deplete the value of the collateral intentionally. <em>Id. </em>In these circumstances, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">[T]he defendant seeks damages as a <em>pledgor. </em>The fact that his pledge is stock and that if the manipulated depreciation of the stock is proven would also give rise to a derivative suit by defendant as <em>stockholder </em>should not foreclose the suit as pledgor. The role of pledgor and stockholder are not identical and defendant may play the part he chooses ____ We find that defendant ... is entitled to bring his claim as individual pledgor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 336 (emphasis in original). <em>See also Schaffer v. Universal Rundle Corp., </em>397 F.2d 893, 896 (5th Cir.1968); 13 W. Fletcher, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 5921.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">The second category of harms which may be remedied on an individual basis consists of \u201cwrong[s] inflicted upon [the stockholder] alone ... or wrong[s] affecting ... the stockholders and not the corporation____\u201d <em>Elster, </em>34 Del.Ch. at 99, 100 A.2d at 222. Wrongful withholding of dividends, for example, gives rise to an individual cause of action. <em>See Abelow v. Symonds, </em>38 Del.Ch. 572, 578, 156 A.2d 416, 419 (1959). Because dividends are an incident of stock ownership, an action to compel the payment of dividends withheld will not inure to the benefit of the corporation; the shareholders alone will gain by a judgment in their favor and, therefore, each shareholder may sue for his own account. <em>See Knapp v. Bankers Securities </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>Corp., </em>230 F.2d 717 (3d Cir.1956); <em>see also Crane Co., </em>511 F.Supp. at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><em>Condec Corp. v. Lunkenheimer Co., </em>43 Del.Ch. 353, 230 A.2d 769 (1967), is also representative of this second category. In that case, the company\u2019s directors denied a controlling corporate shareholder its right to exercise voting control over the company. This claim was properly remedied on an individual basis because the injury was the shareholder\u2019s alone, not shared by the corporation or other equity owners. In <em>Condec, </em>plaintiff had made a tender offer and received tenders for a controlling percentage of Lunkenheimer\u2019s stock. Con-dec's control over Lunkenheimer was frustrated, however, when Lunkenheimer\u2019s management contracted to sell its business to U.S. Industries and, in the context of that agreement, issued 75,000 additional shares of Lunkenheimer stock. The court found \u201cthe primary purpose of the [defendant\u2019s actions] was to prevent control of Lunkenheimer from passing to Condec,\u201d 43 Del.Ch. at 362, 230 A.2d at 775, and allowed Condec to sue, on its own behalf, for cancellation of those 75,000 shares. The court held that Condec need not prove an injury to the corporation as the defendants had argued; that would be necessary only if, for example, a stockholder was attacking, on a derivative basis, the spending of a corporation\u2019s funds for the repurchase of its own stock. 43 Del.Ch. at 365-66, 230 A.2d at 777. Instead, the court concluded, a personal action was proper because Con-dec was \u201ca stockholder with a <em>contractual right </em>to voting control being deprived of such control____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). <em>See generally </em>13 W. Fletcher, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a75915 (enumeration of claims properly brought on an individual basis).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Appellant\u2019s allegations do not fall within the \u201cspecial injury\u201d exception articulated above. Although Cowin generally argues that appellees \u2014 through their conduct \u2014 have breached fiduciary duties owed directly to the minority shareholders, he has not shown, and indeed could not show, that these duties are distinct from those owed the corporation. His claims that appellees caused the company to enter into a series of \u201cunfair\u201d transactions that have \u201cinvolved self-dealing\u201d and \u201cdiverting assets\u201d are fundamentally claims belonging to the corporation and to Cowin only derivatively. <em>See </em>Complaint IMf 13-14, 35-36, 42, 45; R.E. at 6-7, 13, 14, 15. Cowin\u2019s charge that the deceptive and incomplete reports issued by the company in an attempt to \u201cartificially deflate ... the market price of [the company\u2019s] common stock\u201d is also an allegation of harm primarily to the corporation shared by each stockholder proportionate to their holdings. Complaint If 48; R.E. at 16. While the underlying value of the corporation\u2019s assets may be unaffected by this wrongful act, the attractiveness of the corporation as an investment and its ability to compete for capital funds have been impaired. That these deceptive reports may have prevented the company stock from being traded in a \u201cperfect\u201d market causes similar injury to the corporation. In these circumstances, then, because \u201ceach [shareholder] will be made whole if the corporation obtains compensation or restitution from the wrongdoer,\u201d <em>Empire Life, </em>468 F.2d at 335, appellant must pursue his common law claims for damages and injunctive relief on a derivative basis. <em>See also Bokat v. Getty Oil Co., </em>262 A.2d at 249.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Cowin\u2019s request for the appointment of a receiver to liquidate the company, as distinct from his state law claims for damages and injunctive relief, was properly before the district court in a personal action. <em>See, e.g., Lichens Co. v. Standard Commercial Tobacco Co., </em>28 Del.Ch. 220, 228-32, 40 A.2d 447, 451-52 (1944); <em>Salnita Corp. v. Walter Holding Corp., </em>19 Del.Ch. 426, 431, 168, A. 74, 76 (1933). The court found, however, that Cowin had failed to meet the pleading requirements necessary to support such relief. R.E. at 33. We disagree. Although a request for a court-appointed receiver \u201cto wind up a solvent going business is rarely granted,\u201d <em>Berwald v. Mission Development Co., </em>40 Del.Ch. 509, 512, 185 A.2d 480, 482 (Sup.Ct.1962), and the court\u2019s power to do so must \u201calways [be] exercised with great restraint,\u201d <em>Hall v. John S. Isaacs &amp; Sons Farms, Inc., </em>39 Del.Ch. 244, 253,163 A.2d 288, 293 (Sup.Ct. 1960), we believe that Cowin has sufficiently plead the requisite elements to support his claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">To establish the claim for a court-appointed receiver, Cowin must allege facts to show that the majority shareholders or directors of the company have engaged in, or are presently engaged in, fraudulent misconduct which puts the company at immediate risk of great loss. In <em>Warshaw v. Calhoun, </em>43 Del.Ch. 148, 221 A.2d 487 (Sup.Ct.1966), the Delaware Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-16\">It is plain, we think, that for a court to order a dissolution or liquidation of a solvent corporation, the proponents must show a failure of corporate purpose, a fraudulent disregard of the minority\u2019s rights, or some other facts which indicates <em>an imminent danger of great loss resulting from fraudulent or absolute mismanagement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-17\">43 Del.Ch. at 155, 221 A.2d at 491 (emphasis added). Where imminent risk of great loss is not present, or, where no illegal or fraudulent acts have occurred, a \u201creceiver may not be appointed to liquidate [the company].\u201d 43 Del.Ch. at 156, 221 A.2d at 491. Moreover, mere apprehension of future misconduct based upon prior mismanagement will not satisfy the \u201cimminent danger\u201d requirement. <em>Campbell v. Pennsylvania Industries, Inc., </em>99 F.Supp. 199, 206 (D.Del.1951). A shareholder\u2019s exclusive remedy, when his complaint is not based on any illegality, is to withdraw from the corporate enterprise. Id.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-18\">Case law also appears to require Cowin to allege facts showing that a court-ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>pointed receiver \u2014 a particularly onerous form of relief \u2014 is the only relief that will remedy appellees\u2019 misdeeds. In <em>Lichens Co., </em>for example, the court stated that the \u201cinherent power of a court of equity to appoint a receiver for a solvent corporation ... must be exercised with great caution, and only where there is real imminent danger of material loss that cannot otherwise be prevented.\u201d 28 Del.Ch. at 231, 40 A.2d at 452. <em>See also Vale v. Atlantic Coast &amp; Inland Corp., </em>34 Del.Ch. 50, 57, 99 A.2d 396, 400 (1953) (to state a claim for the appointment of a receiver, plaintiff \u201cmust show fraud, gross mismanagement, or extreme circumstances causing imminent danger of great loss which cannot be otherwise prevented\u201d); <em>Pennsylvania Industries, </em>99 F.Supp. at 207 (same).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Bearing in mind the appropriate standard of review at this early stage of the litigation, <em>see supra </em>note 3, we think Cowin\u2019s allegations establish the elements necessary to support his claim for a court-appointed receiver. His complaint details a series of financial misdealings which, if proven, constitute affirmative acts of misconduct by the directors and majority shareholders in breach of the fiduciary duties owed by them to the corporation and, derivatively, to the minority shareholders. This is not a case, then, like <em>Warshaw, </em>where the complainant could only show that the defendant-directors had organized the corporation in such a way that \u201cprevent[edj it from taking advantage of opportunities that e[a]me its way.\u201d 43 Del.Ch. at 155, 221 A.2d at 491. In those circumstances, the court had no power to appoint a receiver because the choice of corporate form, while \u201cunfortunate [wa]s not illegal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Cowin\u2019s complaint also alleges that ap-pellees\u2019 conduct \u2014 both in the past and present \u2014 is depriving the corporation of millions of dollars on an ongoing basis. Complaint UU14-16, 22-27, 28-32, 34-39, 42, 45-46; R.E. at 7-8, 9-11, 11-12, 13-14, 15, 16. At this preliminary stage in the pleadings, these allegations are more than sufficient to show the \u201cimminent danger of great loss\u201d necessary to support Cowin\u2019s request to put the company into receivership. That the company has suffered net income losses in only one year does not support the district court\u2019s dismissal. Likewise, the mere fact that Bresler &amp; Reiner stock was selling, when the complaint was filed, at $4.00 per share (up from a range of $.75 to $2.25 in 1977), does not render incredible the extensive and detailed allegations in Cowin\u2019s complaint, nor does it negate the inferences we must draw on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. The district court impermissibly narrowed the scope of Cowin\u2019s complaint by accepting these facts as controlling in the face of Cowin\u2019s detailed allegations concerning appellees\u2019 misuse of the corporate venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Finally, the allegations of Cowin\u2019s complaint are sufficient to raise the question whether any relief short of receivership will remedy appellees\u2019 past wrongs or deter them from further transgressions. It is undisputed that appellees beneficially control the vast majority of company stock and would retain control of the enterprise even if a shareholder\u2019s derivative suit brought the company some measure of relief from appellees\u2019 conduct. A derivative action, in these circumstances, might provide only stopgap relief. <em>See Ashley v. Keith Oil Corp., </em>73 F.Supp. 37,57 (D.Mass.1947); <em>see also Leibert v. Clapp, </em>13 N.Y.2d 313, 247 N.Y.S.2d 102, 196 N.E.2d 540 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Our disposition should not be taken to suggest that we believe Cowin is entitled to put the company into receivership. Such a course, as the authority indicates, is one of \u201clast-resort,\u201d and the court\u2019s power to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>point a receiver to liquidate a solvent business must be exercised rarely and with great restraint. <em>See Berwald v. Mission Development Co., </em>40 Del.Ch. at 512, 185 A.2d at 482; <em>Hall v. John S. Isaacs &amp; Sons Farms, Inc., </em>39 Del.Ch. at 253, 163 A.2d at 293. As the foregoing should indicate, however, the ultimate inquiry into the propriety of a receivership is factually complex and does not especially lend itself to resolution solely on the pleadings. We note in this respect that no discovery was permitted in the lower court for two years these motions were pending and that the court, in making its decision, could not consequently take advantage of appellant\u2019s ability (or inability) to develop through discovery the factual predicate for his request for a receiver. We believe the district court\u2019s analysis failed to accept the full measure of Cowin\u2019s fairly detailed pleadings and did not draw the reasonable inferences from those allegations. This portion of Cowin\u2019s claim is remanded to the district court for discovery and further factual development.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Appellant\u2019s federal claims raise novel questions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a <em>et seq. </em>(1982). Although Cowin did not buy or sell his stock in connection with the allegedly misleading reports issued by the company, he relies upon section 10(b) of the Act and Rule 10b-5 in seeking to prevent appellees from \u201cdepress[ing] the value of [his] stock and ... eliminatpng] the public market in that stock through dissemination of deceptive statements.\u201d Reply Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant at 18. In short, appellant claims not that he was wrongfully induced to buy or sell stock by appellees\u2019 misrepresentations but rather that his stock was made less valuable by appellees\u2019 misrepresentations to the investing public generally. He does not seek damages but an injunction requiring an end to the alleged misrepresentations and disclosure of past misrepresentations. It is clear from <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975), that appellant could not maintain an action for damages under section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. The question before us is whether he may bring suit for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act prohibits manipulation or deception \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security....\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) (1982). The generalized prohibition of fraud in section 10(b) is made more specific by Rule 10b-5, issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. That rule makes it unlawf\u00fcl for any person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">(1) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">(2) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">(3) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">\n<em>in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5 (1983) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">The Act provides no express civil remedy for a violation of section 10(b). Nor did Congress consider the potential for private enforcement when that section was enacted. <em>Blue Chip, </em>421 U.S. at 729, 95 S.Ct. at 1922. Similarly, the Securities and Exchange Commission did not contemplate private suits when adopting Rule 10b-5. The rule was intended to close a \u201cloophole in the protections against fraud administered by the Commission by prohibiting individuals or companies from <em>buying </em>securities if they engage in fraud in their purchase.\u201d SEC Release No. 3230 (May 21, 1942) (emphasis added), <em>quoted in Birn-baum v.

The threat of private suits has become a valuable adjunct to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s enforcement powers. However, the fact that a cause of action exists does not mean that any person can invoke section 10(b)\u2019s protections. \u201cWe are dealing with a private cause of action which has been judicially found to exist, and which will have to be judicially delimited one way or another unless and until Congress addresses the question.\u201d <em>Blue Chip, </em>421 U.S. at 749, 95 S.Ct. at 1931. This case requires us to consider one limitation on the class of potential plaintiffs under Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In <em>Blue Chip, </em>the Supreme Court held that only purchasers or sellers of securities have standing to pursue private claims for damages under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. The only difference between that case and this is that appellant seeks only injunc-tive relief. The question is whether that difference means that plaintiff\u2019s action survives <em>Blue Chip. </em>We think that it does not.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">More than twenty years before <em>Blue Chip, </em>a distinguished panel of the Second Circuit concluded that section 10(b) was \u201cdirected solely at that type of misrepresentation or fraudulent practice usually associated with the sale or purchase of securities rather than at fraudulent mismanagement of corporate affairs____\u201d <em>Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., </em>193 F.2d 461, 464 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>343 U.S. 956, 72 S.Ct. 1051, 96 L.Ed. 1356 (1952).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Relying primarily on the purpose underlying the adoption of Rule 10b-5, <em>Birnbaum </em>held that the rule extended protection \u201conly to the defrauded purchaser or seller,\u201d 193 F.2d at 464, and affirmed dismissal of a complaint that failed to allege that \u201cany of the plaintiffs fell into either class.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>After declining an earlier opportunity to rule on Birnbaum\u2019s standing requirements, <em>see Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>404 U.S. 6, 13-14 n. 10, 92 S.Ct. 165, 169-170 n. 10, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971), the Supreme Court in <em>Blue Chip </em>affirmed the vitality of the <em>Birnbaum </em>restriction in private damage actions under Rule 10b-5. The plaintiffs in <em>Blue Chip </em>were disappointed offerees of a registered stock offering held pursuant to an antitrust consent decree. They sued under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 alleging that they had been dissuaded from purchasing the offered shares because of their reliance on a false and misleading prospectus. The district court dismissed the complaint, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. The court of appeals reasoned that plaintiffs\u2019 status as offerees pursuant to a court-ordered stock offering was the functional equivalent of having a contract right to purchase securities; since <em>Birnbaum </em>had been interpreted not to exclude those possessing contract rights, plaintiff was held to have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The Supreme Court reversed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court noted that virtually all courts facing the issue had reaffirmed Birnbaum\u2019s limitation on standing and it observed that the SEC had twice sought to extend the reach of section 10(b) by introducing legislation amending the language from \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security\u201d to \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of, <em>or any attempt to purchase or sell, </em>any security.\u201d <em>Blue Chip, </em>421 U.S. at 732, 95 S.Ct. at 1924 (emphasis in original). Both attempts were rejected by Congress. <em>Id. </em>In light of this \u201chistory,\u201d the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">The longstanding acceptance by the courts, coupled with Congress\u2019 failure to reject Birnbaum\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the wording of \u00a7 10(b), wording which is directed toward injury suffered \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale\u201d of securities, argues significantly in favor of acceptance of the <em>Birnbaum </em>rule by this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 733, 95 S.Ct. at 1924 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">The Court also noted that \u201c[ajvailable evidence from the texts of the 1933 and 1934 Acts ... supports the result reached by the <em>Birnbaum </em>court.\u201d 421 U.S. at 733, 95 S.Ct. at 1924. For example, Congress specifically extended the scope of section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a) (1982), to reach fraud \u201cin the offer or sale\u201d of securities: this was language (and presumably scope) it avoided in section 10(b). 421 U.S. at 733-34, 95 S.Ct. at 1924-25. The Court stated that \u201c[w]hen Congress wished to provide a remedy to those who neither purchase nor sell securities, it had little trouble in doing so expressly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734, 95 S.Ct. at 1925. Moreover, the express remedies in the Act, created contemporaneously by Congress with the enactment of section 10(b), are by their terms expressly limited to purchasers or sellers of securities. <em>Id. </em>at 736, 95 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>at 1925. <em>See, e.g., </em>Securities Act of 1933, \u00a7 11(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a) (1982) (action granted to those \u201cacquiring\u201d a security); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77Z (1982) (action granted to purchasers); Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \u00a7 9(e), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78i(e) (1982) (action granted to purchasers and sellers); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 18(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78r(a) (1982) (same). Considering the scope of these express remedies, the Court said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">[I]t would indeed be anomalous to impute to Congress an intention to expand the plaintiff class for a judicially implied cause of action beyond the bounds it delineated for comparable express causes of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">421 U.S. at 736, 95 S.Ct. at 1926 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Finally, the majority opinion recognized the primary function Rule 10b-5 was intended to serve \u2014 the elimination of a loophole permitting the defrauding of sellers\u2014 and observed that the extension of Rule 10b-5, under these facts, would extend a remedy for 1933 Act violations to those Congress excluded from the class protected by the express remedies of that Act. 421 U.S. at 736-37 n. 8, 95 S.Ct. at 1925-26 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The <em>Blue Chip </em>Court, however, did not rest its conclusion \u201csolely on language, history, and precedent.\u201d <em>The Supreme Court, 1974 Term, </em>89 Harv.L.Rev. 49, 265 (1975). <em>See also Liberty National Insurance Holding Co. v.

The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">[W]e would by no means be understood as suggesting that we are able to divine from the language of \u00a7 10(b) the express \u201cintent of Congress\u201d as to the contours of a private cause of action under Rule 10b-5. When we deal with private actions under Rule 10b-5, we deal with a judicial oak which has grown from little more than a legislative acorn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">421 U.S. at 737, 95 S.Ct. at 1926. The Court thus deemed it proper to examine several \u201cpolicy considerations\u201d implicated by its decision affirming the <em>Birnbaum </em>rule. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">The Court first identified three classes of potential plaintiffs precluded from suing under <em>Birnbaum </em>and recognized that the rule \u201cprevents some deserving plaintiffs from recovering damages which have in fact been caused by violations of Rule 10b-5.\u201d 421 U.S. at 737-38, 95 S.Ct. at 1926-27. Nonetheless, other factors outweighed this disadvantage. The Court argued that Rule 10b-5 litigation presents \u201ca danger of vexatiousness different in degree and in kind from that which accompanies litigation in general.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739, 95 S.Ct. at 1927. Given the settlement value of most Rule 10b-5 claims, expansion of the plaintiff class would thus increase the potential and incidence of \u201cnuisance\u201d or \u201cstrike\u201d suits. Similarly, the \u201cpotential for possible abuse of ... liberal discovery provisions\u201d would provide \u201can <em>in terrorem </em>increment of the settlement value\u201d in these cases. <em>Id. </em>at 741, 95 S.Ct. at 1928. To expand the plaintiff class under Rule 10b-5 \u201cwould [thus] appear to encourage the least appealing aspect of the use of the discovery rules.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">The Court was also concerned with the problems of proof that would necessarily inhere in expansion of the plaintiff class to include those claiming injury based solely on an allegation that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused them <em>not </em>to do something. A plaintiff who neither buys nor sells seeks \u201ca largely conjectural and speculative recovery in which the number of shares involved will depend on the plaintiff\u2019s subjective hypothesis.\u201d 421 U.S. at 734-35, 95 S.Ct. at 1925. Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-13\">[p]laintiff\u2019s entire testimony could be dependent upon uncorroborated oral evidence of many of the crucial elements of his claim, and still be sufficient to go to the jury. The jury would not even have the benefit of weighing the plaintiff\u2019s version against the defendant\u2019s version, since the elements to which the plaintiff would testify would be in many cases totally unknown and unknowable to the defendant. The very real risk in permitting those in respondent\u2019s position to sue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>under Rule 10b-5 is that the door will be open to recovery of substantial damages on the part of one who offers only his own testimony to prove that he ever consulted a prospectus of the issuer, that he paid any attention to it, or that the representations contained in it damaged him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a3z-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 746, 95 S.Ct-. at 1930 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In the final section of its opinion, the Court rejected an invitation to create, on the facts of the case, an exception to the <em>Bimbaum </em>rule. That plaintiff was a member of a discrete and limited class and that, as such, the \u201cpractical difficulties of corroborating at least some elements of [its] proof\u201d were thereby mitigated was not sufficient to bypass the purchaser-seller limitation. 421 U.S. at 754-55, 95 S.Ct. at 1934-35. <em>Bimbaum </em>was not \u201cmerely a shorthand judgment on the nature of a particular plaintiffs proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754, 95 S.Ct. at 1934. Thus, even though plaintiff had a \u201cprior connection\u201d with the defendants and was \u201cintended to benefit from ... the consent decree,\u201d the Court dismissed its claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">But respondent and the members of its class are neither \u201cpurchasers\u201d nor \u201csellers,\u201d as those terms are defined in the 1934 Act, and therefore to the extent that their claim of standing to sue were recognized, it would mean that the lesser practical difficulties of corroborating at least some elements of their proof would be regarded as sufficient to avoid the <em>Bimbaum </em>rule. While we have noted that these practical difficulties, particularly in the case of a complete stranger to the corporation, support the retention of that rule, they are by no means the . only factor which does so. The general adoption of the rule by other federal courts in the 25 years since it was announced, and the consistency of the rule with the statutes involved and their legislative history, are likewise bases for retaining the rule. Were we to agree with the Court of Appeals in this case, we would leave the <em>Bimbaum </em>rule open to endless case-by-case erosion depending on whether a particular group of plaintiffs was thought by the court in which the issue was being litigated to be sufficiently more discrete than the world of potential purchasers at large to justify an exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 754-55, 95 S.Ct. at 1934-35.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Cowin argues that the purchaser-seller limitation does not apply to actions seeking equitable relief. He points to a <em>pre-Blue Chip </em>line of cases holding that a private party who seeks only injunctive relief need not have bought or sold securities to sue under Rule 10b-5, <em>see, e.g., Kahan v. Ro-senstiel, </em>424 F.2d 161 (3d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>398 U.S. 950, 90 S.Ct. 1870, 26 L.Ed.2d 290 (1970); <em>Mutual Shares Corp. v. Genesco, Inc., </em>384 F.2d 540 (2d Cir.1967), and contends that the \u201cexception\u201d to the purchaser-seller rule in those cases survives <em>Blue Chip </em>because the Supreme Court limited its holding in that case to private damage actions. Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant at 19-24. We appear to be the first court of appeals squarely to address this issue,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and we think <em>Blue Chip </em>cannot be so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>It is true, as the Court in <em>Blue Chip </em>acknowledged, that the question of what constitutes the proper plaintiff class under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 cannot be <em>conclusively </em>determined by resort to the text of those enactments; as one might expect, neither the statute nor the rule speaks directly to the question of who may sue since the right to sue was created afterwards by the judiciary. <em>See Blue Chip, </em>421 U.S. at 737, 95 S.Ct. at 1926. Still, in the process of implying private rights judges must take account of the statutory scheme. <em>See generally </em>Schneider, <em>Implying Private Rights and Remedies Under the Federal Securities Acts, </em>62 N.C.L.Rev. 853, 884-96 (1984); Frankel, <em>Implied Rights of Action, </em>67 Va.L.Rev. 553, 559-70 (1981). No better guidance exists than the language of the relevant statute and regulation. <em>See Blue Chip, </em>421 U.S. at 756, 95 S.Ct. at 1935 (Powell, J\u201e concurring) (\u201cThe starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The relaxed standing requirement urged on us by appellant would be contrary to the rationale of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 as perceived by the Supreme Court in <em>Blue Chip. </em>While it may be possible to discern differences between an action for damages and a suit for an injunction, most of the Supreme Court\u2019s argument in <em>Blue Chip </em>applies quite as much to the latter as to the former. The scope of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is limited to fraud \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of a security.\u201d Congress was asked on two different occasions to expand the jurisdictional reach of those provisions but chose not to. In contrast, Congress did choose to define the scope of other provisions in the 1933 and 1934 Acts in terms that clearly reflected a broader jurisdictional reach. Congress also limited standing in those instances where it did create express remedies under the Act to a class of persons including only purchasers or sellers. Thus, the purchaser-seller limitation is \u201csufficiently supported by the statutory structure of the Securities Act.\u201d <em>The Supreme Court, 1974 Term, supra, </em>89 Harv.L.Rev. at 269. <em>See also Northland Capital Corp., </em>at 1426-27 <em>(Blue Chip\u2019s </em>holding based primarily on the \u201clanguage of the Act and its legislative history\u201d). These features also constrain us to accept, in the context of an injunctive suit, the common meaning of the terms \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d and reject an expansive construction of the Rule, as <em>Blue Chip </em>did for damage actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Attempting to fashion a different concept of standing for cases like this would involve us in distinctions altogether too awkward to be persuasive. As <em>Blue Chip </em>noted, the \u201cwording of \u00a7 10(b) ... is surely badly strained when construed to provide a cause of action, not to purchasers and sellers of securities, but to the world at large.\u201d 421 U.S. at 733 n. 5, 95 S.Ct. at 1924 n. 5. The Court also stated that it \u201cwould indeed be anomalous to impute to Congress an intention to expand the plaintiff class for a judicially implied cause of action beyond the bounds it delineated for comparable express causes of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 737, 95 S.Ct. at 1926. <em>See also id. </em>at 755, 95 S.Ct. at 1934 (noting \u201cconsistency of <em>\\Birn-baum </em>] rule with the statutes involved and their legislative history\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Our analysis might well end here. However, because <em>Blue Chip </em>went beyond statutory analysis to examine certain \u201cpolicy considerations,\u201d 421 U.S. at 737, 95 S.Ct. at 1926. Cowin argues that relaxing the purchaser-seller requirement in his case is proper because that would not contradict the several policies relied upon by <em>Blue Chip. </em>Several lower courts, including the lower court in this case, have distinguished the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in this fashion. <em>See, e.g., Fuchs v. Swanton Corp., </em>482 F.Supp. 83, 89-90 (S.D.N.Y.1979); <em>Hundahl v. United Benefit Life Insurance Co., </em>465 F.Supp. 1349, 1357-59 (N.D. Tex. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">If we thought this question open, we might conclude that injunctive suits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>present many of the same problems of vex-atiousness, \u201cstrike\u201d suits, abuse of discovery, and the like that damage actions do. We need not decide that, however, for we think the approach appellant suggests is foreclosed by <em>Blue Chip </em>itself. There, the plaintiff had' contended that two policies articulated by the Court \u2014 the difficulties in corroborating the elements of Rule 10b-5 proof and the potential for an unlimited class of plaintiffs \u2014 were simply not raised on the facts of the case. If plaintiffs were allowed to sue, the Court said, \u201cit would mean that the lesser practical difficulties of corroborating at least some .elements of their proof would be regarded as sufficient to avoid the <em>Birnbaum </em>rule.\u201d 421 U.S. at 754-55, 95 S.Ct. at 1934-35. The Court rejected this result stating that while its decision to affirm <em>Birnbaum </em>was in part based on these \u201cpractical difficulties,\u201d the consistency of the rule with \u201cthe statutes involved and their legislative history [were] likewise bases for retaining the rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755, 95 S.Ct. at 1934. To take such arguments into account \u201cwould leave the <em>Birnbaum </em>rule open to endless case-by-case erosion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, while \u201cpolicy considerations\u201d did play a role in the <em>Blue Chip </em>decision, when those policy considerations were inconsistent with the retention of a flat rule and with the other grounds on which the decision rested \u2014 the statute and its history \u2014 they were not strong enough to create an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In cases of doubt, the institutional role of the- Supreme Court weighs in favor of considering its rulings to be general rather than limited to the particular facts. The Supreme Court, unlike the lower federal courts, is given a largely discretionary jurisdiction which is used when areas of the law require clarification. As Judge Marshall put it in holding that <em>Blue Chip </em>forecloses injunctive suits by plaintiffs who have neither purchased nor sold securities, \u201c[W]e must be mindful of the [Supreme] Court\u2019s function in hearing and deciding ... cases. It does not sit to adjudicate individual disputes; that is the business of the district courts and courts of appeal. Rather it uses individual cases and controversies to shape and guide the development of the law. This is particularly true where, as here, it speaks in an area of judge made law.\u201d <em>Wright v. Heizer Corp., </em>411 P.Supp. 23, 34 (N.D.Ill.1975), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>560 F.2d 236 (7th Cir.1977), <em>cert, denied, </em>434 U.S. 1066, 98 S.Ct. 1243, 55 L.Ed.2d 767 (1978). When the Court wishes to make a narrow, fact-bound holding, typically it says so. When it does not say so, the rebuttable presumption is that a general rule has been enunciated. Here there is more than that presumption, for the Court gave every indication that it wished to speak broadly. <em>Blue Chip </em>expressly acknowledged that the rule it adopted in that case operated as a bar to Rule 10b-5 actions brought by \u201cshareholders, creditors, and perhaps others related to an issuer who suffered loss in the value of their investment due to corporate or insider activities in connection with the purchase or sale of securities which violate Rule 10b-5.\u201d 421 U.S. at 737-38, 95 S.Ct. at 1926-27. Appellant falls directly within this group and we may not allow him to proceed on his Rule 10b-5 claims against the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Finally, Cowin\u2019s complaint alleges that the appellees have caused the company to issue material misleading proxy statements in the years 1974 through 1979 in violation of section 14(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a) (1982), and Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-9 (1983). He claims these statements artificially depressed the value of company stock by limiting the public trading market in those shares and resulted in the election of appellees as directors, thus allowing them to continue their fraudulent activities. To remedy these violations of the proxy rules, Cowin sought to have declared void the \u201celections of defendant directors.\u201d Reply Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant at 28.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The district court held that Cowin could not, under section 14(a), challenge \u201cproxy solicitations upon which he has not relied.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>R. E. at 51. The court agreed with a recent Ninth Circuit decision that ruled \u201cthe policies of \u00a7 14(a) and established doctrine in analogous securities contexts supports the ... position [that] shareholders who do not rely on allegedly misleading or deceptive proxy solicitations lack standing to assert direct (as opposed to derivative) equitable actions under \u00a7 14(a).\u201d R.E. at 52 (quoting <em>Gaines v. Haughton, </em>645 F.2d 761, 774 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert, denied, </em>454 U.S. 1145, 102 S. Ct. 1006, 71 L.Ed.2d 297 (1982)). In response to a line of cases \u2014 relied on by Cowin \u2014 taking the contrary position, the court stated that because those cases \u201cso preceded the Supreme Court\u2019s recent restrictions on private securities actions ... their precedential value is dubious.\u201d R.E. at 52. On appeal, appellees rely primarily on the district court\u2019s opinion. Cowin again points to those cases holding that standing to raise section 14(a) claims does not require reliance on the allegedly deceptive proxy materials and argues that the contrary position \u201cconflicts with the remedial purpose of Section 14(a), is unsound in logic, and is contrary to the weight of authority.\u201d Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Our examination of who may sue under section 14(a) follows, the approach taken in part II B <em>supra </em>to analyze Cowin\u2019s section 10(b) claims. Regarding section 14(a), however, we find no language in the relevant statutory materials that leads us to conclude that reliance is a prerequisite to standing under that section. Nor is there any Supreme Court decision that directly controls our resolution of the question. The analysis in <em>Blue Chip </em>\u2014 heavily influenced by the statutory text \u2014 in fact supports our conclusion that Cowin does not need to show reliance to bring a section 14(a) claim.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In <em>J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, </em>377 U.S. 426, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964), the Supreme Court found an implied private remedy in section 14(a) because private enforcement served that statute\u2019s purpose\u2014 \u201cto prevent management ... from obtaining authorization for corporate action by means of deceptive or inadequate disclosure in proxy solicitation\u201d \u2014 and was \u201ca necessary supplement to Commission action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431-32, 84 S.Ct. at 1559-60. While subsequent private right cases suggest a shift in analytical focus, <em>see, e.g., Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 577, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 2489, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the Supreme Court has never re stricted the class of potential plaintiffs under section 14(a) as it has done under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In fact, the <em>Blue Chip </em>opinion stated that the implication of a private remedy under section 10(b) was \u201centirely consistent with the Court\u2019s recognition in ... <em>Borak ... </em>that private enforcement of Commission rules may \u2018[provide] a necessary supplement to Commission action.\u2019 \u201d 421 U.S. at 730, 95 S.Ct. at 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Both section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 proscribe in clear terms a specific form of misconduct. Section 14(a) makes it unlawful to solicit proxies \u201cin contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors----\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a) (1982). Rule 14a-9 expressly prohibits false or misleading proxy solicitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">No solicitation subject to this regulation shall be made by means of any proxy statement ... which, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of a proxy for the same meeting or subject matter which has become false or misleading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">17 C.P.R. \u00a7 240.14a-9 (1983). Unlike section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, neither section 14(a) nor Rule 14a-9 prohibits the unlawful conduct in connection with a particular activity; deceptive proxy solicitations are unconditionally proscribed. It cannot be said then that the language of the statute and the regulation constrains us to find reliance a necessary predicate to standing under section 14(a). <em>Cf Blue Chip, </em>421 U.S. at 749, 95 S.Ct. at 1931. Indeed, there is much to suggest the contrary conclusion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The Act demands full and fair disclosure. Section 14(a) was enacted to prevent \u201cmanagement or others from obtaining authorization for corporate action by means of deceptive or inadequate disclosure in proxy solicitations.\u201d <em>Borak, </em>377 U.S. at 431, 84 S.Ct. at 1559. <em>See also T.S.C. Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 438, 448, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 2132, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976). Congress sought to \u201censurje] that proxies would be solicited with \u2018explanation to the stockholders of the real nature of the questions for which authority to cast his vote is sought.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-lite Co., </em>396 U.S. 375, 381, 90 S.Ct. 616, 620, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 1383,' 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 14 (1934)). The goal of Congress thus seems to have been to protect a shareholder\u2019s investment from self-serving designs of those at odds with the best interest of the corporation. <em>See, e.g., </em>S.Rep. No. 1455, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 77 (1934) (section 14(a) intended to protect investors from \u201cpromiscuous\u201d proxy solicitations by \u201cunscrupulous corporate officials seeking to retain control of the management by concealing and distorting facts\u201d). <em>Borak </em>itself identifies the injury section 14(a) sought to prevent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">The injury which a stockholder suffers from corporate action pursuant to a deceptive proxy solicitation ordinarily flows from the damage done the corporation, rather than from the damage inflicted directly upon the stockholder. The damage suffered results not from the deceit practiced on him alone but rather from the deceit practiced on the stockholders as a group.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">377 U.S. at 432, 84 S.Ct. at 1560.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">The injury Cowin alleges was not caused by his individual reliance on deceptive proxy solicitations. Rather, his claim is that other shareholders elected appellees as directors because they were misled by the proxy materials. The installation of appellees as directors and their subsequent actions has injured appellant. This injury is totally divorced from any reliance, or lack of reliance, on Cowin\u2019s part and falls precisely into the scope of injury Congress sought to protect. <em>Borak, </em>377 U.S. at 432, 84 S.Ct. at 1559. Requiring reliance in these circumstances would serve no legitimate policy and we decline to do so. <em>See Hershfang v. Knotter, </em>562 F.Supp. 393, 397-98 (E.D.Va.1983), <em>aff'd mem., </em>725 F.2d 675 (4th Cir.1984) (plaintiff has standing under section 14(a) despite his lack of reliance because injury suffered has no connection to his individual reliance). <em>Jones v. National Distillers &amp; Chemical Corp., </em>484 F.Supp. 679, 684-85 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (same). <em>Cf. Ash v. GAF Corp., </em>723 F.2d 1090, 1094-95 (3d Cir.1983) (where plaintiff\u2019s claimed injury was a violation of Rule 14a-3 \u2014 requiring proxy statements to be \u201caccompanied or preceded\u201d by annual reports \u2014 fact that he did not vote or attempt to exercise his proxy precluded him from suing to invalidate a director\u2019s election).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">We think sentiment expressed in a recent district court opinion persuasive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">It is abundantly clear that Congress\u2019 intent to protect the investing public would be seriously hampered if one who misuses the proxy process cannot be brought to task by those shareholders who have from the outset recognized his deceptions, but has only to fear that the other shareholders whom he has successfully beguiled will belatedly become enlightened and seek redress for the damage he has done them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-14\"><em>Lynch v. Fulks, </em>[1981 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) 1197,831, at 90,134 (D.Kan. Dec. 12, 1980). <em>See also Clayton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>v.

Because the controlling statutory materials are silent on the question and because we believe a contrary rule would partially frustrate congressional policy, we find that Cowin need not prove reliance to bring a section 14(a) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The district court, however, had alternative grounds for dismissing the section 14(a) claims. The court found that Cowin had failed to adequately allege an injury that was causally related to the alleged proxy violations. <em>See </em>R.E. at 53. Cowin claims that the misleading proxy statement damaged him by causing the market price of his stock to be artificially depressed and by reducing the available resale market for his shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">It may be true that the appellant\u2019s alleged injury is capable of being caused by the misleading proxy statement; however, in <em>J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, </em>377 U.S. 426, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964), the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he purpose of \u00a7 14(a) is to prevent management or others from obtaining authorization for corporate action by means of deceptive or inadequate disclosure in proxy solicitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431, 84 S.Ct. at 1559. <em>See also </em>S.Rep. No. 1455, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 77 (1934) (purpose of \u00a7 14(a) is to protect shareholders from \u201cunscrupulous\u201d directors and outsiders and to give a full explanation of the proposed authorizations for which shareholders\u2019 votes are sought); H.R.Rep. No. 1382, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 14 (1934) (same). Here the appellant claims his damages are a reduction in the price and market for his shares. This may have occurred due to a misleading proxy statement, but was not a result of a corporate action authorized by the proxy machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In <em>Mills </em>the Court recognized that monetary damages may still be allowed where the misleading part of the proxy materials did not relate directly to the transaction involved (in our case the election of directors):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">Monetary relief will, of course, also be a possibility. Where the defect in the proxy solicitation relates to the specific terms of the merger, the district court might appropriately order an accounting to ensure that the shareholders receive the value that was represented as coming to them. On the other hand, where, as here, the misleading aspect of the solicitation did not relate to terms of the merger, monetary relief might be afforded to the shareholders only if the merger resulted in a reduction of the earnings or earnings potential of their holdings. In short, damages should be recoverable only to the extent that they can be shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-9\"><em>Mills Auto-Lite Co. v. Electric, </em>396 U.S. 375 at 388-89, 90 S.Ct. 616 at 623-24, 24 L.Ed.2d 593. The damages, however, that the <em>Mills </em>Court was allowing the plaintiff to show were those that resulted directly from the merger \u2014 the authorized corporate action. Allowing claims that have no direct relationship to the purpose of the proxy statement could open the court\u2019s doors to suits every time a proxy statement is alleged to have caused the market to react negatively to the stock, regardless of how difficult actual proof of damages would be. The appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Schlick v. Penn-Dixie Cement Corp., </em>507 F.2d 374 (2d Cir.1974), is likewise misplaced. There the damages alleged flowed directly from the merger authorized by the proxy state<em>ment </em>\u2014 i.e., an unfair and disadvantageous merger ratio of shares received for those given up. Cowin\u2019s damages are not a result of the corporate action authorized by the proxy statement and therefore are not the type of damages sought to be remedied by section 14(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Cowin also claims that due to the misleading proxy statements the current directors were reelected and he, as a shareholder, was damaged by the continued fraudulent acts of the elected directors. The misconduct alleged here also was not a direct result of the misleading proxy statement and therefore does not meet the causation requirement of <em>Mills. </em>396 U.S. at 385, 90 S.Ct. at 622. See also <em>Brayton v. Ostrau, </em>561 F.Supp. 156 (S.D.N.Y. 1983); <em>Rosenbaum v. Klein, </em>547 F.Supp. 586 (E.D.Pa.1982); <em>Rosengarten v. International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp., </em>466 F.Supp. 817 (S.D.N.Y.1979). Appellant is alleging a subsequent breach of fiduciary duty which is only an incident to the election of directors and not actionable under section 14(a). This claim is actionable, if at all, as a state law claim for breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">Because Cowin has not claimed damages that are remediable by a section 14(a) ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>tion, the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We here summarize our disposition of this appeal. We affirm the dismissal of appellant\u2019s common law and section 10(b) claims although we affirm the latter on grounds different from those relied upon by the court below. The district court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s attempt to put the company into receivership is reversed and remanded for fact-finding. Although it is unnecessary for Cowin to show reliance on the allegedly misleading proxy statements, he has not claimed injury that is remediable by a section 14(a) action. We also affirm the dismissal of Cowin\u2019s section 14(a) claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\">. The court held that Cowin had standing to raise these claims. On appeal, appellees renew the argument that Cowin had no standing to sue under \u00a7 10(b) because he was neither a purchaser nor seller who had acted in reliance on the company\u2019s alleged misrepresentations. <em>See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 731-32, 737-38, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 1923-24, 1926-27, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975); Brief for Appel-lees at 32-36. Cowin\u2019s (and the district court\u2019s) position, on the other hand, is that the <em>Blue Chip </em>standing requirements are relaxed when a complainant seeks equitable relief and not damages. R.E. at 37-38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">. The court ruled, alternatively, that Cowin could not demonstrate \"loss causation\" or economic injury and that the equitable relief appellant sought on his \u00a7 14(a) claim \u2014 the invalidation of the 1980 directors\u2019 election \u2014 would \"constitute an exercise of futility\u201d because of appel-lees' unquestionable control over a significant majority of votes.

Folk, <em>The Delaware General Corporation Law </em>\u00a7 226 (1972), we leave the resolution of this question for another day. On remand, the district court is of course free to pursue this question further if there is any need to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b491-20\">. We do not believe, as the district court seemed to assume, R.E. at 3-4- n. * that \"imminent risk\" can be demonstrated only if the fraudulent acts are being perpetrated on an ongoing basis; past acts as well, whose effects are of a continuing nature, may lead the corporation to \"imminent risk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\">. Appellees\u2019 objection that a receiver may not be appointed without hearing from the other minority shareholders cannot be raised at this stage of the proceedings; neither can appellees\u2019 taking claim be heard now. These are not matters that go to the sufficiency of these pleadings. <em>See Bumrite Coal Briquette Co. v. Riggs, </em>274 U.S. 208, 212, 47 S.Ct. 578, 579, 71 L.Ed. 1002 (1927), <em>and Tower Hill-Connellsville Coke Co. v.

We do not speak to what notice to the other shareholders might become appropriate at a later stage of these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\">. Our holding in this regard would also foreclose that portion of Cowin's Rule 10b-5 claim dismissed by the district court \"without prejudice.\" R.E. at 55. We note, however, with respect to appellant\u2019s \u00a7 10(b) claims that the <em>Blue Chip </em>Court noted with apparent approval the fact that a non-selling or purchasing shareholder \u201cwho suffered loss in the value of his investment due to corporate or insider activities in connection with the purchase or sale of securities which violate Rule 10b-5 ... may frequently be able to circumvent the [purchaser-seller] limitation through bringing a derivative action on behalf of the corporate issuer if the latter is itself a purchaser or seller of securities. 421 U.S. at 738, 95 S.Ct. at 1926, <em>citing Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, </em>405 F.2d 215 (2d Cir.1968), <em>cert, denied, </em>395 U.S. 906, 89 S.Ct. 1747, 23 L.Ed.2d 219 (1969). <em>See also Wright v. Heizer Corp., </em>411 F.Supp. 23, 32 (N.D.Ill.1975), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>560 F.2d 236 (7th Cir. 1977), <em>cert, denied, </em>434 U.S. 1066, 98 S.Ct. 1243, 55 L.Ed.2d 767 (1978). On this record, however, we cannot speculate as to the relevance of this possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Cowin also based this portion of his complaint on \u00a7 13(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(a) (1982). The lower court, however, found it unnecessary to decide whether Cowin could maintain his cause of action under \u00a7 13(a), R.E. at 33, and appellant did not attempt to support his complaint on appeal by arguing that a private cause of action could be pursued under that section. The court's disposition of the \u00a7 13(a) claim in that manner puzzles us in light of the court\u2019s dismissal \u2014 based on the same factual allegations \u2014 of Cowin\u2019s Rule 10b-5 and \u00a7 10(b) claims. However, absent complete briefing and a lower court opinion on this issue, we decline to reach the question, leaving to the district court, on remand, to explore the matter further. <em>Cf. Dan River, Inc. v. Unitex Ltd., </em>624 F.2d 1216 (4th Cir.1980), <em>cert, denied, </em>449 U.S. 1101, 101 S.Ct. 896, 66 L.Ed.2d 827 (1981) (court finds implied right of action under \u00a7 13(d) of the Act). <em>But see In re Penn Central Securities Litigation, M.D.L.

The <em>Birnbaum </em>court consisted of Chief Judge Swan, and Judges Learned Hand and Augustus N. Hand, with the last writing for a unanimous court, and was described by Justice Blackmun, dissenting in <em>Blue Chip, </em>as \"a justifiably esteemed panel of that Court of Appeals regarded as the \u2018Mother Court\u2019 in this area of law.\u201d 421 U.S. at 762, 95 S.Ct. at 1938 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b494-14\">. Though not apparent from the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion, <em>Birnbaum </em>was a suit in equity seeking rescission of a sale allegedly violative of Rule 10b-5 and an accounting by the defendants. See <em>Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., </em>98 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>F.Supp. 506 (S.D.N.Y.1951). The appellate court\u2019s decision, moreover, did not appear to turn on the nature of relief sought. Based on this, the Eleventh Circuit recently stated that \u201d[i]f <em>Birnbaum </em>were binding on this panel it would mandate ... dismissal of ... [the] section 10(b) claim for injunctive relief.\u201d <em>Liberty Nat'l Ins. Holding Co. v. Charter Co., </em>734' F.2d 545, 557 n. 26 (11th Cir.1984). While it is true that <em>Birnbaum </em>was an \u201caction in equity,\" the nature of relief sought was essentially mone- \u25a0 tary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\">. Justice Rehnquist wrote for the majority, joined by Chief Justice Burger, and Justices White, Stewart, Marshall and Powell. Justice Powell also concurred separately, in an opinion joined by Justices Stewart and Marshall. Justice Blackmun\u2019s dissenting opinion was joined by Justices Douglas and Brennan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b495-13\">. In response to the dissenters' argument that the term \"sale\u201d in \u00a7 10(b) was intended to include \"offers to sell,\u201d the Court pointed out that the Act itself defines \"sale\" and that Congress had deleted from that definition events such as offers and advertisements that might eventually lead to a consummated transaction. 421 U.S. at 733 n. 5, 95 S.Ct. at 1924 n. 5. Continuing, the Court stated: \"Beyond this, the wording of \u00a7 10(b), making fraud <em>in connection with the purchase or sale of a security </em>a violation of the Act, is surely badly strained when construed to provide a cause of action, not to purchasers or sellers of securities, but to the world at large.\" <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">. Justice Powell\u2019s concurring opinion rests on the express language of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. 421 U.S. at 755-61, 95 S.Ct. at 1934-37. According to that opinion, the \"critical phrase\u201d in both the statute and the Rule is \"in connection with the <em>purchase </em>or <em>sale </em>of any security.\" <em>Id. </em>at 756, 95 S.Ct. at 1935 (emphasis in original). Respondent\u2019s argument required the Court to read that language as though it stated \"in connection with the purchase or sale of, or <em>an offer to sell, </em>any security.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Justice Powell said the Court could not do this absent \"unmistakable support in the history and structure of the legislation.\" There being no such support, the class of potential plaintiffs under \u00a7 10(b) is properly limited to purchasers or sellers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b497-13\">. The Eleventh Circuit recently discussed a related issue in <em>Liberty Nat\u2019l Ins. Holding Co. v. Charter Co., </em>734 F.2d 545 (1984). There the court held that the shareholder plaintiffs did not have a private cause of action under \u00a7 10(b) to force the controlling shareholder to divest itself of its holdings, or to remove voting power from the controlling shareholder. At 558-59. In <em>Tally v. Mott Supermarkets, Inc., </em>540 F.2d 187 (3d Cir. 1976), the court assumed for \"present purposes\" only, that the \u201crelaxed standing rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Kahan </em>retains its validity after <em>Blue Chip Stamps </em>in appropriate cases where only injunc-tive relief is sought to prevent incipient 10b-5 violations\u201d but then held that the case before it did not fit into the <em>\u201cKahan </em>exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194. In <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>526 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir.1976), the court, in dicta, did approve the \"approach taken by the Second Circuit [in <em>Mutual Shares Corp. v. Genesco ] </em>with regard to in-junctive relief\u201d but only after it had ruled that the plaintiff was \u201cclearly a \u2018seller\u2019 under the [ ] definitional provisions of the Act.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1289-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">The only other appellate court to reach this issue directly was a <em>pre-Blue Chip </em>case from the Eighth Circuit which adopted the view we take in this case. <em>See Greater Iowa Corp. v. McLen-don, </em>378 F.2d 783, 791 (8th Cir.1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b499-6\">. Appellees address this claim as though Cowin sought only to void the 1980 directors\u2019 elections. <em>See </em>Brief for Defendants-Appellees at 37. However, Cowin claims that the complaint alleges \"that defendants are continuing to issue deceptive proxy statements\u201d and that the relief he requests is not limited only to a declaration that the 1980 election is void. Reply Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant at 28. While the complaint is hardly a model of clarity on this point, we agree that it can, and should, be read in this fashion. Appellees\u2019 \"mootness\u201d argument, see Brief for Defendants-Appellees at 37, is thus rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b500-6\">. To the extent appellees argue that Cowin's \u00a7 14(a) claims \u2014 based primarily on self-dealing transactions in violation of the common law\u2014 are barred by <em>Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green, </em>430 U.S. 462, 97 S.Ct. 1292, 51 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977), we think the district court is the proper forum for the initial determination of this question. While the district court apparently alludes to this argument, R.E. at 40-41, the opinion on this point is undeveloped. In this regard, however, we again note our discomfort with the \u25a0 district court\u2019s dismissal of most of Cowin\u2019s claims without permitting any discovery on any of the issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b500-11\">.
