On appeal, Carter essentially contends (1) that the district court erred in dismissing his substantive claims against the defendants with prejudice on the ground that those claims were frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), and (2) that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u201cindependent actions\u201d for relief from prior federal court dismissals and state court judgments pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Finding Carter\u2019s contentions to be without merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-22\">The plaintiff Carter, who has previously filed over 178 actions in various courts, <em>see Carter v. Telectron, Inc., </em>452 F.Supp. 944, 954 (S.D.Tex.1977) (list of cases filed by Carter as of 1977), filed the present complaint in the district court for the Western District of Texas alleging seven claims for relief. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-23\">1. A claim seeking damages from the defendants for an alleged conspiracy to wrongfully indict and convict Carter of embezzlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-24\">2. A claim for $17,485.67 in damages from Carter\u2019s former employer for unpaid sales commissions and unreim-bursed business expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-25\">3. A claim for $26,931.56 in damages as reimbursements for the defendants\u2019 allegedly defective products, which had been sold by Carter to third parties and sold to Carter himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>4. A claim for additional damages on claims 2 and 3 because of the effects of inflation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-5\">5. An independent action under Fed.R. Civ.P. 60(b) to vacate a dismissal with prejudice entered by the district court for the Southern District of Texas, <em>Carter v. Telectron, Inc., </em>Civil Action No. G-77-9 (S.D.Tex.1977).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-6\">6. An independent action under Fed.R. Civ.P. 60(b) to vacate two state court judgments against Carter, identified as <em>Carter v. Dolce, </em>No. 79-CI-10253 (73rd district court of Bexar County, Texas) and <em>Carter v. Telectron, Inc., </em>No. 79-CI-12476 (166th district court of Bexar County, Texas).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-7\">7. An independent action under Fed.R. Civ.P. 60(b) to vacate a dismissal with prejudice entered by the district court for the Northern District of Texas, <em>Carter v. Dolce, </em>No. CA2-82-062 (N.D.Tex.1982). The district court referred Carter\u2019s pro</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">se complaint to a magistrate for a report and recommendation on whether Carter should be allowed to proceed in forma pau-peris and whether Carter\u2019s complaint was frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). The magistrate recommended that (1) Carter be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis and that (2) Carter\u2019s complaint be dismissed as a frivolous action under \u00a7 1915(d). The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings, and dismissed Carter\u2019s action with prejudice. Carter now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Carter claims that the district court erred in dismissing his diversity action with prejudice since he had stated colorable grounds for relief in his substantive claims against the defendants (Claims 1 through 4, summarized above). In prior unsuccessful litigation, Carter has either previously litigated or previously had the opportunity to litigate claims identical to those asserted by Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4 of his present complaint. Therefore, by Claims 5, 6 and 7, Carter brings \u201cindependent actions\u201d under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) to set aside those previous dismissals and judgments so that he may here once again relitigate those previously presented issues concluded adversely to him. Carter candidly admits in his pro se brief on appeal that he must prevail on Claims 5-7 (seeking vacation of previous judgments) before he can prevail on Claims 1-4 (asserting substantive grounds for relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">Because we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Carter\u2019s independent actions for relief from \u25a0these previous judgments <em>{see </em>Part II, <em>infra ), </em>we find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that Carter\u2019s present diversity action should be dismissed with prejudice as a frivolous attempt to relitigate previously settled issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">As stated above, Carter\u2019s substantive claims for relief are frivolous unless the judgments that previously determined claims identical to those presented here are set aside under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Fed.R. Civ.P. 60(b) states in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-15\">This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to grant relief to a defendant not actually personally notified as provided in Title 28, U.S.C., \u00a7 1655, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-16\">The independent action is a vestige of the equity powers of federal courts, preserved by a \u201csavings clause\u201d in Rule 60(b), that provides a mechanism for relief from a prior judgment in certain narrowly-defined circumstances. As one commentator describes it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-17\">Resort to an independent action may be had only rarely, and then only under unusual and exceptional circumstances. It is not the function of an independent action to relitigate issues finally determined in another action between the same parties. It is not a remedy for inadvertence or oversight by the losing party in the original action, nor will it lie on behalf of a party who was himself at fault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>11 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 2868 at p. 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">In <em>Addington v. Farmer\u2019s Elevator Mutual Insurance Co., </em>650 F.2d 663, 668 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>454 U.S. 1098, 102 S.Ct. 672, 70 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981), this court affirmed a district court\u2019s denial of an independent action for relief, noting particularly that \u201cthe plaintiff has alleged no facts indicating that the issues raised [in the previous action] were not open to litigation in the former action or that he was denied a fair opportunity to make his claim or defense in that action.\u201d Applying these standards to the present case, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Carter\u2019s Rule 60(b) independent actions for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Carter alleges that the district court should have vacated a dismissal with prejudice in Civil Action No. G-77-9 (S.D.Tex. 1977), in which Carter had asserted a claim identical to the first claim alleged in Carter\u2019s present complaint. Carter alleges that this previous dismissal should be vacated because it was premised on Carter\u2019s state court conviction, which has since been overturned on federal habeas review. <em>Carter v. Estelle, </em>677 F.2d 427 (5th Cir.1982) (habeas writ granted on double jeopardy grounds), <em>cert, denied, </em>460 U.S. 1056, 103 S.Ct. 1508, 75 L.Ed.2d 937 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">A review of the district court\u2019s opinion in this previous action belies Carter\u2019s contention. The dismissal of Civil Action No. G-77-9 is reported in <em>Carter v. Telectron, Inc., </em>452 F.Supp. 944 (S.D.Tex.1977). That district court specifically noted that Carter\u2019s conspiracy claim was \u201cwithout arguable merit and therefore frivolous in accordance with current case law on this point.\u201d 452 F.Supp. at 1002. The district court did not advert to and placed no reliance on Carter\u2019s state court conviction (which was later overturned). We find no grounds that support Carter\u2019s contention that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Rule 60(b) independent action to vacate Civil Action No. G-77-9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Carter also claims that the district court abused its discretion by denying his independent action for relief from a prior dismissal with prejudice entered in <em>Carter v. Dolce, </em>Civil Action No. CA2-82-062 (N.D.Tex.1982), which raised claims identical to Carter\u2019s second, third and fourth claims in the present suit. The district court in that action articulated five alternative reasons to support its dismissal of the case with prejudice. Carter\u2019s present independent action for relief merely attacks each ground of that prior ruling. The independent action is not a basis for the relitigation of issues adjudicated by the judgment now sought to be annulled. <em>Adding-ton, supra, </em>650 F.2d at 668. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Carter\u2019s independent action to vacate the dismissal with prejudice in Civil Action No. CA2-82-062.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Carter\u2019s Rule 60(b) independent actions for relief from the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>missals with prejudice entered in Civil Action Nos. G-77-9 and CA2-82-062. The substantive claims raised by Carter in the present suit are identical to those settled in these previously dismissed actions. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing this action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">. Carter raises other allegations of error about the dismissal of Civil Action No. G-77-9, but we can find no reason why these other questions could not have been raised on a direct appeal from the dismissal. In accordance with the principle that a Rule 60(b) independent action may not be used merely to relitigate settled issues, <em>see Addington, supra, </em>650 F.2d at 668, Carter\u2019s other allegations are thus not proper grounds for relief in a Rule 60(b) independent action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\">. Carter also asserts that the district court erred in the present case by failing to address his independent action under Rule 60(b) to vacate two state court judgments against him. <em>(See </em>Carter\u2019s Claim 6, <em>supra). </em>The district court apparently stopped short of that issue since it refused to grant Rule 60(b) relief as to the two federal court dismissals (Civil Action Nos. G-77-9 and CA2-82-062). Since the federal court dismissals alone foreclosed review of Carter\u2019s substantive claims in Counts 1 through 4, it was not necessary for the district court to rule on the independent action for relief from those state court judgments challenged by Carter. Moreover, we note that a substantial issue exists as to whether a Rule 60(b) independent action is an available mechanism for challenging a state court judgment. <em>See </em>11 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 2868 at p. 245. We, of course, leave that question for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
