Bet-hell filed this civil rights suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), seeking a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional as applied outside the boundaries of the state, preliminary and permanent injunctions against its extraterritorial application, and damages. The district court granted Bet-hell summary judgment regarding the constitutionality of the statute, and issued a permanent injunction against its application outside Florida boundaries. The court reserved ruling on the issue of damages. The State appeals; we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (1982) (allowing interlocutory appeal from an order granting an injunction).</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-14\">Since the State\u2019s appeal, the Florida Supreme Court has construed section 370.-1105(2), under which Bethell was arrested, and determined that it does not apply outside the territorial boundaries of the state. <em>Southeastern Fisheries Association, Inc. v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>453 So.2d 1351 (Fla.1984). Accordingly, we no longer have a live controversy before us on this issue. We thus are obliged to vacate the district court\u2019s order granting injunc-tive relief and to remand the case for disposition of any remaining claims. See <em>Hall v. Beals, </em>396 U.S. 45, 90 S.Ct. 200, 201-02, 24 L.Ed.2d 214 (1969) (vacating judgment and remanding case which had \u201clost its character as a present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if we are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-15\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
