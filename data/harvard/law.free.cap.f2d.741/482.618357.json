Appeal is from a judgment, designated as final pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, I. Leo Glasser, Judge, dismissing the RICO claims in appellant\u2019s amended complaint. 574 F.Supp. 963. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">This case involves business fraud. Plaintiff-appellant Sedima S.P.R.L. (Sedima) is a Belgian corporation in the business of importing and exporting to and from Belgium electronic, mechanical and hydraulic parts manufactured in the United States and abroad. Appellee Imrex is an American corporation engaged in exporting aircraft and aircraft-related electronic component parts. Appellees Jacob Arm\u00f3n and Gidon Arm\u00f3n are officers of Imrex.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-18\">In 1979, Sedima and Imrex entered into a joint venture to provide electronic component parts for a NATO subcontractor in Belgium. Imrex obtained the parts and shipped them to Europe pursuant to orders secured by Sedima. Sedima allegedly secured approximately $8.5 million worth of orders to be placed through Imrex.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-19\">Sedima alleges that Imrex and the Ar-mons fraudulently prepared purchase orders, invoices and credit memoranda for Sedima that they knew falsely overstated purchase prices, attendant costs and shipping and financing charges of the parts purchased on behalf of the joint venture. The complaint further alleges that Imrex received monies belonging to the joint venture pursuant to these fraudulent purchase orders, invoices and credit memoranda. In addition to counts alleging breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, breach of the joint venture agreement, conversion, breach of a constructive trust and a cause of action based on quasi contract, three of the counts allege violations of RICO, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Two of the RICO counts allege that the fraudulent purchase orders, invoices and credit memoranda constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, the predicate acts being separate and numerous violations of the Mail Fraud Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (1982) and the Wire Fraud Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (1982). The third count charges a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) and (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sedima seeks treble damages and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees under these RICO counts. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\n<em>The District Court Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Judge Glasser dismissed the RICO counts on the basis that there was a failure to allege a RICO-type injury. In so holding, he relied on a series of decisions, discussed <em>infra, </em>which have stated that in order for an injury to be \u201cby reason of a violation , of section 1962,\u201d as required by section 1964(c), something more than or different from injury that would result from the predicate acts alone must be shown by the plaintiff. <em>Bankers Trust Co. v. Feldesman, </em>566 F.Supp. 1235, 1240-42 (S.D.N.Y.1983); <em>Landmark Savings &amp; Loan v. Loeb Rhoades, Hornblower &amp; Co., </em>527 F.Supp. 206, 206-09 (E.D.Mich.1981); <em>North Barrington Development, Inc. v. Fanslow, </em>547 F.Supp. 207, 210-11 (N.D.Ill. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">The district court adopted the reasoning of two related lines of cases. One series of cases, relying on an analogy between RICO and the antitrust laws, requires that a RICO plaintiff allege a \u201ccompetitive injury,\u201d that is, an injury to business or property stemming from competitive harm. <em>North Barrington, </em>547 F.Supp. at 210-11, <em>Harper v. New Japan Securities International, Inc., </em>545 F.Supp. 1002, 1007 (C.D. Cal.1982); <em>Feldesman, </em>566 F.Supp. at 1241. The other series of cases requires plaintiffs to allege a \u201cracketeering enterprise injury,\u201d an injury that occurs where \u201ca civil RICO defendant\u2019s ability to harm the plaintiff is enhanced by the infusion of money from a pattern of racketeering acts into the enterprise.\u201d <em>Landmark Savings, </em>527 F.Supp. at 209, relying upon Note, <em>Reading the Enterprise Element Back Into RICO: Sections 1962 and 1964(c), </em>76 Nw.U.L.Rev. 100, 125-33 (1981). Judge Glasser found no allegation of any injury in this case apart from that which would result directly from the alleged predicate acts of mail fraud and wire fraud, and accordingly dismissed the RICO counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">The problem addressed by the district court, which has received much attention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>both in the courts and among commentators, is that a broad reading of the civil RICO provisions would allow plaintiffs to bring suit in federal court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under RICO nearly anytime they could allege injury caused by two acts which are violations of any one of the predicate acts listed in RICO. Since these predicate acts include a great many state law violations, federal securities law violations, and federal mail and wire fraud violations, an expansive interpretation of RICO allows plaintiffs to bring into federal courts many claims formerly subject only to state jurisdiction, and to bypass remedial schemes created by Congress, particularly in the securities area. The fact that successful RICO plaintiffs may obtain treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees provides, of course, additional incentives to plaintiffs to categorize their actions as RICO claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Section 1964(c) states that anyone \u201cinjured\u201d \u201cby reason of\u201d a violation of section 1962 is entitled to treble damages. Section 1962 \u201cviolations\u201d include conducting \u201centerprises\u201d \u201cthrough a pattern of racketeering\u201d; a \u201cpattern of racketeering\u201d is defined by section 1961(5) as two or more \u201cacts of racketeering\u201d occurring within a given time. \u201cActs of racketeering\u201d are defined by section 1961(1), inter alia, as any of a number of acts \u201cchargeable under State law,\u201d acts \u201cindictable\u201d under a variety of federal laws, or an \u201coffense\u201d under the federal securities law. Thus, ignoring for the moment some troubling ambiguities, the statute on its surface seems to allow private suits for people injured by defendants who have committed two so-called predicate acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Given this language it is not surprising that there has been an explosion of civil RICO litigation. Only a few cases including civil RICO claims were published in the decade following passage of the Act in 1970;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a law review note asserts that courts published only two opinions dealing with civil RICO by 1978 and only thirteen by early 1981. Note, <em>Civil RICO: The Temptation and Impropriety of Judicial Restriction, </em>95 Harv.L.Rev. 1101 n. 7 (1982). There are now over 100 published decisions. Siegel, <em>\u201cRICO\u201dRunning Amok in Board Rooms, </em>L.A. Times, Feb. 15, 1984, at 1. This development has resulted, no doubt, from the bar\u2019s increased awareness of the statute, spawned, perhaps, by an influential law review article coauthored by Professor G. Robert Blakey and Brian Gettings which proposed a broad reading of the statute. Professor Blakey\u2019s position as chief counsel to the Senate subcommittee which proposed RICO has evidently given his expansive views of the statute special credence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A veritable wave of commentaries and cases making civil claims along lines suggested by Blakey and Get-tings and others has occurred. We are told that there is now indeed a \u201cRICO bar\u201d which specializes in bringing or defending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>RICO claims. And members of that \u201cbar\u201d have found, as would appear obvious, that the stigma associated with the label \u201cracketeering\u201d is a good settlement weapon.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, a current adage is said to be that \u201cRICO provides the only <em>civil </em>action where the defendant pleads not guilty.\u201d Bridges, <em>supra </em>note 6 at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The problem with civil RICO is not the explosion of federal litigation. Congress is of course free to create federal causes of action for civil litigants within constitutional limits not necessarily in question here. <em>But see infra </em>notes 24, 49. But there is simply no evidence that in creating RICO, Congress intended to create the broad civil cause of action that the reading of the statute given by its proponents would allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, as its very name implies, was designed to combat organized crime. The damage done by organized crime was the subject of much public concern and congressional activity throughout the 1950s and 1960s.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> RICO was enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub.Law 91-452 (1970), an act designed \u201cto seek the eradication of organized crime in the United States ... by providing new remedies to deal with unlawful activities of those engaged in organized crime.\u201d 116 Cong.Rec. 35191 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Title IX itself was designed \u201cto protect legitimate businesses against the syndicate\u2019s infiltration.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It was an attempt to deal with organized crime as an economic phenomenon. In so doing, its enforcement provisions were modeled after the enforcement provisions of the antitrust laws. <em>See, e.g., infra </em>text accompanying note 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Given the general purpose of the RICO legislation, the uses to which private civil RICO has been put have been extraordinary, if not outrageous. Section 1964(c) has not proved particularly useful for generating treble damage actions against mobsters by victimized businesspeople. It has, instead, led to claims against such respected and legitimate \u201centerprises\u201d as the American Express Company, E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., Lloyd\u2019s of London, Bear Stearns &amp; Co., and Merrill Lynch,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to name a few defendants labeled as \u201cracketeers\u201d in civil RICO claims resulting in published decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Though there are a few reported cases where RICO has been used against reputed mobsters <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or at least against organized criminals,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it is being far more frequently used for purposes totally unrelated to its expressed purpose. It has become a standard practice, for example, to insert a RICO claim in litigation involving tender offers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It has become commonly used, as here, in typical business fraud cases,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>so-called \u201cgarden variety\u201d securities fraud cases,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and in bank fraud cases.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">RICO, then, presents a classic case of a statute whose ambiguous language needs to be construed in light of Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting it.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The need to discern legislative intent is particularly important when, as here, crucial statutory language is drawn <em>in haec verba </em>from another statute where it has a peculiar technical meaning. The law itself calls for reference to legislative intent since the liberal construction clause states that the text should be construed to \u201ceffectuate its remedial purpose.\u201d We are, then, obliged to study the legislative history of RICO and particularly of section 1964(c) to inform our reading of that statute and, in particular, of the scope of the private civil remedy created by the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">\n<em>Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">The legislative history of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 gives little hint of the intended scope of private action under civil RICO. While the Act for the most part originated in the Senate, the civil provision permitting suit by private persons, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c), originated in the House.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Consequently it is not mentioned in the Senate Report, although the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>three subsections of section 1964 that were included in the Senate bill are discussed. This fact, we believe, is critical to consideration of the legislation. This is true because the \u201c[cjivil approach\u201d discussed in the report of the Senate Judiciary Committee accompanying S. 30, Rep. No. 91-617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 80-83 (1969), refers solely to the Government\u2019s right to seek and obtain injunctions to prevent and restrain violations of section 1962 through divestment by individuals of their interest in enterprises, imposing restraints on future activities or investments, or ordering dissolution or reorganization of any enterprise. <em>Id. </em>at 24. Consequently any comments in the Senate Report analogizing to the antitrust laws, referring to the American Bar Association position in the Senate hearings, or otherwise pertaining to the Senate\u2019s \u201c[cjivil approach\u201d do not pertain to the scope, impact, or purpose of the private treble damage remedy inserted later by the House of Representatives.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">Ultimately the Senate accepted the House amendment adding subsection (c). Apparently, as the session was about to end, the Senate did not ask for a conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">The legislative history on the House side is not much more instructive. The decision to add a civil private damages provision was made by a House subcommittee at the behest of Representative Sam Steiger and the American Bar Association.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>tion was not considered an important one, a remarkable fact which in itself indicates that Congress did not intend the section to have the extraordinary impact claimed for it. Indeed, when the Judiciary Committee initially introduced the amended bill, it did not even announce to the House that it had made the addition.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It was only in the middle of the second and last day of House discussion of the bill that a member of the committee noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARc\">at the suggestion of the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Steiger) and also the American Bar Association and others, the corn-mittee has provided that private persons injured by reason of a violation of the title may recover treble damages in Federal courts \u2014 another example of the antitrust remedy being adapted for use against organized criminality.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A12\">This brief remark is one of only three statements regarding section 1964(c) made on the House floor. <em>See supra </em>note 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The House subcommittee hearings<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> are not much more helpful. Although they contain useful analysis of the purposes for creating civil remedies for the government,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and generally for applying anti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>trust type civil remedies in the fight against organized crime,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> most of this discussion took place before the private remedy was added to the bill. Thus, although there was testimony that section 1964 was too broad,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> none of that testimony was addressed to the private cause of action provision. The only discussion accompanying the introduction of the private action came in a statement by Representative Steiger, who wrote that such an amendment would enable \u201cthose who have been wronged by organized crime [to] at least be given access to a legal remedy\u201d and that it would also \u201cenhance the effectiveness of Title IX\u2019s prohibitions.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Nor do the House\u2019s broad pronouncements on the purposes of Title IX or on the meaning of its other sections reveal Congress\u2019 intent in promulgating the private action. The House Report in its introductory section refers, inter alia, to the purpose of \u201cproscribing the operation of any enterprise engaged in interstate commerce through a \"pattern\u2019 o[f] \u2018racketeering activity.\u2019 \u201d H.Rep. No. 91-1549, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 35, <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4007, 4010 (1970). It states that \u201c \u2018[Racketeering activity\u2019 is defined in terms of specific State and Federal criminal statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It adds that \u201c[t]he title, as amended, also authorizes civil treble damages suits on the part of private parties who are injured.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">The section by section explanation is hardly more helpful. Referring to section 1961(1)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> which defines \u201cracketeering activity,\u201d the report says that that term is defined</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-15\">to include murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, narcotic violations, counterfeiting, usury, mail, bankruptcy, wire and securities fraud, and obstruction of justice. State offenses are included by generic designation. Federal offenses are included by specific reference. The term \u201cracketeer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>ing activity\u201d is a key statutory term. Under section 1962 below, racketeering activity is one of three prerequisites to commission of an offense. If there is no racketeering activity, or no collection of an \u201cunlawful debt\u201d there can be no violation of the provisions of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 56, <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4032. The House Report defines \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d only by referring to the section 1961(5) <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> definition that it is the equivalent of at least two acts of racketeering activity occurring within a given time period. <em>Id. </em>The report deals with section 1962 by saying that it \u201cestablishes a threefold prohibition aimed at stopping the infiltration of racketeers into legitimate organizations,\u201d noting that subsection (c) \u201cprohibits the conduct of the enterprise through the prohibited pattern of activity or collection of debt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S. Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News at 4033. In reference to the civil remedies provided in section 1964(c) for the violation of section 1962, the report merely paraphrases the language of section 1964(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The most important and evident conclusion to be drawn from the legislative history is that the Congress was not aware of the possible implications of section 1964(c). If Congress had intended to provide a federal forum for plaintiffs for so many common law wrongs, it would at least have discussed it. If Congress had intended to provide an alternate and more attractive scheme for private parties to remedy violations of the securities laws \u2014 involving decades of statutes, regulations, commentaries, and jurisprudence \u2014 it would at least have mentioned it. The House Judiciary Committee, which authored the provision, would at least have mentioned the amendment to the full House as a major change in its report had there been any inkling of its possible implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">The clanging silence of the legislative history, coupled with the section\u2019s use in areas far afield from the battle against organized crime, has led some, though con-cededly not all, courts to read various limitations into the act in order to conform its use to that thought to best effectuate the congressional purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">Four such limitations have been widely considered: (1) whether RICO requires some nexus between the challenged activity and organized crime; (2) whether the injury complained of must result from \u201centerprise\u201d involvement in the racketeering, rather than directly from the activity itself; (3) whether plaintiffs must allege a \u201ccompetitive\u201d or \u201cracketeering injury\u201d; and (4) whether there must be criminal convictions for the predicate acts underlying a civil RICO suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Even a cursory review of the case law indicates that there is simply no consensus on what RICO requires. While some courts have held that only those activities with some connection to organized crime may be the subject of civil RICO suits,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> others, including this circuit,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> have' rejected this limitation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Similarly, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>some courts have read RICO to require a showing of \u201ccompetitive\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> or \u201cracketeering\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> injury, more have held against imposing such limitations.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Finally, courts have split on whether there must be criminal convictions for the predicate acts prior to institution of a private civil RICO suit. <em>See </em>cases cited at <em>infra </em>note 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We have as yet little guidance from the Supreme Court as to which, if any, of these different understandings of RICO\u2019s private civil remedy is appropriate. In holding in <em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) that the term \u201centerprise\u201d as used in RICO encompasses both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises, and that an enterprise must be an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages, 452 U.S. at 587,101 S.Ct. at 2530, the Court said in reference to the civil remedies that \u201c[a]s a general proposition, however, the civil remedies could be useful in eradicating organized crime from the social fabric, whether the enterprise be ostensibly legitimate or admittedly criminal.\u201d It went on to say that \u201c[t]he aim is to divest the association of the fruits of its ill-gotten gains.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 101 S.Ct. at 2529. The Court concluded that it is \u201cuntenable\u201d that the existence of the civil remedies \u201climits the scope of this criminal provision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">The Court recognized that Congress, in passing RICO, intended to \u201calter somewhat the role of the Federal Government in the war against organized crime,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 587, 101 S.Ct. at 2530, and rejected the lower court\u2019s view that in order to right \u201cthe balance between federal and state enforcement of criminal law\u201d it was obliged to read narrowly the statutory definition of \u201centerprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586-87, 101 S.Ct. at 2530. However, the Court was only discussing congressional intention as to the criminal enforcement provisions of RICO, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>not the intended scope of the private civil remedy. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, the Court\u2019s invocation of the plain meaning rule as regards the Congressional definition of \u201centerprise\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(4), 452 U.S. at 580-81, 101 S.Ct. at 2527, provides little or no guidance as to the handling of the very real ambiguities, which we discuss below, surrounding the complex statutory scheme providing for the private civil remedy. <em>See Harper v. New Japan Securities International, Inc., </em>545 F.Supp. 1002, 1005-06 (C.D.Cal.1982).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">I. <em>Injury by Reason of Racketeering Activity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">We agree with the district court that the appellant has failed to allege any injury to its business \u201cby reason of a violation of section 1962,\u201d as required by section 1964(c). The \u201cby reason of\u201d standing limitation to RICO has been endorsed by a great many district courts. <em>See </em>cases cited in <em>supra </em>notes 33-34. They argue that the \u201cby reason of\u201d language was put into the statute by Congress as a way to limit standing to sue under RICO to people hurt by an injury of the type RICO was intended to prevent. RICO was intended not simply to provide additional remedies for already compensable injuries,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> but rather to provide added remedies and procedures to fight certain specific kinds of organized criminality. The \u201cby reason of\u201d language, therefore, requires that plaintiffs allege injury caused by an activity which RICO was designed' to deter, which, whatever it may be, is different from that caused simply by such predicate acts as are alleged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">The justification for this limitation is not derived solely from the language of the statute.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Instead, many courts focus on the fact that the \u201cby reason of\u201d language is drawn directly from section four of the Clayton Act. In that act the language has been construed to require plaintiffs to allege and prove an \u201cantitrust injury,\u201d <em>e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S.Ct. 690, 697, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977), which the Supreme Court has defined as \u201cinjury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By analogy, then, the \u201cby reason of\u201d language in section 1964(c) is intended to limit standing to those injured by a \u201cracketeering injury,\u201d by an injury of the type RICO was designed to prevent. <em>See, e.g., In re Action Industries Tender Offer, </em>572 F.Supp. at 851-52; <em>Johnsen v. Rogers, </em>551 F.Supp. at 285.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-17\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The term \u201cpattern\" itself requires the showing of a relationship, and the committee report ... thus reinforces that interpretation. So, therefore, proof of two acts of racketeering activity, without more, does not establish a pattern and the ACLU\u2019s fears are unwarranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Two kinds of questions have, however, been raised in relation to finding a standing requirement analogous to the Clayton Act\u2019s in RICO\u2019s \u201cby reason of\u201d language. First, courts and commentators have argued that the legislative history demonstrates that Congress did not intend to have the Clayton Act\u2019s standing requirement applied to RICO. <em>E.g. Schact v. Brown, </em>711 F.2d at 1357-58; Blakey &amp; Gettings, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 1015-17 &amp; nn. 24-32, 1041. The second question has to do with defining precisely what is meant by a \u201cracketeering injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">One of the Senate predecessors to RICO was framed as an amendment to the Clayton Act. S. 2048, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967). This approach was rejected by the House Judiciary Committee in part because it was thought that the strict standing requirements of the Clayton Act should not have to be met by plaintiffs suing under RICO. House Hearings, <em>supra </em>note 9, at 149 (Statement of the Antitrust Section of the ABA). Similarly, on the Senate floor a number of Senators explicitly rejected the idea of \u201cimputing the great complexity of antitrust law enforcement\u201d to RICO,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> although this discussion did not refer to the <em>private </em>civil action which, as we have noted, was added to the bill only after it had left the Senate. The legislative history suggests that it would therefore be inappropriate to carry over wholesale all of the elaborate antitrust standing case law onto RICO. It would no doubt violate both the congressional purpose and common sense to require RICO plaintiffs to allege an injury of the type the <em>antitrust </em>laws were designed to prevent to maintain a RICO suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">On the other hand, there is nothing in the legislative history which suggests that Congress did not intend to create <em>analogous </em>standing barriers to RICO by using the \u201cby reason of\u201d language. By borrowing language imposing a standing limitation, it is reasonable to believe that Congress indicated a desire to have an analogous standing limitation imposed in RICO.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">The question then becomes what kind of injury is a \u201cracketeering injury\u201d? As has been said, RICO was intended to \u201caddress the infiltration of legitimate business by organized crime.\u201d <em>Turkette, </em>452 U.S. at 591, 101 S.Ct. at 2532. According to the congressional statement of findings and purpose, the Act was to seek to eradicate organized crime because \u201corganized crime activities in the United States weaken the stability of the Nation\u2019s economic system, harm innocent investors and competing organizations, interfere with free competition, seriously burden interstate and foreign commerce, threaten the domestic security, and undermine the general welfare of the Nation and its citizens.\u201d <em>See also </em>legislative history cited in <em>Bridges, supra </em>note 6, at 68-72 &amp; nn. 133-39. RICO was not enacted merely because criminals break laws, but because mobsters, either through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the infiltration of legit\u00edmate enterprises or through the activities of illegitimate enterprises, cause systemic harm to competition and the market, and thereby injure investors and competitors. It was to help solve this problem that Congress added RICO to the arsenal of weapons used to fight organized crime. It is only when injury caused by this kind of harm can be shown, therefore, that we believe that Congress intended that standing to sue civilly should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">This is, we repeat, by no means to say that standing to sue under RICO should be limited only to people who have standing to sue for a competitive injury under the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> This is so because Congress in promulgating RICO was addressing the kind of economic injury which has an effect on competition, but nowhere suggested that actual anticompetitive effect is required for suits under the statute. For purposes of clarity, it is better to identify the RICO standing requirement as a \u201cracketeering injury\u201d requirement rather than a \u201ccompetitive injury\u201d requirement, as the latter term may incorrectly suggest that all of the details of the antitrust law standing requirement are being incorporated by reference. This carries with it at least, as the trial judge found, the obligation that the plaintiff show injury different in kind from that occurring as a result of the predicate acts themselves, or not simply caused by the predicate acts, but also caused by an activity which RICO was designed to deter.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">II. <em>Necessity of a Prior Conviction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">In <em>Trane Co. v. O\u2019Connor Securities, </em>718 F.2d 26, 29 (2d Cir.1983), we left \u201cto another day\u201d the question whether a prior criminal conviction is a prerequisite to a civil RICO action. We now hold that it is. A number of cases have discussed the problem with little or no analysis. Even the commentators who would call for an expansive reading of the Act have done likewise, merely citing those same cases in footnotes. <em>E.g., </em>Note, <em>Civil RICO, supra </em>note 35, at 1103 n. 17; Blakey and Get-tings, <em>supra </em>note 6, at n. 129. For reasons that appear below, we cannot agree with these decisions and commentators.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">A. <em>The Case Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\"><em>United States v. Cappetto, </em>502 F.2d 1351 (7th Cir.1974), <em>cert, denied, </em>420 U.S. 925, 95 S.Ct. 1121, 43 L.Ed.2d 395 (1975), is the case most frequently relied upon by courts which have held that criminal convictions are not required before private civil actions may be maintained. <em>Cappetto, </em>however, dealt solely with the government\u2019s right, in the absence of a criminal conviction, to sue for an injunction under section 1964(a) to prevent or restrain violations of RICO. The case held that Congress was entitled to make civil equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>relief available to the government to prevent or restrain certain actions under subsection 1964(a). In so doing, the court relied on a long series of cases which hold that the government is entitled to bring civil suits for acts which are also punishable as crimes, especially when it is seeking remedial equitable relief and not punitive relief. 502 F.2d at 1356-57. Thus, far from determining the question of the intended or appropriate scope of the treble damage remedy provided to private parties under subsection 1964(e), <em>Cappetto </em>made no holding with respect to private civil actions. As a matter of policy, government actions and private actions are of course very different. Prosecutorial discretion, and in the case of RICO, guidelines from the Department of Justice, protect against overbroad use of RICO. <em>See United States Attorneys\u2019 Staff Manual, Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, RICO Guidelines </em>(Jan. 30, 1981).. There is no comparable way to limit private RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><em>Farmers Bank of Delaware v. Bell Mortgage Corp., </em>452 F.Supp. 1278, 1280 (D.Del.1978), did squarely hold that section 1964(c) \u201cdoes not condition that cause of action in any way upon a previous conviction under the criminal provisions of the statute,\u201d and adds that it is only necessary that the plaintiff prove the elements of the RICO action by a preponderance of the evidence in order to be awarded damages in a civil action. However, as support for these propositions it cites only to <em>Cappetto. </em>452 F.Supp. at 1280. Almost all other cases that hold that criminal convictions are not necessary rely either on <em>Farmers Bank </em>or <em>Cappetto </em>and offer no other reasoning to support their conclusion.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">The only other argument put forward for the position that criminal convictions are not required for civil RICO suits is contained in <em>USACO Coal Co. v. Carbomin Energy, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 94, 95 n. 1 (6th Cir.1982). In a footnote the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agr\">Section 1962 merely describes acts that are \u201cunlawful\u201d under RICO. Section 1963 provides that violations of \u00a7 1962 are criminal, just as \u00a7 1964(c) provides that violations of \u00a7 1962 create a private right of action for damages. If Congress had intended to limit liability under \u00a7 1964(c) only to those convicted of or charged with RICO crimes, it would have done so within \u00a7 1964(c) by referring to \u00a7 1963 or by otherwise specifically indicating that a conviction under \u00a7 1963 is a basis for civil damages. By referring in \u00a7 1964(c) only to the unlawful acts of \u00a7 1962, Congress has created a civil remedy that is independent of criminal proceedings under \u00a7 1963.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">While this argument is, at least, based upon the statute, we think it is misguided. If Congress had referred to sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tion 1963 in section 1964(c), the result would have been not only to require criminal convictions for the predicate acts before bringing a civil suit, but to require a conviction under <em>RICO. </em>By referring to section 1962 in section 1964(c), it is our view that Congress intended to refer to injuries caused by the \u201cunlawful\u201d pattern of racketeering, defined in section 1961(5) as \u201crequir[ing]\u201d two of the criminal acts listed in section 1961(1). Thus people injured by \u201cracketeering activity\u201d may sue, assuming they have standing to sue, whether or not the government has brought an action <em>under RICO </em>to punish that activity. As to whether that racketeering activity itself must already have been proven criminal, the question we are facing here, the reference to section 1962 in section 1964(c) provides no indication.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">B. <em>Statutory Analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">1. <em>Language. </em>To determine the scope and content of the civil remedy, the proper place to begin analysis is, as always, the statutory language itself. To start, section 1964 itself draws several distinctions between the government and private persons. Subsection 1964(a) gives the district courts jurisdiction to \u201cprevent and restrain violations\u201d of section 1962; it is not a general grant of jurisdiction and does not relate to subsection (c). Subsection (b) permits the Attorney General to institute proceedings under the section; it was drawn when subsection (c) was not in the statute and relates back to subsection (a).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Study of the particular words chosen by Congress in drafting section 1964(c) is also fruitful. Section 1964(c), as has been noted, \u201cis modeled after, but is not identical to, section 4 of the Clayton Act.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Therefore, any variations between the language of section four of the Clayton Act and section 1964(c) of RICO are especially instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">The Clayton Act provision reads in relevant part: \u201cany person who shall be injured in his business or property <em>by reason of anything forbidden </em>in the antitrust laws may sue____\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a) (1982) (emphasis added). RICO section 1964(c), on the other hand, reads: \u201cAny person injured in his business or property <em>by reason of a violation </em>of section 1962 of this chapter may sue ...\u201d (emphasis added). The difference is instructive. It is possible to argue that \u201cviolation\u201d is simply a shorthand way of saying \u201cby reason of anything forbidden,\u201d and one could suppose that when the House of Representatives reinserted the treble damage private right of action provision which had been rejected by the Senate it approved this change in a desire merely to eschew sur-plusage.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> But this interpretation does not seem as compelling as one which suggests that the change was made with a specific intent in mind \u2014 to require that conviction at least of the predicate acts be had before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>a civil suit may be brought by a private person.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">It is helpful to look back to the definition in section 1961(1) of \u201cracketeering activity,\u201d since we are referred to section 1962 by way of section 1964(c), and section 1962(a) makes \u201ca pattern of racketeering activity\u201d \u201cunlawful\u201d in certain circumstances. Section 1961(1) describes four distinct types of such activity. Those under subparagraph (A) include <em>\u201cany act or threat </em>involving murder, kidnaping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion or dealing in narcotic or other dangerous drugs, which is <em>chargeable </em>under State law\u201d and is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year (emphasis added). The \u201cracketeering activity\u201d acts under subpara-graph (B) include <em>\u201cany act which is indictable </em>under\u201d certain provisions of federal law including mail fraud and wire fraud, in addition to other typical organized crime activities (emphasis supplied). The predicate acts under section 1961(1)(C) are, as in subparagraph (B), \u201cindictable\u201d acts dealing with labor matters. Finally, the predicate acts under subparagraph (D) include \u201cany <em>offense </em>involving fraud\u201d in the securities or bankruptcy areas, or in the felonious dealing in narcotic or other dangerous drugs (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The difference between the \u201cchargeable under state law\u201d and \u201cindictable under federal law\u201d language can readily be explained by the fact that some matters even involving imprisonment for more than a year may be chargeable by information under state law, as in the State of Connecticut for example. The distinction between \u201cindictable\u201d acts under (B) and (C) or \u201cchargeable\u201d acts under (A), on the one hand, and \u201coffense[s]\u201d under subparagraph (D), on the other, is more troubling. An \u201coffense\u201d speaks to conviction. An indictable or chargeable act refers obviously to an earlier stage in the criminal process. All these terms, however, speak along criminal rather than civil lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">A person who is charged in a civil case with securities fraud (for example, by way of willful misrepresentations in a proxy statement), proof of which is by a preponderance of the evidence, can surely not be said to have committed \u201can offense,\u201d conviction of which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, with all of the traditional constitutional and other safeguards. Criminal violation of the securities laws occurs only with the requisite criminal scienter. Is one to be held liable under a lesser standard of proof in a private right of civil action and, not incidentally, thereby stigmatized as a \u201cracketeer\u201d? It is hard to believe that in adopting civil RICO Congress intended to permit proof of \u201cwillful\u201d violations by only a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Otherwise, two misstatements in a proxy solicitation could subject any director in any national corporation to \u201cracketeering\u201d charges and the threat of treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">As for the language \u201cany act which is indictable\u201d (or \u201cchargeable\u201d), conceivably Congress meant by the choice of these words to suggest either that indictments or, in the case of certain state felonies informations, are not required, since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>acts need only be \u201cindicta\u00f3Ze or \u201ccharge<em>able\u201d </em>(emphasis added). But a plausible alternative view of the words \u201cindictable\u201d and \u201cchargeable,\u201d found in RICO\u2019s definitional section, is that Congress did not intend to give civil courts power to determine whether an act is \u201cindictable\u201d in the absence of a properly returned indictment or \u201cchargeable\u201d absent an information. Courts do not traditionally look at a given set of facts\u2014proved by a preponderance of the evidence only\u2014and say that these facts make out acts which are \u201cindictable\u201d or \u201cchargeable.\u201d <em>See Kleiner v. First National Bank of Atlanta, </em>526 F.Supp. 1019, 1022 (N.D.Ga.1981), <em>overruled on other grounds sub nom. Morosani v. First National Bank of Atlanta, </em>703 F.2d 1220 (11th Cir.1983). In the case of indictments that is the purpose of grand juries. The Fifth Amendment provides that \u201cno person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury____\u201d Surely, being declared a \u201cracketeer\u201d or being held responsible for being one is being held to \u201canswer for\u201d an \u201cinfamous crime.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Whatever else one may think of grand juries or the processes by which they pursue their deliberations, they may stand as a bulwark between the individual and the government. Under the interpretation given RICO by those courts which do not require criminal convictions of the predicate acts before the bringing of a civil action, every private plaintiff becomes his own one-person grand jury, or in the case of state felonies chargeable by information, his own prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">2. <em>Intent. </em>But we need not rest the argument for this narrow interpretation of RICO on parsing of the words of the statute, since concededly they are ambiguous and could be construed to relate to underlying conduct. The structure of RICO as a whole leads one to the narrower interpretation requiring criminal convictions by a more direct route. The Act is designed to provide new penalties and remedies to combat conduct which explicitly has already been found criminal. Thus it has been noted by the very commentators who have most strenuously urged a broad reading of civil RICO that RICO did not itself \u201cdraw a line between criminal and innocent conduct,\u201d but rather \u201cauthorized the imposition of different criminal or civil remedies on conduct <em>already criminal, </em>when performed in a specified fashion.\u201d Blakey <em>&amp; </em>Gettings, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 1032 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In this sense RICO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>is significantly different from the antitrust laws, where it is possible to bring a civil action even in the absence of criminal conduct.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> RICO liability simply does not exist without criminal conduct,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> though of course, in a criminal RICO case, the proof of the predicate act convictions may be made under the same indictment, in the same trial and coordinately with the proof of the RICO offense(s). But in a civil context, there is no way to know whether the conduct in question is \u201calready criminal,\u201d a problem compounded by the fact that ordinarily there is a lower burden of proof in civil actions. We conclude that had Congress considered this problem, it would have explicitly required previously established convictions in the context of section 1964(c). Absent such explicit congressional direction, such a narrow reading of section 1964(c) best integrates that subsection into the entire structure of the Act. On the other hand, if the broad reading is accepted, problems are created of which there is no indication that Congress even dreamed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">Thus, <em>the charge that a section 1964 action is \"inherently criminal\" is true, </em>(emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">Note, <em>Organized Crime and the Infiltration of Legitimate Business: Civil Remedies for \u201cCriminal Activity,\" </em>124 U.Pa.L.Rev. 192, 208-09 (1975). <em>See also </em>Matz, <em>Determining the Standard of Proof in Lawsuits Brought Under RICO, </em>Nat\u2019l L.J., Oct. 10, 1983, at 21, col. 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Chief among these problems, as the foregoing argument suggests, is the proper burden of proof in proving predicate offenses in the absence of a criminal conviction. It is not surprising that courts which have allowed civil suits to go forward have wrestled with the proper burden of proof required to maintain the action. The problem, of course, relates to the burden to which a plaintiff must be put to prove that a defendant is a \u201cracketeer\u201d because he has committed two predicate acts. At least three different standards of proof are within the realm of plausibility: proof beyond a reasonable doubt,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> proof by clear and convincing evidence,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and proof by preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Courts in addition have indicated that probable cause must be alleged with reference to the predicate acts, although how this is meant to relate to the burden of the plaintiff at trial remains something of a mystery.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">Insofar as the RICO scheme calls for only criminal conduct to be punished, it thus appears that in the absence of previous convictions a civil plaintiff must carry a burden equal to that in a criminal case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>proving that criminal conduct. Yet it would be extraordinarily difficult for juries to understand the different burdens of proof required for different elements of a civil case. Moreover, if Congress had intended to impose such an unusual scheme, one would think that some suggestion of it would have occurred in the extensive legislative history. Instead, that history indicates that Congress assumed a preponderance standard was appropriate.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The most logical conclusion to be drawn is that Congress expected the criminality of the predicate acts to be proved before the private action went forward \u2014 that a criminal conviction must precede a private civil suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In addition to burden of proof problems, allowing private civil RICO claims to proceed without criminal convictions would make a hash of the very \u201cliberal construction\u201d provision said to require just such a result. It has been argued by the leading proponents of a broad reading of civil RICO that liberal construction is appropriate because RICO merely penalizes conduct already criminal; thus, it is said, requirements of strict construction have already been applied in construing the predicate criminal offenses.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Acknowledging that due process, of course, requires that criminal statutes be strictly construed, <em>e.g., Dunn v. United States, </em>442 U.S. 100, 112, 99 S.Ct. 2190, 2197, 60 L.Ed.2d 743 (1979), these proponents argue that since proof of criminal conduct could already be presumed in RICO suits, there would then be no need to <em>\u201cfurther </em>restrict the scope of the statute by reapplying these policies.\u201d Blakey &amp; Gettings, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 1032 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">In the civil context, absent predicate act convictions, the policy of strict construction simply cannot be implemented. As one commentator has suggested, \u201c[i]f the liberal construction clause is applicable to determine the scope of criminal liability under Title IX, the provision is therefore unconstitutional.\u201d Tarlow, <em>RICO Revisited, </em>17 Ga.L.Rev. 291, 309 (1983). How could the line be crossed into the sphere of criminality simply by bringing a civil action? It is this peculiar structure of RICO \u2022 that strongly suggests that, had Congress considered the problem, it would have intended criminal convictions of at least the predicate crimes as a prerequisite for a civil RICO action. RICO\u2019s statutorily mandated requirement of liberal construction cannot fairly be relied upon in interpreting section 1964(c) without undermining its very justification. Nor is this anomaly surprising given that private civil RICO was added to RICO in. the House as an afterthought, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>subsequent to the inclusion of the liberal construction clause in the Senate version of the bill. The statute, we repeat, is simply not a symmetrical whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In sum, after reviewing the words and structure of the enacted statute, its legislative history, and the prior case law interpreting the statute, we find it impossible to believe that in enacting RICO, Congress intended to sweep all ordinary injuries occasioned by the predicate criminal acts within the dragnet of the treble damage remedy provided by section 1964. To bring a private civil action, there must be a \u201cviolation,\u201d that is, criminal convictions on the underlying predicate offenses. Of course, a conviction under RICO itself will do, a fortiori. Moreover, plaintiffs must satisfy the standing requirement set out in this opinion and by the court below, a requirement that, as a practical matter, will not create an added barrier to a plaintiff\u2019s suit following upon criminal convictions under RICO, though it may present a problem in the case of convictions only of predicate acts, a problem which we need not here address.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Neither should the criminal conviction requirement create a significant additional barrier to a RICO plaintiff with proper standing to sue. Even without such a requirement, if a criminal prosecution is possible, it is unlikely that private RICO actions can progress very far, since defendants will block discovery by invoking the Fifth Amendment. <em>See </em>Bridges, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 53 n. 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">We therefore reject arguments based on the supposed \u201cplain meaning\u201d of a statute that, whatever its virtues and vices, is hardly a model of clarity. Being required, then, to look to the legislature\u2019s intent as demonstrated in the legislative history, we find nothing conclusive, but discern .in the legislative silence a purpose that is entirely at odds with the open-ended reading of the statute adopted by a number of the courts and promoted by certain commentators. The legislative history indicates that the private action provision is modeled upon the Clayton Act, and we hold that standing requirements analogous but not identical to those in the Clayton Act should be required in RICO. We also note that the civil RICO provisions differ in some significant ways from the Clayton Act provisions.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> In particular, the Clayton Act allows suits in the absence of criminal conduct, and therefore obviously in the absence of criminal convictions. Private civil RICO, on the other hand, is designed only to penalize conduct already determined to be criminal. In addition, the analysis of the RICO private treble damage provision must necessarily be differentiated from analysis of the injunc-tive provisions of RICO, both because of the differences between the government and a private party as a plaintiff, and because of the inherent differences between injunctive and punitive damages relief. Finally, we have tried to suggest that RICO\u2019s \u201cliberal construction\u201d clause actually requires that criminal convictions be obtained before civil suits under section 1964(c) commence.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">We need not rest the argument on the burdens to which the courts would otherwise be subjected, though other things being equal that might carry weight. We do strongly suggest, however, that if Congress had intended to permit defendants in every \u201cgarden-variety\u201d fraud or securities violation case to be stigmatized as \u201cracketeers,\u201d on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence, it would have said so in plainer language than it did. Before we impute to Congress the intention of federalizing a large portion of the common law which, since the time of the Constitution, has been left to the courts of the several states, and of providing treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for violations of these laws, or of altogether replacing or eliminating much of the need for extensive bodies of federal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>specifically directed at extensively considered evils, we will require more explicit language from Congress indicative of such intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-13\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-14\">(c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">(d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-9\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">\u00a7 1964.

The Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 was derived from S.30, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 115 Cong. Rec. 769 (1969). Title IX of the Act, RICO, was added to S.30 by the Senate. The substance of Title IX was contained in an earlier Senate bill, S.1861, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 115 Cong.Rec. 9568-71 (1969). Neither S.1861 nor S.30 contained a private civil cause of action. An earlier predecessor of RICO, S.1623, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 115 Cong.Rec. 6995-96 (1969), did contain a private civil cause of action based closely on the Clayton Act, providing explicitly for injunc-tive relief as well as for treble damages. S.1623 \u00a7\u00a7 3(c), 4(a). That bill was itself patterned on two earlier Senate bills, S.2048 and S.2049, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967), both of which contained civil private actions similar to that in S.1623. The Senate Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary replaced S.1623 with S.1861 apparently in part because S.1861 provided broader governmental civil relief, such as the investigative demand, and was in other ways a more comprehensive bill. <em>See Hearings on Measures Relating to Organized Crime Before the Subcomm. on Criminal Laws and Procedures of the Sen. Comm, on the Judiciary, </em>91st Cong., 1st Sess. 387 (1969) [hereinafter, \"Hearings on S.30\"]; Bradley, <em>supra </em>note 8, at 841-42 &amp; nn. 27-28. There is no discussion in the legislative history indicating why S.1861 did not provide a private cause of action. Professor Blakey, then Chief Counsel to the Senate Subcommittee, subsequently has written that the private civil section was dropped \"in an effort to streamline [the bill] and sidestep a variety of complex legal issues, as well as possible political problems in trying to process legislation that expressly created a variety of both public and private remedies.\" Blakey &amp; Gettings, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 1017-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">There were also a number of House predecessors to RICO which paralleled S.30. <em>See </em>H.R. 19215, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 116 Cong.Rec. 31914, H.R.19586, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 116 Cong.Rec. 35242 (1970). The private cause of action section eventually inserted by the House was taken from H.R.19586. H.R.19215 included a much more complete private cause of action section, explicitly allowing for private party in-junctive relief. <em>See </em>Blakey &amp; Gettings, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">While one may or may not agree with Blakey &amp; Gettings that it is \"unfortunate\u201d that H.R. 19215 was not used, <em>id., </em>it is significant that it was not. The more general H.R.19586 was obviously less controversial, less likely to promote debate and hence more likely to result in passage of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">All of the amendments made by the House to S.30 limited its scope, with the exception of the inclusion of a private remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b551-5\">. Failure to recognize this crucial point has led a number of courts and commentators astray. For example, the original Eighth Circuit panel in <em>Bennett v. Berg, </em>685 F.2d 1053, 1058 (8th Cir.1982), <em>aff\u2019d en banc, </em>710 F.2d 1361, <em>cert, denied sub nom. Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Bennett, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 527, 78 L.Ed.2d 710 (1983), states that \"section 1964(c) provides a private cause of action modelled on the antitrust laws\u201d and then for its first citation to this effect refers to S.Rep. No. 617, 80-82, 125, 160 (1969). Yet every statement made in that Senate Report relates exclusively to civil remedies <em>not </em>including a private civil right of action, but only concerning the government\u2019s right to seek an injunction or forfeiture under the provisions of section 1963(a). This is not to say, of course, that the House insertion of the private treble damage action was not based on an analog to the antitrust laws, for it is obviously somewhat patterned in part after section 4(a) of the Clayton Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a) (1982). Indeed, the testimony of Edward L. Wright, then ABA president, in the House hearings on S.30, the absolutely critical testimony leading to the inclusion of section 1964(c) in the House version of the bill, says only:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In the portion seeking to add a proposed Section 1964, \u201cCivil Remedies,\u201d we would recommend an amendment to include the additional civil remedy of authorizing private damage suits based upon the concept of Section 4 of the Clayton Act. Section 4 provides as follows: [quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 4].</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">House Hearings, <em>supra </em>note 9, at 543-44.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b551-10\">. House Hearings, <em>supra </em>note 9, at 520 (Proposal of Rep. Steiger), 548 (Proposal of the American Bar Association). Both proposals were patterned on the private remedy found in the Clayton Act. Significantly Steiger\u2019s proposal, like those in the rejected Senate bills, provided explicitly for a private injunctive remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 521. The legislative history is silent as to why the subcommittee rejected this language and explicitly created only the private action for treble damages which was eventually enacted as \u00a7 1964(c). The adopted statutory language was drawn from H.R.19586, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 56 (1970), one of the two House bills which paralleled S.30. In choosing H.R.19586 over H.R. 19215, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), the House explicitly rejected a private injunctive relief section. <em>See supra </em>note 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">Later, on the House floor, an amendment also offered by Representative Steiger to provide private injunctive relief was withdrawn before the House could vote on it. 116 Cong.Rec. 35346 (1969). In the next term of the Senate the same amendment was proposed as a bill, S.16, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. (1971), as a way to \"expand the available civil remedies\" since \"[n]ow only the United States can institute injunctive proceedings.\u201d <em>See Victims of Crime, Hearing before the Subcom. on Criminal Laws and Procedures of the Senate Com. of the Judiciary, </em>92nd Cong., 1st Sess. 158 (1972) (Statement of Richard Velde, Associate Administrator, Law Enforcement Assistance Administration) [hereinafter \"Victims of Crime\u201d]. While post-enactment legislative history is not by any means conclusive, it cannot merely be ignored. <em>North Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, </em>456 U.S. 512, 530-35, 102 S.Ct. 1912, 1922-26, 72 L.Ed.2d 299 (1982). It thus seems altogether likely that \u00a7 1964(c) as it now stands was not intended to provide private parties injunctive relief. <em>But see Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co. v. Liebowitz, </em>570 F.Supp. 908, 909-10 (E.D.N.Y.1983) (injunctive relief granted), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>730 F.2d 905, 909 (2d Cir. 1984). Two other courts of appeals have reserved judgment on this issue. <em>Dan River, Inc. v. Icahn, </em>701 F.2d 278, 290 (4th Cir.1983); <em>Bennett v. Berg, </em>685 F.2d at 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-16\">Professor Blakey also disagrees with this conclusion, making a rather remarkable argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>based upon the use of the word \"and\u201d in \u00a7 1964(c), as follows. He states:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">A Congressional grant of the right to sue in the absence of statutory limitations, conveys the availability of all necessary and appropriate relief. <em>See, e.g., Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., </em>396 U.S. 229, 239, 90 S.Ct. 400, 405, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969); <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 684, 66 S.Ct. 773, <em>111, </em>90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). Significantly, the treble damage clause of \u00a7 1964(c) is preceded by \u201cand\u201d and not \u201cto.\u201d <em>See National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. National Ass\u2019n of R.R.

Consequently, the availability of comprehensive civil relief should prove of particular significance, for example, in the area of government fraud at the state and local level.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Blakey &amp; Gettings, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 1038 n. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Y\">We do not find it significant that the word \"and\u201d is used in \u00a7 1964(c), especially since its treble damage antitrust analog, \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a) (1982), uses the same word, \"and,\" while a different specific statutory provision of that act expressly gives a private antitrust plaintiff the right to seek an injunction (except when a common carrier is a defendant). Clayton Act \u00a7 16, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26 (1982). We endorse Judge Shadur's comment that an argument based on the word \"and\u201d is \u201cbizarre and wholly unconvincing as a matter of plain English.\u201d <em>Kaushal v. State Bank of India, </em>556 F.Supp. 576, 582 &amp; n. 17 (N.D.Ill.1983). Indeed, the Supreme Court has explicitly held that the parallel language of \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act <em>precluded </em>private injunctive relief. <em>Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, </em>244 U.S. 459, 37 S.Ct. 718, 61 L.Ed. 1256 (1917); <em>Minnesota v. Northern Secs.

One Judiciary Committee member indicated on the floor that three changes had been made from the Senate bill \"merit[ing] discussion,\u201d but did not include the addition of the private cause of action among these three. 116 Cong.Rec. 35197-98 (1970) (remarks of Congressman McCulloch).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b552-12\">. 116 Cong.Rec. 35295 (1970) (remarks of Congressman Poff).

Representative (now Judge) Mikva offered an amendment providing for treble damages for defendants who became subjects of frivolous suits under the section. <em>See </em>116 Cong.Rec. 35342-43 (1970). The evident purpose of this amendment, which was quickly defeated, <em>id., </em>was to point out the dangerous overbreadth of the section, which Mikva claimed was a \"dangerous tool ... given to a competitor who wants to go after somebody who is competing too vigorously against him.\" <em>Id. </em>at 35342. We decline to infer from Representative Mikva\u2019s comments the conclusion that Congress intended to promulgate a statute as broad as the one he feared it was passing.

It can be argued that a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d is defined merely in terms of predicate offenses and nothing more, \u00a7 1961(1), (5), so the fact that racketeering activity must be proved under \u00a7 1964(c) does not in itself require that something other than the predicate offenses be proved.

Thus, in an interesting paper in the post-legislative history, the American Law Division of the Library of Congress, after reviewing the purposes of RICO and of the antitrust laws, concluded that \"[g]iven the similarity of language and circumstances between the antitrust provisions and those of the Organized Crime Control Act, there is no reason to believe that many of these [antitrust] principles and problems would [not] be applicable to both [antitrust and RICO] types of cases.\u201d <em>Reprinted in </em>Victims of Crime, <em>supra </em>note 20, at 331. <em>See Landmark Savs. &amp; Loan, </em>527 F.Supp. at 208-09 (\"Competitive injuries and racketeering enterprise injuries would frequently overlap, but they are not necessarily the same.\u201d). <em>See also </em>Bridges, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 68-73 &amp; nn. 133-34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b558-5\">. For example, recent antitrust cases which focus on market efficiency rather than on damage to business people, <em>see, e.g., Continental T. V, Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., </em>433 U.S. 36, 53 n. 21, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 2559 n. 21, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977), are not relevant to the requirements of RICO standing. Nothing in RICO suggests, then, that only competitors can sue, or that Congress in enacting RICO was more concerned with economic efficiency than with providing remedies for victims of organized crime. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Civil RICO, supra </em>note 35, at 1113-14 (\"RICO's explicit aim to promote free competition focuses as much on insuring a fair market as on insuring an efficient one. Thus, the state should protect the plaintiff injured competitively by a corrupt business even at a cost to market efficiency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Similarly, claims alleging the kinds of business fraud which often affect competition should go forward under RICO even if in the particular case no harm to competition results, as, for example, when all competitors are being extorted from equally. For example, in <em>Hellenic Lines, Ltd. v. O\u2019Hearn, </em>523 F.Supp. 244 (S.D.N.Y. 1981), a company was forced to pay kickbacks to an illegal enterprise for required services. A RICO claim was allowed even though defendant claimed that the inflated price was still reasonable so that no injury to competition had occurred. It was enough that the plaintiff's alleged injury was the <em>kind </em>of injury which Congress identified as threatening competition. The fact that the suit may not have been viable under the Clayton Act shows that the two standing requirements overlap but are not identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">We do not in this business fraud case attempt to define the scope of the standing requirement when the RICO suit is based upon securities law violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\">. <em>See, e.g., Glusband v.

It would be a strained construction to say that any person by virtue of \u00a7 1964(c), which gives such a person only a right to damages, would also have a right to sue for permanent injunctive relief under subsection (a). <em>See supra </em>text at note 24. The differences between the private remedy sections in the Clayton Act and in RICO are particularly significant here. There are specific Clayton Act provisions giving the government and individuals the right to bring actions for injunctive relief, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 25-26 (government, private persons), something which is not set forth in RICO \u00a7 1964 or evidently recognized by the <em>Cappetto </em>court when it speaks of the Clayton Act's \u00a7 4. 502 F.2d at 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Moreover, section 1964(a) speaks of \"jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of section 1962,\u201d on its face allowing injunctions <em>before </em>the violations have occurred or criminal prosecution commenced.

We are fully aware that the \"by reason of a violation\" language can be found in the earlier Senate and House bills which did contain private civil remedies.

(1970). <em>See supra </em>note 18 for a discussion of these bills. Nevertheless, the question remains why the House chose this language over the language of the Clayton Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b562-5\">. The American Bar Association has recommended that the RICO statute be amended to replace the term \"racketeering activity\u201d with the phrase \u201ccriminal activity\u201d as a way to resolve this problem. Report to the House of Delegates, 1982 ABA Sec.Crim.Just.Rep. 3-4 (Jan. 1982). <em>Cf. United States v. Guiliano, </em>644 F.2d 85, 89 (2d Cir.1981) (prejudicial taint inevitably surrounds label of \"racketeer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">As we have indicated in <em>supra </em>note 24, there are potential constitutional problems created by the bro\u00e1d reading of RICO endorsed by many courts. At some point defendants are entitled to the constitutional protections of the criminal law regardless of how the government chooses to characterize a given cause of action. <em>See Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 634-35, 6 S.Ct. 524, 534, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886). Relevant factors in characterizing an action as \"criminal\u201d are the nature of the underlying offense, the stigma attached to the charge made, <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 23-25, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1441-1442, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), the nature of the punishment authorized by the statute, <em>Trop v. Dulles, </em>356 U.S. 86, 94-95, 78 S.Ct. 590, 594-595, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958), the intent of Congress in promulg\u00e1ting the statute, <em>id., </em>and whether the government or a private party is bringing the action. <em>See generally </em>Note, <em>infra </em>note 59, at 210-12. Reading private civil RICO suits not to require criminal convictions would provide civil remedies for offenses criminal in nature, stigmatize defendants with the appellation \"racketeer,\" authorize the award of damages which are clearly punitive, including attorney\u2019s fees, and constitute a civil remedy aimed in part to avoid the constitutional protections of the criminal law. Thus, the construction advanced in this opinion avoids serious constitutional questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b562-10\">. This structure is, of course, altered to some extent by the provision which allows the government to seek injunctive relief in the absence of criminal convictions. As we have indicated, however, injunctive relief to <em>prevent </em>violations is simply a very different kind of remedy than a treble damages action and is accordingly subject to a unique regimen.

We note in the post-legislative history that this conclusion was rejected by the American Law Division of the Library of Congress in its comparative study of RICO and the Clayton Act, <em>see </em>Victims of Crime, <em>supra </em>note 20, at 323, 329, on the basis that \"violation\" is used elsewhere in the antitrust laws, e.g., in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4, 25, 26. But two of the provisions cited in that study have their own parallels in RICO: 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 25 are equivalents of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(a) giving district courts jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations at the behest of the government. And the other Clayton Act provision cited, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26, which has no parallel in RICO, gives similar jurisdiction at the behest of private parties, a matter- which the American Law Division study sought explicitly to remedy as to RICO. Thus, the American Law Division statement does not meet the argument based on the difference in language between the treble damage private action provisions which are otherwise parallel, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b561-14\">.

In so doing, the panel majority takes this Circuit far from the shores of principled and disciplined reasoning, and leads it unnecessarily into a sea of uncertainty. In the panel\u2019s view, Congress would have intended \u2014 had it thought about the implications of \u00a7 1964 \u2014that prior convictions be required. Not only does the majority turn the ordinary rules of statutory construction on their head by ignoring the plain meaning of the statutory language, but it also ignores the sound policy reasons for permitting civil RICO cases to proceed absent prior convictions for the predicate acts. In my view, the civil RICO provisions mean just what they say. Because these and other considerations have convinced me that the majority has crossed the line and trespassed in an area exclusively reserved to Congress, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">I. <em>Prior Criminal Conviction Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Looking at the reasoning that creates a \u201cprior predicate act criminal conviction\u201d requirement one is struck that it \u2014 in Alice\u2019s words \u2014 gets \u201ccuriouser and curiouser.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No support for this proposition is found in the statute or its legislative history. Almost none of the decisions or the commentators argue for such drastic redrafting of the statute. In fact, they support the opposite conclusion, <em>i.e. </em>that no prior conviction is necessary to bring a civil claim under RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Along the way to reaching its novel conclusion, the panel misconstrues Congress\u2019 reasons for the enactment of this statute and makes a number of faulty assumptions. The panel majority\u2019s position seems bottomed on: (1) disapproval of cases that have taken a contrary view; (2) a view that Congress did not give civil courts power to decide when acts are \u201cindictable\u201d or \u201cchargeable\u201d; (3) a view that \u00a7 1964 would constitute an unconstitutional \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d statute were a prior criminal conviction for the predicate acts not required; (4) a fear that defendants will be \u201cstigmatizes\u201d by a civil \u201cconviction\u201d for racketeering activity; and (5) analysis based on the word \u201cviolation\u201d contained in \u00a7 1964. I propose to deal with each of these premises <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">(1) <em>Disapproval of Contrary Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">The majority begins by analyzing those decisions that have refused to adopt a prior criminal conviction requirement, and disapproves of them because they supposedly are not well-reasoned. For example, <em>United States v. Cappetto, </em>502 F.2d 1351 (7th Cir.1974), <em>cert, denied, </em>420 U.S. 925, 95 S.Ct. 1121, 43 L.Ed.2d 395 (1975) is dismissed almost without comment because <em>\u201cCappetto </em>made no holding with respect to private civil actions.\u201d Others are discarded because they merely cite to <em>Cappetto. US ACO Coal Co. v. Carbomin Energy, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 94, 95 n. 1 (6th Cir.1982), which rejected a prior conviction requirement, and reasoned that Congress would have defined the \u00a7 1964 \u201cviolation\u201d differently had it desired such a requirement, is labelled \u201cmisguided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">This panel\u2019s evaluation of <em>Cappetto </em>puts it at odds with other panels of this Circuit that have cited that decision with apparent approval in other respects. <em>See United States v. Huber, </em>603 F.2d 387, 393 (2d Cir.1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>445 U.S. 927, 100 S.Ct. 1312, 63 L.Ed.2d 759 (1980); <em>United States v. Altese, </em>542 F.2d 104, 107 (2d Cir.1976), <em>cert, denied, </em>429 U.S. 1039, 97 S.Ct. 736, 50 L.Ed.2d 750 (1977). <em>Cappetto </em>involved a government prosecuted civil RICO claim. Ordinarily more, not less, protection is expected for a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>when the government is plaintiff. When the plaintiff is a private party, as here, the quick dismissal of <em>Cappetto </em>totally ignores the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d rationale built into RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Discarding the numerous decisions of other courts that have not raised the bar of a prior conviction requirement will not make them go away. Virtually every court that has directly addressed the issue has decided no prior conviction is required. <em>E.g., State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Estate of Caton, </em>540 F.Supp. 673 (N.D.Ind. 1982) (holding no prior conviction is required based on statutory interpretation); <em>Farmers Bank of State of Del. v. Bell Mtg. Corp., </em>452 F.Supp. 1278, 1280 (D.Del.1978) (\u00a7 1964(c) \u201cdoes not condition that cause of action in any way upon a criminal previous under the criminal provisions of the statute\u201d). <em>See Bunker Ramo Corp. v. United Business Forms, Inc., </em>713 F.2d 1272, 1287 (7th Cir.1983) (Civil RICO action available \u201cwithout any requirement of a prior criminal conviction for that conduct,\u201d citing <em>USACO, supra). Morosani v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Atlanta, </em>703 F.2d 1220 (11th Cir. 1983) (overruling <em>Kleiner v. First Bank National Bank, </em>526 F.Supp. 1019 (N.D.Ga. 1981) without discussing prior criminal conviction dictum in <em>Kleiner)-, Pames v. Heinold Commodities, Inc., </em>487 F.Supp. 645, 647 (N.D.Ill.1980); (private RICO action need not be preceeded by criminal conviction). The majority\u2019s dismissal of these holdings as uninformed or as simply \u201cfollowing <em>Cappetto </em>\u201d ignores the obviously simple explanation for their resounding rejection of any prior conviction requirement \u2014 it does not appear in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">(2) <em>\u201cIndictable\u201d or \u201cChargeable\u201d Acts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Congress, the majority further tells us, did not intend to give civil courts power to determine whether an act is \u2018indictable\u2019 absent a properly returned indictment or \u2018chargeable\u2019 absent an information.\u201d How can this view be correct? To begin, the words themselves connote the contrary\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>Congress did not use the phrase \u201cfor which an indictment or information has been <em>returned </em>or <em>filed </em>\u201d; much less did it say \u201cfor which the defendant has been criminally <em>convicted.\u201d </em>More significantly, Congress clearly used the terms \u201cindictable\u201d or \u201cchargeable\u201d in reference to \u201cacts\u201d forming a pattern of racketeering activity under \u00a7 1961, to which sanctions specifically labelled as \u201ccivil remedies\u201d were then directed. To stretch this language into a requirement that a prior <em>conviction </em>must be obtained strains credulity. Had that been Congress' aim, \u00a7 1964\u2019s title would have been \u201cPost Criminal Conviction Civil Remedies,\u201d not \u201cCivil Remedies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Further, the statute as Congress enacted it does not require civil courts to determine that the RICO predicate acts are in fact criminal acts. All that need be determined is that they are acts which, if proved by the government in a criminal proceeding, would subject the violator to criminal sanctions. The use of criminal and civil sanctions for the same conduct is common. Congress has frequently enacted legislation giving private litigants civil remedies for acts which may also be punished criminally. In addition to the antitrust example, Congress has provided for multiple damages, statutory punitive damages, civil penalties and counsel fees in scores of statutes, including <em>inter alia, </em>the patent (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 281) and trademark laws (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117), the Truth in Lending Act (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640), the water pollution control statute (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321), the false claims statute (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729), the wiretap statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520), and the tax laws (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6653(b)). In some of these areas, Congress has gone further and accorded to the <em>government </em>a civil remedy for acts that are also punishable under federal criminal law. <em>Helvering v. Mitchell, </em>303 U.S. 391, 58 S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917 (1938) (after an acquittal for criminal tax fraud, the government obtained a 50 per centum penalty in a civil proceeding against the taxpayer and the court held this a civil, not criminal, sanction); <em>see One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 232, 237, 93 S.Ct. 489, 493, 34 L.Ed.2d 438 (1972) <em>(per curiam) </em>(forfeiture proceeding, civil in nature, not barred under Double Jeopardy Clause after de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>fendant\u2019s acquittal on criminal charges). Rather than asking what kind of sanctions, <em>i.e., </em>criminal or civil, are imposed against a defendant, the majority mistakenly focuses on the nature of the proceeding taken under \u00a7 1964. Here the sanction is treble damages. Treble damages have been part of our jurisprudence for centuries \u2014 since first appearing as a remedy for waste in the Statute of Gloucester (1278) \u2014 and they have never been viewed as \u201ccriminal\u201d sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">(3) <em>Constitutionality of \u00a7 1964 Absent Criminal Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4j\">As just noted, the majority analyzes a proceeding under \u00a7 1964 and implicitly finds it \u201cquasi-criminal.\u201d It then seems to conclude that such finding necessitates holding the section unconstitutional were a prior criminal conviction not to be required. If true, this implicit conclusion is at odds with analogous case law in such areas as civil forfeitures, penalties and deportation cases which teaches that the correct procedure is for a court in a civil case to assure, on a selective basis, the existence of certain procedural safeguards, that would otherwise be applicable only in criminal cases. That is, only those criminal procedural remedies necessary to protect a defendant are required in the civil action. <em>See, e.g., Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886); <em>Lopez-Mendoza v. I.N.S., </em>705 F.2d 1059 (9th Cir.1983) <em>(en banc) </em>(applicability of Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule in civil deportation proceeding), <em>cert, granted, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 697, 79 L.Ed.2d 163 (U.S.1984). <em>Bramble v. Richardson, </em>498 F.2d 968, 973 (10th Cir.) (rejecting claim that <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a forfeiture proceeding), <em>cert, denied, </em>419 U.S. 1069, 95 S.Ct. 656, 42 L.Ed.2d 665 (1974); <em>accord, United States v. Regan, </em>232 U.S. 37, 34 S.Ct. 213, 58 L.Ed. 494 (1914) (standard of proof in action for penalty for violation of Alien Immigration Act is preponderance of the evidence). <em>Cf. In re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 552, 88 S.Ct. 1222, 1226, 20 L.Ed.2d 117 (1968) (absence of fair notice of charges deprived petitioner of due process in disbarment proceeding). Close to 90 years ago the Supreme Court rejected the view that a civil forfeiture proceeding of the type involved in <em>Boyd v. United States, supra, </em>is a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d in which the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation is implicated. <em>United States v. Zucker, </em>161 U.S. 475, 482, 16 S.Ct. 641, 643, 40 L.Ed. 777 (1896). Despite this teaching, the panel holds in effect that \u00a7 1964 is \u201ccriminal\u201d for <em>all </em>purposes by requiring a prior criminal conviction before a civil RICO plaintiff can sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Thus, even accepting <em>arguendo </em>the view that \u00a7 1964 cannot be constitutionally applied in the absence of unspecified safeguards, the proper course is not to require a prior criminal conviction, but to insist on application of those safeguards <em>{e.g., </em>the exclusionary rule, a heightened standard of proof or other criminal protections) within the context of a civil proceeding. The majority\u2019s response that imposing criminal safeguards in a civil case would confuse juries is not borne out in practice. Juries already apply heightened standards of proof to specific issues, in fraud, defamation, paternity and other types of civil actions. <em>See McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7\u00a7 339-40 (2d ed. 1972) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has outlined the proper method of analysis for challenges to statutory civil remedies on the ground they are \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d or sufficiently \u201cpunitive\u201d to require the procedural protections of a criminal trial. In <em>United States v. Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 65 L.Ed.2d 742 (1980), the Court analyzed a challenge to section 311(b)(6) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) which permitted the government to assess a civil penalty of up to $5000 for each violation of the FWPCA. To decide whether a statute is \u201ccivil\u201d or \u201ccriminal\u201d involves a two-step test: first, courts must examine whether Congress indicated a preference for one label or the other; second, where Congress has signalled a preference for a civil penalty, there must be further inquiry to determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>statutory scheme is \u201cso punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate that intention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248-249, 100 S.Ct. at 2641. The Court concluded after considering the seven factors set forth in <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 554, 567-568, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963), that the penalty in <em>Ward </em>was analagous to traditional civil damages and held it not sufficiently punitive to require Fifth Amendment criminal safeguards. <em>United States v. Ward, supra, </em>448 U.S. at 251,100 S.Ct. at 2642. Justice Blackmun\u2019s concurrence emphasized \u201cthat monetary assessments are traditionally a form of civil remedy\u201d and found it significant that the FWPCA \u00a7 311(b)(6), like 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964, does not provide for \u201can affirmative disability or restraint\u201d (such as imprisonment, deportation or disbarment). <em>Id. </em>at 257, 100 S.Ct. at 2645 (Blackmun, J.) (concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">More recently, in <em>United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 1099, 79 L.Ed.2d 361 (U.S.1984), the Supreme Court held that neither the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy clause nor collateral estoppel bars a forfeiture proceeding where the defendant in the pri- or criminal proceeding was acquitted. A unanimous Court applying the two-level <em>Ward </em>test indicated that even \u201cdiscouraging unregulated commerce in firearms\u201d and \u201cremoving [them] from circulation\u201d are remedial, not punitive, purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 1106-1107. The Court stressed that \u201cCongress may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission,\u201d <em>(citing Helvering v. Mitchell, </em>supra) and held forfeiture to be a \u201cseparate civil sanction, remedial in nature.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Applying the <em>Ward </em>test to \u00a7 1964 demonstrates that it is not a \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d statute even for purposes of Fifth Amendment guarantees, much less all criminal protections. The remedial purpose expressed in the statute is evident from its legislative history. Congress specifically provided that RICO \u201cshall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.\u201d Pub.L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 941 (1970) \u00a7 904(a). Section 1964 is designed to <em>compensate </em>private parties who are victims of tortious activity. <em>See United States v. Bornstein, </em>423 U.S. 303, 314, 96 S.Ct. 523, 530, 46 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975) (double damages under False Claims Act designed to ensure government is made completely whole); <em>United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, </em>317 U.S. 537, 549, 63 S.Ct. 379, 386, 87 L.Ed. 443 (1943) (holding that double damages under False Claims Act are compensatory even if recovered by federal government). Its treble damage provision is therefore primarily remedial, and only partly punitive. The recovery in excess of actual damages constitutes statutory punitive damages designed in part to punish the defendant for tortious conduct, but traditionally allowable in civil proceedings without special criminal law safeguards. <em>See Missouri Pacific By. Co. v. Humes, </em>115 U.S. 512, 6 S.Ct. 110, 29 L.Ed. 463 (1885) (multiple damages partly compensatory, partly punitive). Thus, \u00a7 1964 is \u201cprimarily remedial\u201d under the Supreme Court\u2019s tests in <em>Helvering </em>and <em>Ward </em>because its principal purposes are to compensate victims of racketeering activity and to encourage them to vindicate their rights. In serving as private attorneys general, civil RICO plaintiffs aid in the eradication of such activity. In short, Congress\u2019 \u201ccivil\u201d and \u201cremedial\u201d labels should not therefore be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The majority apparently faced the dilemma of either upholding this statute as written or declaring it unconstitutional as punitive and hence quasi-criminal in nature. It chose neither of these straightforward alternatives. It specifically rejected the former. And, since a statute as written may be held unconstitutional only if the challenger presents \u201cthe clearest proof\u201d of it, <em>United States v. Ward, supra, </em>448 U.S. at 249, 100 S.Ct. at 2641 (quoting <em>Flemming v. Nestor, </em>363 U.S. 603, 617, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1376, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (I960)), and because such proof is absent here, it could not choose the latter. Instead, to resolve the problem, the majority inserts the prior criminal conviction requirement to avoid perceived \u201cserious constitutional questions.\u201d The premise is flawed because this course of \u201cavoidance\u201d has actually created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>a constitutional question of even greater significance. Addition of this new requirement to civil RICO \u2014 one which Congress did not vote on and which the President did not endorse \u2014 has raised a question as to whether such judicial creativity is an unwarranted and unconstitutional intrusion into the legislative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">(4) <em>Stigma</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The panel opinion stresses a fear that defendants will be \u201cstigmatized\u201d by their \u201cindictment\u201d at the hands of a \u201cone-man grand jury\u201d for racketeering activity. Yet, stigma alone ordinarily does not suffice to convert a proceeding from civil to criminal. <em>See Ullmann v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 422, 76 S.Ct. 497, 100 L.Ed. 511 (1956) (contempt conviction for refusing to testify before grand jury upheld following grant of immunity over claim defendant would be stigmatized by revealing past connection with the Communist party). One commentator observed that the holding of <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428,18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), relied on by the majority, has been largely limited to sanctions threatening loss of liberty, and that stigma alone does not trigger the need for criminal safeguards. Note, <em>Organized Crime and The Infiltration of Legitimate Business: Civil Remedies for \u201cCriminal Activity,\u201d </em>124 U.Pa.L.Rev. 192, 214-15 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Further, the majority\u2019s sensitivity to the stigma that may attach to decent citizens named as defendants in civil RICO cases seems a bit overstated. Today, defendants in civil suits are labelled as violators of environmental laws when pumping coal byproducts into the atmosphere, despoilers of our rivers when emptying oil from their tanker\u2019s bilges, adulterers in state divorce actions, and killers in vehicular wrongful death actions. The allegations of the civil complaint do not make these citizens criminals, although their conduct may well subject them to separate criminal prosecutions. Why the outcry over RICO? I, for one, believe the public is sophisticated enough to distinguish between a criminal conviction and a civil claim. To be named as a RICO defendant is not quite the Sword of Damocles that the majority would have it. Repeated often enough, it will either lose its effect as a settlement weapon or create enough public pressure to cause Congress to amend the statute. Again, it is not for this Court to alter the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">(5) <em>Use of Word </em>\u201cViolation\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">The opinion also places heavy reliance on Congress\u2019 use of the term \u201cviolation,\u201d and finds this word supports its thesis for a prior criminal conviction. In <em>Ward, </em>the statute also specifically referred to \u201cviolations\u201d of the FWPCA. That Court notably attached no special significance to this term, presumably because the word \u201cviolation\u201d is commonly used to designate civil wrongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">Finally, the effect of this ruling will leave victims of those defendants whose activities were at the heart of Congress\u2019 concern without the remedy Congress envisioned. Regardless of whether a defendant is a member of an organized crime family and no matter how lawless his pattern of racketeering activity may be, if he escapes conviction \u2014 through acquittal, a beneficial plea, or a decision not to prosecute \u2014 then the remedy granted the victim of these activities is lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">II. <em>Racketeering Injury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">Concern that the RICO civil remedy will permit recovery of treble damages and attorneys' fees in every \u201cgarden variety\u201d civil fraud case leads the majority to impose an additional standing requirement. Limiting RICO\u2019s broad reach by requiring, for example, an \u201corganized crime\u201d connection was rejected by Congress and by this court, <em>see Moss v. Morgan Stanley, supra, </em>719 F.2d at 21 n. 17. Similarly, a \u201ccompetitive injury\u201d requirement has been rejected in the Seventh and Eighth Circuits. <em>Schacht v. Brown, </em>711 F.2d 1343, 1359 (7th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 104 S.Ct. 508, 509, 78 L.Ed.2d 698 (1983). <em>Bennett v. Berg, </em>685 F.2d 1053, 1058 (8th Cir. 1982), <em>affd in part on rehearing en banc, </em>710 F.2d 1361 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 527, 78 L.Ed.2d 710 (1983). The Supreme Court has specifically rejected an approach that would require an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>allegation that the enterprise be \u201cillegitimate.\u201d <em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 586-87, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2530, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AdxX\">What remains is the theory adopted by some courts and that, together with the prior conviction requirement, the majority embraces bere. That is, there must be an allegation of an injury from the \u201cracketeering enterprise,\u201d a so-called \u201cracketeering injury.\u201d Such has also been described as an injury \u201cby reason of conduct the RICO act was designed to prevent,\u201d and as \u201csomething more than\u201d the injury caused by the predicate acts alone. How one can distinguish between the injury caused by the predicate acts and the injury done by the enterprise is not explained. My colleagues state that \u201conly when injury caused by this <em>kind of harm </em>can be shown\u201d (emphasis added) does a plaintiff have standing under \u00a7 1964. \u201cThis kind of harm,\u201d in turn, occurs when \u201cmobsters, either through the infiltration of legitimate enterprises or through the activities of illegitimate enterprises, cause systemic harm to competition and the market, and thereby injure investors and competitors.\u201d This formulation is no more than a euphemism for an \u201corganized crime\u201d nexus requirement that should not be adopted by this Court after its rejection by the lawmakers. Other courts, the statute\u2019s congressional sponsors and commentators do not assign to. civil RICO a scope on such a lilliputian scale.</p>\n<p id=\"AUa\">In <em>Schacht v. Brown, supra, </em>the Seventh Circuit evaluated a similar standing requirement and stated that one trouble with \u201cjudicial pruning of RICO\u2019s civil provisions ... where business fraud is alleged [is that] ... there is simply no legitimate principled criterion\u201d that accomplishes the distinction between ordinary \u201cgarden variety\u201d fraud and fraud by an organized crime syndicate. <em>Schacht, </em>711 F.2d at 1356. The <em>Schacht </em>court concluded that since the organized crime limitation on civil RICO had been rejected, it did not want it \u201crevived under the guise of determining the kinds of activity covered by RICO.\u201d <em>Id. See Ral-ston v. Capper, </em>569 F.Supp. 1575, 1580 (E.D.Mich.1983) (racketeering enterprise injury \u201cundefined\u201d). <em>Accord, </em>Note, <em>Civil RICO and \u201cGarden Variety\u201d Fraud </em>\u2014 A <em>Suggested Analysis, </em>58 St. John\u2019s L.Rev. 93, 107-08 (1983). <em>See also Bennett v. Berg, supra, </em>685 F.2d at 1059 (rejecting \u201cracketeering injury\u201d requirement which is just another way of arguing that no \u201centerprise\u201d existed). <em>Hokama v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., </em>566 F.Supp. 636, 643 (C.D.Cal.1983) (racketeering enterprise injury \u201clittle more than indirect statements\u201d of requirement of \u201ca \u2018nexus to organized crime\u2019 \u201d). <em>Eisen-berg v. Gagnon, </em>564 F.Supp. 1347, 1353 (E.D.Pa.1983) (cases do not make clear \u201cwhat that \u2018something more\u2019 would be\u201d); <em>Windsor Associates, Inc. v. Greenfield, </em>564 F.Supp. 273, 279 (D.Md.1983) (racketeering enterprise injury \u201canalytically indistinguishable\u201d from organized crime requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"aqh-dedup-0\">Again, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 477, 97 S.Ct. 690, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977), is misplaced for two reasons. First, Congress, at the suggestion of the ABA Antitrust section, indicated an intent <em>not </em>to incorporate technical antitrust standing and proximate cause notions into \u00a7 1964. <em>See </em>115 Cong.Rec. at 6995 (1969) (discussing private civil actions). Second, in <em>Brunswick, </em>the Court found no clear expression of Congressional purpose to allow suits for \u201closses which are of no concern to the antitrust laws.\u201d <em>Brunswick, </em>429 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>at 487, 97 S.Ct. at 696. Fraud, however, was one of Congress\u2019 specifically targeted activities in enacting RICO, and plaintiff has alleged injury from fraudulent conduct. Whatever <em>Brunswick\u2019s </em>contours may be, its holding.has no application where injury from two acts of mail or wire fraud is alleged, since such injury <em>is </em>of the type RICO was \u201cintended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 489, 97 S.Ct. at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">To cast a net sufficiently wide to catch organized criminals, Congress took the calculated risk that others, whose activities are chargeable as crimes under other federal or state laws, would also be netted. Courts should not \u201ccreat[e] standing requirements that would preclude liability in many situations in which legislative intent would compel it.\u201d Note, <em>Civil RICO: The Temptation and Impropriety of Judicial Restriction, </em>95 Harv.L.Rev. 1101, 1120-21 (1982). <em>See Moss v. Morgan Stanley, Inc., supra, </em>719 F.2d at 21. As with the majority\u2019s prior conviction requirement, the danger is that the racketeering injury standing requirement might well exclude plaintiffs in other cases where defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cwould be near the heart of Congress\u2019 concern.\u201d <em>Mauriber v. Shearson/American Exp., Inc., </em>567 F.Supp. 1231, 1240 (S.D.N. Y.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Finally, despite the majority\u2019s thesis that the House of Representatives was unaware of the consequences of civil RICO, Congressman Poff, its sponsor, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">The curious objection has been raised to [RICO's provisions] that they are not somehow limited to organized crime \u2014 as if organized crime were a precise and operative legal concept, like murder, rape or robbery. Actually, of course, it is a functional concept like white-collar or street crime serving simply as a shorthand method of referring to a large and varying group of individual criminal offenses committed in diverse circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">116 Cong.Rec. at 35,344. Senator McClellan further noted that RICO \u201cwill have some application to individuals who are not themselves members of LaCosa Nostra or otherwise engaged in organized crime.\u201d 116 Cong.Rec. at 18,945 (1970). Congress recognized the possibility of enacting a statute aimed only at \u201cmobsters\u201d or organized crime members and <em>consciously </em>chose not to do so. The majority simply rewrites the statute in a manner Congress rejected under the guise of restricting \u00a7 1964 to \u201cmobster\u201d activity. Congress chose means to achieve its ends that imposed a risk of RICO liability on those like appellee Imrex in this case. The allegations alleging wire and mail fraud against defendant Imrex\u2014 assumed on a motion to dismiss to be true \u2014 are indictable offenses. Fraud is a typical activity of organized crime and Congress specifically noted it in its statement of findings and purpose. Pub.L. No. 91-452, \u00a7 1, 84 Stat. 941 (1970). The legislative branch fully considered the possibility of vexatious litigation and took that risk advisedly. H.R.Rep. No. 1549, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 187 (1970). Moreover, since the lawmakers explicitly provided in \u00a7 1964(c) for a private right of action, quite distinct from one judicially inferred, the judiciary\u2019s duty is to administer the law Congress passed and to defer its views on the policy considerations to the legislature. Note, <em>Civil RICO, supra, </em>95 Harv.L.Rev. at 1117. Judicial creativity can only lead to inconsistency and confusion in the application of civil RICO. Whatever limitation is made should come not from the courts, but from Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Accordingly, I vote to reverse the order appealed from and would reinstate the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\">. L. Carroll, <em>Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, </em>(Children\u2019s Classic ed.) 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\">. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s view that <em>Turkette </em>and other Supreme Court cases in the criminal area have no application to the issues raised on this appeal. In the first place, <em>Turk-ette </em>itself specifically refers to the civil provisions, noting that they \"could be useful in eradicating organized crime from the social fabric, whether the enterprise be ostensibly legitimate or admittedly criminal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 101 S.Ct. at 2529. Further, the majority's concerns over \"federalization\u201d of the common law of fraud are identical to the concern in <em>Turkette </em>regarding the balance between federal and state enforcement of criminal law, which the Supreme Court noted was considered specifically by Congress, and which provided no basis for courts \"to restrict the application of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587, 101 S.Ct. at 2530.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
