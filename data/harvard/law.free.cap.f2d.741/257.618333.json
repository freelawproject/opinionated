In addition, Nevada sought a determination that the Secretary was required to obtain a permit from the Nevada State Engineer to operate the Stampede Dam in California. The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of Indians (Tribe) intervened in support of the Secretary. We affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">T \u201e , , e, , x \u2022 x I- <em>Factual Background and District </em>\u201e . _ . . <em>Court Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"aev-dedup-0\">A detailed recitation of the relevant facts may be found in the district court\u2019s two opinions. <em>Carson</em>-Tru<em>ckee Water Conservancy District v. Watt (Carson-Truckee I), </em>549 F.Supp. 704 (D.Nev.1982). The Little Truckee River flows Trakee River which then \u201e ... . . , ,T \u25a0, , . , flows from California into Nevada and into \u201e ., T , , Pyramid Lake. Stampede Dam is located ,, T..., \u201e on the Little Truckee m California. The \u201e , , . Secretary now operates Stampede Dam m a way that conserves two species of fish) the cuj.uj fish and Lahontan cutthroat trout, that are protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1531-1543 (i982). <em>See Carson-Truckee I, </em>537 F.Supp. at 109; <em>Carson-Truckee II, </em>549 F.Supp. at 710_n. Appellants concede that the Secretary\u2019s obligations under ESA supersede his obligations under the Washoe Project Act and related federal reclamation laws. <em>Carson-Truckee II, </em>549 F.Supp. at 708. Appellants, however, challenge the extent of the Secretary\u2019s obligations under ESA.</p>\n<p id=\"AkaE\">, , The district court bifurcated the issues. In <em>Carson-Truckee I, </em>the district court held that ^ Pontiffs have standing to challen^e the Secretary\u2019s operation of the dam, Pontiffs have a private right of action enforce the Secretary s obligations un^er Washoe Project Act, (3) M &amp; I use is a \u201cbeneficial purpose\u201d for which the Secretary is authorized to sell the project\u2019s water under the Washoe Project Act, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 614, (4) the Secretary is required to sell water from Stampede Dam not needed to fulfill his trust obligations to the Tribe and his obligations under ESA, and (5) the Secretary does not need a Nevada state water permit for Stampede Dam\u2019s present operation in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>After deciding <em>Carson-Truckee I, </em>the district court received evidence on the question of how much water was required to fulfill the Secretary\u2019s obligations under ESA and on an alternate plan, submitted by appellants to the Secretary, for operation of the dam. The parties submitted direct evidence in the form of written expert testimony. The parties then were afforded the opportunity to fully cross-examine the experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">After the hearing, the district court, in <em>Carson-Truckee II, </em>ruled that (1) ESA required the Secretary to give priority to conserving the cui-ui fish and Lahontan cutthroat trout so long as they were endangered and threatened, and (2) the Secretary\u2019s finding that there was no excess water to sell after fulfilling those statutory obligations was supported by substantial evidence and therefore his operation of Stampede Dam was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The court also found that appellants\u2019 proposed alternate plan for the operation of the dam would jeopardize the fish and that the Secretary did not abuse his discretion in rejecting the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">We affirm and adopt all but one of the district court\u2019s holdings for the reasons ably stated by Judge Solomon in his two learned opinions. The one holding we vacate is the court\u2019s ruling in <em>Carson-Truckee I </em>that the Washoe Project Act obligates the Secretary to sell all water from Stampede Dam that remains after he has fulfilled his obligations under ESA and under the Tribe\u2019s reserved water rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Carson-Truckee I, </em>537 F.Supp. at 112-13. The following analysis assumes a familiarity with the district court\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">(a) <em>Obligation to sell water</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that M &amp; I use is a \u201cbeneficial purpose\u201d for which the Secretary is authorized to sell the project\u2019s water, <em>Carson-Truckee I, </em>537 F.Supp. at 112. We do not necessarily agree, however, that the Secretary is obligated to sell the water for M &amp; I purposes simply because those purposes are the only present uses for which the Secretary can obtain some reimbursement for project costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Reclamation projects funded by the federal government are generally intended to be reimbursed through the sale of project water. <em>See, e.g., </em>43 U.S.C. \u00a7 485h(a) (1982) (Secretary must submit findings on the amount of costs that will \u201cprobably be repaid by water users\u201d before construction expenditures for a given project may be made). The district court held that Congress had anticipated that the Washoe Project would be 86% reimburseable. <em>Carson-Truckee I, </em>537 F.Supp. at 111. But circumstances have changed. Although Congress in passing the Washoe Project Act intended that irrigation was the Act\u2019s primary purpose, irrigation is no longer a viable use of the project. Appellants are the only entities that seek to distribute the water for reimburseable purposes. Thus, they argue that the Secretary must sell the project\u2019s water to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">The Washoe Project Act, however, unlike other reclamation project authorizations, did not prohibit the Secretary from constructing the project until repayment contracts for the project had been entered into. <em>Compare </em>San Angelo Project Act \u00a7 2(b), 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 615p(b) (West 1964) (Secretary must enter into contracts for repayment of project costs before constructing project) with Washoe Project Act \u00a7 2(bHc), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 614a(b)-(c) (Secretary must enter into repayment contracts before delivering water). The Washoe Project Act merely prohibits the Secretary from delivering project water for reimburseable uses without first obtaining a repayment contract. <em>See </em>Washoe Project Act \u00a7 2(a), 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 614a(a) (federal reclamation laws govern Secretary\u2019s construction, operation, and maintenance of Washoe project); 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 485h(c) (1982) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>(section of federal reclamation law governing sale of reclamation project water for M &amp; I use).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Because we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that, under ESA, the Secretary is permitted to use at this time all of the project\u2019s water to conserve the two species of fish, we need not resolve the extent of the Secretary\u2019s obligation to obtain reimbursement for the project in the future. The Secretary\u2019s asserted obligation to sell project water for M &amp; I purposes should be considered when his superseding obligations to the Tribe, <em>see supra </em>note 1, and under ESA have been fulfilled. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s opinion on this narrow point.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">(b) <em>Appellants\u2019 arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We feel constrained to elaborate our reasons for rejecting appellants\u2019 arguments against two of the district court\u2019s holdings. Those holdings are that (1) ESA requires the Secretary to give priority to the conservation of threatened and endangered species, and (2) the Secretary did not abuse his discretion both in determining that there was no excess water to sell for M &amp; I purposes after his obligations under ESA were fulfilled, and in rejecting appellants\u2019 alternate plan for operating Stampede Dam. Our comments address specific arguments raised on appeal. We make them only to supplement the district court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">(1) <em>ESA\u2019s requirements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">Appellants urge a reading of ESA that would-lead to a result at odds with the statute\u2019s clearly stated objectives. Appellants contend that the Secretary\u2019s authority is defined solely by ESA \u00a7 7(a)(2), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536(a)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, they argue that the Secretary is authorized only to take actions that avoid \u201cjeopardizing\u201d the continued existence of a species. Appellants contend that the Secretary may not do more than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">In addition to its \u00a7 7(a)(2) \u201cjeopardy\u201d provision, however, ESA also directs the Secretary to conserve threatened and endangered species to the extent that they are no longer threatened or endangered. Appellants, relying <em>solely </em>on \u00a7 7(a)(2), would have us ignore the other sections of ESA directly applicable here and relied on by the district court. <em>Carson-Truckee II, </em>549 F.Supp. at 708-10. ESA \u00a7 2(b), (c), &amp; \u00a7 3(3), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b), (c), &amp; \u00a7 1532(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ESA \u00a7 7(a)(1), moreover, specifically directs that the Secretary \u201cshall\u201d use programs administered by him to further the conservation purposes of ESA. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536(a)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Those sections, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>district court found, direct that the Secretary actively pursue a species conservation policy. <em>See also Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 184, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2297, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978) (ESA requires the Secretary to give highest priority to the preservation of endangered species; Congress intended to \u201chalt <em>and reverse </em>the trend toward species extinction, whatever the cost.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The purpose of ESA \u00a7 7(a)(2) is to ensure that the federal government does not undertake actions, such as building a dam or highway, that incidentally jeopardize the existence of endangered or threatened species. See <em>TV A v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 for an example of \u00a7 7(a)(2)\u2019s application. Contrary to appellants\u2019 contention, ESA \u00a7 7(a)(2) is inapplicable here because the Secretary has not undertaken a project that threatens an endangered species. Instead, following the mandate of ESA \u00a7 7(a)(1), \u00a7 2(b), (c), &amp; \u00a7 3(3), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536(a)(1), \u00a7 1531(c), (b), &amp; \u00a7 1532(3), the Secretary actively seeks to conserve endangered species. Thus, the district court properly applied ESA \u00a7 2(b), (c), &amp; \u00a7 3(3) rather than ESA \u00a7 7(a)(2) to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Applying the proper code sections to this case, the Secretary\u2019s decision is well-justified. The Washoe Project Act anticipates but does not require the Secretary to sell water to recover project construction costs. <em>See supra </em>pp. 741 F.2d at pp. 260-261. ESA, on the other hand, directs the Secretary to use programs under his control for conservation purposes where threatened or endangered species are involved. Following this directive, the Secretary here decided to conserve the fish and not to sell the project\u2019s water. Given these circumstances, the ESA supports the Secretary\u2019s decision to give priority to the fish until such time as they no longer need ESA\u2019s protection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">(2) <em>Abuse of Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">In addition to challenging the extent of the Secretary\u2019s obligations under ESA, appellants presented the Secretary with a proposed alternate plan under which they maintained he could both conserve the fish and sell water for M &amp; I use. The plan included planting miles of shade trees along the river to reduce water temperature, confining the river to a single channel, and constructing fish hatcheries. The district court found that appellants\u2019 proposed alternate plan would jeopardize the fish. He then held that the Secretary had not abused his discretion in rejecting the plan and in determining that he had no excess water to sell for M &amp; I purposes after fulfilling his obligations under ESA. The district court\u2019s holding is based in part upon findings of fact about the spawning requirements of the cui-ui fish and Lahontan cutthroat trout. <em>Carson-Truckee II, </em>549 F.Supp. at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Appellants raise two objections to the district court\u2019s holding. First, appellants contend that, although a district court\u2019s factual determinations are usually reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard, the nature of the hearing conducted by the district court in this case warrants a less deferential standard of review. Appellants assert that the hearing before the district court was a \u201cpaper hearing,\u201d in which the demeanor and credibility of the expert witnesses was not involved. Second, they maintain that the district court was clearly erroneous in any event because its decision, which affirmed the Secretary\u2019s rejection of appellants\u2019 proposed plan, was based on a finding that appellants\u2019 plan would result in a constant river temperature of 68 de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>grees. The fish cannot reproduce in water that warm.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Neither argument persuades us to reach a different result. Although the district court required that expert testimony be submitted in writing, the experts were cross-examined in the court\u2019s presence. And, even if we were to employ a less deferential standard of review, we nonetheless would affirm the district court on its overall holding that the Secretary did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The 68 degree finding is found in a brief footnote in the district court\u2019s opinion. <em>Carson-Truckee II, </em>549 F.Supp. at 711 n. 9. The district court\u2019s holding does not stand or fall with that finding. Even assuming that the district court\u2019s 68 degree finding was clearly erroneous,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we think the district court\u2019s other findings \u2014 for example, that (1) appellants did not meet their burden of showing that the Secretary abused his discretion, (2) it is not feasible to operate Stampede Dam for both M <em>&amp; </em>I and fishery purposes, and (3) appellants\u2019 plan would require the expenditure of huge sums, thereby defeating the purpose of obtaining reimbursement, <em>Carson-Truckee II, </em>549 F.Supp. at 711-12 \u2014 amply support the court\u2019s approval of the Secretary\u2019s ac-' tion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The judgment is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\">.

Because we hold that the Washoe Project Act does not require the Secretary to sell water for M &amp; I use, we need not reach the question whether, given competing mandatory statutory directives, the Secretary would be required to use the project\u2019s water entirely for conservation purposes under ESA \u00a7 2(b), (c), \u00a7 3(3), &amp; \u00a7 7(a)(1). Similarly, because the Secretary actively seeks to use the project for conservation purposes, we need not consider the extent of his affirmative obligations under ESA \u00a7 2(b), (c), \u00a7 3(3), &amp; \u00a7 7(a)(1) had he decided neither to sell the water nor to protect the fish.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b337-9\">. The court noted that the appellants\u2019 plan would result in a constant river temperature of 68 degrees. Such a temperature renders it too hot for the fish to reproduce successfully. Appellants point out that the evidence introduced before the district court indicated that appellants\u2019 plan \u2014 planting miles of shade trees, dredging the channel, and undertaking other measures \u2014 would result in occasional, not constant, 68 degree river temperatures. The district court may therefore have erroneously reported appellees\u2019 expert's testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
