Miller, Jr., who was convicted in New Jersey state court of the murder of Deborah Margolin. In his habeas corpus petition, Miller alleges that his confession to the murder was involuntary, because the police detective\u2019s mode of questioning created psychological pressure that induced him to confess against his will. The New Jersey Supreme Court held that the record supported the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Miller\u2019s confession was \u201cvoluntary,\u201d and thus admissible under the controlling precedents. We have carefully reviewed the record and conclude that the factual findings of the state court are supported by the record. We therefore conclude that we must accord these findings the presumption of correctness provided for in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). <em>See Patterson v. Cuyler, </em>729 F.2d 925 (3d Cir.1984). Given the findings and the presumption, we cannot say as a matter of law that the mode of interrogation used by the detective who questioned Miller rendered the confession involuntary, and accordingly we will affirm the judgment of the district court denying Miller\u2019s application for the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-23\">I. <em>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1501-24\">On August 13, 1973, at about 11:30 a.m., while Deborah Margolin was sunbathing on the porch of her home in rural East Amwell Township, a stranger approached in an automobile and informed her that he had seen a heifer loose at the bottom of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>driveway. The stranger offered to help her retrieve the cow. Ms. Margolin declined the offer of help, and then proceeded alone in her brother\u2019s automobile to retrieve the heifer. Her brother found the automobile about half an hour later; the keys had been left in the ignition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-4\">When Ms. Margolin failed to return by late afternoon, her family commenced searching for her. Her father eventually found her dead, face down in a creek, with her throat and breast cut. The New Jersey State Police were then called. A number of troopers and detectives arrived on the scene at about 7:30 P.M., and took a description of the car and the stranger from the victim\u2019s brothers, who had seen him drive up. Miller, who lived nearby and was known to the troopers, had been convicted in 1969 of carnal abuse and arrested in 1973 for statutory rape. One of the officers, Trooper Scott, recalled that Miller drove a car that matched the one described by the victim\u2019s brothers \u2014 an old white car with the trunk tied shut and two dents in the side. Detective Boyce of the State Police confirmed the descriptions of the car and also concluded that the description of the stranger given by the victim\u2019s brothers matched Miller\u2019s general physical characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-5\">The police located Miller at his place of employment, P.F.D. Plastics in Trenton, at about 10:50 P.M. on the evening of the murder, and questioned him there. Miller agreed to accompany the officers to the police barracks for further questioning, and, without being searched, turned his penknife over to the officers. After spending about seventy-five minutes in the barracks kitchen with Trooper Scott, during which he was not questioned, Miller was taken into an interrogation room by Detective Boyce and read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Miller signed the <em>Miranda </em>card, and specifically asked Boyce for a clarification of his right to terminate questioning, which Boyce gave him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1502-11\">The state police made a tape recording of Miller\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Boyce spoke in a soft and friendly \u2014 even sympathetic \u2014 voice. He thus presented himself as a \u201cnice guy,\u201d friendly to the suspect and interested in solving his problems. In response to Boyce\u2019s questions, Miller first described his activities on the morning of August 13. Boyce then pointed out various discrepancies in Miller\u2019s story about how he passed the time during which the murder occurred, the similarity between the description of the car given by the victim\u2019s brothers and Miller\u2019s car, and other incriminating evidence. At that point, Miller weakened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-12\">BOYCE: Now, what would your conclusion be under those circumstances, if someone told you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-13\">MILLER: I\u2019d probably, uh, have the same conclusion you got.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-14\">BOYCE: Which is what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-15\">MILLER: That I\u2019m the guy that, that did this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-16\">BOYCE: That did what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-17\">MILLER: Committed this crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1502-18\">After this, Boyce shifted gears. Boyce stated that in his opinion, Miller wasn\u2019t a \u201ccriminal,\u201d and that he didn\u2019t have a \u201ccriminal mind.\u201d Rather, Boyce asserted that Miller had a \u201cproblem,\u201d for which he needed help, not punishment. Boyce then led Miller to talk about his need for help, the psychiatric treatment he received as a condition of his parole from a prior conviction, and his recent statutory rape arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-19\">With this background out on the table, Boyce began appealing to Miller\u2019s conscience:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-20\">B. Okay, listen Frank, If I promise to, you know, do all I can with the psychiatrist and everything, and we get the proper help for you, and get the proper help for you, will you talk to me about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>M. I can\u2019t talk to you about something I\u2019m not ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-5\">B. Alright, listen Frank, alright, honest. I know, I know what\u2019s going on inside you, Frank. I want to help you, you know, between us right now. I know what [sic] going on inside you. Frank, you\u2019ve got to come forward and tell me that you want to help yourself. You\u2019ve got to talk to me about it. This is the only way we\u2019ll be able to work it out. I mean, you know, listen, I want to help you, because you are in my mind, you are not responsible. You are not responsible, Frank, Frank, Frank, what\u2019s the matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-6\">M. I feel bad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-7\">B. Frank, listen to me, honest to God, I\u2019m, I\u2019m telling you, Frank, (inaudible). I know, it\u2019s going to bother you, Frank, it\u2019s going to bother you. It\u2019s there, it\u2019s not going to go away, it\u2019s there. It\u2019s right in front of you, Frank. Am I right or wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-8\">M. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1503-9\">Miller then began, step by step, to make damaging admissions concerning his participation in the murder. At first, he insisted that, although he was with the victim when she was killed, some unknown stranger had actually committed the crime while they were searching for the heifer. Miller insisted that he had tried to get help, but that, when he realized the victim was dead, he had panicked and dropped the body off. Boyce allowed this much to come out, but then challenged Miller, saying \u201c[y]ou killed this girl, didn\u2019t you.\u201d Miller again denied having committed the crime, after which Boyce changed gears again, telling Miller\u2014 again in soft, pleading tones \u2014 that he could only be helped if he \u201ctold the truth\u201d \u2014 admitted the crime. The following exchange then took place.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-10\">B. Honest, Frank? It\u2019s got to come out. You can\u2019t leave it in. It\u2019s hard for you, I realize that, how hard it is, how difficult it is, I realize that, but you\u2019ve got to help yourself before anybody else can help you. And we\u2019re going to see to it that you get the proper help. This is our job, Frank. This is our job. This is what I want to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-12\">M. By sending me back down there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-13\">B. Wait a second now, don\u2019t talk about going back down there. First thing we have to do is let it all come out. Don\u2019t fight it because it\u2019s worse, Frank, it\u2019s worse. It\u2019s hurting me because I feel it. I feel it wanting to come out, but it\u2019s hurting me, Frank. You\u2019re my brother, I mean we\u2019re brothers. All men on this, all men on the face of this earth are brothers, Frank, but you got to be completely honest with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-14\">M. I\u2019m trying to be, but you don\u2019t want to believe me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-15\">B. I want to believe you, Frank, but I want you to tell me the truth, Frank, and you know what I\u2019m talking about and I know what you\u2019re talking about. You\u2019ve got to tell me the truth. I can\u2019t help you without the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-16\">M. I\u2019m telling you the truth. Sure, that\u2019s her blood in the car because when I seen the way she was cut I wanted to help her, and then when she fell over I got scared to even be involved in something like this, being on parole and ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-17\">B. I realize this, Frank, it may have been an accident. Isn\u2019t that possible, Frank? Isn\u2019t that possible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-18\">M. Sure, it\u2019s possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-19\">B. Well, this is what I\u2019m trying to bring out, Frank. It may be something that, that you did that you can\u2019t be held accountable for. This is, I can help you, I can help you once you tell me the truth. You know what I\u2019m talking about. I want to help you, Frank. I like you. You\u2019ve been honest with me. You\u2019ve been sincere and I\u2019ve been the same way with you. Now this is the kind of relationship we have, but I can\u2019t help you unless you tell me the complete truth. I\u2019ll listen to you. I understand, Frank. You have to believe that, I understand. I understand how you feel. I understand how much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>it must hurt you inside. I know how you feel because I feel it too. Because some day I may be in the same situation Frank, but you\u2019ve got to help yourself. Tell me exactly what happened, tell me the truth, Frank, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1504-4\">M. I\u2019m trying to tell you the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1504-5\">B. Let me help you. It could have been an accident. You, you\u2019ve got to tell me the truth, Frank. You know what I\u2019m talking about. I can\u2019t help without the truth. Now you know and I know that\u2019s, that\u2019s, that\u2019s all that counts, Frank. You know and I know that\u2019s what counts, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. We can\u2019t hide it from each other because we both know, but you\u2019ve got to be willing to help yourself. You know, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a criminal. You have this problem like we talked about before, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1504-6\">M. Yeah, you, you say this now, but this thing goes to court and everything and you ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1504-7\">B. No, listen to me, Frank, please listen to me. The issue now is what happened. The issue now is truth. Truth is the issue now. You\u2019ve got to believe this, and the truth prevails in the end, Frank. You have to believe that and I\u2019m sincere when I\u2019m saying it to you. You\u2019ve got to be truthful with yourself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1504-8\">Miller then began disgressing, talking about how he was \u201cframed\u201d by a detective in connection with his prior conviction and put in prison, and how \u201cthis is going to kill my father.\u201d Boyce continued to redirect Miller toward the murder, and finally the confession came out. The entire interrogation lasted about fifty-eight minutes. There were no threats or explicit promises made, and no physical coercion. Miller, who was coherent throughout the questioning, passed out at the end.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-11\">The state trial court refused to suppress the confession,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Miller was convicted after a four-day trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court reversed unanimously, stating \u201cwe deplore the techniques and tactics which extracted this confession and which, in our judgment, denied defendant due process of law.\u201d The court\u2019s opinion, which is principally composed of quotes from the interrogation transcript, characterizes Boyce\u2019s method of interrogation as \u201cpsychological pressure,\u201d and in a short conclusion invoked the \u201cthe fair winds of due process\u201d which \u201cblow on the guilty as well as the innocent.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1504-12\">The New Jersey Supreme Court, in a 4-3 decision, reversed the Appellate Division and reinstated the conviction. <em>State v. Miller, </em>76 N.J. 392, 388 A.2d 218 (1978). The court stated the appropriate legal standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aeu-dedup-0\">Every case must turn on its particular facts. In determining the issue of volun-tariness, and whether a suspect\u2019s will has been overborne, a court should assess the totality of all the surrounding circumstances. It should consider the char-. acteristics of the suspect and the details of the interrogation. Some of the relevant factors include the suspect\u2019s age, education and intelligence, advice as to constitutional rights, length of detention, whether the questioning was repeated and prolonged in nature and whether \u25a0physical punishment or mental exhaustion was involved. <em>Schneckloth v. Bus-tamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 226, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2047, 36 L.Ed.2d 854, 862 (1973). A suspect\u2019s previous encounters with the \u25a0law has been mentioned as an additional relevant factor. <em>State v. Puchalski, </em>45 N.J. 97, 101, 211 A.2d 370 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1504-13\">76 N.J. at 402, 388 A.2d at 223. The court then proceeded to make subsidiary findings on the relevant factors, and applying the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d standard, held that the use of the \u201cfriendly cop\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1461\">*1461</page-number>approach by Boyce did not overbear Miller\u2019s will. The court relied primarily on the following facts: the interrogation was not excessively long, Boyce at no time misled Miller into thinking he was anything but an interrogating police officer, and Miller understood the significance and probable outcome of confessing to the killing of Deborah Margolin. <em>Id. </em>at 403-04, 388 A.2d at 224. The court held that \u201cthe interrogation in this case did not exceed the proper bounds and that the voluntariness of der fendant\u2019s confession could properly have been determined by the trial court to be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1505-5\">Miller petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The petition was referred to a magistrate, who recommended that the writ be denied. The district court agreed, rejecting Miller\u2019s contention that the psychological pressure created by the questioning made the confession involuntary in the constitutional sense. The district court held that, based on its independent review of the evidence, including the tape of the confession, Miller\u2019s will was not \u201coverborne\u201d by Boyce\u2019s questioning. The court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation denying the writ of habe-as corpus and granting a certificate of probable cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-15\">II. <em>SCOPE OF REVIEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"AR6\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), a state court factual finding is entitled to a \u201cpresumption of correctness\u201d in a federal habeas corpus proceeding unless one of eight enumerated exceptions apply.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The first seven exceptions, which go to the procedural adequacy of the state proceedings, are not applicable to this case. The eighth exception, which we address below, applies where a factual conclusion is not adequately supported by the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-16\">The controlling case on the application of the eighth exception in this context is <em>Pat</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1462\">*1462</page-number><em>terson v. Cuyler, </em>729 F.2d 925 (3d Cir. 1984). <em>Patterson\u2019s </em>principal holding is that a decision of a state court concerning the voluntariness of a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is entitled to the \u201cpresumption of correctness.\u201d Writing for the court, Judge Sloviter analyzed four recent Supreme Court decisions emphasizing the great deference due to state court factual findings in habeas corpus proceedings. <em>See Rushen v. Spain, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 453, 78 L.Ed.2d 267 (1983) (biased nature of jury deliberations is a finding of fact; presumption of correctness applies); <em>Maggio v. Fulford, </em>462 U.S. 111, 103 S.Ct. 2261, 76 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (presumption applies to competence to stand trial); <em>Marshall v. Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. 422, 103 S.Ct. 843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983) (presumption applies to voluntariness of a guilty plea); <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>455 U.S. 591, 102 S.Ct. 1303, 71 L.Ed.2d 480 (1982) (presumption applies to state of mind of witness in pre-trial photographic identification). On the basis of these cases, Judge Sloviter concluded that, contrary to our prior holdings,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cmixed questions of law and fact\u201d such as whether a confession is voluntary or not are subject to the presumption of correctness contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-6\">Neither <em>Patterson </em>nor the recent Supreme Court decisions hold that we have lost our plenary power to review questions of federal law. Instead, the Court has mandated that we treat state-court factual findings dealing with a defendant\u2019s state of mind as such, and apply the presumption of correctness, even where that finding may be dispositive as a matter of law of the defendant\u2019s claim. Section 2254(d), of course, contains exceptions, the most important of which is that the presumption does not apply unless the factual findings are fairly supported by the record. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Thus, as we read <em>Patterson </em>and the recent Supreme Court cases which it interprets, our review is limited to determining whether the state court applied the proper legal test, and whether the factual conclusions reached by the state court are supported on the record as a whole;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to the extent that our prior holdings gave us plenary review over state court findings as to state of mind, they are no longer valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-11\">The dissent complains bitterly that our opinion, which is, of course, informed by <em>Patterson, </em>reads recent decisions of the Supreme Court as effectively overruling, <em>sub silento, </em>fifty years of caselaw of that Court holding that the question whether a defendant\u2019s state of mind renders his confession involuntary is a question of law, over which we have plenary review in a habeas corpus case. The dissent may be correct on this point. <em>Patterson </em>is binding precedent, however, and we must apply it unless we find it distinguishable, which we do not.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We note that Patterson\u2019s reading of the trend of the recent Supreme Court decisions has since been reinforced by the Court in <em>Patton v. Yount, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 2892 n. 12, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At all events, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1463\">*1463</page-number>believe that <em>Patterson </em>was correctly decided and that its principles are applicable to voluntary confession cases.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1507-4\">The concept of voluntariness is not one that lends itself to easy description. In determining whether a confession is voluntary, a court must make three determinations. First, the court must find the subsidiary facts on which the ultimate conclusion must be based \u2014 the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s confession. Second, the court must draw an inference as to the effect that those surrounding circumstances had on the defendant\u2019s mental processes. Third, the court must determine whether the mental processes which led the defendant to confess were such that the confession was \u201cvoluntary\u201d within the constitutional standard. <em>See Culombe v. Connecticut, </em>367 U.S. 568, 603, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 1879, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1961). The dissent does not dispute that, in reviewing a finding of voluntariness, we must defer as to the state court\u2019s findings of the subsidiary facts, such as the circumstances of the questioning and the defendant\u2019s mental capacities, as long as they are supported by the evidence. There is also no dispute that we are free to review, on a plenary basis, the legal standard applied to the \u201cstate of mind\u201d inference drawn by the state court. The disputed question in this case is whether the inference as to the defendant\u2019s state of mind should be treated as a separate factual conclusion, to which we must also defer, or whether it is so inextricably bound up with the legal standard that the two steps are really one, over which we have plenary review.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1507-7\">In the long series of cases cited by the dissent, the Supreme Court confronted confessions made under varying circumstances. These cases generally presented undisputed facts, including unrecorded interrogation of the defendant by police officers, long periods of questioning during which the defendant was denied sleep, access to counsel, or any other form of outside support, and often included disputes over whether physical force was used. The Court was consistently dubious that a confession given under these circumstances could be considered \u201cvoluntary\u201d; yet state judges and juries were finding, on the basis of these facts, that confessions were voluntary. A precise legal definition of volun-tariness, however, remained elusive. As a result, the Court engaged in an independent, case-by-case review of the state courts\u2019 conclusions concerning voluntariness, on the basis of the subsidiary facts as found by the state court, and substituted its conclusion for that of the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-8\">The case which perhaps best highlights the Court\u2019s approach to this problem is one stressed by the dissent: <em>Culombe v. Connecticut, </em>367 U.S. 568, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1961). In <em>Culombe, </em>the Court utilized the same three-stage analysis as we do here, but did not treat state court findings concerning the defendant\u2019s state of mind as binding. The court did not, however, base its holding on an unconstrained review of the state-of-mind finding. This is clear from a passage from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number>Justice Frankfurter\u2019s opinion in <em>Culombe </em>which immediately follows the segments quoted by the dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1508-4\">Great weight, of course, is to be accorded to the inferences which are drawn by the state courts. In a dubious case, it is appropriate with due regard to federal-state relations, that the state court\u2019s determination should control. But where on the uncontested external happenings, coercive forces set in motion by state law enforcement officials are unmistakably in action; where these forces, under all the prevailing states of stress, are powerful enough to draw forth a confession; where, in fact, the confession does come forth and is claimed by the defendant to have been extorted from him; and where he has acted as a man would act who is subjected to such an extracting process \u2014 where this is all that appears in the record \u2014 a State\u2019s judgment that the confession was voluntary cannot stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANE\">367 U.S. at 605, 81 S.Ct. at 1880-1881. Fairly speaking, the \u201cinference\u201d concerning the defendant\u2019s state of mind, therefore, was never considered a purely \u201clegal\u201d question; rather, it was viewed as a hybrid question, on which the state court\u2019s conclusion was entitled to some deference.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1508-5\">In recent years, the Supreme Court has shown considerable concern for segregating \u201cfactual\u201d and \u201clegal\u201d issues for purposes of appellate review. <em>See Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 287-88, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1789-90, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982) (\u201cultimate\u201d findings of fact, which are dispositive of the legal issues involved, are entitled to deference under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The eases relied on by this court in <em>Patterson </em>extend that concern to habeas corpus review of state court criminal convictions. <em>See also Patton v. Yount, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984). <em>Patterson </em>found this trend generally applicable to constitutional questions that turn on a determination about a defendant\u2019s state of mind, and held that such determinations were ultimate questions of fact, rather than questions of law. We read the recent decisions of the Supreme Court, as interpreted by <em>Patterson, </em>as holding that the second stage of the <em>Cu-lombe </em>inquiry \u2014 that concerning the inference as to the defendant\u2019s state of mind\u2014 should no longer be considered a \u201clegal\u201d or \u201chybrid\u201d question as it was in <em>Culombe, </em>but rather a question of \u201cultimate fact\u201d in the sense of <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-10\">This increased concern with limiting the scope of review reflects a change of emphasis on the part of the Supreme Court. Before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), the Court had used the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d inquiry as a way to check outrageous interrogation practices by law enforcement agencies. Since <em>Miranda, </em>however, voluntariness inquiries have played a far less important role in court supervision of police practices. Before <em>Miranda, </em>the courts were frequently presented with confessions extracted by means of the \u201cthird degree.\u201d Since <em>Miranda, </em>however, voluntary confession cases turn more often on factors such as the individual defendant\u2019s intelligence and understanding of the proceedings. In these latter cases, state court determin\u00e1<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>tion of state of mind will frequently be dispositive, if given deference by the federal courts in habeas corpus proceedings. The Supreme Court, clearly understood this in its recent decisions. These cases, therefore, appear to involve a policy decision by the Court to limit the scope of federal supervision of the interrogation process, as long as the police have complied with the prophylactic rules of <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGFl\">Notwithstanding the dissent\u2019s hyperbole, the case before us today does not present the type of gross abuses of fundamental fairness that characterized many of the voluntariness cases which came before the Court in the years before its decision in <em>Miranda; </em>instead, it is typical of voluntary confession cases in the <em>post-Miranda </em>era. There was no secret interrogation in this case; indeed, the entire encounter was tape-recorded. The questioning was not pressed for a long period of time, and Miller was aware of his right to terminate it upon request. He was not denied food or other necessities, nor was he physically abused or threatened. We cannot say, and we doubt that the dissent would assert, that no confession made under the circumstances presented in this case could ever be \u201cvoluntary.\u201d Instead, we are asked to judge the effect of a particular set of circumstances on a particular defendant. This type of inquiry is one which seems to us to be peculiarly within the proper realm of the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-5\">We recognize that, in circumstances where the ultimate question of fact is one involving state of mind, it may be difficult to pinpoint the \u201cfactual\u201d conclusion as to state of mind, and to state the \u201clegal standard\u201d in such a way as to make its application mechanistic. Under such circumstances, federal courts in habeas corpus cases must either review underlying conclusions about the defendant\u2019s state of mind as legal questions, or allow the fact-finding courts some leeway in applying legal standards to the facts of specific cases. Our reading of the recent Supreme Court decisions relied on in <em>Patterson </em>is that the Court has chosen to require strict adherence to the limited scope of review over facts, even where it would result in giving state trial courts some leeway in applying the constitutional standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-9\">Our decision does not leave the federal courts devoid of power to redress state court decisions which violate fundamental constitutional rights. The legal standard to be applied is a federal question. State courts must apply the federal constitution as it is interpreted by the federal courts, and they may not draw inferences as to a defendant\u2019s state of mind that are not supported by objective facts. But where, as here, the objective facts support a factual inference that the defendant\u2019s \u201cstate of mind\u201d was such that the confession was voluntary within the meaning of the Constitution, it is not the role of the federal courts to second-guess the inference drawn by the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-10\">III. <em>THE VOLUNTARINESS OF THE CONFESSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1509-11\">The constitutional test for voluntariness involves a determination, on the totality of the circumstances, whether the confession was a product of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>free will, or whether it was the product of interrogation, which resulted in the overbearing of the defendant\u2019s will. <em>Sckneck-loth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). In most instances, the controlling question is the defendant\u2019s state of mind \u2014 a question of fact. In this case, the New Jersey Supreme Court<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> stated a number of subsidiary factual conclusions: that Miller was a man of reasonable intelligence who had experience with and understood the workings of the criminal justice system; that Miller\u2019s distress during the interview was a product of his realization of what he had done, not of coercive pressure by Boyce; that Miller was not deceived into believing that Boyce was anything other than a police officer investigating a serious crime for which Miller was the prime suspect; and, that Miller was well aware that, if he confessed, he would be handled through the criminal justice system. The court then concluded, on the basis of these findings, that Miller\u2019s confession was the product of his free will, rather than psychological coercion. 76 N.J. at 404, 388 A.2d at 224. Under \u00a7 2254(d), these conclusions are presumed to be correct, and we must accept them as long as they are fairly supported by the record \u00e1s a whole. We find that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-4\">The most relevant part of the record in this case is the tape of Miller\u2019s interrogation and confession, and we must therefore analyze the confession tape to determine whether it supports the conclusion of the New Jersey Supreme Court. No objection is made to Boyce\u2019s confronting Miller with discrepancies in his explanation of where he was at the time of the murder, or with the statements of the victim\u2019s brothers describing the car that approached their home that morning and its driver. During the questioning, Boyce did lie in telling Miller that the victim had died only a few minutes beforehand, but this lie does not render the confession legally involuntary unless it undermined the \u201cvolun-tariness\u201d of the confession under the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Frazier v. Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 739, 89 S.Ct. 1420, 1424, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969). Since the colloquy about the time of the victim\u2019s death did not seem to affect Miller at all, it cannot be said to have undermined the vol-untariness of the confession. Obviously, the fact that the interrogation was \u201csympathetic\u201d rather than confrontational does not render it coercive. Similarly, to the extent that Boyce confronted Miller with the enormity of his crime, attempting to appeal to his conscience, the questioning is not objectionable, even though Boyce referred to the incident as a \u201cproblem\u201d rather than a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-7\">Miller\u2019s principal contention is that Boyce\u2019s repeated assertions that Miller did not have \u201ca criminal mind,\u201d and that he needed help, rather than punishment, amounted to deception or psychological coercion which undermined the voluntariness of the confession. It is axiomatic that coercion need not be physical to render the confession involuntary; any coercion which denies the defendant the freedom to remain silent may be enough. <em>See Garrity v. New Jersey, </em>385 U.S. 493, 496, 87 S.Ct. 616, 618, 17 L.Ed.2d 562 (1967). Psychological coercion is enough if, under the totality of the circumstances, it results in the overbearing of the defendant\u2019s will. All police practices that encourage defendants to confess, however, do not amount to psychological coercion. Our role is to review the nature of the questioning involved, accepting as true those findings of the state court that involve the defendant\u2019s state of mind, to determine whether the tactics used by Detective Boyce in this ease were unconstitutionally coercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>The most substantial potential problem with the confession is that Boyce\u2019s questioning arguably implied that Miller would receive \u201chelp,\u201d not punishment, if he confessed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The use of promises by an interrogating officer can be sufficient to invalidate a confession. <em>See Robinson v. </em>Smith, 451 F.Supp. 1278, 1290 (W.D.N.Y. 1978), and cases cited therein. In general, however, promises by interrogators will not invalidate a confession unless they are sufficient to \u201coverbear the defendant\u2019s will\u201d\u2014 the general standard of voluntariness. <em>See Fernandez-Delgado v. United States, </em>368 F.2d 34 (9th Cir.1966) (where defendant was told that any assistance to investigators would be brought to the attention of prosecutors, confession was not rendered inadmissible as a result); <em>United States v. Ferrara, </em>377 F.2d 16 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>389 U.S. 908, 88 S.Ct. 225, 19 L.Ed.2d 225 (1967) (where interrogator told defendant that if he cooperated with the government, he would be released on a reduced bail, the confession was not rendered involuntary); <em>United States v. Glasgow, </em>451 F.2d 557 (9th Cir.1971) (per curiam) (where interrogator told defendant he would inform prosecutor if defendant cooperated, the confession was not necessarily rendered involuntary).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1511-9\">In this case, Miller showed a continuing recognition of the depth of the trouble that he was in and the consequences of telling Boyce the truth. Although Boyce stated that he felt Miller needed help, not imprisonment, this was only part of his approach. He also spoke to Miller about the need to tell the truth to purge his conscience,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and continually intermixed his statements about Miller\u2019s \u201cproblem\u201d with his appeals to conscience. The state court found that this questioning did not overbear Miller\u2019s will, and thus did not render the confession involuntary. As we have noted above, we conclude that the state court\u2019s determination as to the effect on Miller\u2019s state of mind was supported on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-10\">IV. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"aje-dedup-0\">Under the caselaw on the question of voluntariness, the inquiry before us is whether the confession was \u201ca product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker.\u201d Judging by this standard, in light of our restricted scope of review, we have concluded that Miller\u2019s confession was voluntary and hence admissible.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1502-6\">.

The dissent points to several \"distinctions\u201d between the voluntariness of <em>Miranda </em>waivers, the subject matter of <em>Patterson, </em>and the volun-tariness of confessions, but they are distinctions without a significant difference. Although a <em>Miranda </em>waiver itself is not exculpatory, any subsequent confession is likely to be, as is evidenced by this case, and the problems of ascertaining the defendant's state of mind are likely to be identical whether the \"voluntariness\u201d challenge is to the <em>Miranda </em>waiver or to the confession itself. It is doubtless for this reason that the <em>Patterson </em>panel encompassed confessions within its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-15\">To the extent that the dissent is arguing that <em>Patterson </em>was incorrectly decided, it is arguing an issue that is not before us, but that may only be decided by this Court <em>in banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>Third Circuit Internal Operating Procedures Ch. VIII(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1506-16\">. The dissent argues that <em>Patton </em>supports its position, relying on the fact that the Court in <em>Patton </em>listed a number of factors which favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1463\">*1463</page-number>deference to the trial court on the issue involved in that case: juror bias. The question before us, however, is not the wisdom of section 2254(d); it is, instead, whether the question of a defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of his confession is a question of fact, or a \u201cmixed question of law and fact.\u201d In <em>Patton, </em>which also required the application of a legal standard to an individual\u2019s state of mind, the Court held that the question of the juror's \u201cstate of mind\" was a question of fact, on which the state court was entitled to deference. A similar inquiry is present in a voluntary confession case, and section 2254(d) is similarly applicable to the inference drawn by the state court concerning the defendant\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1507-9\">. The extended discussion that follows is respective to the dissent. <em>Patterson </em>was a unanimous decision and there was no occasion for such comment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1507-10\">. The question of the degree of deference to be given by a federal court to state-court determinations of subsidiary facts in a <em>habeas </em>case is not at issue in this case. The issue, rather, is what is a \u201cfact\u201d for purposes of review. The distinction raised by the dissent between direct-appeal cases and <em>habeas corpus </em>cases is therefore irrelevant to this case, since the issue of which determinations are \u201clegal\u201d and which are \u201cfactual\u201d is the same in both contexts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1508-6\">. As pointed out in footnote 6 of the dissent, statements in some of the Supreme Court confession cases that the Court would not be bound by factual findings dispositive of the federal issues are \"overstatements.\" If any of the earlier cases were dependent on such reconsidera-tions of factual conclusions, those cases have been overruled. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). <em>Cf. Pullman-Standard v.

The Court has made at least one exception, on policy grounds, to the limitation on appellate review inherent in the <em>Pullman-Standard </em>rule. <em>See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984). Judge Gibbons believes that a similar exception to \u00a7 2254(d) is implicit in the Supreme Court's treatment of the voluntary confession cases. <em>See </em>typescript at 17. We disagree. We believe that the \"policies\u201d cited by the dissent can be dealt with within the framework of the ordinary scope of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1509-6\">. In addition, the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miranda </em>also served to increase the awareness of constitutional rights on the part of local police officers and state court judges, thereby reducing the number of outrageous cases and the need for federal review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-7\">The dissent misrepresents our position when it says that we hold that <em>Miranda </em>compliance affects the scope of review in a habeas case over a state-court determination about a defendant\u2019s state of mind.' Our <em>Miranda </em>reference should rather be understood as an effort to explain the shift in the law. We add to this historical comment the assertion that, at the same time as <em>Miranda </em>was taking care of the worst abuses of police authority, the Court was becoming increasingly concerned with the explosion in the workload of the federal courts, particularly the appellate courts, and with the proper allocation of functions between the state and federal courts. <em>E.g., Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981). Given these developments, the Court has sought to limit the federal role to defining constitutional standards, and dictated that we defer to state courts in applying those standards where these applications are reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1510-5\">. The fact that the facts found in this case are taken from the opinion .of the New Jersey Supreme Court, rather than from a statement of findings by the trial court, does not vitiate the presumption of correctness. <em>See Time, Inc. v.

We also agree that Boyce\u2019s questioning technique could, under different circumstances, create risks of deception. The same questioning coming from, for example, a psychiatrist employed by the police but not clearly identified as a detective, might well create a situation in which the confession would not be voluntary. <em>See Leyra v.

And as a crowning irony to this court\u2019s decision, a majority of the eleven New Jersey judges who reviewed this confession, and to whom we are deferring, concluded not that it was voluntary but that it was involuntary; and all eleven judges asserted that they were drawing a legal conclusion. I emphatically dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-6\">The confession at issue here was the product of implied promises, trickery, cajolery, dissembling, and exaggeration. Because a complete transcript and tape recording of the interrogation are in the record, none of the historical facts concerning Miller\u2019s confession are in dispute. The majority\u2019s abridged account of Detective Boyce\u2019s questioning conveys neither the de-ceipt employed nor the intensity of the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-7\">Early in the interrogation Detective Boyce led Miller to believe that Miller had been identified at the scene of the crime. \u201c[W]e have a physical description,\u201d Boyce asserted, that \u201cfits you and the clothes you were wearing.\u201d App. at 7. Later Boyce told Miller, \u201c[Y]ou were identified as being there talking to her minutes before she was ... [murdered].\u201d App. at 9. In fact Boyce had no such identification. The witness, Daniel Margolin, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1512-10\">I didn\u2019t pay very much attention to the person [driving the car] because I assumed it was someone in the neighborhood and all I really noticed about the individual was he looked about average, he looked like a factory worker and that he had loose-fitting clothing on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1512-11\">Tr. at 169-70. No identification of Miller was ever introduced at trial. Nevertheless, unaware of Boyce\u2019s misrepresentation during the interrogation, Miller responded, \u201c[L]ike you say, I\u2019m identified and my car\u2019s identified.\u201d App. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-12\">Boyce also represented that blood stains of Deborah Margolin, the victim, were found on Miller\u2019s doorstep. \u201cWe went to your house last night and found blood stains on the front stoop,\u201d Boyce dissembled. App. at 6. In fact the state introduced no such evidence at trial and does not contend on appeal that any such blood existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-13\">Nor did the interrogation stop with these fabrications. Miller had been detained in the Flemington State Police Barracks kitchen for two hours before his interrogation. In pretrial proceedings Miller testified that during this detention, Officer Scott \u201ctold me that a girl had been cut but that she was lucky she was still alive and was going to be able to identify the guy that done it.\u201d Tr. at 109. Scott\u2019s assertion was false; although both officers knew that Margolin had died five hours earlier, they deliberately left the impression that she had given a description and could identify her assailant. Alluding to Scott\u2019s remark that Margolin \u201cwas in the hospital,\u201d App. at 9, Miller asked his interrogator whether Margolin was still alive. App. at 8. Boyce quickly ad-libbed, \u201cShe died just a few minutes ago. I just got ... that\u2019s what that [telephone] call was about.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> App. at 9. In fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>Margolin had died hours earlier leaving no description of her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-5\">These prevarications were followed by thirty-eight minutes of intensive, relentless questioning during which Boyce plainly and simply overbore the defendant\u2019s will. Boyce badgered Miller incessantly with promises of help if Miller would confess. On no less than 41 occasions Boyce urged that Miller admit he had a problem, that he needed help to solve his problem, and that Boyce would provide that help if Miller would confess. App. at 6-17 <em>passim. </em>\u201cIf I promise to, you know, do all I can with the psychiatrist and everything, and we get the proper help for you, ... will you talk to me about it?\u201d whispered Boyce. App. at 12. \u201c[W]e\u2019re going to see to it that you get the proper help. This is our job, Frank. This is our job. This is what I want to do,\u201d Boyce intoned. App. at 15. On at least 12 other occasions Boyce urged that Miller would not be held responsible for his actions. \u201c[I]t\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s their fault,\u201d said Boyce. App. at 11. \u201c[I]f you did commit an act, actually they\u2019re the ones that are to blame, in my eyes, ... not you as an individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[I]t may have been an accident,\u201d Boyce entreated. \u201cIt may be something that, that you did that you can\u2019t be held accountable for.\u201d App. at 15. The tape reveals Miller sobbing thirty minutes into the interrogation, distraught, weak, and unstable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-6\">As if there could be any doubt about the intensity of this debilitating examination, at the conclusion of Boyce\u2019s interrogation Miller lapsed into unconsciousness. The majority glosses over the fact that Miller passed out on the floor at the end of the questioning as though this were the ordinary response of one in control of his will during an interrogation. In fact Miller\u2019s unconscious state prevented the officers from obtaining any signed confession. Detective Boyce testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1513-10\">Q. I gather that [a] statement was never taken, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1513-11\">A. It was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1513-12\">Q. Why was that, Officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1513-13\">A. Momentarily after terminating this particular interview Mr. Miller went into as I can best define it a state of shock..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1513-14\">Q. What do you mean by that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1513-15\">A. He was sitting on a chair \u2014 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1513-16\">Mr. Miller had been sitting on a chair, had slid off of the chair on to the floor maintaining a blank stare on his face, staring straight ahead and we were unable to get any type of verbal response from him at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1513-17\">Q. As I understand it he was then removed to the Hunterton Medical Center, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1513-18\">A. Yes, the first aid squad was contacted immediately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1513-19\">Tr. at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-20\">In a unanimous, strongly worded opinion, the New Jersey Appellate Division condemned these adjurations as \u201crelentless and successful Svengalian efforts.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>76 N.J. 392, 419, 388 A.2d 218, 232 (1978) (Conford, P.J.A.D., dissenting).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Without dissent the court held that Miller \u201ccould not long resist the tremendous psychological pressure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe tape transcript must be read in its entirety for its full aroma to be savored,\u201d that court observed. <em>Id. </em>at 413, 388 A.2d at 229. Miller\u2019s ultimate confession, the court held, was a \u201ccapitulation to the superior mind.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 422, 388 A.2d at 234. And capitulation it was. Miller was tricked by an intensive, hypnotic 58-minute interrogation into incriminating himself by a superior questioner who played on Miller\u2019s unstable, childlike mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-5\">After reviewing these events, the New Jersey Appellate Division held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1514-6\">An overbearing broadside which results in a confession by virtue of intense and mind bending psychological compulsion deserves no better fate at our hands than does the legendary rubber hose. <em>Chambers v. Florida, </em>309 U.S. 227 [60 S.Ct. 472, 84 L.Ed. 716] (1940). We have long cherished a determination that the fair winds of due process shall blow upon the guilty as well as the innocent. We will not here let our gratitude for good police work which ferreted out one who is most probably a murderer, and our abhorrence at the crime he committed, cause us to abandon basic constitutional principles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"abh-dedup-1\">76 N.J. at 422-23, 388 A.2d at 234. Without applying these constitutional principles, indeed without referring to them, the majority today characterizes the voluntariness of Miller\u2019s confession as a question of \u201cfact.\u201d The \u201cfactual\u201d finding of the New Jersey Supreme Court, the majority concludes \u2014 a finding that court never made, for the New Jersey Supreme Court held that it was deciding a question of law \u2014 is not without support in the record. Consequently, the majority reasons, we must defer to the state courts\u2019 \u201cfinding\u201d that Miller\u2019s confession was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-9\">This disposition is squarely in conflict with Supreme Court precedent. Over fifty Supreme Court decisions have held that the voluntariness of a confession is a mixed question of law and fact over which our review of the ultimate question of voluntar-iness is plenary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, no issue has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1471\">*1471</page-number>consumed the attention of the Supreme Court more completely in this century, no single question has been investigated more thoroughly nor dissected more vigorously, than the standards for the voluntariness of a confession. The most recent of these decisions, decided barely a month after the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision in this case, reiterated what has become rote in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence: a confession is voluntary only if it is \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe product of a rational intellect and a free will,\u201d \u2019 \u201d and \u201c[i]n making this determination, we are not bound by the [state] [s]upreme [c]ourt\u2019s holding that the statements were voluntary. Instead, this Court is under a duty to make an independent evaluation of the record.\u201d <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 398, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 2416, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-5\">The authority for the majority\u2019s decision to ignore 48 years of Supreme Court precedent holding that the ultimate issue of vol-untariness of a confession is a question of law is the panel opinion of this court in <em>Patterson v. Cuyler, </em>729 F.2d 925 (3d Cir. 1984). Creating a conflict with eight Federal Circuits, <em>see </em>note 20 <em>infra, Patterson </em>reasoned that the voluntariness of a confession is an issue of historical fact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In so reasoning, the Patterson court concluded that no less than fifty Supreme Court decisions have been overruled <em>sub silentio, </em>a <em>coup muet </em>said to be the work of three recent decisions of the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> None of the recent opinions examined in <em>Patterson </em>addresses the voluntariness of a confession. The <em>Patterson </em>court mentioned none of the fifty confession cases which it reasoned were overruled <em>sub silen-tio; </em>nor did it discuss the motive and purpose behind the Supreme Court\u2019s classification of voluntariness of a confession as a mixed question of law and fact. Indeed, <em>Patterson </em>itself addresses only the volun-tariness of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver. No petition for rehearing in <em>Patterson </em>was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-9\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s roughshod treatment of almost half a century of Supreme Court precedent. The history of the voluntary-confession doctrine makes it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number>abundantly clear that the ultimate issue of voluntariness of a confession is a question of law. <em>See </em>Part III <em>infra. </em>Moreover, I dissent from the majority\u2019s deference to a finding of \u201cfact\u201d that no New Jersey Court has made. There is no authority for deference to a finding of \u201cfact\u201d when the court rendering such a \u201cfinding\u201d has \u2022 expressly held that it is not making a factual finding but drawing a legal conclusion. <em>See </em>Part IV <em>infra. </em>We pay little respect for the state courts by ignoring their holdings and rewriting their, factual findings. Finally, I dissent from the majority\u2019s suggestion that three recent Supreme Court decisions have overruled <em>sub silentio </em>one of the most firmly grounded of Supreme Court doctrines. One of these decisions, holding that the ultimate issue of voluntariness of a guilty plea is a question of law, undermines the majority\u2019s position. Neither of the remaining decisions pertains to custodial interrogation conducted in closed proceedings. The import and force of the voluntary-confession doctrine, in contrast, is to afford independent federal review over these closed proceedings. <em>See </em>Part III D <em>infra. </em>The majority\u2019s decision today raises deeply disturbing questions concerning respect for <em>stare decisis </em>and regarding the appropriate role of the inferior federal courts in our hierarchical legal structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-5\">\n<em>Ultimate Issue of Voluntariness of a Confession is a Question of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-6\">\n<em>A. The Direct-Appeal Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-7\">The Supreme Court held in 1936 that a conviction obtained by means of a confession extracted by violence violates due process of law. <em>Brown v. Mississippi, </em>297 U.S. 278, 286, 56 S.Ct. 461, 465, 80 L.Ed. 682 (1936). The interrogators in <em>Brown </em>brazenly admitted their torture. \u201c \u2018This deputy was put on the stand by the state in rebuttal, and admitted the whippings,\u2019 \u201d noted Chief Justice Hughes. Asked how severely one of the defendants was whipped, the deputy testified, \u201c \u2018 \u201cNot too much for a negro; not as much as I would have done if it were left to me.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284, 56 S.Ct. at 464. Two others who had participated in the whippings \u201c \u2018were introduced and admitted it,\u2019 \u201d the Court observed; \u201c \u2018not a single witness was introduced who denied it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284-85, 56 S.Ct. at 464-65. Thus no conflict in the trial testimony was presented in <em>Brown. </em>The Supreme Court held that on the basis of the facts admitted, \u201cIt would be difficult to conceive of methods more revolting to the sense of justice than those taken to procure the confessions of these petitioners, and the use of the confessions thus obtained as a basis for conviction and sentence was a clear denial of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286, 56 S.Ct. at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-9\">On the Supreme Court\u2019s next occasion to address a coerced-confession claim, the interrogators were neither as brazen nor as foolish as those in <em>Brown, </em>for none admitted to mistreatment of the defendants. In <em>Chambers v. Florida, </em>309 U.S. 227, 60 S.Ct. 472, 84 L.Ed. 716 (1940), the Florida Supreme Court had twice reversed the convictions of four defendants, directing that a jury decide in <em>coram nobis </em>proceedings whether their confessions were \u201c \u2018in fact freely and voluntarily made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227-28 n. 2, 60 S.Ct. at 473 n. 2. After a jury twice found the confessions voluntary, Florida\u2019s highest court affirmed. The evidence of voluntariness before the Supreme Court consisted of the transcripts of these <em>coram nobis </em>proceedings. \u201cThe testimony [in these proceedings] is in conflict,\u201d noted Justice Black, \u201cas to whether all four petitioners were continually threatened and physically mistreated until they finally, in hopeless desperation and fear of their lives, agreed to confess ____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231, 60 S.Ct. at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-12\">Before the Supreme Court the State of Florida urged that the jury\u2019s finding of voluntariness was a finding of \u201cfact.\u201d This \u201cfinding,\u201d Florida argued, resolved any dispute in the testimony as to voluntar-iness and \u201cfinally determined [that issue] because passed upon by a jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 60 S.Ct. at 473. The Supreme Court rejected this claim. \u201c[W]e must determine independently,\u201d the Court held, \u201cwhether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1473\">*1473</page-number>petitioners\u2019 confessions were so obtained, by review of the facts upon which that issue necessarily turns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 60 5. Ct. at 473 (footnote omitted). Because certain of the historical facts were disputed, the Court held, it would decide the voluntariness of the confessions as a matter of law on the basis of the undisputed historical facts. <em>Id. </em>at 238-39, 60 S.Ct. at 477-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b1517-6\"><em>Chambers v. Florida </em>thereby became the progenitor of the Supreme Court\u2019s direct-appeal doctrine in voluntary-confession cases. That doctrine provides that in reviewing claims of coerced confession raised on direct appeal to the Supreme Court, the voluntariness of the confession is to be decided as a matter of law on the basis of the admitted or undisputed historical facts of record. The Court applied the direct-appeal doctrine without fail in seventeen voluntary confession cases decided after the <em>Chambers </em>decision in 1940 and before the first voluntary-confession claim to reach the Supreme Court by habeas corpus, <em>Brown v. Allen, </em>344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953), in 1953.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s 1949 trilogy of confession cases, <em>Watts v. Indiana, </em>338 U.S. 49, 69 S.Ct. 1347, 93 L.Ed. 1801 (1949); <em>Turner v. Pennsylvania, </em>338 U.S. 62, 69 S.Ct. 1352, 93 L.Ed. 1810 (1949); <em>Harris v. South Carolina, </em>338 U.S. 68, 69 S.Ct. 1354, 93 L.Ed. 1815 (1949), state the doctrine clearly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1517-7\">On review here of State convictions, all those matters which are usually termed issues of fact are for conclusive determination by the State courts and are not open for reconsideration by this Court. Observance of this restriction in our review of State courts calls for the utmost scruple. But \u201cissue of fact\u201d is a coat of many colors. It does not cover a conclusion drawn from uncontroverted happenings, when that conclusion incorporates standards of conduct or criteria for judgment which in themselves are decisive of constitutional rights. Such standards and criteria, measured against the requirements drawn from constitutional provisions, and their proper applications, are issues for this Court\u2019s adjudica-tion____ Especially in cases arising under the Due Process Clause is it important to distinguish between issues of fact that are here foreclosed and issues which, though cast in the form of determinations of fact, are the very issues to review which this Court sits____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1517-11\">... [I]n all the cases that have come here...during the last decade from the courts of the various States in which it was claimed that the admission of coerced confessions vitiated convictions for murder [citing fourteen cases], there has been complete agreement that any conflict in testimony as to what actually led to a contested confession is not this Court\u2019s concern. Such conflict comes here authoritatively resolved by the State\u2019s adjudication. Therefore only those elements of the events and circumstances in which a confession was involved that are unquestioned in the State\u2019s version of what happened are relevant to the constitutional issue here. <em>But if force has been applied, this Court does not leave to local determination whether or not the confession was voluntary. </em>There is torture of mind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number>as well as body; the will is as much affected by fear as by force. And there comes a point where this Court should not be ignorant as judges of what we know as men.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1518-4\"><em>Watts v. Indiana, </em>338 U.S. at 50-52, 69 S.Ct. at 1348-49 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.) (emphasis added) (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1518-5\">Indeed, the direct-appeal doctrine became so firmly rooted in Supreme Court jurisprudence that reiteration of the oft-repeated standard became second nature to the Court. Thus, after putting \u201cto one side the controverted evidence\u201d in <em>Haley v. Ohio, </em>332 U.S. 596, 597-98, 68 S.Ct. 302, 302-03, 92 L.Ed. 224 (1948), and noting that both the state trial court and the jury \u201cfound\u201d the defendant\u2019s confession voluntarily made, <em>id. </em>at 599, 68 S.Ct. at 303, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1518-6\">But the ruling of the trial court and the finding of the jury on the voluntary character of the confession do not foreclose the independent examination which it is our duty to make here____ If the undisputed evidence suggests that force or coercion was used to exact the confession, we will not permit the judgment of conviction to stand____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1518-10\"><em>Id. </em>(opinion of Douglas, J.). Similarly, in <em>Gallegos v. Nebraska, </em>342 U.S. 55, 72 S.Ct. 141, 96 L.Ed. 86 (1951), the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akz-dedup-0\">As this Court has been entrusted with power to interpret and apply our Constitution to the protection of the right of an accused to federal due process in state criminal trials, the proper performance of that duty requires us to examine, in cases before us, such undisputed facts as form the basis of a state court\u2019s denial of that right____ A contrary rule would deny to the Federal Government ultimate authority to redress a violation of constitutional rights. As state courts also are charged with applying constitutional standards of due process, in recognition of their superior opportunity to appraise conflicting testimony, we give deference to their conclusions on disputed and essential issues of what actually hap-pened____ Its duty compels this Court, however, to decide for itself, on the facts that are undisputed, the constitutional validity of a judgment that denies claimed constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1518-16\">342 U.S. at 61, 72 S.Ct. at 145 (opinion of Reed, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1518-17\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to characterize the ultimate issue of voluntariness of a confession as one of law did not turn on an epistemological theory of whether \u201cvol-untariness\u201d concerned the defendant\u2019s \u201cstate of mind\u201d and whether such \u201cstate of mind\u201d issues are questions of \u201cfact.\u201d To the contrary, the Court\u2019s holdings had a far deeper motivation. The interrogations at issue took place in secret. They generally occurred in inherently coercive settings, frequently involving a single defendant shackled or detained for long periods of time and surrounded or confronted by relays of five or more police officers. At trial the defendant\u2019s account was matched against the testimony of many officers, some of it obviously incredulous to the Supreme Court. The Court construed the ultimate question of voluntariness as one of law because the settings of police interrogations were secret and inherently coercive, because the Court had grave doubts about what transpired during these secret proceedings, and because federal review of these proceedings would be frustrated on direct appeal if the question were one of fact. Hence the Court\u2019s explanation in both <em>Haynes v. Washington, </em>373 U.S. 503, 515-16, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1344-45, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963), and <em>Stein v. New York, </em>346 U.S. 156, 181, 73 S.Ct. 1077, 1091, 97 L.Ed. 1522 (1953) \u2014 both coerced-confession cases \u2014 that \u201cthis Court cannot allow itself to be completely bound by state court determination of any issue essential to decision of a claim of federal right, else federal law could be frustrated by distorted fact finding.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>White v. Texas, </em>310 U.S. 530, 60 S.Ct. 1032, 84 L.Ed. 1342 (1940), and <em>Ward v. Texas, </em>316 U.S. 547, 62 S.Ct. 1139, 86 L.Ed. 1663 (1942), are exemplars of this point. State officers in both cases conceded that they had taken the defendant on \u201cnight trips to the woods,\u201d \u201cout off of the road,\u201d <em>White, </em>310 U.S. at 533, 60 S.Ct. at 1033, or \u201cby night and day to strange towns,\u201d <em>Ward, </em>316 U.S. at 555, 62 S.Ct. at 1143. They contested, however, what happened on these strange \u201cnight trips.\u201d The defendants contended that they were \u201cbeaten, whipped and burned,\u201d <em>Ward, </em>316 U.S. at 551, 62 S.Ct. at 1141, \u201chandcuffed\u201d and \u201cwhipped,\u201d <em>White, </em>310 U.S. at 532, 60 S.Ct. at 1033, and otherwise subject to physical abuse. The interrogating officers, in contrast, denied any mistreatment, avowing instead that the defendants felt a new sense of peace after these night journeys and willingly confessed. The officer\u2019s testimony in <em>Ward v. Texas </em>is illustrative: \u201c \u2018We just talked to him to get that statement. Yes, sir, we just sweet talked him out of it.\u2019 \u201d 316 U.S. at 552, 62 S.Ct. at 1142. The Texas courts resolved the disputed testimony in favor of the officers and purported to \u201cfind\u201d the confessions voluntary. In order to prevent gross miscarriages of justice, the Supreme Court held while state findings of historical fact were binding on direct appeal, the ultimate issue of voluntariness is one of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-5\">In summary, by 1953 the Supreme Court had expressly held in at least eighteen reported cases that the ultimate question of the voluntariness of a confession is one of law. On direct appeal to the Supreme Court this legal determination was to be made on the basis of the undisputed historical facts. The Court characterized the ultimate issue as one of law because the police interrogations at issue were conducted in secret, coercive settings, and because federal review over these proceedings would be defeated on direct appeal were the ultimate issue one of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-10\">\n<em>B. Habeas Corpus Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-11\">In 1953 the Supreme Court examined the first coerced-confession claim to reach the Court in habeas corpus. <em>Brown v. Allen, </em>344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In what is now standard fare to students of habeas corpus, the Court held in <em>Brown v. Allen </em>that the scope of review of the federal courts in habeas corpus exceeds that of the Supreme Court on direct appeal. While the direct-appeal doctrine limits the Supreme Court\u2019s review to the undisputed facts of record, the 1867 Habe-as Corpus Act<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> creates the power in every case to readjudicate issues of historical fact decided by the state courts. 344 U.S. at 457-64, 73 S.Ct. at 407-11 (opinion of Reed, J.). Moreover, the Court held, in certain circumstances the federal courts were obliged to consider factual questions anew, in particular when the state courts failed to give \u201cfair consideration to the issues and the offered evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 463, 73 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>410 (opinion of Reed, J.), and when \u201ca vital flaw be found in the process of ascertaining\u201d the facts by the state courts. 344 U.S. at 506, 73 S.Ct. at 445 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). However, the <em>Brown </em>Court held, conclusions of mixed law and fact are never binding in habeas corpus proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1520-4\">Where the ascertainment of the historical facts does not dispose of the claim but calls for interpretation of the legal significance of such facts, ... the District Judge must exercise his own judgment on this blend of facts and their legal values. Thus, so-called mixed questions or the application of constitutional principles to the facts as found leave the duty of adjudication with the federal judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1520-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 507, 73 S.Ct. at 446 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). The Court\u2019s review of the coerced-eonfession claim in <em>Brown </em>\u2014a mixed question of law and fact \u2014 was plenary. 344 U.S. at 474-76, 73 S.Ct. at 416-17 (opinion of Reed, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-6\">The \u201cfair consideration\u201d and \u201cvital flaw\u201d standards of <em>Brown v. Allen </em>soon proved bedevilling to the district courts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In an effort to afford additional guidance on the question whether the district courts were obliged to relitigate issues of historical fact, the Supreme Court in <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), refined the rules of <em>Brown v. Allen. </em>In lieu of the amorphous \u201cfair consideration\u201d and \u201cvital flaw\u201d standards of <em>Brown, </em>the Court substituted six arguably clearer standards.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the event that a mandatory hearing is not required under these standards, the <em>Townsend </em>Court held, the district courts \u201cmay, and ordinarily should, accept the facts as found in the [state] hearing. But [they] need not.\u201d 372 U.S. at 318, 83 S.Ct. at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-11\">Congress codified the <em>Townsend </em>standards with little change in the 1966 amendments to the Habeas Corpus Act. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(8) (1982); <em>see </em>Maj. op., at 1461 n. 7. The 1966 amendments retained the exception applicable when the state factual determination \u201cis not fairly supported by the record.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(8) (1982). In cases not falling within these exceptions, Congress added, state findings of historical fact \u201cshall be presumed to be correct.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-12\">Neither <em>Townsend v. Sain </em>nor the 1966 amendments to the Habeas Corpus Act, however, altered the Supreme Court\u2019s doctrine that the federal courts sitting in habe-as proceedings exercise plenary review over the ultimate legal issue in mixed questions of law and fact. The <em>Townsend </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1520-13\">By \u201cissues of fact\u201d we mean to refer to what are termed basic, primary, or historical facts: facts \u201cin the sense of a recital of external events and the credibility of their narrators____\u201d <em>Brown v. Allen, </em>344 U.S. 443, 506 [73 S.Ct. 397, 446, 97 L.Ed. 469] [(1953)] (opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter). So-called mixed questions of fact and law, which require the application of a legal standard to the historical-fact determinations, are not facts in this sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1520-15\">372 U.S. at 309 n. 6, 83 S.Ct. at 755 n. 6. As recently as May of 1984 the Court reaffirmed that, the ultimate legal issue in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>mixed question of law and fact is not subject to the presumption of correctness of section 2254(d). <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2070, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>see Marshall v. Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. 422, 103 S.Ct. 843, 849, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983); <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>455 U.S. 591, 597, 102 S.Ct. 1303, 1306-07, 71 L.Ed.2d 480 (1982) (per curiam); <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 342, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1714, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980); <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 403-04, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 1241-42, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-6\">Nor did the Court recede from its holdings that the voluntariness of a confession is such a mixed question of law and fact. As I note below, in over thirty decisions filed between the opinions in <em>Brown v. Allen </em>and <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>the Supreme Court emphatically reaffirmed that voluntary-confession determinations are mixed questions of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-7\">Thus, the evolving standards for the review of historical facts in habeas corpus proceedings had no effect on the voluntary-confession doctrine. That doctrine, that the ultimate question of the voluntariness of a confession is an issue of law, applied equally in direct appeals and habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1521-8\"><em>C. Coerced-Confession Claims from </em>Brown v. Allen <em>to </em>Mincey v. Arizona</p>\n<p id=\"Ay9\">As increasing numbers of coerced-confession claims pressed for the Supreme Court\u2019s attention, the Court evinced mounting concern over the circumstances of police interrogations conducted in closed-door sessions. Between 1953 and 1966, the year of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), the Supreme Court addressed no less than nineteen coerced-confession claims. During this period the Court reaffirmed that a confession may be extracted by psychological ploys as surely as by physical abuse. <em>Blackburn v. Alabama, </em>361 U.S. 199, 206, 80 S.Ct. 274, 279, 4 L.Ed.2d 242 (I960);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>see Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 389-90, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 1787-88, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964); <em>Spano v. New York, </em>360 U.S. 315, 321, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 1206, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (1959) (as \u201cthe methods used to extract confessions [become] more sophisticated, our duty to enforce federal constitutional protections does not cease. It only becomes more difficult because of the more delicate judgments to be made.\u201d). In all such cases, the Court held, the legal standard for voluntariness is whether the confession is \u201cthe product of a rational intellect and a free will.\u201d <em>Blackburn, </em>361 U.S. at 208, 80 S.Ct. at 280. In the case of psychological coercion, the Court\u2019s assessment of voluntariness included consideration of the intensity and potential for de-ceipt of any psychological pressure employed <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in addition to the defendant\u2019s susceptibility to such pressure, as measured by the individual\u2019s maturity,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> education,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>intelligence,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> experience,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and physical condition.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1522-4\">In each of these cases the Supreme Court reaffirmed that the ultimate determination of voluntariness is a mixed question of law and fact. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s encyclopedic opinion in <em>Culombe v. Connecticut, </em>367 U.S. 568, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1961), for example, clearly distinguished between the underlying historical facts and the ultimate determination of vol-untariness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1522-5\">The inquiry whether, in a particular case, a confession was voluntarily or involuntarily made involves, at the least, a three-phased process. First, there is the business of finding the crude historical facts, the external, \u201cphenomenological\u201d occurrences and events surrounding the confession. Second, because the concept of \u201cvoluntariness\u201d is one which concerns a mental state, there is the imaginative recreation, largely inferential, of internal, \u201cpsychological\u201d fact. Third, there is the application to this psychological fact of standards for judgment informed by the larger legal conceptions ordinarily characterized as rules of law but which, also, comprehend both induction from, and anticipation of, factual circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1522-6\">367 U.S. at 603, 81 S.Ct. at 1879 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). The first of these determinations, the Court held, is one of historical fact. <em>Id. </em>However, the Court reiterated, the second and third phases are conclusions of law. <em>Id. </em>at 604-05, 81 S.Ct. at 1880-81. Justice Frankfurter made amply clear the reason for classifying these determinations as legal conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1522-7\">No more restricted scope of review would suffice adequately to protect federal constitutional rights. For the mental state of involuntariness upon which the due process question turns can never be affirmatively established other than circumstantially \u2014 that is, by inference; and it cannot be competent to the trier of fact to preclude our review simply by declining to draw inferences which the historical facts compel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1522-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 605, 81 S.Ct. 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b1522-13\">Reaffirmations of the rule that the ultimate question of voluntariness is one of law appear in every case decided during this period. <em>E.g., Reck v. Pate, </em>367 U.S. 433, 81 S.Ct. 1541, 6 L.Ed.2d 948 (1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ai5-dedup-0\">The question whether there has been a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by the introduction of an involuntary confession is one which it is the ultimate responsibility of this Court to determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1522-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 435, 81 S.Ct. at 1543; <em>see also Haynes v. Washington, </em>373 U.S. 503, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1522-15\">Our conclusion is in no way foreclosed, as the State contends, by the fact that the state trial judge or the jury may have reached a different result on this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1522-16\">It is well settled that the duty of constitutional adjudication resting upon this Court requires that the question whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has been violated by admission into evidence of a coerced confession be the subject of an <em>independent </em>determination here ...; \u201cwe cannot escape the responsibility of making our own examination of the record,\u201d <em>Spano v. New York, </em>360 U.S. 315, 316 [79 S.Ct. 1202, 1203, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265] [ (1959) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aju-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 515, 83 S.Ct. at 1344 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s concern for the conduct of secret police interrogation reached a new level of acuity with the Court\u2019s incorporation of the privilege against self-incrimination as an element of due process applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment. <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 6-11, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1492-95, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964). That concern, in turn, led to the Court\u2019s well-known decisions in <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964), and <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964) \u2014 pressing the sixth amendment right to counsel into service to protect the privilege against self-incrimination after the onset of adversary judicial proceedings, and before their onset in the circumstances defined in <em>Escobedo </em><footnotemark>19</footnotemark>\u2014and <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), requiring the recitation of warnings after the onset of custodial interrogation to enforce the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-6\">The advent of these decisions enforcing the newly incorporated privilege against self-incrimination, however, did not change the Supreme Court\u2019s solicitude for scrutiny of confessions exacted by coercion. In 1978 the Court again affirmed that the ultimate question of the voluntariness of a confession is one of law. <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1523-7\">If, therefore, Mincey\u2019s statements to Detective Hust were not \u201c \u2018the product of a rational intellect and a free will,\u2019 \u201d <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 307 [83 S.Ct. 745, 754, 9 L.Ed.2d 770] [(1963)], quoting <em>Blackburn v. Alabama, </em>361 U.S. 199, 208 [80 S.Ct. 274, 280, 4 L.Ed.2d 242] \u2022 [ (1960) ], his conviction cannot stand. In making this critical determination, <em>we are not bound by the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s holding that the statements were voluntary. Instead, this Court is under a duty to make an independent evaluation of the record.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1523-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 398, 98 S.Ct. at 2416 (emphasis added). The majority now reasons that <em>Min-cey v. Arizona, </em>and each of its direct-appeal predecessors, are now overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1523-11\">It is important to understand the reason for this conclusion and the significance of its ramifications. As the majority properly notes, there is no distinction between the definition of \u201cfact\u201d for purposes of direct appeal and habeas corpus. Maj. op., at 1463 n. 12. Had the voluntariness of Min-cey\u2019s confession been an ultimate question of fact, the Supreme Court would have asked only whether the Arizona courts had applied the proper legal standard \u2014 whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the defendant\u2019s will was overborne \u2014 in finding this fact. In <em>Mincey </em>there was no dispute that the Arizona courts had indeed applied the proper legal standard. If the question of voluntariness were one of ultimate fact, therefore, the Supreme Court would simply- have affirmed, noting that the proper legal standard had been applied. Instead, holding that the ultimate question of voluntariness is one of law, the Court reversed, concluding as a matter of law that the confession was involuntarily made. Thus the majority reasons, with commendable candor, that <em>Mincey </em>is overruled. Similarly, the majority concludes that the entire direct-appeal line of decisions, and the direct-appeal doctrine itself in confession cases, have been reversed <em>sub silentio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1523-12\">The ramifications of this holding are of the highest order. In the majority\u2019s view, the Supreme Court itself is barred on direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>appeal from making an independent determination of the voluntariness of a confession. That function, again in the majority\u2019s view, is open to the federal courts only in habeas corpus, and only when a state court \u201cfinding\u201d of voluntariness is not fairly supported by the record as a whole. Thus, all independent federal scrutiny over confessions \u2014 both on direct appeal to the Supreme Court and in habeas corpus \u2014 would be gravely \u25a0 impaired. It is for precisely this reason that the Supreme Court has reiterated that the ultimate question of vol-untariness is a mixed question of fact and law. And it is precisely this judgment of the Supreme Court that the majority today maintains has been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-4\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that this upheaval in Supreme Court jurisprudence was the work of <em>Miranda </em>is erroneous. Perhaps it is too simple to point out that the Supreme Court decided <em>Mincey v. Arizona </em>in 1978, twelve years after the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miranda. </em>In <em>Mincey, </em>after all, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not given;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> it would be a sophism indeed to rely on <em>Miranda </em>as a foundation for doctrinal change when <em>Miranda </em>itself is violated. But there is no such distinction in <em>Hutto v. Ross, </em>429 U.S. 28, 97 S.Ct. 202, 50 L.Ed.2d 194 (1976) (per curiam).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In <em>Hutto, </em>a habeas corpus proceeding, the defendant had received <em>Miranda </em>warnings; indeed, he had also volunteered a confession with the advice and in the presence of counsel. <em>Hutto, </em>429 U.S. at 29, 97 S.Ct. at 203. Despite the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the presence of counsel, the Court characterized the volun-tariness of the confession as an ultimate issue of law. In particular, the Court did not apply section 2254(d) to the issue of voluntariness. The presence of counsel and giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings were simply factors for consideration in the determi--hation of voluntariness. <em>See Davis v. North Carolina, </em>384 U.S. 737, 740-41, 86 S.Ct. 1761, 1763-64, 16 L.Ed.2d 895 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1524-8\">The theory that <em>Miranda </em>worked a doctrinal upheaval in Supreme Court jurisprudence may have been grist for an advocate\u2019s brief in <em>Hutto </em>and Mincey. It is not, however, a theory open to us as a inferior federal court bound by Supreme Court precedent. And it seems at least relevant that eight Federal Circuits have rejected the theory that <em>Miranda </em>altered the Supreme Court\u2019s voluntary-confession doctrine. Each of these courts addressing <em>post-Miranda </em>events has held that the ultimate question of the voluntariness of a confession is a one of law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>Finally, the majority\u2019s holding sends the wrong signal to law enforcement officers. Its message \u2014 obtain a <em>Miranda </em>waiver and only then employ \u201csophisticated modes of \u2018persuasion,\u2019 \u201d <em>Blackburn, </em>361 U.S. at 206, 80 S.Ct. at 279 \u2014 renders the court\u2019s reliance on the prophylaxis of <em>Miranda </em>sophistical and offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-5\">To summarize, as recently as 1978 the Supreme Court confirmed what it had held on some fifty prior occasions. A confession is voluntary if it is the product of a free will and a rational intellect. The ultimate question of the voluntariness of a confession is one of law. While the historical circumstances surrounding the making of a confession are subject to the strictures of section 2254(d), the conclusion of volun-tariness is not. The presence or absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is simply one factor for evaluation under the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-6\">\n<em>D. Recent Supreme Court Opinions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"amm-dedup-0\">\u201cVery weighty considerations,\u201d the Court has held, \u201cunderlie the principle that courts should not lightly overrule past decisions.\u201d <em>Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., </em>398 U.S. 375, 403, 90 S.Ct. 1772, 1789, 26 L.Ed.2d 339 (1970). The Supreme Court does not make it a practice to overrule doctrines of long standing without a reasoned explanation of its judgment. <em>See Foremost Ins. Co. v. Richardson, </em>457 U.S. 668, 672-77, 102 S.Ct. 2654, 2657-60, 73 L.Ed.2d 300 (1982); <em>United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., </em>421 U.S. 397, 401-11, 95 S.Ct. 1708, 1710-16, 44 L.Ed.2d 251 (1975); <em>Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, </em>398 U.S. 235, 240-53, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 1586-94, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970); <em>Moragne, </em>398 U.S. at 403-05, 90 S.Ct. at 1789-90. This settled practice notwithstanding, the majority today holds that three recent Supreme Court decisions overruled <em>sub silen-tio </em>almost half a century of Supreme Court precedent on voluntary confessions. These cases had no such purport.</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-10\">The first of these decisions, <em>Marshall v. Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. 422, 103 S.Ct. 843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983), examined the voluntariness of a plea of guilty. The Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1525-11\">We entirely agree with the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Court that the governing standard as to whether a plea of guilty is voluntary for purposes of the federal Constitution is a question of federal law.....and not a question of fact subject to the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). But the questions of historical fact which have dogged this case from its inception \u2014 what the Illinois records show with respect to respondent\u2019s 1972 guilty plea, what other inferences regarding those historical facts the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit could properly draw, and related questions \u2014 are obviously questions of \u201cfact\u201d governed by the provisions of \u00a7 2254(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyP\">103 S.Ct. at 849. <em>Marshall </em>obviously undermines any suggestion that the Court had receded from its view that the ultimate question of the voluntariness of a confession is one of law. To be sure, the Court noted that \u201cinferences regarding those historical facts\u201d are governed by section 2254(d). But the voluntariness of a guilty plea, the Court expressly held, is not such an inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1525-13\">Moreover, the policies that moved the Supreme Court to characterize the volun-tariness of a confession as an ultimate issue of law are absent in the case of a plea of guilty. The Court has never reasoned superficially that the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of a confession concerns a \u201cstate of mind\u201d and that all issues of \u201cstate of mind\u201d could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>classified <em>a priori </em>as either \u201cfact\u201d or \u201clegal conclusion.\u201d Our legal characterizations have deeper truths. The Court describes the voluntariness of a confession as a legal issue because confessions are the product of police interrogation generally conducted in closed proceedings and inherently coercive settings. The truth is difficult to penetrate in these proceedings; in order to prevent the shielding of claims of federal right on direct appeal to the Supreme Court, the Court retained a measure of power to draw independent inferences from the historical facts of record. But no such circumstances are present during the allocution of a guilty plea. These pleas are entered in open court under prescribed conditions with the benefit of counsel and with a full stenographic record of the allocution. Nothing could be further from the inherently coercive setting of secret police interrogation. Thus the need for independent federal review of the voluntariness of guilty pleas is less acute than that for confessions obtained during police interrogation. And yet the Supreme Court in <em>Marshall </em>reaffirmed that the voluntariness of even a guilty plea entered in open court is a mixed question of law and fact. If <em>Marshall v. Lonberger </em>speaks at all to voluntary confessions, it counsels more strongly than ever that the voluntariness of a confession is an ultimate issue of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-4\">The remaining two cases on which the majority <em>relies </em>\u2014Rushen <em>v. Spain, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 453, 78 L.Ed.2d 267 (1983) (per curiam), and <em>Maggio v. Fulford, </em>462 U.S. 111, 103 S.Ct. 2261, 76 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (per curiam) \u2014 also do not affect the voluntary-confession doctrine. Both of these cases are per curiam summary reversals decided without briefing or argument; it would be extraordinary, to say the least, if the Supreme Court intended two per curiam summary dispositions to overrule a half century of Supreme Court doctrine. But of course they do not. Neither case addresses the voluntariness of a confession. <em>Maggio </em>arguably holds that a defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial is an issue of fact subject to section 2254(d), notwithstanding the contrary holding of <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 174-75 &amp; n. 10, 95 S.Ct. 896, 905-06 &amp; n. 10, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975). Like the entry of a guilty plea, however, the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial is adjudicated in open court after a competence hearing, <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 385-86, 86 S.Ct. 836, 842-43, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966). The trial court witnesses all of these proceedings and renders credibility findings; counsel is generally present unless that right is waived; and a stenographic record is prepared for the purpose of appellate review. The policies requiring a measure of independent federal scrutiny over confessions obtained during secret police interrogation apply with far less force to the determination of the competence of a witness to stand trial made after a <em>Pate </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-8\"><em>Rushen </em>holds that the effect of <em>ex parte </em>communications on the impartiality of a juror is a question of fact subject to section 2254(d). This unremarkable conclusion is wholly consistent with the voluntary-confession doctrine. Although such <em>ex parte </em>communications do take place outside of the presence of the trial court, they do not occur in the inherently coercive setting of police interrogation and, more importantly, do not implicate the danger of self-incrimination of the defendant. The need for independent federal scrutiny of the impact of <em>ex parte </em>communication on the jury is far more attenuated than that appropriate to the confession of a defendant offered at trial. In drawing this conclusion the <em>Rush-en </em>Court nowhere even alluded to the voluntary-confession doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1526-9\">In short, the suggestion that <em>Marshall, Maggio, </em>and <em>Rushen </em>overruled the voluntary-confession doctrine <em>sub silentio </em>is simply ludicrous. That doctrine retains the vitality it has enjoyed for almost fifty years. It may be the prerogative of a majority of the Supreme Court \u201cto overrule, <em>sub silentio, </em>a century of precedents,\u201d as Justice Roberts put it. <em>James v. Dravo Contracting Co., </em>302 U.S. 134, 161, 58 S.Ct. 208, 221, 82 L.Ed. 155 (1937) (Roberts, J., dissenting). It is not, however, within the power of this court. We under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>mine the \u201cpublic faith in the judiciary as a source of impersonal and reasoned judgments,\u201d <em>Moragne, </em>398 U.S. at 403, 90 S.Ct. at 1789, by abandoning such a longstanding judicial practice on so patently baseless a ground. The court\u2019s holding raises the gravest questions respecting adherence to the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>and concerning the appropriate role of an inferior federal tribunal in deeming so weighty a Supreme Court doctrine overthrown by so meager a force.</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-5\">To the extent that <em>Patterson v. Cuyler </em>reasoned that <em>Marshall, Maggio, </em>and <em>Rushen </em>overruled the voluntary-confession doctrine, it reasoned incorrectly. <em>Patterson </em>\u2019s holding, however, is merely that the voluntariness of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver is an issue of fact.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As such, it would not control our decision here even if the Supreme Court had been silent on the issue of voluntary confessions. <em>Miranda </em>waivers, of course, are generally obtained in closed proceedings. But there the similarity to confessions ends. A <em>Miranda </em>waiver is not inculpatory; rather, it is an agreement to accede to questioning until the permission is withdrawn. <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 1884-85, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981). The policies requiring independent federal review of confessions exacted during police interrogation do not apply with equal force to a mere permission to begin questioning. And as a practical matter, <em>Miranda </em>waivers are generally evinced by signed writings. When a <em>Miranda </em>waiver is effected not by such a writing but by a defendant\u2019s unilateral statement to the police, <em>Edwards </em>holds that the validity of the waiver is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>See </em>note 22 <em>supra. Patterson </em>makes no effort to reconcile its conclusion with this aspect of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Edwards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1527-8\">The majority suggests that Patterson\u2019s reading of the \u201ctrend\u201d of recent Supreme Court decisions has been reinforced by the Court in <em>Patton v. Yount, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984). Quite to the contrary, <em>Patton </em>directs the opposite conclusion. In <em>Patton </em>the Court held that the bias of a single juror is an issue of fact. \u2014 U.S. at \u2014\u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2890-2893. The Supreme Court arrived at that conclusion only after assessing the relevant reasons for categorization of the issue as a question of fact or law. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1527-11\">There are good reasons to apply the statutory presumption of correctness to the trial court\u2019s resolution of these questions. First, the determination has been made only after an often extended <em>voir dire </em>proceeding designed specifically to identify biased veniremen. It is fair to assume that the method we have relied on since the beginning ... usually identifies bias. Second, the determination is essentially one of credibility, and therefore largely one of demeanor. As we have said on numerous occasions, the trial court\u2019s resolution of such questions is entitled, even on direct appeal, to \u201cspecial deference.\u201d ... The respect paid such findings in a habeas proceeding certainly should be no less.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1527-12\">\u2014 U.S. at-, 104 S.Ct. at 2892.</p>\n<p id=\"b1527-13\">These policies do not and never have applied to an assessment of the voluntariness of a confession. The task at hand is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>not an assessment of an individual\u2019s present state of mind. Rather, the issue is whether, during a past closed proceeding, an individual\u2019s will was overborne. This is not a determination of demeanor; it is not the case that the defendant testifies that his will was overborne, the officers testify that his will was not overborne, and the trial court, assessing their demeanor, finds who is telling the truth. The determination of voluntariness requires the drawing of inferences from past events and circumstances. Those circumstances and events, of course, are \u201cfacts\u201d \u2014 the \u201cexternal, \u2018phenomenological\u2019 occurrences and events surrounding the confession,\u201d as Justice Frankfurter put it. <em>Culombe, </em>367 U.S. at 603, 81 S.Ct. at 1879. But the inference whether the defendant\u2019s will was overborne is an independent conclusion. The fact-finder is not present during the giving of the confession. The defendant\u2019s voice is not heard. The interrogators\u2019 methods are not seen. The fact-finder seeks instead to reconstruct the defendant\u2019s mental state after developing a record. The reviewing court is as capable of drawing that inference from the cold facts as is the trial court. <em>Patton\u2019s </em>holding concerning juror bias, measured in court after a searching <em>voir dire, </em>consequently sheds no illumination on whether the voluntariness of a confession obtained during interrogation is an inference of fact or law. And <em>Patton\u2019s </em>admonition to attend to the purposes served by classification of an issue as \u201cfact\u201d or \u201claw\u201d detracts from the majority\u2019s position. The Supreme Court characterizes a confession\u2019s volun-tariness as an ultimate question of law because federal review over custodial police interrogation would be frustrated if the ultimate issue were a pure question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-4\">Thus, even if we were writing on a clean slate, <em>Patterson\u2019s </em>holding concerning <em>Miranda </em>waivers would not compel the same holding for voluntary confessions. Significantly different policies and circumstances pertain to these issues. But of course we are not writing on a clean slate. A half century of unwaivering Supreme Court precedent already compels the conclusion that the voluntariness of a confession is an ultimate issue of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-7\">Finally, I dissent from the majority\u2019s deference to a finding of \u201cfact\u201d that the New Jersey courts neither made nor purported to make. Applying the voluntary-confession doctrine, those courts treated their conclusion of voluntariness as one of law. The premise for deference under section 2254(d) to a state finding of fact is therefore altogether wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-8\">The state trial court made a number of findings of historical fact. For example, the court observed that Miller had been \u201cat the police barracks about almost two hours before this questioning started during which time I find from the testimony was not interrogated about this situation.\u201d Tr. at 145; <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra. </em>The court treated the issue of voluntariness, in contrast, as one of law. \u201cI think that the interview conducted by Detective Boyce meets the requirements of our law,\u201d the trial court held. Tr. at 146. \u201cI don\u2019t consider that the offers of help made by Detective Boyce were such that they ... overcame the will of the defendant which would make this confession involuntary.\u201d The court\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Puchalski, </em>45 N.J. 97, 100-01, 211 A.2d 370, 372 (1965), and <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 223-27, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2045-48, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973), clearly indicate that the trial court regarded this determination as a legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1528-9\">Similarly, in its unanimous reversal of the trial court, the New Jersey Appellate Division held that the trial court\u2019s conclusion was one of law. Under New Jersey law, the findings of the trial courts are binding on appeal unless they suffer, for example, from a \u201cmanifest lack of inherently credible evidence to support the finding, [or an] obvious overlooking or under evaluation of crucial evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 N.J. 146, 162, 199 A.2d 809, 818 (1964). Applying this standard, the Appellate Division sustained the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact. \u201c[T]he judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>found,\u201d the court held, \u201cin findings adequately supported by credible evidence in the whole record <em>(State v. Johnson, </em>42 N.J. 146, 199 A.2d 809 (1964)), that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given and in a timely manner.\u201d 76 N.J. at 413, 388 A.2d at 228. The Appellate Division did not, however, apply the <em>State v. Johnson </em>standard of appellate review to the trial court\u2019s conclusion of voluntariness. Rather, after reciting the trial court\u2019s conclusion of law, the Appellate Division held that \u201cWe are clearly persuaded of error in this determination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1529-5\">In like fashion, the New Jersey Supreme Court treated the trial court\u2019s conclusion as one of law. \u201cWe have no quarrel,\u201d that court held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1529-6\">with the legal principles expressed by the Appellate Division. We disagree, though, with its evaluation of the techniques and tactics used by the officer who questioned [the] defendant, as well as its conclusion that defendant\u2019s confession was involuntary in the constitutional sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1529-7\">76 N.J. at 402, 388 A.2d at 223. The dissent, in a discussion with which the majority did not take issue, was even more explicit. \u201cAs to the scope of appellate review,\u201d the dissenting opinion observed, \u201csince the issue is of constitutional dimension and is one of mixed fact-law, the reviewing court conducts a sweeping surveillance of the question practically the equivalent of <em>de novo </em>redetermination.\u201d 76 N.J. at 411-12, 388 A.2d at 228 (footnote omitted). In the case of \u201ccontested issues as to subordinate facts involving credibility of witnesses,\u201d the court added, \u201cdeference may be accorded any fact-findings thereon by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412 n. 1, 388 A.2d at 228 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1529-8\">Thus, all eleven New Jersey judges who reviewed this confession held that the determination of the voluntariness of Miller\u2019s confession is one of law. Yet in disregard of these legal conclusions, the majority today recharacterizes their holding as one of \u201cfact.\u201d Section 2254(d) does not require that we ignore the legal conclusions of the state courts in this fashion. That section provides that \u201ca determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue, made by a State court of competent jurisdiction ... shall be presumed to be correct\u201d unless one of the exceptions set forth in that section is established. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (1982). Because none of the state courts even purported to treat the ultimate question of voluntariness as one of fact, there is no basis for deferring to any such factual conclusion under section 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1529-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1529-11\">\u201cNothing that we write,\u201d as Justice Stevens has put it, \u201cno matter how well reasoned or forcefully expressed, can bring back. the victim of this tragedy ____\u201d <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 415, 97 S.Ct. 1232,1247, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring). But the tragic circumstances of the crime before us cannot diminish our respect for constitutional principle. A conviction obtained by a confession exacted by coercion, whether psychological or physical, violates due process. Miller\u2019s confession was the product of a will overborne by deceipt, trickery, and promises of help if only he would confess. Confess he did, in an overwrought physical state requiring medical attention. A confession extracted by these psychological ploys from a defendant of unstable mental disposition and childlike maturity after an intense grilling cannot be squared with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1529-14\">Rather than meet our responsibility to examine the voluntariness of Miller\u2019s confession independently, however, the majority characterizes this determination as a question of \u201cfact\u201d and purports to defer to state \u201cfindings\u201d on this issue \u2014 findings, of course, that were never made, for the New Jersey courts faithfully adhered to the Supreme Court\u2019s consistent holding that the voluntariness of a confession is an issue of law. The majority\u2019s decision is squarely inconsistent with almost half a century of Supreme Court precedent. We have no power to treat so cavalierly the reasoned decisions of some fifty Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>precedents; we certainly have no warrant for supposing that they have been overruled <em>sub silentio </em>by two summary per curiam dispositions of the Supreme Court addressing other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-4\">I cannot join in this judgment. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1512-8\">. The tape recording of the interrogation reveals that a telephone rang shortly before Miller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>asked whether Margolin had died. Boyce quickly fabricated a story that the caller informed him that Margolin had died moments earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-8\">In pretrial testimony Scott asserted that he did not \"discuss any aspect of the murder of Miss Deborah Margolin\u201d in the Barracks kitchen. Tr. at 58. In light of Miller\u2019s contemporary allusion on the tape to Scott\u2019s remark that Mar-golin \"was in the hospital,\" this testimony was not credible. The trial court found only that Miller \"was not interrogated\u201d during this period. Tr. at 145, a finding not inconsistent with the fact that Scott remarked to Miller that Margolin was in the hospital when the interrogation began. <em>See Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 299-303, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1688-91, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1513-22\">.
