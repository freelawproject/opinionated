The district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that Mrs. Cajigas had not filed administrative charges of discrimination within the statutory limitation period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-22\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the defendant, we must view the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and draw all rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>sonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>See, e.g., Hahn v. Sargent, </em>523 F.2d 461, 464 (1st Cir.19-75), <em>cert, denied, </em>425 U.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 1495, 47 L.Ed.2d 754 (1976); <em>Massaro v. Vernitron Corp., </em>559 F. Supp. 1068, 1073 (D.Mass.1983). Examined from such a perspective, the facts of this case are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In November 1978, Cajigas occupied the position of accountant in the Investment Division of the Banco de Ponce. At that time, she had worked for the bank for over four years and had been promoted twice. Her most recent promotion had been in December 1977, and since that time she had informed her superiors of her desire to be promoted to the position of manager. On November 22, 1978, the bank promoted a male co-worker, Mr. Sepulveda, to a manager\u2019s position within the Investment Division; on the same day the bank named Cajigas assistant manager of the Division.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Unhappy that Sepulveda had been made a manager and that she had not, Cajigas complained to the bank official in charge of the Investment Division. This official told her that the bank did not want any women, particularly married women,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in a managers position because the bank\u2019s clients preferred to deal with men at the executive level and because married women could not attend lunch and dinner meetings with clients and bank officials. In February 1979, a woman other than plaintiff was appointed as a manager in the investment department. Meanwhile and thereafter Ca-jigas complained to her supervisor \u201calmost everyday\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> about not being promoted. On March 27, 1979, she brought her complaint before higher bank officials. When the officials would not promote her to manager, she resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Cajigas met with one of the bank\u2019s vice-presidents, Alfredo Arroyo, on June 21, 1979. Arroyo offered her a manager\u2019s position, but he refused to guarantee that she would receive compensation and promotional opportunities equal to those afforded male employees. Arroyo also refused to give her back pay dating from the time of Sepulveda\u2019s promotion. Because of those refusals, Cajigas did not accept the bank\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">On July 6, 1979, her attorney mailed a letter to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) asserting that the Banco de Ponce had discriminated against Cajigas on the basis of her sex. On August 9, 1979, she filed a formal charge of discrimination with the Anti-Discrimination Unit (ADU) of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources, and she filed a formal charge with the EEOC on August 14. The ADU dismissed the charge on October 31, 1979. The EEOC terminated its evaluation of the charge and issued Cajigas a right-to-sue letter on September 2, 1980. She filed her complaint in the district court later that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">The bank filed a motion for summary judgment on April 23, 1981. The district court granted this motion in part,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but rejected the argument that' the action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Order of Feb. 25, 1982, Record vol. 1, doc. no. 33 (D.P.R.). On reconsideration of its partial denial of the motion, the district judge decided that the promotion of Sepulveda was the sole reason underlying the plaintiff\u2019s decision to resign on March 27, 1979; that the resignation, therefore, was a consequence of \u201cthat single discriminatory act\u201d; and that \u201c[t]he same [could] be said of the later offers of reemployment made by the defendant\u201d. Opinion and Order of July 8, 1983, Record vol. 1, doc. no. 41, at 6 (D.P.R.). Because Sepulveda\u2019s promotion occurred on November 22, 1978, the court held that the plaintiff\u2019s filings with the ADU and the EEOC on August 9, 1979, and August 14, 1979, respectively, were untimely. The court accordingly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ment and dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The sole issue on appeal is whether Caji-gas made a timely filing of administrative charges of discrimination. She raises a number of arguments in attacking the district court\u2019s holding that she did not file her charges within the relevant statutory period. Some of these arguments are irrelevant or have been waived; these we need not resolve. We address these arguments first. Then we discuss the plaintiff\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The plaintiff presents three arguments whose merits we need not address.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\"><em>First. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s brief expends much effort arguing, and the defendant\u2019s brief disputing, the question whether Puer-to Rico is a \u201cdeferral state\u201d \u2014 that is, a state<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> having a state or local agency to which the EEOC must initially defer admin-, istrative action. In a deferral state, a plaintiff must file her charge of discrimination with the appropriate state agency within 240 days of the last act of unlawful discrimination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In a nondeferral state, a plaintiff must file her charge with the EEOC within 180 days of the last act of unlawful discrimination. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) (1979). Cajigas argues that Puerto Rico is a deferral state and that the 240-day limit applies. The bank asserts that the plaintiff never presented this argument below and therefore cannot raise it now. At this point, the issue need not be determined.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If, as the plaintiff argues, the defendant discriminated against her either up to her resignation on March 27, 1979, or in connection with the reemployment offer in June 1979, the plaintiff\u2019s filing with the EEOC meets the (shorter) 180-day limit for nondeferral states. If, as the district court held, the only act of illegal discrimination against the plaintiff was the defendant\u2019s promotion of Sepulveda on November 22, 1978, the plaintiffs filing with the ADU does noT meet even the (longer) 240-day limit for deferral states. Thus, the deferral question is irrelevafl'fSt this point: The plaintiff\u2019s success on this appeal will be determined solely by 'her success in the arguments addressed ipH'ho next sectiorTorthis opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\"><em>Second. </em>Cajigas argues that the July 6,1979, letter to the EEOC constitutes a \u201cfiling\u201d for purposes of the statute of limitations. We decline to consider this argument. The plaintiff never filed this letter with the district court, and it is not part of the record. The plaintiff\u2019s pleadings and memoranda consistently refer to various dates between August 8 and August 14, 1979, as the EEOC filing date; they never mention the letter of July 6.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because this argument was neither raised in nor considered by the district court, we shall not address it for the first time on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>appeal. <em>See Greenwich Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association v. Fidelity Bond &amp; Mortgage Co., </em>714 F.2d 183, 184 (1st Cir. 1983); <em>Goldman v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>607 F.2d 1014, 1017 &amp; n.7 (1st Cir.1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>445 U.S. 929, 100 S.Ct. 1317, 63 L.Ed.2d 762 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><em>Third. </em>Cajigas argues that there is evidence that she did not learn of Sepulveda\u2019s promotion until sometime in December 1978, and that the applicable statute of limitations did not commence until the plaintiff received notice of the promotion. Again, this argument was not considered by the district court, and therefore cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. In fact, the bank asserted in its motion for summary judgment and in an affidavit that the plaintiff was notified of Sepulveda\u2019s promotion on November 24. The plaintiff\u2019s memorandum in opposition to the motion does not controvert this fact, and indeed seems to accept it. The fact must therefore be accepted as true for the purposes of ruling on the motion for summary judgment. <em>See Melanson v. Caribou Reefers, Ltd., </em>667 F.2d 213, 214 (1st Cir.1981) (per curiam); <em>Morton v. Browne, </em>438 F.2d 1205, 1206 (1st Cir.1971) (per curiam).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In addition to the arguments discussed in Section A, the plaintiff asserts three reasons that the district court should not have granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. First, Cajigas argues that the defendant committed an act of unlawful discrimination when, in June 1979, it refused to give her back pay and to guarantee equal treatment if she would return to work. Second, Cajigas argues that the applicable limitation period should be tolled because of her efforts to work out a voluntary conciliation with the defendant. Third, she argues that she was the victim of the defendant\u2019s discriminatory promotion policy, not only in November 1978 but also thereafter when defendant again refused to appoint her to available managerial positions for which she was qualified.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We reject the first two arguments, but agree with the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s first two contentions can be quickly dismissed. First, Cajigas has not alleged any facts showing that the bank\u2019s refusal to offer equal pay and to guarantee equal promotional opportunities constituted different treatment from that afforded males in similar situations. There is no basis, therefore, for finding this action to be a violation in itself rather than a subsequent effect of the allegedly discriminatory failure to promote. <em>See United Airlines v. Evans, </em>431 U.S. 553, 558, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 1889, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977). The plaintiff\u2019s second argument is foreclosed by <em>Delaware State College v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980), which held squarely that \u201cthe pend-ency of a grievance, or some other method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>of collateral review of an employment decision, does not toll the running of the limitations period\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 261, 101 S.Ct. at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">According to Cajigas, the bank maintained a policy of discriminating against women, especially married ones, with regard to promotions to executive positions. Cajigas asserts that, from December 1977 until the day of her resignation, she attempted to obtain a promotion to manager but was denied one because of the discriminatory policy. That another woman was made a manager in February 1979 and that plaintiff was offered a position as manager in June 1979 are some indication that manager positions were open. She contends that this policy was a continuing violation of title VII, and that it operated against her until she resigned. Thus, she concludes, the statutory time limitation began to run with her resignation on March 27, 1979. The bank argues in response that, as the district court held, the only act of alleged unlawful discrimination of which the plaintiff complains is the promotion in November 1978 of Sepulveda rather than the .plaintiff. Her failure to obtain a promotion during the following four months and her eventual resignation were, according to the bank, only continuing <em>effects </em>of the promotion of Sepulveda. On this record, plaintiffs theory is plausible, and thus, at this preliminary stage, we must reject defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">As the defendant observes, a court evaluating a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d argument must distinguish between a continuing violation and the continuing effects of a prior, yet discrete and no longer existent, discriminatory act. This lesson is taught primarily by two decisions of the Supreme Court: <em>United Airlines v. Evans, </em>431 U.S. 553, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977), and <em>Delaware State College v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980). In <em>Evans </em>the plaintiff, a female flight attendant, was grounded in 1968 because of the defendant airline\u2019s \u201cno marriage\u201d policy, a policy later found discriminatory in a lawsuit brought by other female flight attendants. United rehired Evans in 1972 but, in conformity with the airline\u2019s seniority system, refused to credit her with the seniority that had accrued to her before 1968. Evans filed a charge with the EEOC in February 1973. The Supreme Court held this filing untimely, rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the defendant had engaged in continuing discrimination by refusing to credit the plaintiff for pre-1968 seniority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap\">\u201cRespondent emphasizes the fact that she has alleged a <em>continuing </em>violation. United\u2019s seniority system does indeed have an impact on her pay and fringe benefits. But the emphasis should not be placed on mere continuity; the critical question is whether any present <em>violation </em>exists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">431 U.S. at 558, 97 S.Ct. at 1889. Because United\u2019s seniority system operated in a facially neutral manner, the Court concluded that there was no present violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The plaintiff in <em>Ricks </em>was a foreign black professor whom the defendant university denied tenure in March 1974, allegedly for discriminatory reasons. In accordance with its usual procedure, the university offered Ricks a one-year \u201cterminal\u201d contract, which was to expire in June 1975. Ricks accepted the offer.. In April 1975, he filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. The Supreme Court held that this filing was not timely. It reasoned that the denial of tenure was the only act of alleged discrimination, and that the eventual termination of employment was \u201ca delayed, but inevitable, consequence of the denial of tenure\u201d. 449 U.S. at 257-58, 101 S.Ct. at 503-04. The Court stressed that the proper focus is upon the time of the discriminatory <em>act, </em>not the time .at which the consequences of that act are felt. <em>Id. </em>at 258,101 S.Ct. at 504; <em>accord Chardon v. Fernandez, </em>454 U.S. 6, 8, 102 S.Ct. 28, 29, 70 L.Ed.2d 6 (1980) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">The district court brought the present case within the doctrine of <em>Evans </em>and <em>Ricks </em>by concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s resignation on March 27, 1979, was a consequence of the defendant\u2019s promotion of Se-pulveda rather than the plaintiff on November 22, 1978. We disagree. Were it the case that Sepulveda\u2019s promotion foreclosed plaintiff from being promoted \u2014 say, had Sepulveda secured the only available opening as manager and there simply were no manager positions available either on March 27, 1979 when plaintiff met with management and, before resigning, once again urged her promotion or at some earlier point within the limitations period proceeding plaintiff\u2019s August filing \u2014 then the failure of plaintiff to receive a promotion after November 22, 1978 would in fact be merely the result of the prior act of alleged discrimination, and <em>Ricks </em>and <em>Evans </em>would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>apply. But, there are indications in the record that other slots may have been open during the limitations period \u2014 such as the one another woman filled at some point in February 1979 \u2014 or that promotion was not necessarily dependent upon a vacancy being created by another\u2019s departure but rather could be bestowed upon meritorious performance. Thus, on the present record, we cannot say plaintiff\u2019s action is foreclosed by <em>Evans.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">As did the district court, the defendants rely heavily on <em>Goldman v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>607 F.2d 1014 (1st Cir.1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>445 U.S. 929, 100 S.Ct. 1317, 63 L.Ed.2d 762 (1980). In <em>Goldman, </em>the plaintiff had been demoted to a lower-paying position in 1975. He filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC in July 1976. In opposition to a motion to dismiss because of untimely filing, the plaintiff argued that during 1976 he had made repeated- requests to be transferred back to his former position. The Court of Appeals held that this allegation did not save the plaintiff\u2019s suit. <em>Goldman </em>does not undermine the plaintiff\u2019s position, for deficiencies present in <em>Goldman </em>are absent here. In <em>Goldman, </em>it had not been alleged when the refusals to retransfer occurred or whether any position had been open when the refusals were made. 607 F.2d at 1018-1019. Here, in contrast, there is some indication that positions as manager were open in February and March when plaintiff continued to press for promotion, and thus plaintiff\u2019s action is timely with respect to at least the alleged discriminatory refusal to promote plaintiff to an available executive position for which she was qualified occurring within 180 (or 240, as the case may be \u2014 we leave the matter to be determined in the first instance by the district court) days of the filing of her administrative complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The harder question is whether plaintiff may continue to litigate with respect to actions occurring outside the 180 or 240 day limitations period. This circuit has yet to rule squarely on this issue, and we prefer not to do so in the absence of a concrete factual situation. Had plaintiff ceased her employment in November 1978 after Se-pulveda, rather than she, was named manager but had not filed her complaint until August, it would be clear her action would not be timely as to the November event. Why plaintiff\u2019s continued employment and subsequent denial of promotion should make the November event now actionable is questionable, and at least one member of the panel doubts whether the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d theory should operate to allow recovery with respect to a distinct act of discrimination taking place at an identifiable point of time outside the limitations period.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It may be that the continuing violation theory is more appropriately limited to a situation where there is no single act of discrimination sufficient to trigger the running of the limitations period. <em>See generally Valles Velazquez v. Chardon, </em>736 F.2d 831 at 833 (1st Cir.1984) (discussing continuing violation theory). Possibly such a situation might occur were promotions not made necessarily in the context of competition for a specific slot vacant by reason of say death or resignation, but rather were bestowed irregularly from time to time based on meritorious performance and, though it would be difficult to pinpoint any particular date at which advancement should have occurred, after the passage of time it becomes apparent that plaintiff, due to discrimination, is not on the same promotion track as others.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Where in the continuum the present case fits we do not know. The record is not sufficiently developed, and the parties have not sufficiently focused on the matter. Because, as we have concluded, plaintiff\u2019s action is timely at least with respect to the allegedly discriminatory refusal to promote her in March, the judgment of dismissal must be reversed and the case remanded. On remand, the parties will have a further opportunity to argue the appropriate contours of plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">' <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">MEMORANDUM AND ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"aze-dedup-0\">On Rehearing</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">In moving for rehearing, appellee argues the present record would not support a finding either that managerial positions for which plaintiff was qualified were open or that, despite the absence of an open slot, promotion during that period was still possible. The record is murky with respect to these matters, for, in moving for summary judgment, appellee did not directly focus on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>them. Yet, whether other managerial slots for which plaintiff was qualified were open or whether, absent a vacancy, a promotion might nevertheless be bestowed due to, say, meritorious performance were issues material to the question whether plaintiffs action was timely. It was appellee\u2019s burden in moving for summary judgment to show that no genuine issue of material fact with respect to timeliness existed. This appellee did not do and consequently we vacated the summary judgment. In so doing we of course did not resolve this factual issue one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Appellee also argues that even if plaintiff\u2019s action is timely, the evidence is insufficient to establish sex discrimination. The district court granted summary judgment on timeliness grounds. It did not rule on the substantive merit of plaintiff\u2019s case, and hence, on appeal, we do not do so. Appellee\u2019s substantive arguments should be considered in the first instance by the district court. Vacation of the summary judgment in no way reflects our determination one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\n<em>Motion for rehearing denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-13\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (1979).

The defendant is apparently of the view that the plaintiff cannot make this argument now because she did not allege it in her complaint. That view misconstrues the purpose of the complaint in federal litigation. Under the concept of notice pleading, a complaint need not clearly articulate the precise legal theories upon which the plaintiff bases her right to recovery. The complaint must simply \" \u2018give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff\u2019s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests\u2019 \u2019\u2019. <em>Baldwin County Welcome Center v. </em>Brown,_U.S._,_n. 3, 104 S.Ct. 1723, 1725 n. 3, 80 L.Ed.2d 196 (1984) (quoting <em>Conley v.

The plaintiff in the present case put her continuing violation theory before the district court when the court considered the defendant\u2019s motions for summary judgment.
