Samuels was specifically mentioned in three counts, and Newell in two.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">The first count of the indictment charges that Samuels and Newell conspired with several people, some known, others not, to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (1982). The indictment also alleges that Newell used a telephone to facilitate the heroin conspiracy, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b), by obtaining the telephone number of one of his drug customers. Finally, Samuels is charged in two counts with using a telephone on certain dates to facilitate the conspiracy by discussing possible exchanges of heroin for cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-17\">After a bench trial, Samuels and Newell were convicted of the .various crimes for which they had been indicted. The evidence presented by both sides consisted principally of recordings of a number of telephone conversations as well as a series of stipulations. The government\u2019s only witness was Lawrence Kutney, an undercover narcotics agent with, the Pennsylvania Department of Justice. Kutney interpreted the telephone conversations that were introduced into evidence and provided expert testimony as to the nature of illicit drug traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-18\">At trial, Samuels and Newell admitted that they were friends of the principal conspirator, Anthony DeAngelis, and that they were occasional drug users.- They argued, however, that use is not a federal crime and, in any event, that the purchase of drugs is not enough to tie them to a conspiracy to distribute heroin as set forth in the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-19\">Although we are mindful of the deference that should be shown to the determinations by the district court, we are also aware of our obligation to review those determinations on the basis of the evidence presented at trial. Having examined that evidence and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the government, <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), we have serious doubts- that the government has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Samuels and Newell were implicated in the crimes for which they were convicted. We will, therefore, reverse the conviction of Newell on all counts and reverse the conviction of Samuels on the facilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>counts. We will, however, affirm Samuels\u2019 conviction and sentence for conspiring to distribute heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"A-Y\">I</p>\n<p id=\"AXx\">The determination of guilt rests initially with the trier-of-fact, who ordinarily hears the evidence \u201clive\u201d and can make those judgments of credibility implicit in the final decision on the basis of first-hand observation of the witness\u2019 demeanor and manner. That does not mean, however, that a district court\u2019s verdict must be affirmed in all . \u25a0 nl . circumstances, especially, as m this case, , , , , , , ,. when our natural reluctance to question the sometimes subtle judgments a trial judge must make is tempered by the fact that the record consists almost exclusively of transcribed conversations. Although we do not lightly overturn a judge\u2019s finding, we do so here in fulfilling our responsibility to \u201cguard against dilution of the principle that guilt is to be established by probative evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Williams, 425 </em>U.S. 501, 503, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 1692, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"A9Jo\">^</p>\n<p id=\"ags-dedup-0\">Count 38 charges that on October 20, 1981, Newell used a telephone to facilitate a conspiracy to distribute heroin by obtaining the telephone number of a drug customer, identified by the government at trial and in its brief on appeal as Mr. John Carlo. The evidence introduced at trial to support this charge consisted of a tape-recorded telephone conversation intercepted by a court-authorized wiretap on a phone frequently used by DeAngelis, the \u201chub\u201d of the conspiracy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqT\">The transcript of the recorded conversations shows that on October 20, Newell used DeAngelis\u2019 phone to call his own home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> App. 95-96. An unidentified male, whom Newell calls \u201cJim,\u201d answers the phone and tells Newell that someone has been looking for him. In the government\u2019s version of the transcript, that someone -is called \u201cJohn Carlo;\u201d in Newell\u2019s version, \u201cGiancarlo.\u201d When Newell asks Jim to 1\u00b0ok UP a nu\u2122ber wber,e J\u00b0hn iiCarl\u00b0 ,or Giancarlo can be reached, Newell-,n the governments eyes-has committed a c\u2122ae: he has used a teulePhone facilitate \"0nspiraCy by obta\u2122mS tbe namber \u00b0f his customer John Carlo. Other ?an transcnpt of this phone conversar tion, the government produced no evidence ; , . , <em>L </em>to support this charge,</p>\n<p id=\"AKC\">_ At trial, it was explained without contradiction that Newell lived with someone called \u201cGiancarlo Fontenot.\u201d Newell presented voter registration records to show that such a person resides at the same address as Newell. App. 197-98, 213-14. He also presented telephone comPany records showing that the first number be called is listed at the residence of Giancarl\u00b0 Fontenot and that the number Jim gave Newell was subscribed to by Giovanni Fontenot, Giancarlo\u2019s father. App. 197, 213. The transcripts show that Newell called that number moments after he spoke with Jim App 9g&gt; 2i5. Newell asserted that the woman who answered his call is Giancarlo\u2019s mother. In any event, when Newell identifies himself and asks for Giancarlo, the woman explains that Giancarlo has just left. She corrects Newell\u2019s use 0f ^he phrase \u201cBuon Giorno\u201d (sic), and he explains that \u201che\u2019ll try to find him [Giancarlo] at home.\u201d Half an hour later Newell makes a second call to his own home. When queried, Jim explains that \u00abhe\u201d has not called back. App. 216. Ne-well replies: \u201cOkay when he calls, tell him I\u2019ll be home by 11:00 or 11:30.\u201d The entire conversation consists of nine sentences or fragments of sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>No other evidence supports or even bears upon the charge that Newell used a communication device to obtain the telephone number of a drug customer, John Carlo. The government has not borne its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Newell is guilty of this crime. No evidence has been adduced to show that Fontenot is engaged in drug-trafficking. The government may not simply refer, as it did at oral argument, to the conversation in which Newell tried to obtain the number of his drug customer, \u201cMr. Carlo,\u201d as evidence to support this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"ACu\">Newell was also found guilty of acting in furtherance of a conspiracy to distribute heroin. To support this conviction, the prosecution cites <em>United States v. Provenzano, </em>620 F.2d 985 (3d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>449 U.S. 899, 101 S.Ct. 267, 66 L.Ed.\u00c9d 129 (1980), for the proposition that \u201c[o]nce the government has proven the existence of a conspiracy, slight evidence is sufficient to connect a defendant with it.\u201d Government\u2019s Brief at 11. We find no support in <em>Provenzano </em>for that positibn or for the notion that in a conspiracy trial the government is relieved of the traditional burden of proving every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1072, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970); <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>567 F.2d 252 (3d.Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"Aib\">To support Newell\u2019s conviction for conspiraey to distribute heroin, the prosecution points to two items of evidence. The first is Newell\u2019s use of the telephone to obtain the number of his alleged drug customer, \u201cJohn Carlo.\u201d That conversation proves as little with regard to the conspiracy charge as it does with regard to the facilitation charge. The second piece of evidence, however, is more equivocal,</p>\n<p id=\"ATI\">On October 12\u2019 Newe11 rePorts m a Phone conversation with DeAngelis that smce this last one&gt;1 Sot lots of&gt; ah&gt; flak\u201d APP- 'Dm context of Newell s remark does not reveal what the last one is, but DeAngelis replies: Yeah, well, it shouldn\u2019t be time. At trial, in its brief, and at ora^ argument, the prosecution contended that Newell and DeAngelis were referring to an earlier cocaine transaction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If this is so&gt; bbe conversation of October 12th cannot be taken as evidence of Newell s conspiring distribute heroin. There is no doubt that conversation may point to some other crime, but it is not proof of the crime alleged. As Chief Justice Marshall remarked in a different context, \u201c[t]he rule a man shall not be charged with one crime, and convicted of another, may sometimes cover real guilt, but its observance is essential to the preservation of innocence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>The Schooner Hoppet v. United States, </em>11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 244, 247, 3 L.Ed. 380 (1813).</p>\n<p id=\"aqe-dedup-0\">C</p>\n<p id=\"A8U\">Samuels has also been convicted of using a telephone to facilitate a conspiracy to distribute heroin. Counts 29 and 39 allege that Samuels spoke to DeAngelis on two specific occasions to discuss \u201ca possible exchange of heroin for cocaine.\u201d At trial, the government offered the transcript of two telephone conversations to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>these charges. In the first, Samuels learns that DeAngelis has acquired some heroin and arranges a visit. DeAngelis asks Sam-uels to bring along a pack of cigarettes and \u201cthree rolls\u201d of something he describes by using, according to Agent Kutney (App. 169), street slang for marijuana.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The prosecution asserts that this conversation proves beyond a reasonable doubt that Samuels used a telephone to facilitate a conspiracy to distribute heroin by discussing a possible exchange of heroin for cocaine. At trial, Samuels maintained that this was but one of several instances in which he exchanged small amounts of marijuana for small amounts of heroin that he and DeAngelis would sometimes consume together.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">As evidence for the second facilitation charge, the government proffered the transcript of one conversation. On October 14, DeAngelis called Samuels and explained that he has gotten what Samuels had asked about earlier \u2014 his \u201cmale friend.\u201d App. 64. It was uncontradicted at trial that the term, \u201cmale friend,\u201d referred to heroin. DeAngelis responded by suggesting that \u201c[I]\u2019ll trade ya.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> App. 64. Agent Kutney testified that the trade DeAngelis envisioned was heroin for some marijuana. App. 168-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">It is difficult to see how these conversations and the testimony describing them can support beyond a reasonable doubt two felony convictions for the crimes alleged in the indictment. The prosecution argues that \u201cSamuels\u2019 admission that he traded marijuana for heroin ... is basically dispositive of the issues raised with respect to the two telephone counts.\u201d Government\u2019s Brief at 19. We cannot agree that such an admission would support an indictment charging that on certain dates Samu-els \u201cdid knowingly and intentionally use a ... telephone in facilitating a ... conspiracy to distribute heroin ... [by] discussing] a possible exchange of heroin for cocaine.\u201d App. 7, 9 (Counts 29 and 39). <em>See supra </em>note 6. An accused cannot be convicted of a crime alleged in an indictment by virtue of proof that he committed some other offense. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>599 F.2d 880, 888 (9th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. White, </em>569 F.2d 263, 268 (5th Cir.1978) (the \u201csubstance involved in the transaction must be the same illegal substance alleged in the indictment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">The concern that prompts us to reverse Samuels\u2019 convictions for facilitation is grounded not only in the insubstantiality of the evidence the government adduces to support the charges specified in the indictment, but also in the difference between the conversations DeAngelis has with Sam-uels and those he has with other indicted co-conspirators. The latter clearly reveal actual drug transactions between persons who are intent on doing illicit drug business.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> DeAngelis does not have to prompt these people so that they realize what he is talking about in code, and what he is talking about is always clear, at least given Agent Kutney\u2019s expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">There is some tendency in conspiracy cases for finders-of-fact to believe that a defendant must have been involved in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>conspiracy, once evidence has been presented of some questionable acts the prosecution contends are but an extension of the larger conspiracy. Under our system of law, however, guilt must remain personal and individual, and a conviction, especially on charges relating to a conspiracy, must rest on individual guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 9 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). We cannot find such proof for any of the charges discussed so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The evidence the prosecution has brought forward to implicate Samuels in the conspiracy is more persuasive. On October 12, alleged co-conspirator Friedman tells DeAngelis that if DeAngelis needs cash, Friedman will have Samuels give DeAngelis the money Samuels owes Friedman.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> App. 36-37. The next day Samuels calls DeAngelis and explains that he was \u201csupposed to drop something off.\u201d App. 52. The government alleges that this something was the money' Samuels had agreed to pass on to DeAngelis and that Samuels knew that the cash would be used to fund a drug deal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Viewing this conversation in the light most favorable to the government, as we are required to do on a motion after a guilty verdict, a trier-of-fact could reasonably conclude that on this occasion Samuels knowingly acted in furtherance of the conspiracy. Samuels knew that DeAngelis sold controlled substances, and he was sufficiently acquainted with Friedman to have owed him a substantial sum of money. Consequently, we believe that sufficient evidence had been presented at trial to link Friedman with the conspiracy and to support the inference that Samuels knew of this link.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgments of conviction against Newell will be reversed, along with the judgments of conviction against Samuels on the charges of using a telephone on certain dates to facilitate a conspiracy to distribute heroin. Samuels\u2019 conviction on the conspiracy charge will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">At trial the government produced the following transcription to prove that Newell had used a telephone to obtain the number of a drug customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">DLE-81-047 Tape T14, Log # 36</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">DATE: 20 October 1981 TIME: 2140-2142 OUTGOING CALL: TO 386-4922<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> JIM LNU: Hello.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">John NEWELL: Jim?</p>\n<p id=\"b637-18\">JIM: Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-19\">NEWELL: Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-20\">JIM: Hi.
