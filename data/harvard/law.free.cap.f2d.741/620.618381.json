Byrnes, et al., trustees of the Western Pennsylvania Teamsters and Employers Pension Fund, and W.F. Hardy, et al., trustees of the Western Pennsylvania Teamsters and Motor Carriers Fund (the Funds), appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. They contend that the court erred in rejecting their requests that it apply a six-year statute of limitations and that it toll the applicable statute of limitations. Defendant, DeBolt Transfer, Inc. (DeBolt), a freight carrier, cross-appeals from the same judgment in which the court found it liable to plaintiffs for the sum of approximately $185,000. We affirm in part and reverse in part, and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-23\">Beginning in 1973, DeBolt agreed in a series of collective bargaining and trust agreements to make regular contributions, to the Funds on behalf of a wide range of employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The payments it subsequently made were by means of a self-reporting system: when the Funds sent it the monthly invoices, DeBolt would adjust them, list the names of those individuals on whose behalf it contributed, and return the invoices to the Funds with the tendered payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-24\">In the middle of 1980, the Funds instituted an audit of DeBolt\u2019s records pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the audit program authorized by the agreements. Based on both information uncovered by a preliminary audit and DeBolt\u2019s denial of access to employment records, the Funds\u2019 trustees brought suit on October 24, 1980, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>and the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 <em>et seq., </em>alleging that DeBolt had systematically failed to contribute on behalf of an entire range of individuals for whom the agreements provided that it contribute. On stipulated facts, the district court on June 30, 1983 entered summary judgment for plaintiffs with regard to each of the categories of employees for which they claimed defendant had wrongfully failed to contribute \u2014 non-union owner-operators, fleet owners, owner-operators at the Neville Island operation, and individuals who had worked less than 1,000 hours. The district court also held, however, that any payment that should have been made prior to three years before the date on which the suit had been filed could not be recovered because of the three-year statute of limitations in the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law, Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 43, \u00a7 260.9a(g) (Purdon 1983). The district court also concluded that the undisputed facts did not justify tolling the statute of limitations. It entered summary judgments for the Pension Fund in the amount of $149,378.78 and for the Welfare Fund in the amount of $35,252.78. As noted above, each side appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Defendant first contends that, under section 202 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052, it need not have made contributions to the pension fund on behalf of employees until they worked 1,000 hours in a twelve month period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court properly rejected this untenable argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">The district court correctly noted that the 1,000 hour requirement has nothing to do with DeBolt\u2019s obligations in this case. That requirement merely establishes a statutory minimum after which pension rights begin to vest in employees. The requirement in no way purports to super-cede the contracts entered into between the parties under which DeBolt agreed to contribute pursuant to the appropriate collective bargaining agreements on behalf of individuals who work beyond the thirty-day probationary period. <em>See Talarico v. United Furniture Workers Pension Fund, </em>479 F.Supp. 1072, 1082 (D.Neb.1979). Accordingly, the court properly granted summary judgment on the 1,000 hour issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">Defendant next contends that the district court erred in concluding that defendant\u2019s obligation to contribute under applicable collective bargaining agreements applied equally to union and non-union owner-operators. It claims that the agreements, as a matter of fact, do not extend to non-union drivers and, as a matter of law, may not extend to non-union drivers. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">The district court properly found that, on their face, the collective bargaining agreements at issue here plainly contradict DeBolt's contention that it never incurred an obligation to contribute on behalf of non-union owner-operators. Article 40(2)(a) of the Eastern Conference Area Iron &amp; Steel Rider defines employees under the agreements to be \u201cany driver, chauffeur or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>driver-helper operating a truck, tractor ... or any other vehicle____\u201d Article 40(2)(c) and Article 55(4) likewise state that \u201chired or leased equipment shall be operated by an employee of the certificated or permitted carrier.\u201d In sum, these provisions of the collective bargaining agreements negate DeBolt\u2019s contentions that it was obligated to contribute only on behalf of union employees. The defendant can point to no provision in any of the agreements that supports its claim that only union members were to receive the benefits of DeBolt\u2019s contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The absence of any distinction in the agreements between union and non-union members can be easily explained: the law does not permit such a distinction. Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a0n-dedup-0\">It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer \u2014 by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The Supreme Court made clear in <em>Radio Officers\u2019 Union v. NLRB, </em>347 U.S. 17, 39-42, 74 S.Ct. 323, 335-337, 98 L.Ed. 455 (1954), that section 8(a)(3) meant precisely what it said: an employer may not encourage or discourage union membership by means of discrimination. The district court found that DeBolt\u2019s practice of making contributions to the Funds on behalf of union members only will encourage union membership. Not even DeBolt disputes this observation. Accordingly, section 8(a)(3) prohibits such a practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">On appeal, DeBolt seems to recognize the futility of claiming that it may contribute only on behalf of union owner-operators. Thus, it seeks to subtly shift the trappings of its argument, contending that it incurred no obligation to contribute on behalf of non-union owner-operators because non-union owner-operators are not \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of the collective bargaining agreements. Such an argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">As noted above, Article 40(2)(c) of the Iron &amp; Steel Rider specifically sets forth the employees covered by the agreement. With regard to hired or leased equipment, the agreement provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-11\">In all cases, hired or leased equipment <em>shall be operated by an employee of the certificated or permitted carrier. </em>The Employer expressly reserves the right to control the manner, means and details of and by which the owner-operator performs his services, as well as the ends to be accomplished. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcJ\">Article 55(4), the provision devoted to owner-operators, repeats verbatim the conditions of Article 40. Now, however, DeBolt contends that non-union owner-operators are <em>not </em>employees because DeBolt simply does <em>not </em>exercise control over them. In short, DeBolt asks us to relieve it of its obligations under a series of collective bargaining agreements, resorting to subtle and specious reasoning. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">DeBolt places great weight on <em>Todd v. Benal Concrete Construction Co., </em>710 F.2d 581 (9th Cir.1983). In <em>Todd, </em>defendant Benal, a construction company, had obligated itself in a collective bargaining agreement to treat owner-operator ditch trenchers as employees and thus to contribute on their behalf to four trust funds. Benal subsequently failed to make such contributions. The Ninth Circuit permitted Benal to get out from under its contractual obligation because it concluded that, under the common law agency test adopted by that court, the unregulated ditch trenching operations at issue there demonstrated that those owner-operators were in fact independent contractors rather than employees, regardless of the contractual provision to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">Whatever the merits of the <em>Todd v. Be-nal </em>approach, we decline to extend the principle of that case to cover the undisputed facts before us. As noted above, De-Bolt agreed that \u201call ... hired or leased equipment shall be operated by an employee of [DeBolt].\u201d It likewise agreed that it \u201creserves the right to control the manner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>means and details of and by which the owner-operator performs his services.\u201d In his deposition, John DeBolt, II, the president of DeBolt, admitted each of these facts. He also acknowledged that under regulations of the Public Utility Commission of Pennsylvania and the Interstate Commerce Commission DeBolt is <em>required </em>as a certificated carrier to have exclusive control of the equipment leased by its owner-operators.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">In sum, DeBolt agreed in its collective bargaining agreements with the Teamsters Union to classify the owner-operators at issue here as employees. It agreed that it controlled the activities of such owner-operators. It agreed to contribute to the Funds on their behalf. It may not now argue that such individuals are <em>not </em>employees, <em>not </em>subject to DeBolt\u2019s control, and that De-Bolt is <em>not </em>required to make contributions in their behalf. The court properly entered summary judgment for the Funds on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">For essentially the same reasons that apply to the owner-operators, the class of sixteen unidentified individuals grouped by the parties under the category of \u201cfleet owners\u201d (more accurately called \u201cfleet drivers\u201d) is entitled to contributions on its behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">To repeat, DeBolt agreed that \u201chired or leased equipment shall be operated by an employee of [DeBolt].\u201d It likewise agreed to make contributions to the Funds on behalf of such drivers. Due in large measure to DeBolt\u2019s lack of cooperation, the Auditor could not determine who actually drove the tractor-trailers leased to DeBolt by fleet owners. The parties thus used the term \u201cfleet owners\u201d as a concise way of referring to such <em>drivers. </em>Contrary to DeBolt\u2019s contention, neither the Funds nor the district court has ever suggested that the collective bargaining agreements obligate DeBolt to make contributions on behalf of the equipment owners themselves. With respect to the drivers of such equipment, however, the district court properly granted summary judgment for the Funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Throughout this litigation, the Funds have contended that DeBolt owes contributions on behalf of those workers at the Neville Island operation. Not surprisingly, DeBolt has steadfastly maintained that Ne-ville Island has nothing to do with the collective bargaining agreements at issue here and that it therefore owes no such contributions. The district court agreed with the Funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">The collective bargaining agreements provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-13\">In no event will a separate division, terminal or facility be established that is not covered by the terms of the National Master Freight Agreement and the Appropriate Area Supplements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">DeBolt claims that its connections with Ne-ville Island are too tenuous to bring that operation within the scope of this provision. It claims that, in exchange for a percentage of the revenue, it merely permits a commissioned agent to use its (DeBolt\u2019s) Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) rights to solicit freight and haulers. The district court labeled this \u201ca subterfuge operation ... established by DeBolt to avoid its contractual contributory obligations to the [Funds].\u201d This may be so. As it stands, however, nothing in the record supports this harsh allegation. It is not uncommon for carriers to lease ICC rights with the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1181.26. Because the record on the Neville Island issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>is so hazy, however, we remand to the district court with direction to reexamine that operation and to make more detailed factual findings and a clearer explanation as to how it reached its result.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In their appeal, the Funds assert that the district court erred in holding that (a) the three-year statute of limitations governed the action and (b) the undisputed facts did not justify tolling the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Because neither the LMRA nor ERISA contains an explicit limitation period with regard to actions such as this, federal courts must determine the timeliness of the suit by reference to the most appropriate statute of limitations of the state in which the action arose. <em>International Union v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp., </em>383 U.S. 696, 705, 86 S.Ct. 1107, 1113, 16 L.Ed.2d 192 (1966). Eleven days prior to oral argument in the case <em>sub judice, </em>another panel of this court decided that, when a Fund sues to recover unpaid contributions to employee benefit trust funds, the three-year statute of limitations contained in Pennsylvania\u2019s Wage Payment and Collection Law, Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 43, \u00a7 260.-9a(g) (Purdon 1983), governs the action. <em>Teamsters Pension Trust Fund v. John Tinney Delivery Service, Inc., </em>732 F.2d 319 (3d Cir.1984). On appeal, the Funds have devoted much effort toward persuading us that the <em>Tinney </em>court failed to make the proper inquiry and thus reached an unfortunate result. They contend that because they allege violations of the collective bargaining agreement, the district court should have applied the six-year limitations statute governing an action on a written contract. 42 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 5527(2) (Purdon 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Whatever the merits of this position, the policies of our court dictate that no subsequent panel, but only the <em>in banc </em>court, may overrule the reported opinion of a previous panel. <em>See </em>Internal Operating Procedures Chapter 8C (\u201c... [RJeported panel opinions are binding on subsequent panels---- Court <em>in banc </em>consideration is required to overrule a published opinion of this court.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court in this case did not err in applying the shorter limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">Throughout this litigation, the Funds have contended that the search for the proper statute of limitations may ultimately prove beside the point because such statute did not begin to run until the completion of the compliance audit in early 1981. In a brief discussion of the issue of tolling under Pennsylvania law, the district court rejected the contention and refused to toll the statute. We believe that the issue should be reexamined by the district court on remand, at which time the district court will have the opportunity to further develop the factual record and integrate such findings with the relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-15\">In recent years, other courts have encountered the tolling question in situations similar to that faced here by the district court. In <em>Seymour v. Hull &amp; Moreland Engineering, </em>418 F.Supp. 190 (C.D.Cal. 1976), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>605 F.2d 1105 (9th Cir.1979), trustees of health and welfare and pension funds brought suit against an employer obligated under a collective bargaining agreement to make payments by means of a self-reporting system, alleging <em>inter alia </em>that the employer had failed to make contributions on behalf of certain employees. Holding for the funds on most of the elements of their claim, the court, applying California law, concluded that \u201cno portion of plaintiffs\u2019 claims are [sic] barred by the statute of limitations\u201d because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-16\">The statute of limitations was tolled until plaintiffs obtained knowledge of the facts upon which their cause of action is based. The tolling was caused by defendants\u2019 breach of the trust and confidence plaintiffs placed in defendants to report hours and pay contributions required by the Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-17\">418 F.Supp. at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-18\">A similar situation unfolded in <em>Bugher v. Consolidated X-Ray Service Corp., </em>515 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>F.Supp. 1180, <em>aff'd, </em>705 F.2d 1426 (5th Cir. 1983). Trustees of health and welfare and pension funds brought suit against an employer likewise obligated under a collective bargaining agreement to make payments to the funds by means of a self-reporting system. As in <em>Seymour, </em>the funds in <em>Bugher </em>alleged that the employer had underreported and thus failed to contribute as much as it owed. The court agreed with the funds. Accordingly, it concluded that under Texas law such conduct by the employer served to toll the applicable statute of limitations, permitting the funds to recover all contributions that the employer had failed to make. 515 F.Supp. at 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The district court\u2019s discussion of the tolling issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>gives no indication that previous courts have struggled with the identical issue and concluded that tolling may represent the appropriate course of action. Instead, the district court merely cites several recent cases that discuss the Pennsylvania law of tolling in cases having little in common with the case at <em>bar </em>\u2014 Gee <em>v. CBS, Inc., </em>471 F.Supp. 600 (E.D.Pa.), <em>aff'd, </em>612 F.2d 572 (3d Cir.1979), and <em>Knuth v. Erie-Crawford Dairy Association, </em>463 F.2d 470 (3d Cir.1972)\u2014 and concludes that those cases compel us to reject the Funds\u2019 plea to toll the statute. We do not find the question so uncomplicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In <em>Gee, </em>471 F.Supp. at 617-37, the court engaged in an extensive discussion of the matter of tolling under Pennsylvania law. The court enumerated several types of situations in which tolling had been invoked, among them cases involving the doctrines of inherent fraud, fraudulent concealment, and breach of a fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The district court in this case, citing <em>Gee </em>and <em>Knuth, </em>apparently believed that, of the diverse situations justifying tolling under Pennsylvania law, only fraudulent concealment could potentially apply. It then proceeded to conclude that, because \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 complaints in the consolidated actions do not contain any allegations of affirmative, independent acts of concealment by the [defendant,\u201d the Funds could not have the statute tolled. These conclusions raise at least two problems that must be addressed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">First, the district court should examine the rationale of <em>Seymour </em>and <em>Bugher, </em>together with applicable Pennsylvania law to determine whether DeBolt\u2019s breach of the duty to make accurate reports and contributions under a self-reporting system itself tolled the limitations period, irrespective of any fraud, until the Funds should reasonably have learned of the breach. <em>See Seymour, </em>418 F.Supp. at 197, and <em>Bugher, </em>515 F.Supp. at 1183. <em>See also Livolsi v. City of New Castle, </em>501 F.Supp. 1146, 1151 (W.D.Pa.1980); <em>Developments in the Law </em>\u2014 Statutes <em>of Limitations, </em>63 Harv.L.Rev. 1177, 1214-16 (1950). This inquiry necessarily requires the district court to examine <em>Seymour </em>and <em>Bugher </em>and decide whether the theory underlying such cases proves inconsistent with Pennsylvania law. It may also require further development of the record in order to determine whether, given all the circumstances, the Funds exercised sufficient diligence to preserve their rights. <em>See Gee, </em>471 F.Supp. at 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">Second, the district court\u2019s conclusions with regard to the fraudulent concealment issue need to be spelled out in greater detail. If the problem is with the Funds\u2019 complaints, the court should act on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree, of course, that fraud, and thus fraudulent concealment, must be pleaded with particularity. <em>Walters v. Ditzler, </em>424 Pa. 445, 227 A.2d 833 (1967); Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). Nevertheless, the district court should reexamine the means by which DeBolt regularly submitted its list of names and contributions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>If, for instance, such submissions contained an express certification clause equivalent to that in Bugher,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court should determine whether such a clause satisfies the requirement of an \u201caffirmative effort ... to conceal\u201d under <em>Gee, Knuth, </em>and <em>Overfield v. Pennroad Corp., </em>146 F.2d 889 (3d Cir.1944). Should no such certification clause be present, the court should decide whether the mere act of submitting an incomplete list of names and contributions under a self-reporting system constitutes an affirmative act under the Pennsylvania law of fraudulent concealment. The court should make whatever additional factual findings it deems necessary to the disposition of the tolling issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AEXt\">Accordingly, we will affirm in part and reverse in part, and as to the issues on which we reverse, we will vacate the judgments and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK7D\">WEIS, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"AJDs\">I join in the court\u2019s opinion but wish to add a few comments on the tolling issue.</p>\n<p id=\"A2Y\">A statute of limitations represents a legislative policy judgment on how long a plaintiff may delay bringing suit without being unfair to the defendant. That being so, exceptions should not be freely allowed, and the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the statute has been tolled. <em>Swietlowich v. County of Bucks, </em>610 F.2d 1157 (3d Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"Aos\">In this case, the defendants\u2019 reporting obligation is based on contract. The characterization of that duty as \u201cself-reporting\u201d is not a talismanic phrase that imbues the obligation with fiduciary status. Also of importance is that the same contract gives plaintiffs the right to conduct periodic audits. Therefore, the inquiry into the plaintiffs\u2019 diligence has more significance than where a party does not have the access to information available to plaintiffs here.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">The district court cageg of <em>Seymour u Hull &amp; Mordand Engineering, </em>418 F Supp 190 (C.D.Cal.l976), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>605 R2d 1105 (9th Cir. 1979), and <em>Bugher </em>v. <em>Consolidated X-Ray Service Corp., </em>515 F gupp 1180 (N.D.Tex. 1981)&gt; <em>aff'd, </em>705 R2d i426 (5th Cir.1983), mugt be viewed with caution. As this court\u2019s opinion notes, those cases apply the laws of California and Texas; here, Pennsylvania law controls. In addition, there was a factual finding in <em>Seymour </em>that the defendant, \u201cknowingly in breach of the Agreement,\u201d failed to report hours worked. 418 F.Supp. at 196. In <em>Bugher, </em>the court found that there had been fraudulent concealment under Texas law.</p>\n<p id=\"ATae\">Whether those cases are helpful in interpreting Pennsylvania law necessarily hinges first, on factual matters that are not presently in the record, and second, on a comparison of the respective state\u2019s laws on tolling. Resolution of those matters is entrusted to the district court on remand,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-18\">.
