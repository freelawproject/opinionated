For the purpose of this order Rock Island Arsenal includes Arsenal Island and all access thereto, except the Rock Island Arsenal Viaduct, Fort Armstrong Avenue, and the Rock Island Arsenal Bridges that connect the Arsenal with the cities of Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-6\">The reason for this bar action is that on 24 FEB 1982 you engaged in a demonstration on Rock Island Arsenal in the vicinity of Building 321 in violation of Rock Island Regulation. 1-19, Paragraph 1-33.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-7\">You are further advised that Title 18, Section 1382 of the United States Code provides that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-8\">\u201cWhoever reenters or is found within any such reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation, after having been removed therefrom or ordered not to reenter by any officer or person in command or charge thereof</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-9\">\u201cShall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-10\">Should you reenter or be found on Rock Island Arsenal, as herein defined, in violation of my order, you will be subject to prosecution in the Federal Court and conviction could result in a fine or your imprisonment or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\">Bar letters received by the other appellants were of similar notice and form, except that Morlan\u2019s letter did not contain his name or the signature of an Arsenal official. Each letter, however, gave adequate notice of the consequences which might ensue upon reentry to the Arsenal, and Mor\u00edan stipulated his letter was issued by \u201can authorized official.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-13\">Our examination of this record does not disclose any challenge to the facts related in the paragraphs above. Nor is there any indication that appellants sought to challenge the validity of the Bar Letters before their reentry into the Rock Island Arsenal on April 10, 1982, which led to the instant prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-14\">Quilty's and Fessler\u2019s letters were dated February 24, 1982; Morlan\u2019s was dated March 5, 1982. It is undisputed that all three reentered the Arsenal on April 10, 1982. The statute upon which the government relies for this prosecution is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-15\">\u00a7 1382. Entering military, naval, or Coast Guard property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiE\">Whoever, within the jurisdiction of the United States, goes upon any military, naval, or Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation, for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"amn-dedup-1\">Whoever reenters or is found within any such reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation, after having been removed therefrom or ordered not to reenter by any officer or person in command or charge thereof\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-16\">Shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-17\">The cases were tried before a U.S. Magistrate under Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure for the Trial of Misdemeanors Before U.S. Magistrates. The Magistrate found each guilty and sentenced Quilty to 90 days, Mor\u00edan to 45 days, and Fessler to one year of unsupervised probation and a $300 fine. On appeal to the District Judge, the convictions were affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-18\">On appeal to this court, appellants argue that their convictions violated the first and fifth amendments, that the District Court erred in not acquitting them on their de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>fense of necessity and that the Bar Letters were procedurally invalid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">The first of these claims has been resolved by the Supreme Court in <em>Greer v. Spock, </em>424 U.S. 828, 96 S.Ct. 1211, 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976). The court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6T\">A necessary concomitant of the basic function of a military installation has been \u201cthe historically unquestioned power of [its] commanding officer summarily to exclude civilians from the area of his command.\u201d <em>Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, </em>367 U.S. 886, 893 [81 S.Ct. 1743, 1748, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961) ]. The notion that federal military reservations, like municipal streets and parks, have traditionally served as a place for free public assembly and communication of thoughts by private citizens is thus historically and constitutionally false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-6\">The respondents, therefore, had no generalized constitutional right to make political speeches or distribute leaflets at Fort Dix, and it follows that Fort Dix Regs. 210-26 and 210-27 are not constitutionally invalid on their face.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">424 U.S. at 838, 96 S.Ct. at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">The <em>Greer </em>case in footnote 10 also answers appellants\u2019 first and fifth amendment claims, and specifically the contention that their rights were violated because organized religious services were permitted by Arsenal officials on some occasions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-9\">10 The fact that other civilian speakers and entertainers had sometimes been invited to appear at Fort Dix did not of itself serve to convert Fort Dix into a public forum or to confer upon political candidates a First or Fifth Amendment right to conduct their campaigns there. The decision of the military authorities that a civilian lecture on drug abuse, a religious service by a visiting preacher at the base chapel, or a rock musical concert would be supportive of the military mission of Fort Dix surely did not leave the authorities powerless thereafter to prevent any civilian from entering Fort Dix to speak on any subject whatever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aav-dedup-1\">424 U.S. at 838 n. 10, 96 S.Ct. at 1217 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">The defense of \u201cnecessity\u201d upon which appellants also rely, has been recognized in <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>444 U.S. 394, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980), with two conditions: 1) the defendants must reasonably believe their criminal conduct \u201cwas necessary to avoid a harm more serious than that sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense,\u201d and 2) there must be no \u201creasonable, legal alternative to violating the law.\u201d 444 U.S. at 410, 100 S.Ct. at 635. The <em>Bailey </em>opinion also contains this fuller statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-13\">Under any definition of these defenses one principle remains constant: if there was a reasonable, legal alternative to violating the law, \u201ca chance both to refuse to do the criminal act and also to avoid the threatened harm,\u201d the defenses will fail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-14\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-15\">It is, of course, impossible to argue that nuclear war is not a more serious harm than a peaceful, if unlawful, anti-nuclear prayer demonstration<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at the Arsenal. It is just as impossible, however, to argue that there are not reasonable alternatives to violating the law under which these defendants were convicted. There are thousands of opportunities for the propagation of the anti-nuclear message: in the nation\u2019s electoral process; by speech on public streets, in parks, in auditoriums, in churches and lecture halls; and by the release of information to the media, to name only a few. <em>United States v. Bailey </em>authoritatively answers appellants\u2019 third argument in this appeal, inasmuch as \u201ca rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>sonable, legal alternative to violating the law\u201d clearly existed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Appellants cite to us and rely upon <em>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Berrigan, </em>\u2014 Pa.Super. -, 472 A.2d 1099 (1984) (en banc), and <em>Kiiskila v. Nichols, </em>433 F.2d 745 (7th Cir.1970) (en banc). <em>See also Kii-skila v. United States, </em>466 F.2d 626 (7th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">The first of these cases was tried in the state courts of Pennsylvania and, on appeal, resulted in a remand for new trial by the majority of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia Office. The majority opinion cited <em>United States v. Bailey, supra, </em>quoted substantially different justification defenses provided by Pennsylvania law, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 501 and 503, and held that <em>United States v. Bailey </em>\u201cwhile instructive\u201d was \u201cnot binding on our understanding of Pennsylvania\u2019s defense of justification.\u201d 472 A,2d at 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">While we accept the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s interpretation of Pennsylvania law, and recognize that <em>Bailey </em>may not be binding on that court, we cannot disclaim its authority over the United States Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-9\">We have also considered the <em>Kiiskila </em>cases cited above, to the extent they instruct a different formulation on the first amendment question. These cases were decided in the early 1970\u2019s, well before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Greer v. Spock, supra. </em>The federal necessity defense was defined in 1980 in <em>United States v. Bailey, supra. </em>As indicated above, we are required to regard the majority opinions in the <em>Spock </em>and <em>Bailey </em>cases as established law, which this Circuit must now follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">We recognize that appellants may well view themselves as inheritors of a tradition of civil disobedience which historically has encompassed American political dissent from Thomas Paine to Henry David Thoreau to Martin Luther King, Jr. It would be hard to argue that appellants\u2019 cause\u2014 apparently a general effort to stop nuclear war \u2014 is not comparable in significance to those which motivated these just named figures in their respective causes. Further, there is nothing in this record to show that their conduct was in any respect violent or disruptive. These considerations, however, do not alter the duty of the federal courts to enforce the laws established by a Congress elected by the people, under interpretations which the Supreme Court has upheld as consistent with the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-12\">The convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1095-10\">. We have carefully examined the procedural arguments which appellants\u2019 counsel have advanced. We have not, however, been able to ascertain any significant error or omission in the dispatch or wording of the \"bar\u201d letters which was not cured by stipulation. Their issuance is plainly within the authority of the Arsenal command under the terms of Title 18, U.S.C. \u00a7 1382.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1095-16\">. Reciting the prayer of St. Francis is certainly not an \"anti-nuclear demonstration\u201d under all circumstances and at all times. When spoken on the premises of a federal nuclear arsenal by persons who have been officially barred from the property as a result of a prior demonstration, this characterization is, we believe, appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
