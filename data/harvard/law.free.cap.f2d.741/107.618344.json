In 1980 Telegraph Savings was declared insolvent and the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), acting as receiver, sold substantially all of Telegraph Savings\u2019 assets to another financial institution. The question presented is whether Mitchell Investment\u2019s right to require redemption of the stock is enforceable and, if so, against whom and under what procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">Telegraph Savings is a state chartered savings and loan association organized under the laws of Illinois. In 1977 Telegraph Savings was experiencing financial difficulty and Mitchell Investment, plaintiff below, entered into negotiations for the purpose of investing in the troubled institution. The negotiations led to a subscription agreement that required Telegraph Savings to issue and Mitchell Investment to purchase 1,000 shares of \u201cPermanent Preferred Shares Series 1\u201d at a price of $1,000 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">Mindful of Telegraph Savings\u2019 precarious situation and the risks inherent in holding permanent reserve stock,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mitchell Investment sought to protect itself in the event Telegraph Savings became insolvent. To this end, the subscription agreement provides that if the corporation sells substantially all of its assets \u201cany holder of Preferred Shares Series 1 may at his option require the redemption of all or any part of his Preferred Shares Series 1.\u201d Joint Appendix at 97. The agreement further provides that redemption of this stock \u201cshall be subject to such requirements as may be imposed from time to time by statute or regulation, whether state or federal\u201d and that all redemption payments \u201care made subject to such restrictions as state and federal regulatory authorities may impose acting pursuant to statutes and regulations from time to time in effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">The attempt by Mitchell Investment to keep Telegraph Savings afloat was unsuccessful: in 1980 the FSLIC concluded that Telegraph Savings\u2019 financial condition prevented it from conducting its normal busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ness; the Illinois Commissioner of Savings and Loan Associations issued a custody order; the Federal Home Loan Bank Board-appointed the FSLIC as receiver; the FSLIC sold substantially all of the operating assets and associated liabilities of Telegraph Savings to another savings and loan association; and the remainder of Telegraph Savings assets and liabilities were transferred to the FSLIC in its corporate capacity. <em>See Telegraph Savings and Loan Association v. Schilling, </em>703 F.2d 1019 (7th Cir.) (upholding takeover and sale of Telegraph Savings), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 341, 78 L.Ed.2d 681 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"AleU\">Promptly after the takeover, Mitchell Investment notified the FSLIC of its intent to exercise its contractual right to require redemption of its permanent reserve shares. The FSLIC refused to honor the request and Mitchell Investment filed suit against the FSLIC in its corporate capacity alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Mitchell Investment\u2019s theory is that its contractual right is among the residual liabilities ultimately transferred by the FSLIC in its capacity as receiver to the FSLIC in its corporate capacity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mitchell Investment expressly eschews reliance on any procedure that would permit it to present its claim to the FSLIC in its capacity as receiver, maintaining instead that it may proceed directly against the FSLIC in its corporate capacity as the successor to or assign of Telegraph Savings\u2019 contractual responsibilities to Mitchell Investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">In the District Court the FSLIC argued there was no proof that it assumed this contractual obligation and that, in any event, the claim must be presented to the FSLIC in its capacity as receiver. The District Court, in an unpublished opinion, held that the FSLIC in its corporate capacity did not assume the contractual obligation of Telegraph Savings to Mitchell Investment, and thus granted the FSLIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Mitchell Investment Co. v. Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Co., </em>No. C-2-81-661 (S.D. Ohio May 24, 1983). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">During the course of this appeal, this Court directed the parties to address the enforceability of the redemption agreement under Illinois law, which both parties agree controls.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon consideration of the supplemental briefs filed by the parties, we conclude that Mitchell Investment has failed to prove compliance with state statutory procedures governing retirement of permanent reserve capital. We thus affirm the District Court, albeit on grounds not relied on by that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">The Illinois Savings and Loan Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> establishes a procedure for redeeming the permanent reserve capital of a savings and loan association, including a requirement that the Illinois Commissioner of Savings and Loan Associations (Commissioner) approve of the proposed redemption.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mitch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ell Investment concedes that Telegraph Savings is governed by the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The record contains no evidence that Telegraph Savings complied with the statutory procedure for retiring or redeeming the permanent reserve shares held by Mitchell Investment. Since the subscription agreement provides that the redemption payments are subject to restrictions imposed by state statutes, securing the approval of the Commissioner is in the nature of a condition precedent to the obligation of Telegraph Savings, or its successor or assign, to redeem the stock. Absent proof of compliance with this condition precedent, the Court is precluded from reaching the issue of the FSLIC\u2019s alleged breach or unjust enrichment. If the FSLIC has any contractual obligation \u2014 a question we do not reach \u2014 that obligation would arise only after the Commissioner approves the redemption plan. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) op Contracts \u00a7 225(1) (1981) (performance of a duty subject to a condition cannot become due unless the condition occurs or non-occurrence is excused). The positive law of Illinois cannot be abrogated by private contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">The FSLIC argues that the redemption agreement is unenforceable under the Illinois Business Corporation Act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which provides in part that \u201c[n]o purchase of [a corporation\u2019s] own shares shall be made at a time when the corporation is insolvent or when such purchase would render the corporation insolvent.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In a related proceeding concerning the propriety of the takeover of Telegraph Savings, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a finding that at the time of the takeover Telegraph Savings was insolvent. <em>See Telegraph Savings, </em>703 F.2d at 1027-29. Such a finding is not part of the record in this case, however, because the parties did not see this as an issue in the District Court. Absent evidence of insolvency in this record, the Court will pretermit resolution of this issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed, but without prejudice to Mitchell Investment to bring another action after complying, if possible, with the Illinois statutory procedure for redemption of the permanent reserve shares.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\">. Illinois savings and loan associations can issue two kinds of equity: withdrawable capital accounts and permanent reserve shares. Illinois Savings and Loan Act \u00a7 4-1, Ill.AnrStat. ch. 17, \u00a7 3091 (Smith-Hurd 1981). Withdrawable capital accounts, although treated as equity for some purposes, are essentially savings deposits and they must be insured. Permanent reserve shares, on the other hand, are equity investments analogous to stock commonly issued by corporations not governed by special regulatory schemes. They \"function as secondary reserves out of which losses are paid when all other available reserves have been exhausted[;] such stock is not withdrawable until all liabilities of the association have been satisfied in full. Permanent reserve shares are basically risk capital and function as protection for withdrawable capital accounts.\" <em>Lanigan v. Apollo Savings, </em>30 Ill.App.3d 781, 332 N.E.2d 591, 595 (1975) (citations omitted); <em>accord Lanigan v.

The FSLIC does not argue that we should give collateral estoppel effect to the holding in <em>Telegraph Savings </em>that the association was insolvent.

However, the concept of privity recognizes that a major shareholder often is the alter-ego of the corporation, <em>id. </em>at 1140, and privity can be presumed.
