The district court determined that defendant Rago had breached the agreement with Sun by violating a clause which incorporates the protections and duties of franchisees under Title I of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (PMPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801 et seq. (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the district court in favor of Sun.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Rago operated a Sunoco station in Bell-mawr, New Jersey, for eight years, under a franchise agreement with Sun. The terms of the franchise were contained in two contracts, one covering Rago\u2019s lease of the station premises and the other governing Rago\u2019s use of the Sunoco trademark, products and equipment. Both contracts contained a provision incorporating by reference the grounds for termination or nonre-newal of the franchise set forth in the PMPA. The contracts were last renewed for the period of June 1, 1980 to May 31, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-17\">On June 19, 1981, two years before the stated expiration of the contracts, Sun sent Rago a certified letter informing him of its intent to terminate the franchise as of October 1, 1981. The letter asserted that Rago\u2019s failure to operate the station for the period from April 11 to April 20, 1981, and Rago\u2019s failure to pay rent and other sums due Sun in a timely manner were grounds for termination of the franchise under \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C) of the PMPA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Rago refused to relinquish possession of the station premises, Sun filed suit in the federal district court in New Jersey seeking a declaratory judgment of its right under the PMPA to terminate the franchise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sun\u2019s original complaint cast this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>action as one arising under the PMPA and asserted the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805. While that section grants a private cause of action to franchisees, it is silent as to the right of franchisors to bring suit. The district court assumed jurisdiction under \u00a7 2805, but later allowed Sun to file an amended complaint recasting its action as one brought under the court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1982), thus curing any jurisdictional defect in the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Just prior to the date set for trial of this matter, Sun filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The district court granted Sun\u2019s motion on the ground that either Rago\u2019s delinquent payments or his closing of the station allowed Sun to terminate the franchise under \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C) of the PMPA. Rago was then ordered to vacate the station premises. Sun subsequently agreed to dismiss its remaining claims for damages, and on October 24, 1983 the district court entered final judgment. Shortly thereafter Rago filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The PMPA was enacted in 1978 in recognition of \u201cthe disparity of bargaining power which exists between the franchisor and the franchisee\u201d in the gasoline industry. S.Rep. No. 731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 17, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, pp. 873, 877.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Act \u201cestablishes protection for franchisees from arbitrary or discriminatory termination or nonrenewal of their franchises,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, by imposing two requirements on franchisors. First, the franchisor may terminate a franchise only for certain statutorily prescribed grounds. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802. Second, the franchisee must be given adequate notice of the franchisor\u2019s intent to terminate the franchise. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2804. The Act creates a private right of action for franchisees who have been subject to unlawful termination or nonre-newal of their franchise. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2805. In keeping with the Act\u2019s acknowledgment of the inferior economic and bargaining position of the franchisee, the franchisor who wishes to terminate or not renew a franchise has the burden of proving compliance with all the statutory requirements of the PMPA. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2805(c). Additionally, the Act allows franchisees to obtain a preliminary injunction upon a lesser showing than is usually required. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2805(b). The effect of the PMPA thus is to create a presumption that any termination of a franchise is unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">In granting Sun\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, the district court declared that the explanations offered by Rago for failing to keep the service station open in April, 1981 were irrelevant to determining whether Sun had complied with \u00a7 2802(c)(9)(A) in terminating Rago\u2019s franchise. The district court also rejected Rago\u2019s argument that Sun should not be allowed to rely on \u00a7 2802(c)(8) in terminating the franchise because its longstanding practice of accepting late payments meant that Sun had waived this particular ground for termination, or that requiring timely payment was not Sun\u2019s standard marketing practice, or that late payment was not relevant to the franchise agreement and hence was not a reasonable ground for termination. Because \u00a7 2802(c) lists events which are \u201crelevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise ... is reasonable,\u201d the district court stated that \u201conly events which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>not enumerated in [\u00a7 2802(c)] must be scrutinized for reasonableness.\u201d The effect of the district court\u2019s ruling was. to make any late payment or any closing of a service station for more than seven days per se grounds for terminating the franchise, regardless of the franchisee\u2019s reasons for these actions. We find such an implacable interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 2802(c)(8) and (9)(A) at odds both with other provisions of the PMPA and with the remedial legislative purpose of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801(13), the definition of \u201cfailure\u201d under the PMPA specifically excludes \u201cany failure which is only technical or unimportant to the franchise relationship,\u201d or \u201cany failure for a cause beyond the reasonable control of the franchisee.\u201d These restrictions on what constitutes a \u201cfailure\u201d within the context of the PMPA must necessarily inform a determination of whether a franchisee\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to make timely payments or \u201cfailure\u201d to operate the marketing premises for seven consecutive days constitutes a valid ground for termination. That a default in complying with a contractual obligation has been deemed a reasonable ground for termination under the Act does not mean that compliance is always within the reasonable control of the franchisee. We agree with the Seventh Circuit that \u201ca provision may be intrinsically reasonable, but unforeseen circumstances may impede compliance____ The \u2018beyond the reasonable control\u2019 limitation is merely a legislated excuse for nonperformance.\u201d <em>Brach v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>677 F.2d 1213, 1224 n. 16 (7th Cir.1982). Hence, a franchisee\u2019s failure to operate a service station for seven days because of a flood or some other cause beyond his or her reasonable control would appear not to constitute grounds for termination of the franchise under the PMPA because such failure would not fall within the definition of failure under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Our task in construing \u00a7 2802(c) \u201cis to interpret the words ... in light of the purposes Congress sought to serve.\u201d <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org., </em>441 U.S. 600, 608, 99 S.Ct. 1905,1911, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979); <em>see Brach v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>677 F.2d at 1220. In enacting the PMPA, Congress recognized \u201cthe legitimate needs of a franchisor to be able to terminate a franchise ... based upon certain actions of the franchisee, including certain failures to comply with contractual obligations ____\u201d S.Rep. No. 731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 19, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 877. The major thrust of the PMPA, however, is to protect franchisees from arbitrary or unfair termination by limiting the franchisor\u2019s ability to resort to such an \u201cextreme remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. Numerous commentators have noted that judicial interpretation of the PMPA must take into account the Act\u2019s primary goal of protecting franchisees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Allowing a franchise agreement to be cancelled anytime the franchisee makes even one late payment or closes the service station for seven days, regardless of how compelling the reason or how minor the incident, would undermine the protective purpose of the PMPA and conceivably could facilitate the very type of unfair or arbitrary terminations sought to be prohibited by the Act. Although the legislative history is not unambiguous, in light of the Act\u2019s specific intent to benefit franchisees, we decline to construe \u00a7 2802(c) as a per se termination rule favoring franchisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-16\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-17\">Consequently, we cannot agree with the district court that no reason can justify a franchisee\u2019s failure to make timely payments or to keep open the marketing premises. Because the district court disposed of this matter on a motion for summary judgment, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Kaufman v. Solomon, </em>524 F.2d 501, 502 (3d Cir.1975). Employing this stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>dard, we conclude that Rago has failed to put forth any reasons in either the pleadings or the deposition which would excuse the admitted closing of his service station for ten consecutive days in April, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">In U 77 of his Answer to the Complaint, Rago asserted that he closed the station \u201cdue to a theft by one of his employees and the other employee terminating his employ-ment____\u201d Although the record made it clear that Rago frequently ran the station by himself, and that his normal hours of business were 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. seven days a week, he offered no compelling reason for his own inability to open the station at all for ten days. In response to Sun\u2019s notice of termination, Rago wrote a letter detailing the \u201creasons probable\u201d for his failure to keep the station open. During his deposition, Rago admitted that these reasons were merely hypothetical examples of why a franchisee might have to close a station; they were not advanced as the actual reasons for his own closing. Rago testified that a robbery, the need to conduct an inventory, and various personal problems made it impossible for him to run the station during the ten days at issue. However, the robbery occurred on April 7, four days before the station was closed, and the inventory was completed in less than four hours during the evening of April 10. Rago\u2019s various personal problems, including the need to locate a former employee and the aftereffects of a dental appointment on April 9, similarly do not account for any significant amount of his time during the period of April 11 to April 20. After reviewing the record, we conclude that under the circumstances Rago\u2019s failure to operate the station was a sufficient ground for terminating his franchise under \u00a7 2802(c)(9)(A) of the PMPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Section 2802(b)(2)(C) allows a franchisor to terminate a franchise upon the occurrence of a relevant event which makes termination reasonable if the \u201cfranchisor first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of such occurrence\u201d not more than 60 or 120 days prior to notification of termination, depending upon which notification provision of the Act is applicable. Congress imposed these time limitations in order to \u201cpreclude the franchisor from basing termination ... upon old and long forgotten events,\u201d although \u201cthe time limitations are not intended to stop a franchisor from exercising termination ... rights based upon a future event ... if such future event is a repeat occurrence of an event with respect to which the previous exercise of termination or nonrenewal rights was waived.\u201d S.Rep. No. 731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 33, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 892. Sun relies upon this legislative pronouncement in asserting that it could terminate Rago\u2019s franchise by treating each late payment as a separate event within the meaning of \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C). Congress, however, specifically provided for utilization of a timely payment standard in the PMPA in order \u201cto permit evaluation of nonpayment \u00f3r late payments in view of prevailing commercial or industry trade practices.\u201d S.Rep. No. 731, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 38, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 896. Sun\u2019s repeated acceptance of late payments over a period of years would suggest that timely payment was not its prevailing trade practice. Although we do not decide this issue, there is a serious question under the PMPA whether Sun\u2019s past practices precluded it from basing termination on late payments absent any notice that timely payment would be required in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-9\">.
