A previous panel of this court decided that although appellant had not met the \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d requirement of \u00a7 244(a)(1), he had retained a \u201clawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years\u201d and was entitled to seek discretionary relief under \u00a7 212(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On petition for rehearing, that decision was vacated,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the case was scheduled for oral argument. Having heard the arguments of counsel, we reassert the prior panel\u2019s position that petitioner is not eligible for \u00a7 244(a)(1) relief, but we further conclude that he is also ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">Petitioner, a thirty-year-old native and citizen of Colombia, became a lawful permanent resident of this country December 23, 1975. He has resided here since then and now lives in Puerto Rico with his wife</p>\n<p id=\"b425-20\">and child. The conduct which led to his difficulties with immigration authorities occurred in August 1979, when he sailed a vessel to the Bahamas and took 12 Colombia citizens aboard with the intent to smuggle them into this country. He was arrested in Florida waters with the aliens aboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-21\">In September 1979, criminal charges were lodged against Marti-Xiques, and he pleaded guilty in federal district court to knowingly aiding another alien to enter this country illegally in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1) (1982). In August 1980, the INS initiated deportation proceedings against him by issuing a show cause order, alleging that petitioner was deportable for entering the United States without inspection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The INS subsequently filed an additional deportation charge, alleging that petitioner, for gain, had knowingly aided another alien to enter this country.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-22\">On July 28, 1982, the immigration court found Marti-Xiques deportable as charged on both grounds. It denied his motion for discretionary relief and ordered that he depart this country voluntarily or face deportation. On November 5,1982, the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed, and the deportation decision became administratively final.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-23\">On appeal, petitioner does not challenge the findings of deportability. Rather, he argues that he is eligible for discretionary relief from deportation under \u00a7\u00a7 244(a)(1) and 212(c) of the Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">In <em>INS v. Phinpathya, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 584, 78 L.Ed.2d 401 (1984), the Supreme Court recently held that \u00a7 244(a)(l)\u2019s \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d requirement is a strict threshold criteria to be met before the Attorney General can exercise his discretion to suspend deportation. In <em>Phinpathya, </em>respondent and her husband had stayed in this country beyond the expiration date of their visas. The INS commenced deportation proceedings against them. They conceded deporta-bility, but sought discretionary relief under \u00a7 244(a)(1). Respondent was denied relief because she had left the United States for a three-month period and had improperly obtained a nonimmigrant visa from the United States consular office in Thailand to aid her reentry. The court of appeals had decided that she was eligible for \u00a7 244(a)(1) relief, concluding that her absence from the country was not \u201cmeaningfully inter-ruptive\u201d since \u201cshe intended, at all times, to return to the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Supreme Court reversed, finding the court of appeals\u2019 flexible \u201cmeaningfully interrup-tive\u201d standard inconsistent with both the statutory scheme established and the ordinary meaning of the language used by Congress. Thus, the Supreme Court remarked that courts must \u201capply[ ] the \u201cplain meaning of [Section 244(a)], however severe the consequences\u201d ...,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and concluded that respondent was not eligible for \u00a7 244(a)(1) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The <em>Phinpathya </em>decision makes clear that Marti-Xiques is not eligible for discretionary relief under \u00a7 244(a)(1). The holding of the Supreme Court may be broad enough to deny \u00a7 244(a)(1) discretionary relief to an alien who leaves this country for any reason, for any length of time.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even if the opinion is not that broad, however, the reason for which petitioner left this country \u2014 to smuggle aliens into the United States in violation of the Act \u2014 certainly has a \u201cmeaningful bearing on the attachment or commitment [he] has to this country____\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We hold, therefore, that petitioner does not satisfy the \u201ccontinuous physical presence\u201d eligibility criteria of \u00a7 244(a)(1).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-19\">To be eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief, an alien must have maintained a \u201clawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years ...\u201d in this country. The parties agree that petitioner acquired a lawful domicile on December 23, 1975. Nonetheless, the parties disagree over whether petitioner has satisfied the seven-year requirement. The INS maintains that petitioner\u2019s lawful domicile ceased to exist approximately one month short of the required seven years, November 5, 1982, when the Board rendered its decision on deportability. Petitioner, however, argues that the requisite seven years transpired after that decision with the pendency of this appeal. The question becomes, then, by what point in time must an alien have established a \u201clawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years\u201d so as to be eligible for \u00a7 212(c) discretionary relief? To ensure that we select a fair and viable cutoff date for determining eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief, a review of the alternatives is helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-20\">\u25a0A.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-21\">The earliest possible cutoff date is that suggested by the Act\u2019s legislative history. In discussing the history of \u00a7 212(c), a 1950 Senate Report stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah5\">the proviso was intended to give discretionary power to the proper Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>official to grant relief to aliens who were reentering the United States after temporary absence, who came in the front door, were inspected, lawfully admitted, established homes here, and remained for 7 years <em>before they got into trou</em>ble.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">This view suggests that if an alien commits a deportable act before establishing a \u201clawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,\u201d and he is found deportable for having committed those acts, he is ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) discretionary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Fixing the cutoff date at the time a de-portable act is committed would have serious drawbacks. First, in many situations, establishing such a date would prove unworkable. Although in the instant case Marti-Xiques was found deportable for committing a criminal act on a specific date, many of the grounds Congress has established for deportation either relate to the alien\u2019s status or condition, or contemplate ongoing activity.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Second, under the present statutory scheme, fixing such an early cutoff date would often produce harsh results. For example, an alien is deportable for becoming a public charge or institutionalized mental incompetent only if such an unfortunate fate befalls him within five years of entering the country.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Aside from the difficulties in ascertaining the date on which the deportable act was eom-</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">mitted in these circumstances, the five-year outer limit would effectively preclude any alien determined deportable for mental incompetence or pauperism from eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief: if he acquired such a condition within five years of entering this country, obviously he could not meet \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s seven-year eligibility period. Such a result runs contrary to the notion that because discretionary relief is remedial, preliminary standards of eligibility should be read generously so as not to \u201cpreclude the Attorney General from considering the exercise of his discretionary power to alleviate hardships.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For these reasons, we decline to adopt the date on which the alien \u201cget[s] into trouble\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> as the \u00a7 212(c) cutoff date.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">An alternative cutoff date could be, as the INS urges, when the finding of deport-ability becomes administratively final. The Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Lok v. INS, </em>681 F.2d 107 (2d Cir.1982), supports the INS\u2019s position that a Board deportability determination terminates lawful domicile and is the relevant date for computing \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s seven-year period. In <em>Lok, </em>as here, the Board issued its decision upholding a finding of deportability before the seven-year period of domicile had accrued.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As in this case, the petitioner in <em>Lok </em>did not challenge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>finding of deportability on appeal but rather argued that he was eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because the seven-year period accrued during the pendency of his appeal. The court, however, held that Lok\u2019s lawful domicile ended when the Board\u2019s decision became final because he did not challenge the Board\u2019s findings of deportability. <em>Id. </em>at 110. The court reasoned that a petitioner who has conceded deportability cannot possess a lawful intent to remain in this country. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">The possibility of such discretionary relief led the INS and the Courts to tolerate Lok\u2019s presence; it did not legalize his intent to remain any more than the Service\u2019s policy against deporting Lok as the spouse of a citizen____ Once Tim Lok\u2019s order for deportation was not timely challenged on the merits, he resided in the United States once again as a matter of grace, not law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Under the <em>Lok </em>rule, petitioner\u2019s domicile ended when the Board\u2019s decision became final and before the requisite seven-year period had elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The prior panel\u2019s now vacated decision rejected <em>Lok, </em>concluding that \u201cuntil denial of discretionary relief is upheld [an alien\u2019s] intent to remain in this country cannot be deemed unlawful.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> More importantly, the panel feared that, assuming the <em>Lok </em>rule applied only when the Board\u2019s finding of deportability was not appealed, adoption of the rule would encourage frivolous appeals and would ensnare only the unwary who failed to raise a \u201cpro forma objection to the finding of deportability.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In view of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s recent holding that \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s requisite seven-year period can accrue during the pendency of an appeal which <em>does </em>challenge the Board\u2019s finding of deportability,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> those fears were not unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">The <em>Lok </em>rule also has the disadvantage of making the availability of \u00a7 212(c) dependent upon the length of the administrative deportation process. Such a result produces unequal treatment by randomly benefiting those aliens who encounter delays in the administrative process while disadvantaging those aliens whose cases proceed smoothly and expeditiously. For example, under the present statute and regulations, an alien could have his hearing within a week of the issuance of a show cause order<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and, if an oral decision is rendered, the immigration judge reads his decision into the record at the conclusion of the hearing.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> By comparison, the show cause order in the instant case was issued on August 29, 1980, and the immigration judge did not render a decision until September 20, 1982. To allow a respondent in a deportation proceeding to benefit from delays in the administrative process seems utterly arbitrary. Such a result would be especially ironic in the instant case in view of the fact that part of the delay in this case was due to the filing of additional deportation charges against petitioner on January 15, 1981. For these reasons, in addition to those expressed by the prior panel, we decline to adopt the <em>Lok </em>rule to determine eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">Yet another possible cutoff date is the one suggested by petitioner and adopted by the prior panel: the date upon which judicial review of the Board\u2019s determination is completed. This date, however, is even more vulnerable to our reservations about the <em>Lok </em>decision than is the <em>Lok </em>case, itself. Allowing petitioner to benefit from the delays inherent in the administrative process is arbitrary and unfair enough. But allowing him to further benefit from the docket congestion which plagues the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>federal courts<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and to take advantage of whatever procedural dilatory tactics he can conceive of<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> is untenable. Therefore, we reject petitioner\u2019s contention that the seven-year eligibility period for \u00a7 212(c) relief should be able to accrue during the penden-cy of an appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Having found all of the above discussed alternatives unacceptable, we now attempt to fix a cutoff date which minimizes the problems which attended those rejected alternatives. In our view, the most viable and fair cutoff date is the date upon which the INS commences the deportation proceedings, <em>i.e. </em>when the order to show cause is issued. This choice eliminates both of the problems inherent in the \u201ctime of commission of a deportable act\u201d cutoff date. First, regardless of the grounds for deportation, the date is readily ascertainable. Second, the Attorney General\u2019s discretion in granting \u00a7 212(c) relief is not overly restricted as would be the case with the earlier cutoff date. Furthermore, fixing the cutoff date as of the time of the issuance of the show cause order also avoids the problem of tying the accrual of \u00a7 212(e)\u2019s seven-year period to the quirks and delays of the administrative and judicial processes. Therefore, we conclude that eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief is determined as of the date the order to show cause is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In the instant case, it is undisputed that the seven-year period did not commence until December 23, 1975, when petitioner became a lawful permanent resident. The INS issued the order to show cause on August 29, 1980. Clearly, petitioner had not established a \u201clawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> before the issuance of the show cause order. Therefore, petitioner is ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">Because petitioner fails to meet the statutory eligibility criteria, the Board\u2019s denial of his motion for discretionary relief is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-12\"><em>. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b425-13\">. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1182(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b425-14\">. By its terms, \u00a7 212(c) applies only in exclusion proceedings where a resident alien has traveled abroad temporarily and where he is excludable under one of several enumerated grounds. Despite the literal language of the section, the Board interprets it to apply in deportation proceedings. The Board initially limited \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s application in deportation proceedings to cases where a resident alien had traveled abroad temporarily. In <em>Francis v. INS, </em>532 F.2d 268, 272-73 (2d Cir.1976), however, the Second Circuit held that the distinction between potential deportees who have traveled abroad temporarily and those who have not is irrational. The court held that equal protection requires that \u00a7 212(c) relief be available in deportation proceedings even where the alien has never left this country.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b425-25\">. 713 F.2d 1511 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b425-26\">. 724 F.2d 1463 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b425-27\">. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b425-28\">. <em>See id., </em>\u00a7 1251(a)(13).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b425-29\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(a)(1), 1182(c) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b426-8\">. <em>Phinpathya v.
