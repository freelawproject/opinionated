GIBSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The issue before us is whether Darin Dunlap, who is eight years old and severely mentally retarded, is a citizen of Texas for the purpose of invoking diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1982). The district court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 567 F.Supp. 1435 (D.C.Ark. 1983), held that the move of Darin from Arkansas to Texas, where he was placed in a special care home, was not sufficient to effect a change in citizenship. The district court relied upon the rule that the domicile of the child is that of the parents, and Darin\u2019s parents remained in Arkansas. On appeal it is argued that a separate, permanent residence has been established for Darin in Texas, with guardians of Darin\u2019s person and estate appointed there, and that he is therefore a citizen of Texas for diversity purposes. We affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Darin was born in June, 1976, and this litigation stems from the malpractice suit brought by his father on his behalf against the attending physician, Dr. Thomas L. Buchanan. The complaint alleged that Dr. Buchanan negligently inflicted catastrophic brain injuries upon Darin in the course of delivery, resulting in permanent and total disability. The suit was filed on October 21, 1980, in Conway County Circuit Court, and later amended to include as an additional plaintiff the First State Bank and Trust Company of Conway, Arkansas, as guardian of Darin\u2019s estate. The suit was dismissed without prejudice on the motion of the plaintiff on May 20, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">In June of 1982, Darin was moved to Hurst, Texas, where his aunt, Carolyn Sue Wells, was appointed guardian of his person. The Texas Commerce Bank of Arlington, Texas, was appointed guardian of his estate, while the Arkansas guardianship was dismissed. These Texas guardians brought an identical suit on Darin\u2019s behalf against the doctor, an Arkansas citizen, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. The district court, in its order of dismissal, made the following findings concerning the move:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5-\">In June, 1982 Darin\u2019s mother took him to Hurst, Texas where they stayed with his aunt, Carolyn Sue Wells, while Darin had surgery on July 6, 1982 at the Children\u2019s Medical Center in Dallas. On October 5, 1982 Darin was moved into a home owned by Ms. Lee Baber which is licensed to care for mentally retarded children by the State of Texas. The Baber home is located in Dallas where Darin attends a special school for the handicapped during the day. Ms. Baber charges $367.00 per month to keep Darin (she also keeps two other retarded children in the four bedroom house). Because Darin is retarded he receives a monthly Supplemental Security Income check from the Federal Government which together with the $82.70 Darin\u2019s parents pay each month makes up the $367.00. Ms. Baber stated in her deposition that Darin\u2019s parents are responsible for his medical and dental bills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">* * 4s * sit *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-15\">Although Darin\u2019s mother and sister stayed in Texas during the summer of 1982 with Ms. Wells, his sister returned to school in Arkansas in the fall and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>mother returned after he was placed in the Baber home. At no time did his father leave the family home in Conway County, Arkansas. Although Mrs. Dunlap stated in her deposition that she and Darin had \u201cmoved to Texas\u201d she also stated that her sole purpose there was to find a placement for Darin after which she planned to return to Arkansas (Dunlap deposition p. 10).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The district court rejected the arguments that Darin\u2019s move to Texas was a bona fide change of residency, concluding that his domicile was the same as that of his parents and that diversity of citizenship as to the defendant was therefore lacking. On appeal the guardians persist in their argument that Darin\u2019s move to Texas was a change of domicile sufficient to create diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Our review of the district court\u2019s decision is limited. \u201cA determination of citizenship for purposes of diversity is a mixed question of law and fact, but mainly fact, which may not be set aside by an appellate court unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Bates, </em>431 F.2d 16, 18 (8th Cir. 1970) (citing <em>Russell v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., </em>325 F.2d 996 (8th Cir.1964); <em>Janzen v. Goos, </em>302 F.2d 421 (8th Cir. 1962)). State citizenship for the purpose of diversity jurisdiction is equated with domicile. <em>Russell, </em>325 F.2d at 998; C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, Jurisdiction </em>\u00a7 3611 (1975); <em>see Williamson v. Osenton, </em>232 U.S. 619, 624, 34 S.Ct. 442, 442, 58 L.Ed. 758 (1914). In <em>Rogers, </em>the appellant failed to demonstrate that the district court clearly erred in determining that the person in question \u201chad acquired no citizenship in Colorado and that he remained domiciled in and a citizen of Nebraska * * *.\u201d 431 F.2d at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The domicile of a minor is generally determined by reference to another person because minors are legally incapable of forming the requisite intent to regard a place as a home; however, it is Darin\u2019s domicile, not that of his guardians, that determines whether diversity jurisdiction exists. <em>See </em>C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3615. The general principles surrounding the question before us were stated succinctly and well by the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">\u201cWhen a legitimate child is born of a living father, its domicile is that of its father, and thereafter the child until its majority ordinarily continues to have the domicile of its father ... regardless of whether the child actually lives with its father or not.\u201d <em>American Conflicts Law, </em>3rd Ed., \u00a7 12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">\u201cAn infant who is insane has the domicile of his parents, like any other minor.\u201d Id. \u00a7 13.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">Arkansas courts follow these general rules. <em>In re Watson, </em>99 F.Supp. 49 (D.C. Ark.1951).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">The district court further observed that minors retain their parents\u2019 domicile when they attend school in a different state but continue to be supported by their parents and to see them when school is not in session. <em>Lyons v. Salve Regina College, </em>422 F.Supp. 1354 (D.R.I.1976), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>565 F.2d 200 (1st Cir.1977), <em>cert, denied, </em>435 U.S. 971, 98 S.Ct. 1611, 56 L.Ed.2d 62 (1978). The court also pointed out that an incompetent person\u2019s domicile must be determined by reference to another. The court discussed <em>Chew v. Nicholson, </em>281 F. 400 (D.Del.1922), in which a mentally incompetent Delaware woman institutionalized in Pennsylvania was held not to have capacity to change her domicile from that of her parents in Delaware, even though she resided in Pennsylvania for over sixty years until her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">These general principles do not require us to adopt an unbending rule that a child such as Darin can never, under any circumstances, have a domicile other than that of his parents. Indeed it is entirely possible that a child may be shown by the evidence to have adopted such a domicile. In <em>Elliott v. Krear, </em>466 F.Supp. 444 (E.D. Va.1979), the minor plaintiff\u2019s .divorced mother, who had legal custody of him, was domiciled in California. The court held that the minor was domiciled in Virginia, however, because his mother had left him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>in the actual custody of his Virginia grandparents, who cared for him and were paying for all of his support. <em>See also Spur-geon v. Mission State Bank, </em>151 F.2d 702 (8th Cir.1945), <em>cert, denied, </em>327 U.S. 782, 66 S.Ct. 682, 90 L.Ed. 1009 (1946) (emancipated minor may acquire domicile of own choice).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">In the present case, the guardians argue that because Darin now resides in Texas and because his appointed legal guardians are Texas citizens, he is domiciled in Texas. The guardians\u2019 reliance upon <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Law </em>\u00a7 22 (1971), however, is misplaced. Comment (h) to section 22 states: \u201cIf the ward lives with the guardian in the state of appointment, he takes the domicil of the guardian. If he does not live with the guardian he does not take the latter\u2019s domicil.\u201d Here, while Darin lives away from Arkansas, he lives with neither of his legal guardians. The issue then, as the court in <em>Elliott v. Krear </em>recognized, is a factual question of where, considering the mosaic of circumstances surrounding Darin\u2019s care and control, he is domiciled. The district court found that Darin\u2019s parents continued in their parental roles notwithstanding the appointment of Darin\u2019s Texas guardianships:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">The Arkansas guardianship was dismissed on January 28, 1983. The Texas bank was appointed guardian of Darin\u2019s estate solely to receive any proceeds from this litigation. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel made this point quite clear in his brief. It is abundantly evident from the depositions of Ms. Dunlap, Ms. Baber and Ms. Wells that Ms. Wells and her husband as guardians of his person have not exercised any control over Darin. He never stayed in the Wells home unless his mother was present also. Ms. Wells has made no decisions regarding Darin\u2019s welfare, perceiving her role as taking \u201chis mother\u2019s place when she\u2019s not here____\u201d (Wells depo. p. 46). She didn\u2019t know the name of Darin\u2019s school nor the name of his doctor. She indicated that the length of Darin\u2019s stay at Ms. Baber\u2019s home was ultimately the responsibility of his mother. Mr. and Mrs. Wells appear to have done nothing more than give Darin\u2019s mother a place to stay when she is in Texas to visit Darin and to check on him each month. Darin\u2019s parents remain financially responsible for him and have exercised traditional parental control over him (Wells depo. pp. 27-40).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Thus, the district court\u2019s findings as to the Texas guardianships did not compel it to make an exception to the general rule that Darin\u2019s domicile should follow that of his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Another consideration in determining a minor\u2019s domicile is whether the purposes of diversity jurisdiction are served by the choice. In <em>Ziady v. Curley, </em>396 F.2d 873 (4th Cir.1968), the court held that the minor plaintiff was domiciled in New Jersey, where he went to live with his mother and stepfather when his father, with whom he had been living in North Carolina, died. In rejecting the common law view that the minor\u2019s domicile remains in the state of the father, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">[Ojne of the principal purposes of diversity jurisdiction was to give a citizen of one state access to an unbiased court to protect him from parochialism if he was forced into litigation in another state in which he was a stranger and of which his opponent was a citizen. * * * The infant plaintiff, for all practical purposes, and for the specific purpose envisioned by the founding fathers, is \u00e1 stranger to the State of North Carolina.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">In contrast to <em>Ziady, </em>the district court found that the purposes of diversity jurisdiction would not be served by holding Darin to be a Texas domiciliary.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">We need not address defendant\u2019s argument under <em>McSparran v. Weist, </em>402 F.2d 867 (3d Cir.1968), <em>cert, denied, </em>395 U.S. 903, 89 S.Ct. 1739, 23 L.Ed.2d 217 (1969), that Darin\u2019s Texas domicile was \u201cmanufactured.\u201d The district court\u2019s findings of fact regarding Darin\u2019s domicile did not rely upon any showing of impropriety or eollu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>sion. Nor do we discern any legal support for plaintiffs\u2019 related argument that Darin\u2019s parents\u2019 intention that Darin be domiciled in Texas is controlling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Analyzing this question of domicile under <em>Rogers v. Bates, supra, </em>as one of mixed law and fact, we must conclude upon examination of the record that the district court\u2019s determination of Darin\u2019s citizenship was not clearly erroneous. Darin was admitted to the Human Development Center in Conway, Arkansas, in March, 1980, and resided there until the move to Hurst, Texas. His parents have continuously maintained their home in Morrilton, Arkansas, and there is no indication that they have intended to make their home in Texas. The father evidently never went with the family to Texas for any extended period. The home in which Darin resides in Texas is permanent, but Mrs. Baber, who maintains the home, testified that she is only licensed to provide for children up to age twelve. Darin\u2019s parents continue to visit him and bring him to Arkansas on weekends and holidays. They have continued to provide for his support, education, and medical treatments. By contrast, Mrs. Wells, the guardian of his person, has taken no action or assumed any responsibility as guardian other than signing papers from Mrs. Baber that had been previously executed by Mrs. Dunlap. Mrs. Wells perceives her role as taking Darin\u2019s mother\u2019s place when she is unavailable and handling emergencies. She has had nothing to do with arranging for Darin\u2019s education nor does she know the names of his physicians. These facts underscore our conclusion .that the district court\u2019s determination of Darin\u2019s domicile was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\">. The Honorable Elsijane T. Roy, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\">. Plaintiffs' reliance upon <em>Chew v. Nicholson, supra, </em>is unfounded. There the court assumed, without deciding, that an insane person\u2019s guardian could alter that person\u2019s domicile. In so doing, the court expressly distinguished an insane person\u2019s guardian from a child\u2019s father, who has no such power: In the case of father and child, the infant\u2019s domicile follows that of the father; but a father cannot give his son a domicile apart from his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-21\">281 F. at 405 (quoting Dicey, <em>Conflict of Laws, </em>2d ed. at 149).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
