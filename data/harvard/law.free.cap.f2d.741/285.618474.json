Before the instant petition was filed, Zepeda was deported without notice to his counsel. The government contends that Zepeda\u2019s departure from the United States strips the court of jurisdiction to review the underlying deportation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-25\">We hold that the court has jurisdiction to review a deportation order where an alien\u2019s departure was not lawfully executed, and we conclude that deportation without notice to the alien\u2019s counsel is not a lawful departure. We find, however, that Zepeda has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>failed to demonstrate a clear probability of persecution so as to require withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Zepeda, a citizen of El Salvador, entered the United States in October 1982, without inspection. He was apprehended on December 13, and remained in custody until his deportation on June 15, 1983. At his hearing, Zepeda conceded deportability, but he applied for withholding of deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h), alleging that he feared persecution for his political beliefs if deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Zepeda was deported once before, in 1981, for overstaying a student visa. Zepe-da testified that after his deportation in 1981 he returned to his mother\u2019s home in San Salvador and operated a shoe business. Local guerillas apparently considered the Zepeda home to have a strategic location. The guerillas repeatedly visited the Zepeda house, and they requested Zepeda to undergo military training and store munitions in his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Government troops also frequented the area, and they too used the facilities at Zepeda\u2019s house. Generally, the guerillas visited during the daytime, the government troops at night. Neither knew the other frequented the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Zepeda claims he only wanted to remain neutral in the struggle between the government and the insurgents, but he felt \u201ccaught between two hot spots\u201d because neither side would leave him alone. To placate the guerillas, Zepeda agreed to store guns in his mother\u2019s home, but he left the country before the guerillas actually brought the guns to him. Zepeda contends that he is entitled to asylum as a person seeking to remain neutral in the political struggle, on grounds that he will be subject to persecution by both sides if he is returned to El Salvador.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The immigration judge denied the application, reasoning that Zepeda merely faced the same dangers as every other resident of El Salvador. To withhold deportation in such circumstances, in the judge\u2019s view, would \u201cpermit the whole populace of El Salvador to remain in this country.\u201d In a per curiam opinion, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">On June 15, 1983, while he was in custody, Zepeda was deported without notice to his counsel. The same day, Zepeda\u2019s counsel filed the instant petition for review of the BIA\u2019s deportation order. The government has moved to dismiss on grounds that Zepeda\u2019s deportation deprives the court of jurisdiction to review the underlying deportation order. Zepeda contends that the court maintains jurisdiction to review deportation orders where an alien\u2019s departure is not lawfully executed by the government, and Zepeda argues his deportation without notice to counsel was unlawful. On the merits of the application, Zepeda contends that the evidence established a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"At-\">I. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">The government\u2019s jurisdictional challenge is based on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-15\">An order of deportation or of exclusion <em>shall not be reviewed </em>by any court if the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right under the immigration laws and regulations or <em>if he has departed from the United States after the issuance of the order.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">(emphasis added). Zepeda\u2019s deportation, the government argues, was a \u201cdeparture\u201d within the meaning of section 1105a(c), and withdraws jurisdiction from the court to review the underlying deportation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">The courts of this circuit, however, have held that section 1105a(c) is not to be given quite so narrow an interpretation as the government urges on us. The term \u201cdeparture\u201d is limited to \u201clegally executed departures\u201d when the alien\u2019s departure is effected by the government. <em>Mendez v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>563 F.2d 956, 958 (9th Cir.1977). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Under the <em>Mendez </em>exception, an alien outside the United States may petition for review of his deportation order when his departure was not \u201clegally executed.\u201d <em>Thorsteinsson v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>724 F.2d 1365, 1367 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2386, 81 L.Ed.2d 345 (1984) (examining record of the deportation hearing to determine whether the petitioners were unlawfully deported by being denied effective assistance of counsel). <em>See also Estrada-Rosales v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>645 F.2d 819, 820-21 (9th Cir.1981) (allowing a deported petitioner to attack a deportation order based on an invalid conviction); <em>cf. United States v. Calderon-Medina, </em>591 F.2d 529, 530 n. 4 (9th Cir.1979) (defendant charged with illegal reentry permitted to attack collaterally the lawfulness of his underlying deportation where he was deported without being allowed to contact his country\u2019s embassy). <em>Mendez </em>and its progeny establish that the court has jurisdiction to determine whether Zepeda\u2019s departure was lawfully executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">II. <em>Lawful Deportation</em></p>\n<p id=\"ate-dedup-0\">The government does not dispute that Zepeda was deported without actual notice to Zepeda\u2019s counsel. It contends, however, that no notice was required because the immigration statutes themselves put Zepe-da\u2019s counsel on constructive notice that Zepeda could be deported at any time after the Board dismissed his appeal. The government points to section 1105a(a)(7), which expressly allows the Attorney General to execute a deportation even though the alien has not yet exercised his right to seek judicial review of the deportation order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 HOSaiaX?).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nothing in the INS regulations, the government contends, requires additional notice to counsel before the government effects deportation, at least where the alien<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\"><em>Mendez </em>rejected a similar argument on facts almost identical to those in the instant case. In <em>Mendez, </em>the agency notified the alien, but not his counsel, that the alien was to report for deportation. The alien reported as ordered and was deported without notice to his counsel. Several months later, when the attorney filed a petition for review of the underlying deportation order, the INS argued that the alien\u2019s deportation deprived the court of jurisdiction. The court, however, held that it had jurisdiction to consider the lawfulness of the deportation, and it concluded that the deportation was unlawful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-15\">Here, failure to notify appellant\u2019s counsel amounts not only to a violation of 8 C.F.R. 292.5(a), but also to appellant\u2019s right to counsel as provided in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-16\"><em>Mendez, </em>563 F.2d at 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-17\">The government distinguishes <em>Mendez </em>as involving a petitioner who was not in government custody at the time of his deportation. Under the government\u2019s theory, INS regulations require notice of deportation only when the alien is at large, not when he is. in custody. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 243.3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because an alien in custody is not entitled to notice, neither is his attorney. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.5(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ment cites no authority supporting this interpretation of its regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><em>Mendez, </em>however, was not based only on the INS regulations. The court held that notice to counsel was required by section 1252(b) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act itself, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b), which grants the alien a statutory right to counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unlike the INS regulations, section 1252(b) makes no distinction between the representation rights of aliens at large and those in custody, and we are unpersuaded that any such distinction is warranted. At a minimum, an alien\u2019s counsel must be made aware of the alien\u2019s deportation in order to provide representation. We hold, therefore, that the agency\u2019s deportation of Zepeda without notice to his counsel violated Zepeda\u2019s section 1252(b) right to counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, the government\u2019s deportation of Zepeda was not a legally executed departure, and we therefore have jurisdiction to review the underlying deportation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">III. <em>Clear Probability of Persecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In 1980, Congress amended section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h), to require the Attorney General to withhold deportation if he determines that an alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in his home country because of his race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a social group.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Refugee Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-212, \u00a7 203(e), 94 Stat. 102, 107 (1980). We review factual findings by the agency regarding an alien\u2019s eligibility for withholding of deportation under the substantial evidence test. <em>McMullen v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>658 F.2d 1312, 1316 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">Zepeda does not contend he will be persecuted because of his race, religion or nationality. He seeks refuge only on grounds of his wish to remain politically neutral in the struggle that has divided his country. In order to invoke section 243(h), therefore, Zepeda must prove four elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-13\">. 1. A likelihood of persecution; i.e., a threat to life or freedom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-14\">2. Persecution by the government or by a group which the government is unable to control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-15\">3. Persecution resulting from the petitioner\u2019s political beliefs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-16\">4. The petitioner is not a danger or a security risk to the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-17\"><em>McMullen, </em>658 F.2d at 1315. Zepeda must demonstrate a clear probability that he will be subject to persecution if deported. <em>Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Stevic, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 2492, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-20\">In essence, Zepeda contends that he will be persecuted by both sides in El Salvador because his mother owns a house in a strategic location, and because Zepeda himself is a male of military age who has sworn allegiance to neither faction. Although Zepeda\u2019s reluctance to return to his wartorn nation is understandable, neither of his contentions is a proper ground for refuge under section 243(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-21\">Recent Ninth Circuit decisions repeatedly have rejected applications for relief under section 243(h) based on generalized allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>tions of persecution resulting from the political climate of a nation. In <em>Chavez v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>723 F.2d 1431 (9th Cir.1984), Lopez, like Zepeda, a citizen of El Salvador, requested asylum partly on grounds that his ownership of a gun made him a target for guerillas who might want his weapon, and his status as a young urban male unallied with either faction left him vulnerable to persecution by both sides. The court rejected both contentions. Danger arising from mere gun ownership, the court held, did not qualify as persecution under section 243(h). <em>Id. </em>at 1433. Further, Lopez\u2019 status as a young urban male was not specific enough for political asylum; the widespread violence affecting all Salvadorians was not persecution within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h). <em>Id. </em>at 1434. <em>See also Martinez-Romero v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>692 F.2d 595 (9th Cir.1982) (rejecting the contention that no one should be returned to El Salvador because of the present anarchy).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Zepeda\u2019s alleged danger from his family\u2019s ownership of a strategically located house, like Lopez\u2019 ownership of a gun, does not qualify as persecution based on \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a social group, or political opinion\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h). To the extent that Zepeda also faces danger because of his noncommitment to either side, his danger is the same as faced by other Salvadorians. It is not specific enough to mandate withholding of deportation. We conclude, therefore, that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Zepeda\u2019s application for withholding of deportation^</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We hold that deportation of an alien without notice to his counsel is not a legally executed departure within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c), and does not strip the court of jurisdiction to review the deportation order whether or not the alien was in custody at the time of deportation. Zepeda, however, has failed to demonstrate a clear probability of persecution based on the grounds enumerated in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h), and consequently is not entitled to withholding of deportation. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(7) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">(7) nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Attorney General to defer deportation of an alien after the issuance of a deportation order because of the right of judicial review of the order granted by this section____</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\">. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 243.3 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"av_-dedup-0\">Once an order of deportation becomes final, an alien, <em>not in the physical custody of the Service, </em>shall be given not less than 72 hours advance notice in writing of the time and place of his surrender for deportation____ The advance notice requirement above does not preclude taking an alien into custody at any time, including any time within the 72 hour period ____ However, in such an instance, the alien\u2019s deportation shall not be effected prior to the expiration of 72 hours from the time of apprehension or of the 72 hour notice period, whichever is less,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ3\">(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b362-20\">. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.5 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayd\">(a) Representative capacity.
