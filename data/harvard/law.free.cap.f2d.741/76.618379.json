Following a jury trial in South Carolina State Court, Appellant was convicted of murder. His conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of South Carolina on October 3, 1979. <em>State v. Doby, </em>273 S.C. 704, 258 S.E.2d 896 (1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>444 U.S. 1048, 100 S.Ct. 739, 62 L.Ed.2d 735 (1980). Appellant\u2019s main contention on appeal is that the trial court impermissibly relied upon the truth of his confession in deciding to admit it, thus directly violating the mandates of <em>Rogers v. Richmond, </em>365 U.S. 534, 81 S.Ct. 735, 5 L.Ed.2d 760 (1961). We agree with Appellant and reverse the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-24\">The facts pertinent to this appeal concern the <em>in camera </em>hearing held during Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>lant\u2019s state court trial for the purpose of determining the voluntariness of Appellant\u2019s confession. <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964). At the hearing, Appellant presented several psychiatrists who testified to facts regarding Appellant\u2019s psychological make-up and intellectual capacity. The purpose of such testimony was to show that Appellant was mentally deficient and, therefore, was unable to understand his <em>Miranda </em>rights so as to knowingly and intelligently waive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">During the psychiatrists\u2019 testimony, the trial judge posed questions that strongly suggest he was concerned with whether Appellant had been truthful in giving his confession. For example, Judge Gentry asked Dr. Camp: \u201cWhen he [Appellant] said that he did commit the crime, is it possible that he was telling the truth?\u201d Joint Appendix at 136. Again, the trial judge asked Dr. Camp: \u201cIs it reasonable to assume that he [Appellant] was there and did it?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Following this psychiatric testimony, the defense counsel argued to the trial court that it should consider this evidence on the issue of the voluntariness of Appellant\u2019s waiver of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. At this time the trial court and defense counsel engaged in the following dialogue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">[Defense Counsel \u2014 Mr. Allen]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">I feel like that the Court should consider the most relevant things we\u2019ve brought out, not only Floyd\u2019s testimony both direct and cross, not so much what the questions were, but what the Court saw, and how he responded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">And also the doctors\u2019 background information on him, his performance level in school, his IQ, his psychological diagnosis, and all these things just go to the fact that he could not have intelligently waived his Miranda rights. That\u2019s really the only issue we\u2019re talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">THE COURT: How about the truth? MR. ALLEN: Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">THE COURT: How about the truth? Truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">MR. ALLEN: I don\u2019t understand the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">THE COURT: How about the truth? you say we\u2019re not concerned with anything except his understanding of his Miranda rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">MR. ALLEN: In this hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-15\">THE COURT: Oh, yeah, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-16\">Do you have any law on the middle ground between truth and legal right? MR. ALLEN: No sir, I mean\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-17\">THE COURT: Is there any?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-18\">MR. ALLEN: Explain your question, please, I don\u2019t understand it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-19\">THE COURT: Do you have any law on the middle ground between truth and legal right? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen any, have you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-20\">MR. ALLEN: No sir, I haven\u2019t. I'm not sure exactly what the Court\u2019s asking, but I do have the law on the fact\u2014 THE COURT: That\u2019s the dilemma that I\u2019m in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-21\">MR. ALLEN: Well, sir, it seems certainly arguable\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-22\">THE COURT: It\u2019s a real dilemma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-23\">MR. ALLEN: \u2014and goes to the totality of the circumstances, and these officers, being officers of the Court as you and I are, should have provided that man, after they saw; and they can\u2019t deny that they saw the type of person Fooyd [sic] is, that is readily apparent, I don\u2019t think any one would deny that; even after seeing that they did not afford him counsel, because Floyd didn\u2019t know to ask for it, because he didn\u2019t understand it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-24\">Joint Appendix at 173-174.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-25\">The day after the <em>in camera </em>hearing, the trial court allowed Appellant\u2019s confession to be admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-26\">After the jury had returned its verdict, Judge Gentry addressed the jurors in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-27\">[Trial Court]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-28\">I can announce in the present [sic] of this jury now, however, that during the in-camera hearing on the admissibility of the alleged confession, after hearing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>psychiatrists and after hearing the officers, and the manner in which the statement was taken, as I instructed the jury following that some two-three hour hearing Tuesday night \u2014 or was it Monday night, I\u2019ve forgotten \u2014 whatever, I concluded as a matter of law that the jury was entitled to consider that. After hearing the confession I became convinced in my own mind that some of the contents of that document could have been known only to the killer of Sally Ann Hutchinson. I won\u2019t go into enumerating them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Joint Appendix at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">It is clear from the language used by the trial judge in questioning the psychiatrists and defense counsel, as well as addressing the jurors, that he considered the truth of Appellant\u2019s confession in deciding its admissibility. <em>Rogers v. Richmond, supra, </em>prohibits a trial judge from relying upon the truthfulness of a confession when deciding whether it should be admitted as a voluntary statement of the accused. <em>Rogers </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">From a fair.reading of these expressions, we cannot but conclude that the question whether Rogers\u2019 confessions were admissible into evidence was answered by reference to a legal standard which took into account the circumstance of probable truth or falsity. And this is not a permissible standard under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The attention of the trial judge should have been focused, for purposes of the Federal Constitution, on the question whether the behavior of the State\u2019s law enforcement officials was such as to overbear petitioner\u2019s will to resist and to bring about confessions not fully self-determined \u2014 a question to be answered with complete disregard of whether or not petitioner in fact spoke the truth. The employment instead, by the trial judge ... of a standard infected by the inclusion of references to probable reliability resulted in a constitutionally invalid conviction____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">365 U.S. at 543-44, 81 S.Ct. at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The purpose of a <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing is to determine the voluntariness of a confession, and during such hearing the trial judge is \u201cduty-bound to ignore implications of reliability ... and to shut from his mind any internal evidence of authenticity that a confession itself might bear.\u201d <em>Lego v. Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 484 n. 12, 92 S.Ct. 619, 624 n. 12, 30 L.Ed.2d 618 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">The Appellees argue that the trial judge was not concerned with the truthfulness of Appellant\u2019s confession. Rather, they contend that the trial judge pursued this line of questioning in order to determine whether Appellant had the mental capacity to voluntarily waive his rights. That is, if Appellant fabricated his confession to merely please the officers, how could he have confessed to details about the crime previously unknown to the officers?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the trial judge had to examine the confession to determine whether it was the product of Appellant\u2019s free will.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">In support of their proposition, Appellees rely upon <em>Gilreath v. Robinson, </em>544 F.Supp. 569 (1982), <em>aff'd sub nom. Gilreath v. Mitchell, </em>705 F.2d 109 (1983). In <em>Gilreath v. Robinson, </em>Appellant contended that the trial judge improperly relied upon the truth of his confession by referring to facts of the confession known only to the accused. But this Court found that the trial judge did not violate the dictates of <em>Rogers:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-13\">A careful reading of the ten pages of trial transcript in which the judge discussed his findings and his reasons for admitting the confession clearly shows that a belief in the truthfulness of the confession was not a reason for admission. In mentioning that the confession contained facts known only to the accused, the trial judge was not passing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>upon the credibility of the statement, but was answering the appellant\u2019s claim that at the time of the confession he was in a psychotic state or a condition of complete helplessness where he could do no more than \u201cto parrot back a story that was implanted in his mind by someone else of fantasy.\u201d This is not the reliance upon truth of a confession that is condemned by Justice Frankfurter in <em>Rogers, </em>but is a proper inquiry and finding by the trial judge in deciding if a statement is voluntary or is the result of improper interrogation which puts words into the mouth of the accused and overrides his free will. See also <em>United States v. Kreczmer, </em>636 F.2d 108, 110-11 (5th Cir. 1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><em>Gilreath, </em>705 F.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">But <em>Gilreath </em>can be distinguished from the present case. The trial judge in the present case did not raise the issue of the previously unknown facts with an eye toward determining Appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the confession. Rather, he was convinced that Appellant\u2019s confession must be true because he knew these facts previously unknown to the interrogating officers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is apparent in his questions to the psychiatrists and confirmed in his final speech to the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The Court finds that the trial court violated <em>Rogers v. Richmond </em>by relying upon the truth of Appellant\u2019s confession in determining its admissibility. Accordingly we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions that the writ of habeas corpus be issued, first allowing South Carolina a reasonable time in which to commence a new trial on the charges, should it so choose.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">. The investigating officers testified that during his confession, Appellant stated that he accidentally nicked the victim\u2019s right leg with the murder weapon. The officers allegedly had no pri- or knowledge of this fact, but were able to verify it by checking photographs of the victim contained in the police file, only after receiving the information from the Appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">. In questioning Dr. McFadden, the trial judge came close to a \"proper inquiry\u201d of the type used by the trial judge in <em>Gilreath. </em>However, Judge Gentry stopped short by again returning to the issue of the veracity of Appellant\u2019s confession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">THE COURT: Well, at one point in your testimony you stated that you thought with the proper, suitable circumstances you could get Floyd Doby to confess to anything, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">DR. McFADDEN: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">THE COURT: How would you explain, in this particular case for example, the defendant telling the investigators, Hitchens and Blan-kin, if they were the only two in the room at that time, about him inadvertently nicking the deceased\u2019s panty hose, of which they had no knowledge at the time, and later that the right panty leg had been nicked, and a hole appeared?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-23\">DR. McFADDEN: I couldn\u2019t explain that. THE COURT: I mean, he just couldn\u2019t have been confessing to that unless he had some intimate knowledge of that fact, could he? DR. McFADDEN: It would sound that way. THE COURT: Thank you, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-24\">Joint Appendix at 125-26.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
