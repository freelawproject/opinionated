Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>691 F.2d 139, 146 (3d Cir.1982), rather than merely a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution, which latter standard they contend Congress, by enacting the Refugee Act of 1980, intended to make applicable to cases involving the withholding of deportation under section 243(h). The petitioners rely heavily upon the reasoning and conclusion to this effect of the Second Circuit in <em>Stevic v. Sava, </em>678 F.2d 401, 408-09 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">However, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in <em>Stevic, </em>460 U.S. 1010, 103 S.Ct. 1249, 75 L.Ed.2d 479 (1983), and, resolving a conflict between the circuits, reversed the Second Circuit and rejected its analysis in <em>Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Stevic, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). With specific reference to the issue before us, the Court held that \u201c \u2018the clear probability of persecution\u2019 standards remains applicable to \u00a7 243(h) withholding of deportation claims.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at-, 104 S.Ct. at 2501.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">As we apprehend the petitioners\u2019 argument, their sole contention of error is that, however articulated, both the immigration judge and the board required them to establish \u201ca clear probability of persecution\u201d before deportation would be withheld under section 243(h). If the board indeed did so,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stevie </em>renders this contention meritless. Nor do we understand the petitioners to contend that their proof established a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d so as to justify withholding of deportation under the statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Accordingly, finding no merit to the petitioners\u2019 contention, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"A6Z\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-17\">. Section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended in 1980, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">\"The Attorney General shall not deport or return any alien ... to a country if the Attorney General determines that such alien\u2019s life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>or freedom would be threatened in such country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h)(1) (1980).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b828-10\"><em>. </em>The board also held that, even if a lesser standard of \"good reason\u201d or \"realistic likelihood\" were applied, the petitioners had failed to establish that their brother's occupation as a soldier will result in their persecution within the meaning of the Act. We need not reach these determinations, since no contention of error as to them is raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
