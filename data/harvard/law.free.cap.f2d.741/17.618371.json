While the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Robert L. Carter, Judge, is clearly authorized by law to dismiss a case for failure to comply with discovery orders, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(C), we believe the \u201cextreme\u201d sanetion of dismissal, <em>Cine Forty-Second Street Theatre Corp. v. Allied Artists Pictures Corp., </em>602 F.2d 1062, 1064 (2d Cir. 1979), too drastic under the facts of this case at this time, and we therefore reverse. <em>See Societe Internationale Pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales v. Rogers, </em>357 U.S. 197, 209, 212, 78 S.Ct. 1087, 1094, 1095, 2 L.Ed.2d 1255 (1958); <em>Flaks v. Koegel, </em>504 F.2d 702 (2d Cir.1974); <em>cf.

The crushing is said to have resulted in a host of medical problems, including the fracturing of the tibial aspect of the first metatarsal of the left foot, swelling, shininess of the skin, non-pitting edema, marked sensitivity of the skin, burning sensation, erythema and pain in the foot on walking and at rest, typical of a \u201cSudeck\u2019s atrophy,\u201d according to one doctor; severe sensitivity and inability to bear weight, diffuse edema, diffuse osteoporosis of the foot and ankle, a \u201cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>flex sympathetic dystrophy\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and possible causalgia syndrome, according to a second doctor; and \u201cpainful ankleosis\u201d as well as sympathetic dystrophy, according to a third. X-rays referred to in a subsequent medical report revealed extensive patchy osteoporosis suggesting disuse or immobilization of the foot plus evidence of degenerative and possibly post-traumatic arthn- ,. \u201e xr , r ,, , , , tis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yet another doctor, however, after , \u201e . <em>\u2019 </em>. , \u2019 noting that appellant refused to have a paravertebral block and that appellant s <em>^ </em>r,.

Another examining physician noted \u201cvoluntary guarding\u201d by appellant of the foot, stated that appellant permitted touching of the foot only once and concluded that there was neither causalgia nor Sudeck\u2019s atrophy and probably not even a fracture of the metatarsal. An additional doctor found no causalgia and believed appellant possessed the orthopedic ability to return to work. An eighth doctor, Dr. Jahss, examined appellant at appellee\u2019s request and noted no swelling or discoloration. According to Dr. Jahss\u2019 report, the patient would not allow him to examine, \u201cmuch less touch\u201d the left foot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AV\">believing ^ Jahgs examina. ^ inguff\u00edcient then ffled a Fed.R.Civ.P. __ ,. \u201e , 35 motion for an order compelling an addi- .. , , . . . \u201e ., . tional physical examination.

Following this examination the doctor made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>seven page report, which, after reciting the medical history, the findings of the eight doctors previously referred to and the patient\u2019s treating physician, described Dr. Olson\u2019s own examination<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">It is my neurosurgical opinion following this examination that there are none of the criteria present which would indicate that the patient has any evidence of a reflex dystrophy or causalgia. None of the sympathetic changes associated with this condition are in evidence. Further, there is a large element of conscious dramatization of his subjective complaint in the respect that his sensory demarcation of increased sensitivity is of a stocking-type distribution and not consistent with an organic lesion. Further, although he does not allow the foot to be examined or touch <em>[sic] </em>them, further indicating a large conscious element of dramatization. It is obvious that his left foot is kept in a state of good hygiene; it was normally clean and the nails were normally trimmed \u2014 not found in conditions of causalgia or reflex dystrophy. It is clear that the left lower extremity is utilized to a great extent since in fact the left thigh was larger than the right, and there was no atrophy in the left calf, further indicating theatricality on the part of the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">I note no significant findings in the left foot to indicate any neurologic involvement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATK\">In other words, Doctor Olson found no reflex dystrophy or causalgia. What he did find was \u201ctheatricality,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>classic malingering \u2014 from the defendant\u2019s point of view the best possible report one could obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Despite this extremely favorable report, appellee renewed its dismissal motion, requesting as an \u201calternative\u201d to dismissal the equally severe sanction of precluding appellant from offering any evidence with respect to the claim of injury and damage. Despite opposition papers filed by appellant, including that of a paralegal who observed Dr. Olson\u2019s examination, and who disputed the doctor\u2019s assertion that appellant \u201cwas able to remove his socks and trousers and replacing <em>[sic] </em>them\u201d (the paralegal said he assisted DeCrescenzo), the district court granted the motion to dismiss. Its reasoning was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">On a prior occasion, plaintiff refused to allow defendant\u2019s physician to examine his foot. Defendant moved to compel plaintiff to submit to physical examination, that motion was granted, and some nine months later, arrangements were made a second time for the examination. This time plaintiff did not appear. Defendant\u2019s motion for sanctions was denied, and plaintiff was given a third opportunity to submit to the examination. On October 6, 1983, defendant\u2019s physician examined plaintiff in the office of plaintiff\u2019s counsel who was present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>throughout. Plaintiff refused to allow the doctor to touch his foot because it was too painful. He would not allow his foot to be measured and refused to permit any motor testing or pin pricking of the foot. On one occasion the doctor touched a brush to the left foot, and the plaintiff complained of pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">There is no essential dispute about what took place. Counsel for plaintiff contends that plaintiff did not refuse to be examined. He merely refused to submit to pain. Such sophistry is no defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">Plaintiff has been given three opportunities to allow defendant to examine his foot and thus avoid having his claim dismissed for his failure to permit proper discovery by defendant. Plaintiff, however, persists in refusing to cooperate, and three opportunities are enough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">The ultimate medical issue in this case is, of course, whether the plaintiff sustained \u201cserious and severe personal injuries,\u201d as he claims, or whether he is malingering, as Dr. Olson\u2019s report indicates. If he has the conditions that he claims he has, such as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, Sudeck\u2019s atrophy and causalgia, it is understandable that he is not anxious to have his foot touched, much less manipulated, by examining physicians. <em>See supra </em>note 1. If he does not, on the other hand, suffer from those conditions, he should, of course, permit whatever touching or manipulation is required or requested by the examining physician. We do not, however, believe that the lower court took into account the possibility, as indicated in some of the doctor\u2019s reports, that appellant does, in fact, have the conditions that Dr. Olson clearly believes he does not have. Rather, the court assumed what is ultimately a question for the finder of fact, namely, that appellant did not have the condition(s) described in the medical treatise quoted in footnote 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Beyond this we believe that the district court assumed that because the plaintiff would not allow the doctor to touch his foot, this prevented the doctor from making an examination. As we read the doctor\u2019s report, Dr. Olson based his extensive conclusions on the examination he conducted of appellant, an examination that the doctor clearly believed adequate to support those conclusions. Indeed, nowhere in his report does Dr. Olson indicate that the examination was in any way incomplete or inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">We reverse the judgment and order dismissing the complaint. The question remains whether a further examination should be ordered by the district court on remand, but we leave this to the district court\u2019s sound discretion, bearing in mind that we believe on the record before us that the appellee has already had the benefit of an examination and report that should enable it effectively and adequately to defend appellant\u2019s suit. If the district court orders a further examination, it should select the physician, time and the place for the examination and the conditions under which the plaintiff must submit. If ordered, the examination should also be conducted at appellant\u2019s expense. This is a less drastic but nevertheless effective sanction. <em>See </em>Waterman, <em>An Appellate Judge\u2019s Approach When Reviewing District Court Sanctions Imposed for the Purpose of Insuring Compliance with Pretrial Orders, </em>29 F.R.D. 420, 425 (1962). We repeat, however, our view that the ap-pellee already has an examination and report sufficient for its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">Judgment reversed, cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-32\">. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy has been known for over one hundred years but is still poorly understood. An early description of the symptoms was published by Weir Mitchell, based on his experience with wounds of ne extremities during the Civil War, but it has been described since then by many clinicians and is known under different names depending on the presenting or primary symptoms A few examples of these syndromes which fall under this general category are causalgia, the name used by Mitchell to , J? V . . <em>r </em>.. <em>i </em>describe the burning pam or partial nerve injury; Sudeck\u2019s atrophy, the name used to describe the muscle atrophy and decalcification of bone that occurs following soft tissue and bone injuries of the extremities.... Although the most severe syndromes are seen with partial lesions of peripheral nerves, all these syndromes have similar changes apparently related to altered control of sympathetic innervation, and all respond in varying degrees to blocking the function of the sympathetic nervous system with local anesthetics or by surgical means.</p>\n<p id=\"AIm\">In peripheral nerve lesions, the syndrome is seen most commonly with incomplete lesions of the median, ulnar and sciatic nerves, with preservation of pain function, but decrease in touch and pressure sensation distal to the lesion. <em>The patient usually complains that any stimulus, particularly light touch, causes a burning over the distribution of the area of injury, which gradually spreads to involve the whole extremity. The pain often is so intense that the patient will spend hours keeping the hand or other involved part moist and protected from any contact or stimulus. </em>On examination, the major changes are increased sweating, vasoconstriction, smoothness (atrophy) of the skin&gt; and marked limitation of all joint movement. With lesions of joints or soft tissue, such as bursitis of the shoulder, fractures of the wrist, or fractures of the small , c , j 4.1. j _ bones or the hand, the same syndrome may .x, , T \u201e . x <em>:c </em>aPPear \u2122th less severity- In all instances, if *e syndrome continues long enough, x ray shows decalcification and physical exammatlon reveals swelling, smoothness of skin, vasomotor constriction, increased sweating, limitation of movement of joints, and eventually atrophy of muscles.

The patient arrived utilizing crutches and was wearing a sock over his left foot, favoring the left lower extremity. He was obviously overweight. Trousers were removed with the pants leg pulled over the left foot and the sock subsequently removed. At that point the patient would not allow me to touch his foot stating that it was extremely uncomfortable. He thereafter put one crutch beneath his foot propping it up six inches from the floor. Inspection of the foot revealed no sympathetic changes. There was no glossiness of the skin, no sympathetic changes of the nail bed, no evident swelling, discoloration or sweating. It was of interest that the nail beds were trimmed normally. The right thigh measured 21\", six inches above the patella and the left thigh, 21/8\". This was repeated to insure that there was no atrophy of the left leg. Calves measured 16\" bilaterally. When attempting</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">to measure the foot, the patient refused. He would allow no motor testing of the left foot, although it was noted that quadruceps [sic] and hamstrings were normally intact. On sensory testing, he allowed no pinprick to be applied to the left foot; however, on one occasion I touched a brush to his left foot and he complained of pain. Therefore, pinprick was applied to the left lower extremity above the ankle and carried inferiorly to a point just at the ankle and serial testing revealed a well demarcated area encircling the ankle of the left foot. Light touch was similarly defined and consistent with a sock-like distribution. Deep tendon reflexes were intact and equal throughout except in the left ankle which was not tested. The Babinski sign on the right was not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Excerpt from Dr. Olson\u2019s letter, <em>supra </em>note 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
