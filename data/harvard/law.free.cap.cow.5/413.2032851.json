Judge. On the 4th of April last, the defendant\u2019s attorney served this notice on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney; \u201c Elijah Baker ads. Parnell Moody, Ac. Sir, take notice that a writ of error has been duly filed, Ac. and that a recognizance has been duly entered into, and acknowledged according to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, to be filed in the Supreme Court clerk\u2019s office, Albany.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s attorney disregarded this notice, and issued execution; which,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-11\"><em>P. C. Van Wyck </em>now moved to set aside, as irregular.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-12\"><em>J Platt, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AddP\">objected that the notice was a nullity, m not naming the bail, and giving their addition and residence. He said the same form should be pursued in this, as in the ordinary case of special bail; for the defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>error has the same right to except. (2 Dunl. Pr. 1138, 9. Tidd\u2019s Pr. 1087. Tidd\u2019s App. ch. 43, s. 15, p. 350. 6 Mod. 24. Tidd\u2019s Pr. 222, 3. 11 Mod. 2, case 9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AS3\"><em>Van Wyck </em>denied \u2022 that this was so as to bail in error. He said it is necessary by the statute, (1 R. L. 143,) to put in bail by recognizance before the court which renders the judgment; and which passes judicially, at the time, on the competency of the bail. This is conclusive: and is always deemed so in practice. But,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b414-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AXtQ\">The defendant\u2019s notice was defective, in not setting forth the names, additions and places of residence of the bail. The defendant in error may guard against their incompetency or insolvency, by excepting and compelling them to justify, in the same manner as the plaintiff may do in case of bail to the action. For this purpose, he must have notice who they are. The plaintiff has therefore, been regular ; but as the proceeding, to bring error, and put in bail, was in good faith, let the execution be set aside on payment of costs; and the bail justifying in the usual way, if required.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
