It being late in the evening when they retired, they had liberty from the court (by consent of parties,) to seal their verdict and disperse, rendering it the next morning. They accordingly told the constable they had agreed, dispersed ; the next morning delivered a paper purporting to contain their verdict; which was, on opening it, found to contain these words : <em>\u201c </em>The jurors, after due deliberation, do not agree.\u201d Signed by all the jurors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-10\">Before the jury re-assembled to deliver the above paper, some of them were seen in a bar room, where the cause was much talked of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-11\">On the paper being delivered, the Judge, after explaining certain testimony, as to which the jury disagreed, directed them to retire and re-consider the case; which they did, though this course was objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel; and afterwards they returned a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-12\"><em>I. </em>Seelye, now moved to set this verdict aside.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-13\"><em>A. </em>Stewart, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYP\">cited <em>Smith </em>v.

The present case is far different. After practicing a fraud on the constable, several of the jurors are found in a public bar-room, where the subject of the suit was much talked of in their presence ; and it <em>is </em>not pretended that they did not listen to the conversation ; and might not have been influenced by it. This is not to he tolerated. Here is not only suspicion of abuse ; (and we have uniformly held that the slightest suspicion of this sort, will vitiate the verdict;) but we think the circumstances of this \u2022 case, in themselves, amount to positive abuse. They evince that want of respect in the jury, to the obligations imposed upon them by their situation, which cannot he sanctioned consistently with the right of parties. They procured their separation by a very unbecoming artifice ; thus placing themselves in a situation to he practiced upon, and influenced by conversation out of doors. Such conversation was carried on in the presence of some of them. Indeed, it is difficult to see how the suspicions which attach to this case, could be explained away. The motion must he granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
