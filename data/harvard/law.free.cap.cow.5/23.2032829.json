A. Foot, moved to bring on the argument of this cause upon affidavits made for the purpose of a motion to set aside the report of referees upon the merits. The cause was on the calendar; and he read the proof of the service of a notice that a motion would be made to set aside the report, upon the affidavits, at the last August term, at the Academy' in U tica; and if it should not then be made, that the cause would be continued on the calendar from term to term, until it should be brought on.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-6\"><em>J. </em>M\u2019Kown,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ABq\">objected that the notice of the motion was insufficient for the present term.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b23-7\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ao9\">The notice is insufficient; and we cannot hear the motion. The regular practice is to notice for the particular term at which the motion is to be made; and we must not allow this course to be departed from, where no reason is shown for it. Causes cannot be continued in this manner by a single notice running from term to term.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
