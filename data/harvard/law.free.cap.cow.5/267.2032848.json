(2 Saund. 47, k.) It is true, that in <em>Cockerill et ux. </em>v. <em>Kynaston, </em>relied on by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, costs were denied to the defendant, and the case is not distinguishable from the present. \u25a0 But in a subsequent case, <em>(Bollard </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>7 T. R. 354,) Lord Kenyon said there was some mistake in <em>Cockerill </em>v. <em>Kynaston ; </em>and the plaintiffs having declared on a possession after the testator\u2019s death, were holden on being nonsuited, to pay costs. In <em>Hollis </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(10 East, 293,) the plead ings were like the second and third counts of this declaration. Lord Ellenborough said the question was, whether the plaintiffs need declare as administrators; that it certainly was not necessary to declare in that form; that on the death of the intestate, the plaintiffs were, in point of law, the owners of the goods; and, whether possessed of them or not, they might declare as other persons; and judgment was given against them for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">The rule that executors when prosecuting in right of the testator, shall not pay costs, applies to cases where it is necessary, to sue in their representative character. <em>(Admrs. of Tilton </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>11 John. 403.) The general doctrine on this head was very fully considered in <em>Ketchum </em>v. <em>Ketchzim, </em>(4 Cowen\u2019s Rep. 87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">In the principal case, the whole evidence of the trover and conversion was of a time subsequent to the testator\u2019s death. The defendant must take his judgment for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
