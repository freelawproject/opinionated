Seelye </em>moved to consolidate these causes, on an affidavit of the partner of the attorney for the tenants, that he was well acquainted with the titles of hoth parties, &amp;c. that he was informed and believed, and had good reason to believe, that the lessors had caused these action#to be brought on the same grounds, and the same title which they set up in <em>Jackson ex dem. Swartwout and wife </em>v. Johnson, (ante, 74;) that the plaintiff\u2019s claim of title in all these causes is the same, and derived from the same source; and that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence on the trial would be substantially the same in each. That, as he was informed and believed, the tenants all claimed title from the same source; and that the same evidence would be adduced by all the tenants, on the trial, varying only, in the manner of conveying down the title to them. That the venues were all laid in the county of Otsego ; and the demises all laid on the same day.
