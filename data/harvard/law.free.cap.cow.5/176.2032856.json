The Judge overruled the objection, and permitted the writ to be read in evidence ; after the defendant had proved by Judge Forman, that he allowed it, and that he was first Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the county of Onondaga, and of the degree of Counsellor at Law of the Supreme Court, at the time of allowing it; and also had proved by Nicholas P. Randall, that the writ was in the hands of Elisha Marsh a deputy of the sheriff of the county of Onondaga, on the morning of the 17th day of December, 1822, and before Lasher left the jail liberties to go to Syracuse. Randall also swore that he went to Syracuse, and that after he had been there a short time, Lasher and the deputy sheriff, came to Syracuse together, and remained together during the time they were at Syracuse ; and that after the hearing of the insolvent application of Lasher, the witness and they returned by the nearest and most direct rout to the jail liberties, and arrived there at about 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the 17th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel further proved by Judge Forman, that the writ was allowed by him on the application of John Wilkinson, Esq. who, at the time, acted as counsel for Lash-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>er; and Judge Forman did not recollect, whether there was any affidavit or not, hut rather thought there was not. John Wilkinson, a witness for the plaintiffs, testified, that he got the writ allowed by Judge Forman, without any affidavit, and sent it to Lasher, or to Marsh, the deputy sheriff, and he did not recollect which; and that he did not know that the deputy sheriff had any knowledge that he acted as counsel for Lasher. Elisha Marsh, the deputy sheriff, a witness for the plaintiffs, testified, that he received the writ of Lasher, on the morning of the 17th day of December, 1822, enclosed in a letter; that Lasher at th time of delivering the letter to him, in which the writ was enclosed, told him he had a letter for him, from Mr. Randall. The witness, at that time, knew that Randall was the attorney who had made the application of insol vency; that, on opening the letter, he found, instead of a letter from Randall, that the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>in Wilkinson\u2019s hand-writing, was enclosed. He further testified, that he did not know upon whose application the writ issued ; that he knew that the writ was in the handwriting of Wilkinson, but he did not know that he was attorney or counsel for Lasher on the application.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-8\">John Wilkinson further testified, that the words, \u201c <em>testify 'and,\u201d </em>were not in the writ at the time it was allowed ; 'but that some time after the 17th day of December, 1822, Marsh, the deputy sheriff, called upon him, the witness, and told him that the sheriff was sued for the escape of Lash-er, and that Judge Earll said he thought the writ, as it was would be a good justification for the sheriff, hut that the words <em>\u201c testify and,\" </em>ought to have been in the writ; that thereupon the witness, at the request of the deputy sheriff, made the alteration by interlining the words \u201c <em>testify and.\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-9\">The counsel for the plaintiffs then contended that the writ ought not to be received as evidence, on the ground of the alteration, and that it was no justification for the sheriff, which objection was overruled by the Judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-10\">The Judge charged the jury, that if they believed that the defendant, or the deputy knew the writ had been obtained on the application of Lasher or his counsel, they should fine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>for the plaintiffs ; otherwise, for the defendant; and they found for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-4\">A motion was now made for a new trial, on the grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\">1. That the application being made for the writ, by the insolvent himself, without affidavit, it was irregular; and afforded no justification to the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-6\"><em>2. </em>In the form, in which it was allowed, it was not an <em>hab. corp. ad testificandum ; </em>nor was any place mentioned where the sheriff was to have the body.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-7\">3. The alteration of the writ by the deputy, after it was allowed, rendered it absolutely void, and inadmissible in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-8\">4.

The omission in the writ, of the words <em>to testify, </em>was not material. It still appeared to be a <em>habeas corpus ad testificandum. </em>It directed the sheriff to bring the prisoner before the officer, to answer unto those things that might be there required of him, pursuant to the act entitled an act to abolish imprisonment for debt in certain cases. Under that act, he would be required to answer only as a witness. It was substantially good ; and was in the words of the statute. The omission of a place in the writ where the prisoner was to be brought did not render it void. He was directed to be brought before <em>Joshua Forman, Esq. First Judge of the Court of Common Pleas in and for the county of Onondaga. </em>If the words, <em>at his office, in said county, </em>had been added, it would have been in <em>terms, </em>sufficiently explicit; and I think they are fairly to be understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">The writ was allowed by an officer of competent authority to allow <em>writs of habeas corpus. </em>He had the same powers as a Judge of the Supreme Court at chambers; and the case of <em>Hassam </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>(18 John. 48,) shows that a <em>habeas corpus ad testificandum </em>may be allowed by a Judge at chambers, to bring up a prisoner charged in execution. (And vid. 5 id. 357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">If the writ was issued by an officer of competent authority, and was not void on its face, the defendant was bound to obey it. (5 John. 357. 3 Esp. Rep. 283. 3 Burr. 1340. 4 East, 587.) Whether the writ was regularly issued or not; whether upon the application of the ere ' itor, or the insolvent, the sheriff had no means <em>oi </em>knowing snd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>was Lot bound to inquire. Admitting it to have issued erroneously, there being no defect of jurisdiction in the officer, it is a justification to the sheriff. (13 John. 444. 19 John. 39. id. 7. 1 Cowen, 309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The alteration of the writ, subsequent to its execution, could not deprive the sheriff of his justification under it, if <em>it </em>was originally sufficient to justify him. The alteration was made without his authority; and he was not responsible for the act of his deputy in that respect. But the principle ijlied on by the defendant\u2019s counsel, does not apply to a case like this.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The motion for a new trial must he denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">New trial refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
