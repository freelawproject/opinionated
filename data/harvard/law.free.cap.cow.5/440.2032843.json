John Phillips was an adult; the other defendants were, and still are infants. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney issued executions against all the defendants within the year; contrary to the statute (sess. 36, ch. 93, s. 6, 1R. L. 318.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-14\">On the 27th of April (Thursday) the defendants gave notice of a motion to set aside the executions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-15\">On Thursday or Friday (the 27th or 28th of April) the plaintiff\u2019s attorney withdrew the executions from the hands of the sheriff, nothing having been done upon them; and altered them, so that they stood against John Phillips, the adult only; he (the attorney) having issued the executions by mistake, without adverting to the statute which requires a jrnar\u2019s delay of execution against infant heirs. On the same day he gave notice of the alteration to Mr. Wheeler, the attorney of John Phillips, and guardian <em>ad litem </em>of the other defendants ; and offered (by stipulation in writing) to pay the costs which had accrued about the motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-16\"><em>J.

The withdrawing of the executions extended only to the infants. They should also have been withdrawn as to the adult.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-4\"><em>G.
