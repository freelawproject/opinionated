J. Oakley, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIP\">said the statute (sess. 47, ch. 238, s. 37,) required the bond to he signed by the <em>party </em>appealing. The word <em>party </em>is often used in the same section; and in a sense which, it cannot he doubted, extends to <em>all the parties. </em>Thus, either <em>party </em>conceiving himself aggrieved, may appeal. The <em>party </em>appealing is to serve a notice signed by the <em>party </em>appealing, &amp;c. So the word appellant, although grammatically singular, was doubtless intended, as used in this section, of <em>all </em>the parties who appeal. Thus, in case judgment is rendered against the appellant, the bond is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>he shall pay, &amp;c.. If the judgment may have been rendered against the <em>appellant </em>before the justice, the further condition shall be added, &amp;c. and so in various other instances, (which he put) where party, or appellant, in the singular, has a plural meaning. Is the case before the Court an exception <em>1 </em>It would seem to be necessary that the party should himself execute the bond, in order to signify his assent to the appeal, and give the'C. P. jurisdiction. The statute concerning writs of error, (1 R. L. 143, s. 2,) expressly provides for an absent party, and requires three sureties ; when otherwise two would be enough.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b35-4\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AHn\">Clearly one of two men, though partners, cannot bind the other by specialty upon the footing of his general authority. But we think there is no necessity for the party to give the bond, provided the security is fully competent without him. The main object of the bond is, not to give the Court jurisdiction, though it is made incidentally necessary, for this purpose, by the statute; but to make the appellee secure in recovering his demand. This purpose is just as well answered without the party, as with him, provided competent sureties execute the bond.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The Court below erred; and the motion must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Rule for a peremptory mandamus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b35-7\"><em> Barnes </em>v. <em>Bulwer, </em>(Carth. 121,) and <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Bennington, </em>(Barn. 75,) S.
