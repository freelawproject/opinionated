L 353, s, 19;) but \u2019if it appear to have been returned <em>non est inventus, </em>a supersedeas will be granted, unless it bo followed up by an alias.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-7\">The court may, under special circumstances, give time to issue an alias.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-8\">The defendant having been surrendered, in discharge of his bail, to the sheriff of New York, on the 29th of October ; on the 7th March, the Recorder of New-York made an order upon the plaintiff, to show cause on the 11th, why a supersedeas should not issue upon the statute, (1 R. L. 353, s. 12.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b278-9\">On showing cause it appeared that a <em>ca. sa. </em>had been delivered to the sheriff, on the 4th of March, returnable that day; but the defendant was not actually arrested upon it; and the sheriff returned it <em>non est inventus ; </em>though the defendant had continued in his custody on the limits, after the surrender, and was so in his custody when he returned the <em>ca. sa.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-10\">The Recorder refused to make an order which should be absolute for a supersedeas, until the 21st of March; to the end that the opinion of the Supreme Court might be taken in the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-11\">S. <em>M. Hopkins, </em>moved to set aside the order of the Recorder.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apy4\">He said it was a sufficient answer to the application for a supersedeas, that the defendant had been charged in execution at the time of showing cause. (Coleman\u2019s Cas. 42. 1 Caines\u2019 Rep. 67.) It is enough that an execution is delivered to the sheriff.. <em>(Minturn </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>3 John. 446.) It \u2022 is not the fault of the plaintiff, if a sheriff will not arrest a man in his custody. In <em>Minturn </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>putting a <em>ca. sa. </em>in the post office, directed to the sheriff, was held sufficient.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>J. E. Lovett, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW-\">relied on the case of <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>(8 John. Rep. 379, 382,) as in point against the motion.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b279-4\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AG-\"><em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Whipple </em>is decisive that the mere delivery of a <em>ca. sa. </em>to the sheriff, against a person on the limits, is not <em>per se et eo instanti, </em>an arrest, so as to charge the sheriff for an escape; but is that material to the present question ? The plaintiff has made an ineffectual attempt to charge the defendant. The execution was returned <em>non est; </em>and he might have issued an alias <em>ca. sa. </em>on the 11th. That would have been good cause, under the authorities cited for the motion. He did not do so; but seems to rely on the sheriff\u2019s liability. In <em>Minturn </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>(3 John. 446,) had it been shown to the court that the <em>ca. sa. </em>had miscarried, or had not been executed, or not received by the sheriff, till after the return day, is there a doubt that a .supersedeas would have followed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We think the recorder decided correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\"><em>Hopkins, </em>said there had been a misapprehension of the practice on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s <em>attorney; and </em>moved for a stay of proceedings until he should be able to communicate with him ; so that he might yet charge the defendant in execution. He said that in a case so circumstanced, this might be done, as he was confident he could show upon authority, if time should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">As to this,</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\n<em>Cur adv vult.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Time was afterwards allowed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
