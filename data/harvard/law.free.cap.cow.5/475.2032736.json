In <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>(2 Str. 937,) it was decided, after full argument and deliberation, that the contract to marry by an infant is not void; but voidable at the election of the infant; yet, as to the person of full age, contracting with the infant, it absolutely hinds. Hence, an infant may maintain this action against an adult; but an infant defendant is not liable. (Com. Dig. Enfant, B. 6.) The defendant is entitled to judgment,</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Judgment for the defendant. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
