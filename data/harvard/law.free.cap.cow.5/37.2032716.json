Nearly two years after, he entered a rule to amend, and pleaded, under the rule, four additional pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-6\"><em>W. L. F. Warren, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOK\">moved to set aside the rule, and the pleas under it, as irregular. He cited 8 Reg. Gen. April term, 1796 ; under which, he said, the defendant could not amend his plea of course, at any time, unless it he demurred to. That a plea could not be added, he cited 18 John. Rep. 310; Dunl. Pr. 695, 292.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-12\"><em>P. H.

The 8 Reg. Gen. of' April term, 1796, is the only authority for amending of course. Under this rule you cannot amend a plea unless it be demurred to; and then you cannot add a new plea. The motion must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-14\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
