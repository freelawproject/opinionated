That on the 1st day of February, 1823, $1350 rent was due for three years; and that, on the day mentioned in the declaration, after that sum became due, the plaintiff fraudulently and clandestinely removed the goods from the demised premises; and within 30 days thereafter, the defendant distrained them for the $1350 in arrear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-10\">To this avowry the plaintiff interposed several pleas; one of which was, that all interest, title, term and estate</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-12\">which the plaintiff had by virtue of the demise, before the time when, &amp;c. to wit, on the 1st of May, 1823, wholly ceased, determined and ended; and the plaintiff on that day wholly removed off, from and out of the possession of the premises: and had never since been in possession of the whole</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-14\">or any part; nor in any manner since that time been tenant to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-15\">General demurrer and joinder.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-16\"><em>D.

The avowry is, therefore, sufficient. (The opinion expressed in <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Van Buskirk, </em>(3 Cow. 271,) that a distress off the premises can only be made within thirty days after the rent fell due, was not necessary to the decision of that cause ; and on more full consideration must be overruled.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The plea substantially takes issue on the material fact in the avowry; for if the plaintiff\u2019s interest ceased on the 1st May, 1823, and he removed off the premises before the time, when, &amp;c. it negatives the averment, that the plaintiff was possessed, &amp;c. as tenant to the defendant, at the time of making the distress. This fact being admitted by the demurrer puts an end to the right of distress. It is said, the plea ought to have concluded to the country. This is correct; but it is not cause for a general demurrer.
