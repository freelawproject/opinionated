That Campbell died about 20 years before the trial; leaving Elizabeth and Nancy, his daughters, and heirs at law. That Nancy intermarried with Brown, the tenant, previous to 1816; and is still living, having several children by Brown.

(1 R. L. 56, s. 1.) The deed was to him and his heirs; and the estate r.ot having been devised, his heirs would take as special occupants. <em>(Atkinson </em>v. Baker, 4 T. R. 229, <em>Doe </em>v. Luxton, 6 id. 289.)

Parker, (A Spencer, </em>same side,) contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQb\">Brown was a mere tenant by the curtesy initiate; and, at. most, Gillis could acquire and hold no more than an estate <em>par auter vie. </em>Clearly, at common law, the widow would not be dowable of such an estate; (2 Saund. 46, note (5); Co. Lit. 32, a.; 2 Bl. Com. 129; Lit. s. 9; 3 P. Wms. 263 ; 1 R. L. 365, s. 4;) and the statute, (1 R. L. 56,) gives no greater right. It was passed merely with a view to the remedy. leaving the rights of the widow precisely as they were before.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b389-6\"><em>Curia, </em>per Woodworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARI\">The husband of the demandant had not an estate, that could descend to his heirs. It was <em>pur auter vie. </em>By the English statute, (29 Car. 2, c. 3, sec. 12,) such an estate descends to the heir, if it comes to him as a special occupant. It was enacted to prevent the mischief, which previously existed, that where no special occupant was designated by the grant, it belonged to the person who first took possession. (4 D. &amp; E. 229.) This act enables the proprietor to devise the estate; but when no devise is made, it is chargeable in the hands of the heir, if it comes to him by reason of a special occupancy as assets by descent, as in case of lands in fee simple; and if there be no special occupant, it shall go to the executor and be assets. Our act, (1 R. L. 365, s. 4,) declares that estates of this description shall be deviseable; and if no devise be made, they shall go to the executor or administrator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>to be applied and distributed as- part of the personal estate. The consequence is, the demandant is not entitl\u00e9d to dow er; and the tenant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Judgment for the tenant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
