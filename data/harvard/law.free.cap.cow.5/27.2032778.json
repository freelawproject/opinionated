One Ellis was the grantee in, and had possession of a deed constituting a link in the plaintiff\u2019s deduction of title; and on an affidavit that he withheld the inspection of this deed from the plaintiff, by means whereof he was embarrassed in setting out his title in the declaration, and could not safely try his cause,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-12\"><em>A. C. Paige, </em>moved for a rule upon Ellis,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-lL\">requiring him to allow the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to take a copy of this deed, and cited <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>(4 Cowen\u2019s Rep. 399;) 19 John. Rep. 268; 2 Campb. Rep. 94, note ; 12 John. Rep. 225 ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>1 Campb. Rep. 562, per Sir J. Mansfield ; 11 John. Rep 245 ; 2 Arch.

Danforth </em>said, whatever the Court might do, if this deed were in the hands of the party, they would never call upon a third person in this form to produce a paper. He is liable to be called on by a <em>subpeena duces tecum. </em>But this being an action for a tort, the Court will not even compel a party to produce papers for the inspection of his antagonist; and so this Court held in <em>Denslow &amp; Wife </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>(2 Cowen\u2019s Rep. 592.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b28-10\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AYT\">If-the action were upon contract, and the motion unobjectionable on this ground, we would not grant this application. It is aimed against a third person not interested in the cause ; and seeks to pry into his private papers. If the plaintiff deem it material, he must compel its production by <em>subpeena duces tecum, </em>or in some other way than by motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
