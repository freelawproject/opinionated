Neither special nor common bail had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>been filed in this Court; nor had the defendant appeared \u2022 jiere any form \u2022 nor had the plaintiff, who was an infant, and sued helow by his guardian, had any guardian or next friend appointed in this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-4\"><em>J. </em>M\u2019Kown, nioved to set aside the proceedings for irregularity.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARp\">He contended that the plaintiff should have commenced his proceedings <em>de novo, </em>by having a guardian appointed, awaiting the defendant\u2019s appearance, and declaring in this Court.

This was held in <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>(3 Caines\u2019 Rep. 86.) It follows, that the cause is here, on the return of the certiorari, in the same situation as to the appearance of the parties, and other incidents, as it stood in the Court below. And it proceeds here directly from the point at which it stopped below. The English practice appears to be different; but the practice of this Court has been settled ever since the case of <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Horton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
