That Dobbin continued his possession about four years after, when he was succeeded by another tenant under the lessors of the plaintiff; and this last was succeeded by a series of tenants down to one Gluivy, who was in possession under a lease in the summer of 1821, or 1822.

The lessors of the plaintiff showed a continued possession in themselves, and the one from whom they derived it, under a claim or assertion of right from 1805 to 1821, or 2. In December, 1822, the defendant entered, without pretending any right or title, the premises being then vacant. This action was brought in April, 1823. The reason of the premises being vacant is given by Thomas Mumford, a witness for the plaintiff; who testified that he was the agent of the lessors, with authority to lease, or sell the lot; that he had leased it, for several years, to different tenants; that he last leased it to one Qmivy, who, after the expiration of his lease, held over, with the consent of the witness, who never knew that he had left the premises, until informed that the defendant had entered. This shows that the possession had never been abandoned by the lessors, without the <em>animus revertendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AfEo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>In <em>Smith </em>v.
