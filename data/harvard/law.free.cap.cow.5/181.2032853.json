By means, &amp;c. the plaintiff was, &amp;c. and became, &amp;c. and was hindered, &amp;c. and was forced to pay, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-8\">The <em>second </em>count was in the usual form, for a common assault, and battery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-9\">The defendant pleaded, 1st, <em>not </em>guilty, to the whole declaration; 2d, <em>son assault </em>demesne, in the common form, to the first count in the declaration. The 3d plea was to the <em>first count </em>in the declaration, and stated, in substance, that the plaintiff made an assault upon one Ambrose Cadwell, and was beating him, &amp;c.; and the defendant, to preserve the peace, and to part the plaintiff from Cadwell, and prevent him from further beating him, gently laid his hands upon the plaintiff, as he lawfully might do, &amp;c.. And because the plaintiff continued to beat Cad-well, and attempted with great force, &amp;c. to throw him out of a carriage in which he was riding, to and upon the ground, to the great and imminent danger of the life and limbs of Cadwell, the defendant thereupon, to preserve the peace, and to save and deliver Cadwell, &amp;.c. did, necessarily and unavoidably, beat the plaintiff, as mentioned in the <em>first </em>count, which are the same trespasses, &lt;fcc. 4th. <em>Son assault </em>demesne, in the common form, to the 2d <em>count </em>in the declaration. 5th. The same plea to the 2d <em>count </em>as the the third plea was to the first count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-10\">To the 2d <em>plea, (son assault </em>demesne) the plaintiff replied <em>de injuria, </em>&amp;c. generally, and in the common form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-11\">To the 3d <em>plea, </em>he replied, in substance, the due issuing of a warrant by Simeon Bingham, Escp a justice of Oneida county, in favor of one Rowland Wilson, against Cadwell, under, and in pursuance of the act for the recovery of debts, to the value of twenty-five dollars, which warrant was delivered to the plaintiff, who was a constable of Vernon, in Oneida county, to be executed, &amp;c.; that he took Cadwell, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the warrant, and carried him before the justice, and that before he was duly discharged, he attempted to escape from the plaintiff\u2019s custody, against his will and consent, and that the defendant aided and abetted Cadwell in such attempt to escape. That Cadwell got into the defendant\u2019s carriage, who was furiously driving him off, &amp;c. wherefore the plaintiff gently laid his hands upon Cadwell, to prevent his escaping; and because Cadwell resisted with strong hand, &amp;c. the plaintiff, as, such constable, &amp;c. pulled Cadwell out of the carriage, as he lawfully might, &amp;c. doing no unnecessary damage, and exerting no unnecessary force, &amp;c. which is the same, &amp;c. mentioned in the <em>third, plea.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-4\">To the 4th <em>plea, (son assault </em>demesne,) the plaintiff replied <em>de injuria, </em>in the common form-.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">To the 5th <em>plea, </em>the plaintiff replied in the same manner as to the third plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">Upon the trial of the cause, the counsel for the plaintiff offered to prove, that the plaintiff, on the 23d day of May, 1822, was a constable of the town of Vernon, and, as such officer, had a warrant, which had been duly issued by Simeon Bingham, Esq. a justice of the peace of that town, at the suit of Rowland Wilson, against Ambrose Cadwell, by virtue of which warrant, he had arrested Cadwell, and had him, in custody; and that while the plaintiff so had Cadwell in his custody, the defendant attempted to rescue Cadwell from sutih custody and for that purpose persuaded Cadwell to get into the carriage of the defendant for the purpose of driving him off, out of the custody of the plaintiff ; that the plaintiff remonstrated against such conduct, and endeavored to dissuade Cadwell and the defendant from pursuing their intention. That the defendant well knew that Cadwell was in the plaintiff\u2019s custody, and that he told Cadwell to get in his carriage, and that he would bear Cadwell out in it, and would stand between him and all harm. That Cadwell accordingly did get into the defendant\u2019s carriage, and that the plaintiff, for the purpose of preventing the escape of Cadwell, 'stepped his foot upon the nave of the defendant\u2019s carriage wheel, and took hold of the lines of the defendant, and also took hold of Cadwell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>to take him from the carriage. That the defendant then immediately placed himself between the plaintiff and Cad well, for the purpose of preventing the plaintiff from taking Cadwell out of the carriage, and started his horse, and threw the breast of the plaintiff with great violence across the wheel of the carriage, and dragged him along the highway between the wheel and body of the carriage ; that the plaintiff, for the purpose of stopping the movement of the carriage took hold of the defendant\u2019s reins; and that the defendant struck the plaintiff across his face with the but of his whip.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-8\">To this evidence of the warrant and arrest, the counsel for the defendant objected, and'said that he relied upon his plea of not guilty, and his 2d and 4th pleas of <em>son assault demesne ; </em>that the offer of the plaintiff showed that he m\u00e1de the first assault upon the defendant, in wrongfully seizing his lines; and that the plaintiff could not, under his replication of <em>de </em>injuria, &lt;fcc. justify the assault upon the defendant by proving the warrant and arrest; but that the plaintiff, if he wished to give such evidence, should have replied specially and stated it in his replications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-9\">The defendant offered no evidence, and did not claim, or pretend to justify under his 3d or 5th pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-10\">The Judge overruled the evidence offered by the plaintiff of the warrant and arrest, upon the ground that the plaintiff could not give this evidence under his general replications of <em>de injuria, </em>&amp;c. but should have replied them' specially. The plaintiff then offered to give the same evidence under his replications to the 3d and 5th pleas of the defendant. To this the defendant objected, and it was overruled upon the ground that he had not claimed or attempted to justify under the 3d and 5th pleas. And the plaintiff thereupon submitted to a nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-11\"><em>J. C. Spencer, </em>for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGQ9\">now moved to set aside the nonsuit, and for a new trial. He said that <em>son assault demesne </em>were mere matter of excuse, to which <em>de injin ia sua, </em>&lt;fcc. might always be replied. (8 Co. Rep. 67, <em>a. </em>Yelv. 157. Cro. Jac. 224. Salk 637, 8. Willes, 54, 99, 204. 1 Chit. Pl. 763, 579, 584. 2 Saund. 294, note (1). 6 Bac. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Abr. <em>Trespass, </em>(I) pl. 4. <em>Replication. </em>4 John. Rep. 159. id. 112. T. Raym. 50. 12 John. 291.) If the general replication was all that the plea called for, it followed that the evidence offered was proper.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-5\"><em>G. G. Bronson, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8gL\">admitted the legal position taken, that <em>de injuria </em>was a proper replication; but said it is quite another question as to what may be evidence under it. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel has argued the question as if we had demurred to the replication. Evidence of a right to make the assault varies from the replication which is merely a traverse that the plaintiff made the first assault. It is but an issue upon that fact. We say he should have replied the warrant with the arrest, and carried us to an issue upon that. The other pleas did not help him. We had a right to consider them mere form, and not rely upon them at all; and we did so. He cited, <em>7 </em>John. Rep. 111; Carth. 280 ; 1 Chit. Pl. 582, 584; 2 id. 642, note, <em>(t) </em>(u); 2 Bl. Rep. 1165.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-6\"><em>Spencer, </em>in reply, admitted that had the action been against Cad well, it might have been necessary to reply specially. Not so as to third persons. The warrant and arrest, as to them, were mere matter of excuse; not of right. There is not a case at war with this distinction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b185-7\"><em>Curia, </em>per Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK58\">The evidence was properly rejected. The general replication, <em>de injuria, </em>&amp;c. denies that the plaintiff made the first assault, &amp;c. as alleged in the plea of <em>son assault. </em>Where the plea, therefore, is true in fact, and the plaintiff relies upon special circumstances or facts to justify the assault, which he admits he first made, he must set them out specially in his replication, and not reply generally <em>de injuria. </em>(Chit. Plead. 563,4.) When, in fact, therefore, the plaintiff made the first assault, or whenever, in answer to the defendant\u2019s plea of <em>son assault, </em>he relies upon new matter, he should not reply generally <em>de injuria, </em>but shoidd state such new matte.- specially. <em>(Sayre </em>v. <em>Earl of Rochford, </em>2 W. Bl. 1165. Garth. 280. 2 Chit. Pl. 643, <em>note,(t) (u). </em>5 Com. Dig. <em>Pleader, </em>(F. 18.) He cannot give it in evidence under the general replication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>of <em>de injuria. </em>In <em>Collier </em>v. Moulton, (7 John. 111,) Ch. J. Thompson says, if the defendant had <em>pleaded son assault, </em>instead of giving notice of it under the general issue, and the plaintiff intended to avail himself of the <em>moliter manus, Sec. </em>he must have replied specially; for he could not give it in evidence under the general replication, <em>de injuria sua propria. </em>20 Vin. 440. <em>King </em>et <em>ux. </em>v. <em>Peppard, </em>Comb. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The evidence being properly rejected under the general replication, and the defendant having given no evidence under his third plea, to which the special matter offered in evidence was replied specially, it could not be admitted under that replication. The nonsuit, therefore, was properly ordered; and the motion to set it aside, and for a now trial, must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
