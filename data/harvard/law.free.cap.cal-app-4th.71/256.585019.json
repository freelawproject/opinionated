We conclude that the showing of misconduct requires a new trial, but that the evidence did not warrant grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The accident that gave rise to this action occurred on the morning of October 21, 1991, at defendant\u2019s Los Angeles intermodal container transfer yard (yard), at which cargo containers are transferred between trailer trucks and railcars. Plaintiff was employed by defendant as a brakeman, working with Engineer Edward Fitzgerald and Conductor Victor Brown in assembling a freight train by backing (\u201cshoving\u201d) a group or \u201ccut\u201d of railroad cars from an adjacent yard. Fitzgerald ran the locomotive that shoved the cars, while plaintiff and Brown operated pickup trucks in the yard. The three maintained contact by radio. Fitzgerald\u2019s radio was mounted in the locomotive. Plaintiff carried his suspended on his chest by a neck strap.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s immediate assignment was to guard or \u201cprotect\u201d a grade crossing (J-crossing), frequently traversed by trucks, and over which the railcars would pass after proceeding from a curve through an underpass 462 feet away. The crossing was not equipped with gates or signals. It had \u201cstop\u201d indicators painted on the pavement, and plaintiff\u2019s truck was equipped with flashing red lights. Because Fitzgerald could not see ahead of the cars he was shoving, plaintiff served as his \u201ceyes\u201d at the crossing, assuring it was clear of traffic until the railcars entered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">As was common practice, plaintiff stopped his truck on the track at the J-crossing to obtain the earliest possible view of the railcars as they emerged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>from the underpass. After Conductor Brown radioed that he had thrown a switch necessary for the shove to proceed, plaintiff informed Brown and Fitzgerald by radio that he was at the J-crossing, protecting it, and that the shove, along track 812, could proceed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brown then said, \u201cOkay. Back up.\u201d Fitzgerald began the shove, attaining a speed of about eight miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Plaintiff then received a broadcast from Fitzgerald that locomotives for a long-haul train (\u201croad power\u201d) were coming out of the roundhouse, which would mean that a switch would have to be realigned to enable the crew\u2019s next scheduled operation. Plaintiff accordingly sought to contact the crew,of the \u201croad power,\u201d to request that they throw the switch after passing it. To do this, plaintiff turned his head downward to switch the radio from his \u201cyard\u201d frequency to a \u201croad\u201d channel, activate the talk button, and speak into the microphone.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">It took plaintiff three attempts to complete the call. He then looked up toward the underpass, and saw the shoved cars coming toward him. Plaintiff \u201chit the gas\u201d on his truck, but the engine died and the truck did not move. He then attempted to radio Fitzgerald to stop the train, twice stating, \u201cThat\u2019ll do\u201d (railroad jargon for \u201cstop\u201d). Fitzgerald, however, did not receive this transmission, because plaintiff\u2019s radio was still switched to the road channel. The cut of railcars crashed into plaintiff\u2019s truck, crushing it and dragging it several hundred feet.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff was not extracted from the wreckage for more than an hour. He suffered disabling leg and hand injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">At trial, plaintiff asserted several theories of defendant\u2019s negligence, causative of his injuries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among these was that defendant had provided an unsafe workplace by placing plaintiff on the tracks to guard the J-crossing, a condition that could have been obviated by maintaining crossing gates there.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">In this connection, rule 103 of defendant\u2019s general code of operating rules provided that \u201cWhen cars are shoved . . . over road crossings at grade, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>crew member must be in position on the ground at the crossing to warn traffic until it is occupied,\u201d but that \u201cSuch warning is not required when: flj] (1) Crossing gates are in fully lowered position . . . .\u201d The testimony repeatedly reflected that defendant had not placed crossing gates at the J-crossing. Testifying under Evidence Code section 776, Paul Earls, defendant\u2019s yard trainmaster (crew and rules supervisor) on the day of the accident, could provide no reasons why defendant had not done so, except to state that he had not seen crossing gates \u201cinside of a plant like that where it\u2019s solely operated by Southern Pacific employees.\u201d Earls further testified that as of the time of the accident, roughly 10 to 18 movements of trains over the J-crossing occurred during each 24-hour shift. He then was asked, assuming crossing arms had been present, \u201cIn the average 24 hours, there would be 10 to 18 occasions when those crossing arms would have to lower to protect the T crossing; right?\u201d Earls replied, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant offered no contradictory (or any other) evidence regarding the frequency with which gates at the J-crossing would be lowered during normal yard operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In his summation, plaintiff\u2019s counsel stressed Earls\u2019s testimony in connection with his argument that crossing gates or signals would have made safer the conditions under which plaintiff was required to protect the crossing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In reply, defendant\u2019s counsel urged that defendant\u2019s method of guarding the crossing had been reasonable, and noted that plaintiff had not called any expert to testify that crossing gates were necessary or advisable. Commencing his rebuttal, plaintiff\u2019s counsel again argued: \u201cI\u2019m still waiting. I didn\u2019t hear one word in explanation. Southern Pacific is definitely silent on why . . . don\u2019t you people put a guard gate up at that crossing at T? You would only have to move it 10 to 18 times every 24 hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The case was submitted to the jury on a special verdict, requiring it first to determine whether defendant had been negligent and then, if so, to decide issues of causation, comparative negligence, and damages. By a vote of nine to three, the jury found that defendant had not been negligent. Judgment for defendant accordingly was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Plaintiff moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial. Both motions asserted insufficiency of the evidence to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>verdict. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 629, 657, subd. 6.) In addition, the motion for new trial cited jury misconduct. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657, subd. 2.) In that connection, plaintiff tendered the declaration of Prentice Brown, one of the three jurors who had dissented from the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Among other things, Brown\u2019s declaration related certain statements and conduct by another juror, Fred Silverman, during the jury\u2019s deliberations. On voir dire, Silverman had identified himself as a career transportation consultant who did \u201csome work, mainly with public agencies, but very often involving railroad operations, mainly grade crossings . . . .\u201d On questioning by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, he stated that he had driven through the yard in connection with property acquisition, and that \u201cthere are other places, not in yards, where I have looked at line sections and grade crossings, grade crossing problems.\u201d Silverman stated he had not done any work regarding grade crossing safety or equipment design, nor had he had such training, but he was \u201caware of devices, aware of regulations, et cetera.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">According to Brown\u2019s declaration, during deliberations another juror, Hobson, who also ultimately voted for plaintiff, had broached the issue of whether defendant should have installed crossing arms at the J-crossing. Silverman then had \u201cstood up and said, \u2018No, that\u2019s totally wrong because you\u2019ve got trains sitting on that track,\u2019 and he drew a diagram on the blackboard where [defendant] in his opinion would place these sensors, and he offered the suggestion, \u2018If they place these sensors here, because this is a rail yard, there would be cars sitting on the tracks all the time and the arms would be down all the time because there are cars just sitting there waiting to be picked up.\u2019 He said, \u2018This is the reason why the arms weren\u2019t installed.\u2019 \u201d As Brown added, there had been no evidence introduced about sensors controlling crossing gates.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In response to Brown\u2019s declaration, defendant offered declarations by three other jurors. Ail of them confirmed Brown\u2019s account to some extent, and none contradicted it. Silverman himself declared that after Juror Hobson opined that gates should have been present, \u201cI indicated to Mr. Hobson that the sensors whic\u00ed operated crossing gates would make it impractical to have gates at the location of the accident, because they would be triggered all day long.\u201d Silverman also stated that he did not recall who had first used the term \u201csensors\u201d in the. deliberations, but that the \u201cdiscussion\u201d of them had lasted \u201cfive minutes at the most.\u201d Juror Janice Moore similarly declared that Silverman had \u201cexplained that sensors at that location would be triggering all day and it would not make sense to have them there. The entire issue of sensors was only discussed for approximately three to four minutes during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the jury deliberations.\u201d Foreperson Michael Weidlein also declared that sensors had been discussed for a few minutes in relation to the use of crossing gates.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The trial court denied the motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">1. <em>Jury Misconduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">We consider first plaintiff s contention that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for new trial on grounds of prejudicial jury misconduct. The misconduct asserted consisted of Juror Silverman\u2019s opining to the jury regarding the absence and feasibility of crossing arms or gates at the J-crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">As noted, the evidence of Juror Silverman\u2019s conduct was uncontradicted. Moreover, it was clearly admissible. All of the declaration testimony set forth above related statements and conduct occurring during deliberations, as distinguished from asserted or attempted proof of the mental processes of the jury. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1150, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">Presentation to or reception by a jury of new evidence from sources outside the trial evidence constitutes misconduct. (7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Trial, \u00a7 338, pp. 382-383, and cases there cited.) This includes expert opinions about issues in the case that are not based on the evidence. As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cIt is not improper for a juror, regardless of his or her educational or employment background, to express an opinion on a technical subject, so long as the opinion is based on the evidence at trial. Jurors\u2019 views of the evidence, moreover, are necessarily informed by their life experiences, including their education and professional work. A juror, however, should not discuss an opinion explicitly based on specialized information obtained from outside sources. Such injection of external information in the form of a juror\u2019s own claim to expertise or specialized knowledge of a matter at issue is misconduct.\u201d <em>(In re Malone </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 935, 963 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 281, 911 P.2d 468].)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">Juror Silverman\u2019s comments to the jury, in the nature of an expert opinion concerning the placement of crossing gate \u201csensors,\u201d their operation, and the consequent reason why gates had not been or could not be installed at the J-crossing, constituted misconduct under the foregoing rules. Speaking with the authority of a professional transportation consultant, Silverman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>interjected the subject of \u201csensors,\u201d on which there had been no evidence at trial. He also expounded, and apparently illustrated with a diagram, his opinions about where such sensors would be placed to operate crossing gates for the J-crossing, how yard operations would activate those sensors, and consequently that gates would be infeasible to protect the crossing because they would continually block it.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">This exposition went far beyond the evidence in the case. Silverman contradicted the testimony of defendant\u2019s own trainmaster, Earls, with respect to the frequency with which crossing gates would have been lowered, and also offered a rationale for the absence of gates, which Earls had been unable to provide. (Cf. <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Doulton </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 945, 947, 949-951 [169 Cal.Rptr. 550] [not misconduct for engineer juror to draw diagram of accident location based solely on his impression of the testimony].) Silverman\u2019s opinion not only derived from sources outside the evidence, but also rebutted a significant element of plaintiff\u2019s proof, which was otherwise undisputed. It was clearly misconduct. <em>(In re Malone, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 963; see <em>Wagner, supra, </em>at pp. 949-950.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Defendant contends that Silverman\u2019s statements should be considered permissible inasmuch as \u201cplaintiff never presented evidence to support his crossing gates argument,\u201d instead leaving its determination to the jury\u2019s common experience. This is an inaccurate characterization. First, plaintiff did present evidence that his workplace involved a crossing at which there were no gates, and which he was instead required to \u201cprotect\u201d by placing himself on the tracks in his truck. Moreover, plaintiff presented specific evidence, through Earls, about the very point that Silverman later rebutted, namely the frequency with which crossing gates would have to operate had they been present at the J-crossing, and thus the practicality of that alternative. No more was required for the jury to reach a conclusion of negligence by failure to provide a safe work place.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Furthermore, contrary to defendant\u2019s implication, Silverman\u2019s statements were not matters of common experience. They involved his own opinions about where \u201csensors\u201d for the J-crossing gates would be placed and how the traffic in the yard would cause them to operate. The trial evidence about the operation of gates was limited to Earls\u2019s testimony as to the frequency with which they would be lowered. It made no reference to \u201csensors\u201d (or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>means of control) or their placement. Silverman\u2019s embellishment of this state of the evidence brought to bear not common knowledge but purported expert (and ex parte) rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Defendant also cites <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Preventive Medicine Medical Group, Inc. </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 728, 742 [223 Cal.Rptr. 859], in which the court termed it \u201cinappropriate\u201d for the defendant to complain about a juror\u2019s having disclosed her own pain and suffering during deliberations, when the defendant had not sought on voir dire to eliminate jurors with such experiences. Defendant suggests that having accepted Silverman as a juror with knowledge of his background, plaintiff should not be heard to complain of his use of it in deliberations. We find the analogy unacceptable. Plaintiff did explore Silverman\u2019s background on voir dire, but his answers neither disclosed nor intimated that he would later be moved to interject opinions based on sources outside the trial evidence, in contradiction of it. (Cf. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Covell </em>(1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 947, 952 [161 Cal.Rptr. 377] ,)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although voir dire is the primary vehicle for searching out bias in prospective jurors, it cannot clairvoyantly anticipate misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The remaining question is whether the misconduct was prejudicial, so as to have required a grant of a new trial.  \u201cWhether prejudice arose from juror misconduct. . . is a mixed question of law and fact subject to an appellate court\u2019s independent determination. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nesler </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 561, 582 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 454, 941 P.2d 87].) A showing of misconduct creates a presumption of prejudice, which in turn \u201cmay be rebutted by an affirmative evidentiary showing that prejudice does not exist or by a reviewing court\u2019s examination of the entire record to determine whether there is a reasonable probability of actual harm to the complaining party resulting from the misconduct. [Citations.] Some of the factors to be considered when determining whether the presumption is rebutted are the strength of the evidence that misconduct occurred, the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, and the probability that actual prejudice may have ensued.\u201d <em>(Hasson </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 388, 417 [185 Cal.Rptr. 654, 650 P.2d 1171], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">More recently, the Supreme Court has stated that in criminal cases reversal is required \u201c[w]hen the misconduct in question supports a finding that there is a substantial likelihood that at least one juror was impermissibly influenced to the defendant\u2019s detriment.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1990) 50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Cal.3d 907, 951 [269 Cal.Rptr. 269, 790 P.2d 676]; accord, <em>In re Malone, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 964.) The test is an objective one, calling for inquiry as to whether the misconduct \u201c \u2018is inherently likely to have influenced the juror.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marshall, supra, </em>at p. 951.) This analysis of prejudice \u201cis different from, and indeed less tolerant than,\u201d normal harmless error analysis, because jury misconduct threatens the structural integrity of the trial. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Although stated in criminal cases, this rationale applies to civil cases as well, because civil litigants too are constitutionally entitled to a fair trial before an unbiased jury. <em>(Province </em>v. <em>Center for Women\u2019s Health &amp; Family Birth </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1673, 1679 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 667], disapproved on another point in <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Norcal Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 30, 41 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 876 P.2d 999]; <em>Glage </em>v. <em>Hawes Firearms Co. </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 314, 322 [276 Cal.Rptr. 430].) Moreover, a substantial likelihood that one juror was adversely affected would also require reversal in a civil case, like the present one, in which the verdict was nine to three. (See <em>Province, supra, </em>at p. 1680; <em>Glage, supra, </em>at p. 323, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">We have previously reviewed the evidence of misconduct in this case. It is clear and undisputed. Moreover, we cannot agree with defendant\u2019s characterization of the episode as \u201ctrivial.\u201d Juror Silverman\u2019s exposition and demonstration may have been relatively brief, but they directly contradicted the trial evidence concerning a significant element of plaintiff\u2019s theory of unsafe workplace: the feasibility of crossing arms at the J-crossing. The thrust of Silverman\u2019s illustrated remarks, as attested to by himself as well as other jurors, was that plaintiff\u2019s theory of how due care could have made his workplace safer was extrinsically unrealistic, impractical, and worthy of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Defendant contends that the misconduct could not have harmed plaintiff because this theory was unsupported by evidence. The premise of the argument remains inaccurate. (See fn. 8, ante.) Defendant further argues that because, according to Juror Brown\u2019s declaration, the jurors had already tentatively aligned nine to three in defendant\u2019s favor when Juror Silverman addressed them, it is unlikely that his comments had any impact. We cannot be so confident. In the first place, Brown\u2019s declaration was ambiguous as to the sequence and firmness of the jury\u2019s divisions in relation to when Silverman spoke. In any event, as described Silverman\u2019s remarks were strong and pertinent. They inherently carried a substantial probability of impact and influence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 951.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">We conclude that the presumption of prejudice has not been rebutted. The misconduct was clear and severe, and it directly devalued the otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>undisputed evidence on a significant aspect of plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case regarding an unsafe workplace. In light of the entire record, as well as the closeness of the verdict, we believe that there is a substantial likelihood that plaintiff was thereby harmed. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 950- 951; <em>Hasson </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 417.) The trial court should have granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for new trial on grounds of jury misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">2. <em>The Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The judgment is reversed.
