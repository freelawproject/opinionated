She was fired in April 1992 for allegedly falsifying her time sheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Thompson sued the hospital for breach of an oral contract not to discharge her without good cause and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. She alleged her termination was pretextual and designed to deprive her of accrued retirement and pension benefits. She was 56 years old at the time of her termination, 6 years away from retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">The jury was instructed, \u201c[tjhere is a presumption under the laws of California that employment is at will [and] . . . may be terminated by either the employer or the employee at any time, for any reason, good, bad, or nonexistent. . . .\u201d The jury was further instructed that the hospital had the legal right to dismiss Thompson if she failed to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of an oral contract requiring good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The jurors found there was such an oral contract and the hospital fired Thompson without just cause and breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Damages were assessed at $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">The hospital moved for a new trial. It attached declarations from three dissenting jurors showing the damages were inflated by one-third in order to cover plaintiff\u2019s attorney fees. Thompson opposed the new trial motion with declarations from some of the majority jurors denying any agreement to increase the damages to include attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">The judge had retired, and a substitute heard the new trial motion. He expressed the view the award was excessive and should be reduced from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>$75,000 to $56,000. To avoid a new trial, Thompson accepted the remittitur \u201cin the spirit of putting an end to this litigation . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The minute order directed counsel to prepare the appropriate notices. The hospital subsequently produced a notice of ruling explaining why the conditional new trial order was granted. The court never drafted or filed a specification of reasons of its own. The hospital filed this ill-advised appeal from the judgment as reduced by the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The hospital correctly contends the court lacked authority to issue a remittitur for any reason other than excessive damages, and in no case without preparing its own specification of reasons. But the hospital\u2019s reliance on a technicality has produced, appropriately enough, only a technical victory. Rather than ordering a new trial, as the hospital desires, the proper course is to reinstate the original judgment. Thus, by \u201csucceeding\u201d in this appeal, the hospital obtains a $19,000 increase in liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The remittitur is a judicially developed device, codified in Code of Civil Procedure section 662.5, to allow trial judges who disagree with a jury\u2019s determination of damages to order a conditional new trial unless the plaintiff agrees to a reduced damage award. The Supreme Court has held the remittitur is only to be used \u201cto reduce excess damages\u201d and cannot be employed \u201cbeyond that limited context.\u201d <em>(Schelbauer </em>v. <em>Butler Manufacturing Co. </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 442, 454 [198 Cal.Rptr. 155, 673 P.2d 743, 38 A.L.R.4th 566] [no remittitur to reassess percentages of comparative fault among parties].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Jury misconduct may result in excessive damages and support a remittitur. That was the situation in <em>Tramell </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>(1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 157, 171 [209 Cal.Rptr. 427], where the trial judge concluded damages were excessive based on juror declarations stating that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel \u201cwould receive 33% of what we awarded to Mrs. Tramell and her children . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 163, fn. 2.) <em>Tramell </em>held use of a remittitur \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>a permissible procedure. . . . There is no legal or logical impediment to the trial judge\u2019s decision that juror misconduct was an objective fact which improperly influenced the verdict herein.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">But, as <em>Tramell </em>itself recognized, orders granting new trials on the ground of excessive damages must be accompanied by a written specification of reasons prepared and filed by the trial judge. (163 Cal.App.3d at pp. 168-169; see also <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 104, 115 [65 Cal.Rptr. 315, 436 P.2d 315] [\u201c[I]f the ground is \u2018misconduct of the jury\u2019 . . . the judge should specify this improper method of deliberation as the basis of his action\u201d].) And the Supreme Court has strictly interpreted the statutory requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 657 for a written specification of reasons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Trial judges have a \u201cclear and unmistakable duty\u201d to timely specify their grounds and reasons for granting a new trial, \u201cand we expect that such duty will be faithfully discharged.\u201d <em>(Treber </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 128, 136 [65 Cal.Rptr. 330, 436 P.2d 330].) An oral explanation will not suffice, and the task cannot be transferred to trial counsel. <em>(La Manna </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 413, 422 [118 Cal.Rptr. 761, 530 P.2d 1073] [substantial compliance unacceptable]; see also <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 468, 484 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 338] [reversing new trial order as to punitive damages where \u201cthe trial court assigned no ground therefor and gave no reasons whatever\u201d]; <em>Steinhart </em>v. <em>South Coast Area Transit </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 770, 774 [228 Cal.Rptr. 283] [\u201cwords can easily trip off the tongue, whereas to write them down, to pin them to the page so they are permanent and not an evanescent utterance, requires more time, deliberation, and labor\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">No such specification of reasons issued here, only the ineffective musings and writings of court and counsel like those in the cases above. Neither the transcript of the new trial hearing nor defense counsel\u2019s notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>ruling satisfied the statutory requirement. And Thompson\u2019s immediate consent to the remittitur made no difference. <em>(Greenfield </em>v. <em>Spectrum Investment Corp. </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 111, 122 [219 Cal.Rptr. 805]; see also 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7 122, p. 626 [\u201cThe requirements of C.C.P. 657 are applicable to conditional new trial orders entered pursuant to C.C.P. 662.5, \u2018even when subsequent actions of a party fulfilling a condition stated therein have the effect of negating that order for new trial.\u2019 \u201d].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The failure to supply an adequate specification of reasons renders the new trial order defective, but not void. Instead the hospital, as the party seeking a new trial, has the burden to sustain that position on appeal with \u201c \u2018a record and argument to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sanchez-Corea </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 900.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We independently review all the grounds advanced for the new trial motion and will sustain the order \u201cif it should have been granted upon any ground stated in the motion, whether or not specified in the order or specification of reasons . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657.) That review includes searching the record, with the assistance of the party for whom the new trial was granted, \u201cto find support for any <em>other </em>ground stated in the motion . . . .\u201d <em>(Mercer </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 119.) While we give \u201cconsiderable weight to the expressed opinion of the trial court\u201d <em>(Malkasian </em>v. <em>Irwin </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 738, 749 [40 Cal.R.ptr. 78, 394 P.2d 822]), we nonetheless exercise our own judgment, following our review of the record, to determine whether a new trial is legally required.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The court had no adequate basis for a new trial order, conditional or otherwise. <em>(Sanchez-Corea </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 906.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>We do not construe the juror declarations taken as a whole to show an express or implied agreement by the jury to inflate the verdict to include attorney fees. Other jurors contradicted the assertion of the three dissenting jurors. And the $75,000 awarded by the jury was the same amount requested in plaintiff\u2019s closing argument to cover her missed opportunities for overtime and lost pension plan benefits. That request included no claim for attorney fees. After examining the record, we conclude a new trial was not required as a matter of law because of alleged jury misconduct \u2014 or anything else.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Under like circumstances the court in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Preventive Medicine Medical Group, Inc. </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 728 [223 Cal.Rptr. 859] affirmed the denial of a new trial for jury misconduct. In <em>Moore </em>two juror declarations were introduced to show a discussion among the jurors regarding the plaintiff\u2019s probable contingency fee obligation to his attorney. Distinguishing <em>Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 59 [137 Cal.Rptr. 863, 562 P.2d 1022], the court found the declarations insufficient to \u201cestablish \u2018[a]n express agreement by the jurors to include such fees in their verdict, or extensive discussion evidencing an implied agreement to that effect.\u2019 [Citations.] .... The declarants do not suggest an express agreement was reached and the discussion they relate could hardly be characterized as extensive.\u201d <em>(Moore, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d at pp. 740-741, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">III, IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">In view of Thompson\u2019s rule violations on appeal, we decline to award her costs. Her respondent\u2019s brief was grossly defective, containing no references to the reporter\u2019s transcript and substituting invective for substantive analysis. Unnecessary time and court resources were consumed in returning the brief to counsel for resubmission of a new brief with appropriate transcript references. <em>(Alicia T. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 869, 885 [271 Cal.Rptr. 513].)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The new trial order is reversed, and judgment is ordered to be entered on the verdict.

We see no principled reason, for example, why trial judges may not state their reasons for granting a new trial on a reported record, or why they cannot delegate to counsel the task of preparing the specification of reasons. In the similar context of a bench trial, for example, judges customarily request the prevailing party to draft a proposed statement of decision. (See <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Malone </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 18, 21 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 454]; <em>In re Rodrigo S. </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1179, 1183 [276 Cal.Rptr. 183].) These matters, however, are for the Legislature, not us. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe power of the [Legislature [in] specifying procedural steps for new trials is exclusive and unlimited. . . . [T]he judiciary, in its interpretation of legislative enactments may not usurp the legislative function by substituting its own ideas for those expressed by the [Ljegislature.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Sanchez-Corea </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 905, fn. 5.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\">In contrast, where there is a specification of reasons for a new trial order based on jury misconduct, appellate courts defer to the trial judge\u2019s determination regarding misconduct and prejudice and will not interfere \u201c \u2018unless a manifest and unmistakable abuse of discretion clearly appears.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Weathers </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 98, 109 [95 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 516, 485 P.2d 1132].) <em>Weathers </em>affirmed a new trial order in a medical malpractice case where juror declarations showed one juror telephoned his own doctor \u201cand obtained his opinion, which was communicated to the other jurors, that viral encephalitis \u2018was an incurable and fatal disease, and that the decedent. . . was doomed from the beginning so, what were we doing here, and why didn\u2019t we get this thing over with.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 107.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 544.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
