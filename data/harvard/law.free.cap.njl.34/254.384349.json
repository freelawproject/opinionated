An assessment for taxes in a school district made upon real estate only, is illegal, and the assessor has no authority to alter the duplicate by extending the assessment to the personal estate of those assessed, and adding the names of others not assessed, after the duplicate has been delivered to the collector.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b274-6\">2. On an appeal to commissioners by several parties, they are to deal with each case separately, and if the particular tax appealed from is remitted as being illegal, the commissioners have no authority to remit it to others who have not appealed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b274-7\">3. If a collector has acted in good faith, under the order of a tribunal having jurisdiction of the subject matter, until the time has passed in which he should make return of delinquents, and obtain a tax warrant to enforce payment of the tax, and his term of office has expired by its own limitation, he is powerless to obey the mandate of this court, if he should be directed to proceed and collect the tax.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b274-8\">4.

The tax should have been levied on the real and personal property of the taxable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>inhabitants of the district and their estates, and the taxable property therein, in the same manner as township taxes are assessed. <em>Nix. Dig. </em>879, \u00a7 80.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The subsequent alteration in the duplicate by adding names and extending the assessment to personal property, retaining the same rate, and thereby greatly increasing the sum assessed beyond that authorized to be raised, was grossly irregular.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">These illegalities and irregularities were undoubtedly sufficient to enable those against whom \u00bfhe tax was assessed to avoid it altogether, on proceedings by way of <em>certiorari </em>or appeal to the commissioners of appeal in cases of taxation. By the eighth section of the general tax law, <em>(Nix. Dig. </em>939,) any person aggrieved by an assessment of taxes made against him, may appeal to the commissioners of appeal in cases of taxation in and for the township, who, by the forty-ninth section, are required, after due examination of the facts and consideration of the case, to give such judgment as shall be agreeable to the principles of justice, which judgment shall be final and conclusive, and shall be rendered within three days after the hearing of such appeal; and by the next succeeding: section the commissioners are required to give a transcript of such judgment, in case it shall be in favor of the appellant, which transcript is made a sufficient voucher to him, and the collector, in collecting the taxes of the same, and every other officer whom it may concern, is directed to govern himself accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">It is obvious that in discharging these duties, the commissioners should deal with the individual tax-payer, and not with the assessment in gross. The appeal is to be made by the party aggrieved, and the transcript of the decision of the commissioners is to be given to him as his voucher. In this case, appeal was made by a number of the persons against whom this tax was assessed; how many, does not appear, but it is manifest that all who were taxed did not complain of the assessment. Upon these individual complaints the commissioners swept away the entire assessment of this tax, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>comprising assessments against three hundred and seventy persons, and the transcript of their proceedings delivered to the collector contains all these names, with the respective assessments against each. It would be impossible to sustain these proceedings of the commissioners, if before us directly for review. They can only be excused by the palpable irregularities in the assessment, which it was impossible to remedy except by remodeling the entire assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">But was the collector bound to disregard the action of the commissioners ? They were a tribunal who had jurisdiction over the subject matter. In all respects, except in form, the certificate was such as the law recognized, and which it was made his duty to obey. The commissioners had power to remit the assessment against each individual named in it, on an individual application for that purpose. The collector was not bound to know how the case of each of the persons was brought before the commissioners \u2014 either at the regular or a \u2022special meeting \u2014 much less to involve himself in a litigation with each tax-payer, to defend the action of the commissioners. In entire good faith, so far as appears, he conformed to the order of the commissioners, until the time had passed within which he should make return of delinquents to a justice of the peace, to obtain a tax warrant to enforce the payment of the tax. His term of office has since expired, by its own limitation, and he is powerless to obey the mandate of thia court} if he should be directed to proceed and collect the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">A writ of <em>mandamus </em>will not in general be allowed, unless the act commanded to be done is legally possible when the writ issues; consequently, a return showing that the person against whom it issued has not the power to do the act, is good. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>L. &amp; N. W. R. R. Co., </em>16 <em>Q. B. </em>864; <em>The King </em>v. <em>Twyford, </em>5 <em>Ad. &amp; El. </em>436; <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Ambergale, &amp;c., Railway Co., </em>1 <em>E. &amp; B. </em>372; <em>The People </em>v. <em>The Supervisors of Greene, </em>12 <em>Barb. </em>217 ; <em>Great Western R. R. </em>v. <em>The </em>Queen, 1 <em>E. &amp; B. </em>874 <em>; Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims </em>240; 15 <em>Barb. </em>607; 24 <em>Barb. </em>166.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The exceptions to this general rule are few, and are stated in the opinion of the Chief Justice, in <em>Silverthorne </em>v. <em>Th</em>e <em>Warren Railroad Co., </em>4 <em>Vroom </em>173. The case now before the court is not within any of the exceptions to the general rule. Indeed, with respect to magistrates and officers having only public duties to perform, the courts will refuse to award a <em>mandamus </em>when the performance of the duty commanded will involve the officer in litigation, the issue of which is in-doubt. In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Greame, </em>2 <em>Ad. &amp; El. </em>615, it was held that the court will not compel a magistrate, by <em>mandamus, </em>to-issue a distress warrant for a highway rate, upon the occupier of lands within his district, if it appear that in the magistrate\u2019s belief, and in fact, there is a legal doubt as to the occupiers being liable to contribute to the repairs of the parish highways, and that the magistrate is liable to be sued if the warrant is granted, and this although the-occupier has not appealed against the rate. In <em>The King v. Sillifant, </em>4 <em>Ad. &amp; El. </em>354, the King\u2019s Bench refused to award a <em>mandamus </em>to a justice-to enforce the payment of a church rate, which had been affirmed in the Ecclesiastical Court, the jurisdiction of the justice to issue process being a matter in doubt. See, also, per Lord Campbell, C. J., in <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>2 <em>E. &amp; B. </em>204.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">If the defendant has been guilty of official misconduct in relation to this matter, he may be punished by indictment. That punishment it is not the province of this court to inflict, by the use of the writ of <em>mandamus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The motion to quash is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Bedle and Dalrimple, Justices, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Cited <em>in State, Trustees, &amp;c., pros., v.
