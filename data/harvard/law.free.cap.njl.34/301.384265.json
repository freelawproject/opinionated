That the word <em>accepted, </em>as applied to an act of the legislature, having no fixed legal signification, is not sufficient to show that the defendants agreed or consented to assume the position, of lessees under the act; and 2. That there could be no acceptance of the act unless in writing and under the seal of the company; and that such an acceptance ought to have been alleged in this declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Assuming what cannot.be controverted \u2014 that the legislature had no power, and could not have intended to make a contract for these defendants, and to bind them as lessees, without their consent, express or implied \u2014 fit follows that such consent must appear on the face of the declaration. For it is a fundamental rule of pleading that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>most allege in his declaration <em>all that is essential </em>to his right of action. <em>Gould\u2019s Pl., ch. </em>4, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">On the part of the state it is urged that if in no other way, such consent certainly does appear from the averment that the defendants <em>aeeepted, the aet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The first question to be determined is, as to the legal effect and meaning of this averment.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">It may be admitted that the word <em>aeeepted </em>has no fixed technical signification as applied to an act of the <em>legislature; </em>and yet it can hardly be doubted, that, as applied to an act of this character \u2014 to the charter of a private corporation or a supplement to such a charter, which this act seems in effect to be \u2014 this word is, and has been, commonly used to signify assent and agreement to all the terms and provisions contained in such act or charter. This is its usual and natural meaning, and in this sense it must be understood in this declaration, unless it will bear some other sense more favorable to the defendants. For if there is any other sense in which the averment in question may be fairly understood, the defendants may- insist upon that sense as against the state. <em>(Gould\u2019s Pl., ch. </em>3, \u00a7 54, <em>and cases cited; Steph. Pl. </em>378, <em>and n. </em>29.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">But as the very purpose of the act was to make this lease | as the powers of the company were enlarged simply with a view to their acceptance of the lease, and only so far ?is was <em>mmttmy </em>to enable them to enjoy its advantages; and as the lease and its provisions constitute the entire body of the act, so that if these are taken away there is nothing left, I am wholly unable to understand how the defendants could, in any fair or rational sense, accept the act, and not at the same time accept and agree to the provisions of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">It was further insisted on the part of the defendants, that there could be no valid acceptance of the act unless it was in writing and under the seal of the company j and that the state was, therefore, bound to allego <em>sueh </em>an acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">But admitting it to be true that the acceptance, to be valid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>must have been in writing and \u00bfunder seal, it does not follow that these circumstances must be alleged in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">If they .are in fact necessary, as the counsel for the defendants insist, to constitute a legal acceptance of the act, to admit that the def\u00e9ndants accepted the act, necessarily implies that they accepted with these essential circumstances \u2014 -just as the averment of a feoffment implies livery of seisin; or as the averment of a surrender implies that the lessor entered. 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Pl. </em>253.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In the same book it is said \u2014 referring to 2 <em>Saund. </em>305, <em>n. </em>13 \u2014 \u201c In pleading an acceptance by a corporation of an assignee of the lessee as tenant, it is not necessary to show that the acceptance was by deed, for an acceptance being pleaded, everything that would render it a good acceptance is implied.\u201d <em>Chitty\u2019s Pl. </em>253.</p>\n<p id=\"AUb\">But I do not understand the rule to be, either in England or in. this country, that the acceptance of a charter \u2014 to-which the acceptance alleged here seems clearly analogous\u2014 to be binding must be by writing and under seal. In the-case of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>7 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>708, (14 <em>E. C. L. </em>111,) the question was as to the form under which the burgesses of Stafford were bound to signify their assent to the charter,. &amp;c.; and Lord Tenterden, C. J., upon that point, says: <em>\u201c </em>It has long been the received opinion that there must be an acceptance, but the mode of proving it has always been left open. In general, the acceptance of a charter has been proved by evidence of acting under it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">And Bayley, J., upon the same point, says there had been a valid acceptance by \u201ca majority of the burgesses signifying their acceptance of the charter, either, in writing or by-acting under it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">And Littledale, J., in the same case, says: \u201cI am of opinion that any unequivocal act of the parties showing their assent to accept and b$ governed by the charter is sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">In <em>Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations </em>it is said: <em>\u201c </em>It is not indispensable to show a written -instrument, or even a vote-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>of acceptance; and there may be many instances in which an acceptance can be inferred.\u201d See also <em>Bank of U. S. </em>v. <em>Dandridge, </em>12 <em>Wheat. </em>71, and other American cases cited in <em>Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, </em>\u00a7 83 and in <em>Abb. Dig. L. Cor. </em>147-148.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">This question, however, does not appear to be necessarily involved in the decision of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">For if the fact of acceptance is sufficiently alleged, as I think it is, the effect of the demurrer is to admit it; and such admission disposes of the case, without determining what kind of acceptance the state will be bound to prove in order to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The first and fourth counts, which allege acceptance by the defendants, being good, there must be judgment on the \u25a0demurrer for the state.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
