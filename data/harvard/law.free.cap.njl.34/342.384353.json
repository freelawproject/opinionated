The motion, when subsequently renewed, the same day in the presence of the adverse counsel, was denied, and the appeal dismissed. It sufficiently appears that the defect, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>which the dismissal rests, could have been cured without occasioning any delay, if the motion had been granted when first made, and that the appellant has been deprived of a trial of his cause without any fault of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">If the rule had been ordered when first applied for, and the justice\u2019s return had not been procured before the appeal was peremptorily called, a different case would be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The affidavits are competent to show a case of surprise, and their admissibility is not in conflict with <em>Scott </em>v. Beatty, 2 <em>Zab. </em>256, or <em>Paterson and Ramapo Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>4 <em>Zab. </em>535. If the appellant had not understood that his application was to be granted at a later hour, he would have insisted upon having the rule when first asked for, and might have perfected his transcript in dne season.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The rule to show cause must be made absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\"><em>Mandamus </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
