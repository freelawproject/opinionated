The trial court granted Pacific Shore\u2019s summary judgment motion following <em>King </em>v. <em>State of Cal. </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 784 F.2d 910, cert. den. <em>sub nom. King v. California </em>(1987) 484 U.S. 802 [98 L.Ed.2d 11, 108 S.Ct. 47], rehg. den. 484 U.S. 971 [98 L.Ed.2d 412, 108 S.Ct. 412] <em>(King), </em>ruling that once having refinanced their first loan, the Lozos had nothing left to rescind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">In the published portion of this opinion, we decline to follow <em>King, </em>and are instead persuaded by the reasoning of myriad federal courts from other circuits. We hold that borrowers are not precluded from rescinding a consumer credit transaction that is secured by their residence and subject to TILA merely because they have already refinanced that loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">In the unpublished portion, we hold that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment of the Lozos\u2019 claim under the Unfair Business Practices Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200, the UCL) because a lender\u2019s violation of TILA can be an unfair business practice or act under the UCL. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SYNOPSIS</p>\n<p id=\"ALP\">1. <em>The loan and the refinance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">The facts are undisputed. On August 7, 2000, defendants and cross-complainants, the Lozos, obtained a nonpurchase money mortgage in the amount of $28,000 secured by a deed of trust against their home. The lender was plaintiff and cross-defendant Pacific Shore, a residential mortgage lender. The loan carried an interest rate of 13.375 percent. Pacific Shore, charged, among other things, origination, funding, processing, and settlement fees in excess of $2,800, which amounted to more than 10 percent of the principal amount of the loan. Because the points and fees charged by Pacific Shore exceeded 8 percent of the total loan amount, it was considered a high cost loan and thus subject to the disclosure requirements of TILA. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1602(aa), 1635(a), 1639(a) &amp; (b); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.32(a)(1) (2006).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">In June 2002, the Lozos obtained a second loan from Pacific Shore in the amount of $71,600, which was used, among other things, to pay off the full outstanding balance of the first loan. The Lozos were also charged a prepayment penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">In April 2003, the Lozos attempted to rescind the first loan by notifying Pacific Shore. Pacific Shore rejected the demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>2. <em>The lawsuit and summary judgment motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Pacific Shore filed its complaint against the Lozos seeking a judicial declaration that the August 2000 loan agreement was valid and binding according to its terms, and the Lozos were not entitled to rescind it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">The Lozos responded with a cross-complaint asserting that the first loan was subject to the disclosure requirements of TILA and Federal Reserve Board Regulation Z implementing it (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.1 (2006)). Under TILA, the Lozos alleged that Pacific Shore had failed to properly and timely provide mandated disclosures and had rejected their attempt to rescind the first loan agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">Pacific Shore moved for summary judgment on the grounds, there being no dispute of fact, that based on long-standing authority in <em>King, supra, </em>784 F.2d 910, the Lozos\u2019 repayment of the first loan terminated any rights they may have had to rescind it under TILA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">The Lozos opposed the summary judgment motion by arguing that <em>King </em>was improperly decided and not binding. They enumerated the specific TILA omissions: (1) The notice of the right to rescind did not include the date of the transaction or the deadline by which the notice of rescission must be sent (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(a); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.23(b) (2006))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; and (2) Pacific Shore failed to provide, at least three business days before the execution of the first loan\u2019s documents, two copies of the consumer disclosures of the (a) interest rate, (b) monthly payments, (c) borrowers\u2019 right not to complete the transaction, along with notices that (d) the borrowers risked losing their home if they did not meet their loan obligations. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639(a)(1) &amp; (2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">The trial court granted Pacific Shore\u2019s summary judgment motion. In so doing, the court determined that \u201c[i]t is undisputed that the loan ... in this case had been refinanced in full prior to the time that the Lozos sought to exercise a right of rescission of that loan under the Truth in Lending Act. In <em>King </em>... the court held that a loan which had been refinanced could not be rescinded under the federal Truth in Lending Act . . . because \u2018there is nothing to rescind.\u2019 \u201d The Lozos appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">1. <em>Standard of review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">Summary judgment is granted when a moving party establishes the absence of a triable issue of material fact and the right to entry of judgment as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c); <em>Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493].) \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018We review the [superior] court\u2019s decision to grant . . . summary judgment de novo.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] There being no dispute as to the operative facts here, the question is purely a legal one for us to resolve. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Nathanson v. Hecker </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1158, 1162 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 773].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">2. <em>TILA, HOEPA, and Regulation Z.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Congress enacted TILA in 1968 \u201cto protect consumers\u2019 choice through full disclosure and to guard against the divergent and at times fraudulent practices stemming from uninformed use of credit. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(King, supra, </em>784 F.2d at p. 915.) The stated congressional purpose behind TELA is \u201cto assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(a); see also 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.1(b) (2006).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">HOEPA amends TELA to \u201censure that consumers understand the terms of such loans and are protected from high pressure sales tactics .... [The amendment] also prohibits High Cost Mortgages from including certain terms such as prepayment penalties and balloon payments that have proven particularly problematic.\u201d (Sen.Rep. No. 103-169, 2d Sess., p. 21 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 1905.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">Toward this end, TILA requires that specific disclosures be provided to borrowers of qualifying consumer credit transactions that are secured by the borrowers\u2019 residence. Section 1635 of title 15 of the United States Code mandates that lenders clearly and conspicuously disclose to borrowers that borrowers have a right to rescind the transaction until midnight of the third business day following consummation of the transaction. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.23(b) (2006).) HOEPA further directs lenders to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>disclose: that borrowers are not required to complete the loan agreement merely because they have received disclosures or signed the loan application; that they could lose their home if they do not meet their loan obligations; and the percentage rate, the amount of monthly payments, and in the case of adjustable rate loans, that the interest rate and payment could increase. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639(a)(1) &amp; (a)(2).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such disclosures must be made \u201cnot less than 3 business days prior to consummation of the transaction.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639(b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">The remedies under TILA include civil liability and damages. If any required disclosures are not given, the borrower\u2019s right to rescind is extended from three days to <em>three years after the date of consummation of the transaction. </em>(15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(a) &amp; (f); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.23(a)(3) (2006).) Thus, \u201ca single violation of TILA, whether it be substantive or technical, extends a borrower\u2019s period for rescission. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Wiggins v. Avco Financial Services </em>(D.D.C. 1999) 62 F.Supp.2d 90, 94; see <em>Semar v. Platte Valley Federal S &amp; L Ass\u2019n </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 791 F.2d 699, 704 [minor technical, as well as major, violations of TILA or Regulation Z entitle the borrower to rescind].) Lenders who fail to notify the borrower correctly of the right to rescind are also liable to the borrower for damages plus costs and attorney fees. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(1), (a)(2)(A) &amp; (a)(3).) Lenders who omit the disclosures under title 15 United States Code section 1639 are subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>liability in the amount equal to the sum of all finance charges and fees paid by the consumer, unless the failure to comply with the statute is not material. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">As a consumer protection statute, TILA \u201cis to be liberally construed in favor of borrowers.\u201d <em>(Wiggins v. Avco Financial Services, supra, </em>62 F.Supp.2d at p. 94; see <em>Riggs v. Government Emp. Financial Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 623 F.2d 68, 71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">3. <em>Summary judgment of the Lozos\u2019 TILA cause of action was improperly granted.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">a. <em>Under the undisputed facts, the Lozos were entitled to rescind.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">As framed by the pleadings and demonstrated in the motion for summary judgment, the Lozos claim that Pacific Shore violated TILA and Regulation Z by failing to deliver to them two copies of the notice of the right to rescind with the date of the loan and the deadline for rescission (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635; 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.23(b)(1) &amp; (c) (2006)), and by omitting to make the title 15 United States Code section 1639 disclosures at least three business days prior to consummation of the first loan transaction. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639(a) &amp; (b).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hence, the Lozos argue, they had a continuing right to rescind the transaction for three years or by August 2003 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(f); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.23(a)(3)) and so their June 2003 notice of rescission was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">While it appears that Pacific Shore did provide certain disclosures, in moving for summary judgment, it <em>did not dispute that the disclosures were not made in advance of the date the loan closed and the rescission notice was not filled out properly, as it lacked crucial terms. </em>Thus, there is no dispute that Pacific Shore violated certain of TILA\u2019s disclosure mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">In ruling as a matter of law that the Lozos had no right to rescind the first loan, the trial court relied on <em>King, supra, </em>784 F.2d at pages 912 to 913. There, the borrower entered into two relevant transactions, the latter of which was a refinance that superseded an earlier loan. After filing for bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>protection, the borrower attempted to rescind the earlier loan under title 15 of the United States Code, section 1635. On behalf of herself and a class, the borrower then sued the loan broker and lenders alleging violations of various TILA disclosure requirements. <em>(King, supra, </em>at p. 912.) In affirming the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action, the Ninth Circuit stated in full: \u201cThe loan of March 1981 cannot be rescinded, because there is nothing to rescind. King refinanced that loan in November 1981, and the deed of trust underlying the March 1981 loan has been superseded.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 913.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">We respectfully decline to follow <em>King. </em>\u201cDecisions of lower federal courts interpreting federal law are not binding on state courts. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 190, 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710[declining to following Ninth Circuit decision].) \u201c[E]ven on federal questions, [the decisions of the lower federal courts] are persuasive and entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>(Etcheverry </em>v. <em>Tri-Ag Service, Inc. </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 316, 320 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 36, 993 P.2d 366].) However, \u201c[w]here lower federal precedents are divided or lacking, state courts must necessarily make an independent determination of federal law [citations].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 321.) We may independently resolve the question before us because federal courts are split on the question of whether, under TILA, a borrower has a right to rescind a qualifying loan after it has been paid off.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">Some courts follow <em>King. </em>(See, e.g., <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Equicredit Corp. of America </em>(N.D.Ill., Jan. 22, 2002, No. 01 C 2130) 2002 WL 88750 at p. *2 [following <em>King];</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> Jenkins v. Mercantile Mortg. Co. </em>(N.D.Ill. 2002) 231 F.Supp.2d 737, 746 [following <em>King].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">However, most courts have not followed <em>King. </em>(See, e.g., <em>Barrett v.

Vanguard Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n. </em>(E.D.Pa. 1989) 710 F.Supp. 143, 145-146 [holding contrary to <em>King]; Abele </em>v. <em>Mid-Penn Consumer Discount </em>(Bankr.

Cir. 1988) 845 F.2d 1009.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">For two reasons, we decline to follow <em>King </em>and are instead persuaded by the majority of cases that have convincingly held that rescission is available notwithstanding that the loan the borrower seeks to rescind has already been refinanced. First, apart from the conspicuous lack of analysis in <em>King </em>providing us with little basis for its position, its conclusion is not supported by the language of TILA and Regulation Z. According to Regulation Z, \u201c[i]f the required notice or material disclosures are not delivered, the right to rescind shall expire 3 years after consummation, [1] upon transfer of all of the consumer\u2019s interest in the property, or [2] upon sale of the property, whichever occurs first.\u201d (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.23(a)(3) (2006); see also 15 U.S.C. 1635(f).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Absent from that list is payment of the loan. There is no statutory authority for concluding that a refinance terminates the consumer\u2019s right to rescind the original loan. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As noted by one court, \u201c[t]he fact that the regulations set forth an enumerated list of events that cut off rescission rights\u2014and do not include the payment in full of the loan as one of those events\u2014speaks against [the lender\u2019s] argument.\u201d <em>(McIntosh v. Irwin Union Bank and Trust, Co., supra, </em>215 F.R.D. at p. 31.) Because TELA is to be construed liberally to effect its remedial purpose of protecting consumers who are inherently at a disadvantage in loan and credit transactions by assuring that they will not be easily misled about the costs of financing <em>(Semar </em>v. <em>Platte Valley Federal S &amp; L Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>791 F.2d at p. 705; <em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Avco Financial Services, supra, </em>62 F.Supp.2d at p. 94, citing <em>Thornka </em>v. <em>A.Z. Chevrolet, Inc. </em>(3d Cir. 1980) 619 F.2d 246, 248), we are adverse to reading into the statute an implicit basis for terminating consumers\u2019 remedies that would only benefit lenders at the expense of borrowers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">Second, <em>King </em>is really distinguishable. Title to the borrower\u2019s residence in <em>King </em>remained vested in the bankruptcy trustee <em>(King, supra, </em>784 F.2d at p. 912), whereas here, the Lozos continue to hold title. Were we to follow <em>King </em>we would be overlooking the fact that something does remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>to be rescinded in this case. Under TILA, rescission \u201cdoes not mean an annulment that is definitively accomplished by unilateral pronouncement, but rather a remedy that restores the <em>status quo ante. </em>[.Citation.]\u201d <em>(Quenzer v. Advanta Mortg. Corp. USA </em>(D.Kan. 2003) 288 B.R. 884, 888.) Once borrowers exercise their right to rescind under TILA, their liability for the loan ceases and any security interest given becomes void. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(b).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Procedurally, lenders must return to the borrowers \u201cany money or property given as earnest money, downpayment, or otherwise, and . . . terminat[e the] security interest,\u201d and borrowers must tender back to the lenders property, e.g., the loan proceeds, received from the lender. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(b); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.23(d) (2006).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Stated otherwise, after rescission, borrowers are \u201c \u2018not liable for any finance or other charge\u2019 \u201d such as interest, commissions, or extra payments in a TILA rescission. <em>(Semar v. Platte Valley Federal S &amp; L Ass\u2019n, </em>supra, 791 F.2d at p. 705; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(b);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> see also <em>Pulphus </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>2003 WL 1964333, at p. *17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">By contrast, a refinance is \u201c[t]he discharge of an obligation with funds acquired through the creation of a new debt. .. .\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Diet. (6th ed. 1990) p. 1281, col. 2.) But, a refinance may not reimburse borrowers for the downpayment, finance charges, commissions, or fees paid in connection with the first loan. <em>(McIntosh </em>v. <em>Irwin Union Bank and Trust, Co., supra, </em>215 F.R.D. at p. 31; cf. <em>Mayfield v. Vanguard Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n., supra, </em>710 F.Supp. at p. 148.) A refinance does not return the borrowers to the status quo ante. Here, after the refinance, there <em>did </em>remain something to rescind, namely, the interest, fees, penalties, and charges that the Lozos paid under the first loan. A holding that after a refinance there remains nothing to rescind in this case, would provide unscrupulous lenders with a means of laundering their TILA violations in the initial loan by refinancing it with a second loan, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>forever preventing borrowers from recouping their wrongfully paid finance charges, downpayments, and other fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">We disagree with Pacific Shore and its amicus curiae, citing <em>IT Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 443 at page 451 [147 Cal.Rptr. 828], that if we do not follow <em>King </em>we will create forum shopping opportunities. In <em>IT, </em>there was implicit support for the Ninth Circuit view in a California case. Yet, no California case has weighed in on the issue here. More important, federal courts disagree about whether to follow <em>King. </em>We are persuaded by the reasoning of the cases from other jurisdictions and are convinced to follow them. In any event, we decline to follow <em>King </em>merely to avoid the potential for forum shopping where the holding of <em>King </em>has the effect of undermining TILA and the purposes for which TILA was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">Turning to the undisputed facts here, the Lozos were entitled to rescind the first loan at the time they notified Pacific Shore that they were exercising their rescission right, notwithstanding they had refinanced that loan. With the second loan, the Lozos repaid the outstanding debt of the first loan along with a prepayment penalty. <em>Yet, Pacific Shore never tendered the Lozos any money and property the Lozos had paid to Pacific Shore in the form of up-front fees and costs, such as downpayment, fees, penalties, and interest. </em>The refinance <em>did not </em>return the Lozos to the status quo ante. Effectively, the refinance operated only as an incomplete rescission. Because Pacific Shore unlawfully declined the Lozos\u2019 request to rescind the first loan, the trial court erred in granting its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">b. <em>The Lozos are not entitled to damages under TILA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">The trial court also ruled that the Lozos\u2019 claim for damages under section 1640(e) of title 15 of the United States Code, as opposed to their claim for rescission, was barred by the statute of limitations. We agree. TELA requires borrowers to file an action \u201cwithin one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(e).) The alleged violation here is the failure to make proper and timely disclosures at least three days before consummation of the transaction, i.e., August 4, 2000. Thus, the Lozos had until August 3, 2001, to file their complaint. Their complaint for TELA damages is time-barred as it was filed on September 4, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">To summarize, the trial court erred in ruling that rescission was unavailable to the Lozos, although it properly applied the statute of limitations to bar the Lozos\u2019 claim for damages.

They contend, even if their complaint did not sufficiently raise this violation, that they requested trial court leave to amend their complaint, which request the court should have granted. Observing that the issues to be resolved on summary judgment are framed by the pleadings, and that the Lozos\u2019 cross-complaint did not raise violation of the prepayment penalty prohibition, Pacific Shore counters that any violation of the prepayment penalty ban is not cognizable in this proceeding, and in any event, Pacific Shore did not violate TILA\u2019s prepayment penalty provision. We need not address the prepayment penalty prohibition here because the Lozos have adequately alleged at least one other violation of TILA that entitled them to rescission. (See <em>Wiggins v. Avco Financial Services, supra, </em>62 F.Supp.2d at p. 94.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1084-7\"> We recognize that numerous federal opinions addressing the holding of <em>King </em>are unpublished.
