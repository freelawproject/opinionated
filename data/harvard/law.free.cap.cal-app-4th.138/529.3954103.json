J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag-\">This appeal is from the termination of Margaret\u2019s (Mother) parental rights over Fernando. Mother and Fernando correctly argue that the juvenile court should have selected legal guardianship as Femando\u2019s permanent plan instead of adoption because, notwithstanding the strong presumption in favor of adoption, the peculiar facts of this case demonstrate a compelling reason for finding that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to Femando and exceptional circumstances warrant selecting legal guardianship as his permanent plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we find Mother and Fernando\u2019s argument regarding the Indian Child and Welfare Act has no merit. We shall reverse the juvenile court\u2019s order identifying adoption as Femando\u2019s permanent plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Fernando was bom with a positive toxicology for alcohol and marijuana, and Mother had entered a voluntary maintenance plan, which proved unsuccessful. The court detained Fernando on July 28, 2004, when he was approximately four months old, and ordered him placed with maternal grandmother, Christina, who had been taking care of him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Christina had called the police when Mother left Femando with her for 11 days and disappeared. The Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 300 petition, as sustained, indicated that Mother has a history of substance abuse, was incapable of caring for Fernando, left Fernando with Christina without providing for his care, and placed Femando at risk of physical and emotional harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Initially, Mother did nothing to comply with her case plan, but eventually she entered a rehabilitation program and initiated visits with Fernando. Throughout Femando\u2019s detention, he resided with Christina, who also cared for Femando\u2019s two minor siblings, neither of whom was a dependent of the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">There is no dispute that Christina provided excellent care or that Femando has bonded with her. The Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) consistently reported that Christina was able to deal effectively with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Femando\u2019s special needs as a result of reactive airway disease and slight developmental delay. In January 2005, DCFS reported that Fernando was attached to Christina and that she was providing for his necessities and monitoring his medical needs. DCFS also reported that Christina \u201cis doing a great job with complying with the case plan. She remains dedicated to caring for child Fernando . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In May 2005, DCFS reported that \u201cFemando has many special needs and requires stability and consistency in order to progress developmentally.\u201d DCFS also reported that the grandparents \u201clove him [Femando] very much. Femando has become a part of their family.\u201d It was reported that Fernando bonded with his grandparents and that they \u201chave a warm and affectionate relationship with Femando. They are able to meet Femando[\u2019s] special needs and provide him with a safe and stable home environment.\u201d DCFS opined that it was in Fernando\u2019s best interest to be adopted by his grandparents. The next month DCFS reported that it was in Fernando\u2019s best interest to be adopted by his grandmother. The report did not mention adoption by Femando\u2019s grandfather other than to indicate that a spousal waiver was necessary in order to proceed with the adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In August 2005, the juvenile court terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights and ordered adoption as Femando\u2019s permanent plan. Christina and Mother had requested legal guardianship as Fernando\u2019s long-term plan. At that time, there was no dispute that Christina\u2019s husband was not willing to adopt and that Christina\u2019s adoption would require that he sign a spousal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">At the section 366.26 hearing, Mother testified that she had been clean and sober for almost six months, had taken parenting classes, and visited with Femando on the weekends. She testified there was a relationship between Femando and his older siblings. Christina testified that she cared for Fernando and for Mother\u2019s two other children. Christina testified that Fernando \u201cdoesn\u2019t really know [Mother] that well, but he is starting to.\u201d Christina testified that she preferred to become Femando\u2019s legal guardian rather than adopt him but that the social worker told her \u201cif I didn\u2019t adopt Femando, that he would be placed in the system to be adopted by someone else.\u201d Christina did not want to adopt because Femando \u201cbelongs to my daughter, and I know that one day she will get him back.\u201d Christina also testified that Femando had a very close relationship with his siblings and that the siblings regularly play together.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The court found that Mother does not have a parental relationship with Femando because she waited until after the statutory six-month period had elapsed to appear in court and did not begin visiting Femando until 10 weeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>before the section 366.26 hearing. The court then found that section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(D) was inapplicable because, even though Christina was a relative caretaker, no exceptional circumstances were present. The court explained its finding as follows: \u201cthis is a grandmother who has already taken care of two of this mother\u2019s kids already, and there\u2019s just \u25a0 no exceptional circumstances.\u201d The court also found that Fernando is adoptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Mother and Fernando both appeal, arguing that the court should have selected legal guardianship as Fernando\u2019s long-term plan and that the court failed to comply with the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we shall summarize the facts with respect to the latter contention along with the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">I. <em>Femando \u2019s Long-term Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZY\">A. <em>General Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The following pertinent principles are well established. After reunification services have terminated, the focus of a dependency proceeding shifts from family preservation to promoting the best interest of the child including the child\u2019s interest in a \u201cplacement that is stable, permanent, and that allows the caretaker to make a full emotional commitment to the child. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Marilyn H. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 295, 306 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 851 P.2d 826].) The purpose of a section 366.26 hearing is to \u201cprovide stable, permanent homes for\u201d dependent children. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (b).) At a section 366.26 hearing the juvenile court has three options: (1) to terminate parental rights and order adoption as a long-term plan; (2) to appoint a legal guardian for the dependent child; or (3) to order the child be placed in long-term foster care. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (b).) Adoption is the preferred plan and, absent an enumerated exception, the juvenile court is required to select adoption as the permanent plan. <em>(In re Jasmine T. </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 209, 212 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 128].) The burden falls to the parent to show that the termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child under one of the exceptions. <em>(In re Zachary G. </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 799, 809 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 20].)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">There are five circumstances that may present \u201ca compelling reason for determining that termination [of parental rights] would be detrimental to the child. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1).) One is if \u201c[t]here would be a substantial interference with a child\u2019s sibling relationship, taking into consideration the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>nature and extent of the relationship, including, but not limited to, whether the child was raised with a sibling in the same home, whether the child shared significant common experiences or has existing close and strong bonds with a sibling, and whether ongoing contact is in the child\u2019s best interest, including the child\u2019s long-term emotional interest, as compared to the benefit of legal permanence through adoption.\u201d (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1)(E).)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Another exception, under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(D), applies if \u201c[t]he child is living with a relative or foster parent who is unable or unwilling to adopt the child because of <em>exceptional circumstances, </em>that do not include an unwillingness to accept legal or financial responsibility for the child, but who is willing and capable of providing the child with a stable and permanent environment and the removal of the child from the physical custody of his or her relative or foster parent would be detrimental to the emotional well-being of the child.\u201d The subdivision (c)(1)(D) exception does not apply where the juvenile court makes a finding that grandparents are willing and able to adopt a child. <em>(In re Zachary G., supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 810.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">B. <em>The Juvenile Court Applied the Incorrect Test in Evaluating the Subdivision (c)(1)(D) Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Generally, we review the trial court\u2019s application of the exception to the termination of parental rights for substantial evidence. <em>(In re Zachary G., supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th 799, 809; <em>In re Derek W. </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 823, 827 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 739].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, in this case, the court applied the incorrect legal test. We review de novo the interpretation of a statute, which is a question of law. <em>(Robin J. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 414, 420 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 417].) The relevant facts are not disputed, and therefore the significance of the facts presents a question of law. <em>(Ghirardo v. Antonioli </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 791, 799 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 883 P.2d 960]; see also <em>In re Zeth S. </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 396, 405 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 683, 73 P.3d 541].)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">In contrast to the general principles summarized above, the meaning of the phrase \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d is not well defined. One court has held that \u201cmere family preference is insufficient.\u201d <em>(In re Rachel M. </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1289, 1298 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 153].) Similarly, \u201cpersonal preference\u201d of the potential adoptive parent had been held to be irrelevant. <em>(In re Jose V. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1792, 1801 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 684].) Another court has held \u201cthe statutory \u2018exceptional circumstance\u2019 refers to circumstances that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>make the custodial relative unwilling or unable to adopt . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Zachary G., supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 810.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The phrase \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d should be interpreted in light of the overarching purpose of section 366.26 and the overarching purpose of the dependency system\u2014to achieve the best interest of the dependent child. <em>(In re Joshua S. </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1341, 1350 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 656].) If courts never considered family preference, the term \u201cunwilling\u201d as used in section 366.26,- subdivision (c)(1)(D) would be rendered meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">When Christina\u2019s attorney indicated that Christina was upset that she was threatened if she did not adopt Femando the social worker would \u201ctry to find an adoptive home . . . and remove the child from her,\u201d the court responded, \u201cIt is not a threat, ma\u2019am. It is the statute. It is the law. It is what the statute says.... The primary goal of a child is . . . permanency. The most permanent plan is adoption. That is the one we look to the strongest.\u201d The court continued: \u201cThe primary goal is permanency. The permanent plan is adoption. That is the one that the department looks to. Yes, there are exceptions, but the primary goal is to get this child adopted with a permanent family. [][] Guardianship is another alternative, but it is not one the court looks to. It is up to the Department\u2014it is up to the caretakers, but, clearly the goal is for us to adopt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">While the Legislature has expressed a preference for adoption over other permanent plans, this preference is overridden if one of the exceptions enumerated in subdivision (c)(1) of section 366.26 is found to apply. Contrary to the juvenile court\u2019s statement, the juvenile court should look to legal guardianship under appropriate circumstances. It is not clear from the record why the court announced that guardianship is \u201cnot one [alternative] the court looks to. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">While it may be that the court\u2019s explanation was to serve only as a partial description of the statutory scheme, the court\u2019s stated rationale for its mling also suggests the court applied an incorrect test when it evaluated the section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(D) exception. Specifically, the juvenile court found: \u201cExceptional circumstances don\u2019t arise here, and this is a grandmother who has already taken care of two of this mother\u2019s kids already, and there\u2019s just no exceptional circumstances.\u201d That was the court\u2019s sole rationale for its finding that the section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(D) exception did not apply to Femando. The court made no finding that Christina was willing and able to adopt Femando and what impact the threats to take Femando from his grandmother had on her \u201cunwillingness\u201d to adopt. Nor did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the juvenile court consider the emotional upheaval Fernando would suffer as a result of being removed from the home he had lived in almost his entire life, a home the trial court had earlier indicated he would never leave. Prior to the section 366.26 hearing, the juvenile court stated \u201c[h]e is going to be with his grandmother for the rest of his life. That is what is going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Contrary to the juvenile court\u2019s finding that no exceptional circumstances existed because Christina was also taking care of Fernando\u2019s two siblings, this evidence is evidence of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d as that term is used in section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(D). Fernando had been living with his siblings almost his entire life, and Mother and Christina\u2019s testimony that Fernando was bonded to his siblings was not disputed. Although the court did not consider the specific sibling exception, Fernando\u2019s relationship to his siblings is relevant in considering exceptional circumstances <em>for </em>purposes of the subdivision (c)(1)(D) exception. Fernando was raised with his two siblings in Christina\u2019s home almost his entire life. His siblings are not dependents of the juvenile court, and Christina has not adopted them but has provided care for them in Mother\u2019s absence. Allowing another family to adopt Fernando would mean that he no longer would share daily interactions with his siblings. Forcing Christina to adopt Fernando would mean that he would become his siblings\u2019 uncle. Even then, there would be nothing to prevent Mother from taking custody of her two other children, leaving Fernando alone with Christina.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Not only would adoption disrupt Femando\u2019s relationship with his siblings, but it also would dismpt Christina\u2019s marriage. Christina\u2019s husband was never identified as Femando\u2019s caretaker and his care of Femando was not described in detail in the DCFS reports. Other than mentioning that Fernando was bonded to grandfather, Femando\u2019s relationship with his grandfather is unclear. What is clear and undisputed is that, in order to adopt Femando, a spousal waiver would be required. Adoption would not only interfere with Femando\u2019s sibling relationships, but also would invade the private realm of Christina\u2019s marriage. The court not only ignored the marital implications but also failed to consider the potential effect of such an adoption on Fernando\u2019s relationship with his grandfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">DCFS argues that \u201cassuming arguendo that the maternal grandmother had been unwilling or unable to adopt, no one offered any, much less compelling evidence showing how removal from her care would detrimentally affect Femando to such a degree as to outweigh his need for permanency through adoption.\u201d Both prongs of the argument are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>The record indicates Christina was initially unwilling to adopt. Even though she made statements that she would adopt, those statements always followed what she described as a threat that unless she adopt DCFS would find another adoptive family for Fernando. Indeed, not only does DCFS readily acknowledge its thinly veiled threats, but it argues that in telling Christina that Fernando \u201cwould be placed in the system for adoption,\u201d \u201cthe social worker did nothing less than honestly describe the reality of the choices before her [Christina]. Fernando\u2019s future cannot remain on hold while [Mother] vacillates between sobriety and inebriation.\u201d But Fernando\u2019s future is not dependent on Mother\u2019s conduct because as DCFS regularly reported, Christina provided excellent care and provided Fernando with a stable and loving home.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The second prong of DCFS\u2019s argument\u2014that there was no compelling evidence that removal from Christina\u2019s care would detrimentally affect Fernando\u2014also is incorrect. Since he was four months old, Fernando lived with Christina and his two siblings. DCFS reported that \u201cFernando has many special needs and requires stability and consistency in order to progress developmentally.\u201d Removing him from Christina\u2019s home and searching for another adoptive family would deprive him of this stability DCFS has already determined is necessary for him. There is no dispute regarding the intimacy of Fernando\u2019s daily associations with Christina and with his siblings and no basis in the record to conclude that severing these ties, the only ones Fernando knows, would not detrimentally affect his well-being. Although the burden of proof falls to Mother or Fernando, the record contains no contrary evidence. All of the evidence in the record indicates that it would be detrimental to Fernando to remove him from Christina\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In the juvenile court, DCFS argued, \u201cI am asking the court to go forward today and terminate parental rights. If the grandmother changes her mind, and she wishes to be the one to adopt this child, then, [so be it]. She certainly would have the preference as the current caretaker and as a relative, but if she chooses not, then that would be her choice as well.\u201d We do not agree that, under the peculiar facts of this case, Christina should be coerced into either becoming \u201cwilling\u201d to adopt Femando or watching as someone else does. That neither serves Fernando\u2019s best interest nor follows the mandate of section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>II. <em>The Indian Child Welfare Act Does Not Apply to This Case</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The order terminating mother\u2019s parental rights identifying adoption as Fernando\u2019s permanent plan is reversed.
