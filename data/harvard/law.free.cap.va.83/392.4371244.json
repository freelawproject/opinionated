Chapman, wife of H. C. Chapman, \u201cto have and to hold in her own right free from any claim or demands from her husband, or any other person or persons claiming under, through, or against him in any way, now or at any time thereafter,\" the word \u201c thereafter\" being manifestly intended for \u201c hereafter.\" The consideration for the grant expressed in the conveyance is the love and affection borne by the grantors for their daughter, and the sum of five dollars. In the year 1884 Susan J. Chapman died, having previously devised the land in question to the appellants, when\u2014that is to say, after her death\u2014 this suit was instituted to subject the estate by the curtesy which the husband, H. C. Chapman, is alleged to have in said land, to the payment of certain judgments which had \u2022been recovered against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The sole question we have to determine, therefore, is whether, under the circumstances of this case, the husband, H. C. Chapman, has an estate as tenant by the curtesy in these lands.</p>\n<p id=\"AiR\">It is well understood that at common law it was not competent in a grant to a woman of an estate of inheritance to exclude her husband from his right of curtesy. <em>Sir Anthony Mildmay\u2019s Case, </em>6 Rep. 41; Clancy on Rights of Women, 191; <em>Mullany </em>v. <em>Mullany, </em>3 Green\u2019s Chy. R. 16. And so with respect to the ordinary equitable estates of married women, for example, where lands have been given to trustees in fee upon trusts for a married woman and her heirs, or for a single woman in fee, who afterwards marries, they fall within the reason and are governed by the same rule as legal estates, and, therefore, in any case where the husband would be tenant by the curtesy at law he will be so in equity. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>5 Madr. 410; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>1 P. Wm. 109; 1 Minor\u2019s Inst. (3d ed.), 352. But with regard to the separate estate of a married woman, properly so called, where the intention of the devisor, or settler, is clearly expressed to that end, it has been held that the estate may be so limited as to give the wife the inheritance and deprive the husband of curtesy. And where a separate use is declared as to property, real or personal, which I apprehend is always the case, and only the case, where a <em>feme covert </em>has what is properly and technically called a separate estate, the married woman has in England, when not restrained from alienation, <em>\u201c </em>as incident to her separate estate and without any express power, a complete right of alienation by instrument <em>inter vivos, </em>or will; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Meads, </em>4 DeG. J. &amp; S. M. 605; and in Virginia, where the married woman\u2019s powers as to her separate real estate are not quite so large as to the <em>corpus- </em>or body of her separate estate, the power of disposing of it in any way that may be prescribed by theinstrument ere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ating it, and if not prohibited, expressly or impliedly, by that instrument in the mode prescribed by law for the-alienation of real estate by married women or by last will and testament. Code 1873, ch. 118, \u00a7 3; 3 Lomax Dig. (ed. 1885), 11, note 1; <em>Justis </em>v. English, 30 Gratt. 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Now, as to this interest of <em>the feme covert </em>created by the separate use, or as it is called by Jessel, M. R., equitable estate of inheritance to her separate use, and which is, as Lord Chief-Justice Westbury says, in <em>Taylor </em>v. Meads, supra, \u201cthe creature of a court of equity to which there is nothing correspondent at law,\u201d it is now settled in England by the ease of <em>Cooper </em>v. Macdonald, although until 1877 it was a vexed question, that if the married woman fails to dispose of it by deed or will, her husband will be entitled to curtesy therein, but that where the married woman disposes of it, as she has the right to do, the husband\u2019s right to curtesy is lost. L. R., 7 Chy. Div. 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In the above cited case of <em>Cooper </em>v. Macdonald, where all the cases are reviewed, the master of the rolls, speaking with reference to this subject, said: \u201cA gift of afee simple estate, or a gift of a capital sum of money, to the separate use of a married woman, gives her the same power of alienation over it as if she were a single woman. She is entitled to dispose of it as if she were not a married woman at all; and that at once gets rid of any notion of the husband having an interest. Whatever interest he would have had in the absence of disposition, is got rid of by the disposition. The separate use is a creature of equity, and equity says the estate may be so limited to the married woman as that she can get rid of every possible interest of the husband. That is the meaning of a limitation to her separate use and free from his interference or control. It is exactly the same for this purpose.as if the -estate had been limited to such uses as the married woman shall by deed or will appoint; it entirely destroys the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>notion of the husband having any interest in it against her disposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In this State there has been no adjudication upon the precise point under consideration, but see opinion of Carr, J., in <em>West </em>v. <em>West Ex\u2019ors, </em>3 Rand. 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Now, testing the case with which we are dealing by the principles announced above, it seems to me clear that the husband here has no estate by the curtesy in the premises in controversy. No particular phraseology is necessary to create a separate use. Here the words \u201cto have and to hold in her own right, free from any claims or demands from her husband or any person or persons claiming under, through or against him in any way, now or at any time hereafter,\u201d not only create, but are conceded to create, \u201ca sole and separate estate,\u201d and the wife having\u2014as we have seen she had the right to do\u2014devised the lands in question to the appellant, it must be held that H. C. Chapman is excluded from any right to curtesy which, in default of a disposal of said property by his wife, he would have been entitled to therein. It follows that the decree of the circuit court must be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
