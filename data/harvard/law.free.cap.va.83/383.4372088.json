City county, rendered twenty-second December, 1885, in a chancery suit in the name of Sears\u2019 Executor against Marshall. This is sequel to the cause of <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Sears\u2019 Ex\u2019or and als., </em>79 Va. 49. Upon the return of this cause the circuit court, in obedience to the decree of this court, assigned the proceeds of the property embraced in the annulled deed to Marshall. A bill was presented to review and reverse the decree by Sears\u2019 executor, which was dismissed at the costs of the complainants therein, and from the decree dismissing the same this appeal was obtained.

On the former appeal this court decided that the then appellant, the present appellee, William J. Marshall, was not estopped to assert his claim of homestead in the property embraced in certain fraudulent bills of sale, in which he was the fraudulent grantor, and which had been set aside. And the cause was remanded \u201c with instructions to assign to the appellant the said sum of one thousand and thirty-five dollars, the proceeds of the sales of the sloops \u201c Right Bower\u201d and \u201cUncle Jeff,\u201d and so much of the proceeds of the sloop \u201c Ann Cooley \u201d as may be sufficient, with the amount heretofore claimed by the appellant, to make his homestead exemption of two thousand dollars, unless it appears that he is not entitled to the same upon other grounds.\u201d The effect of this decision is palpably to hold that Marshall was entitled to a homestead exemption in the proceeds of' the sales of these vessels, unless it could be seen by the' lower court that he was not entitled to the same upon some ground which had not been brought to the attention of this court. In other words, the sole question debated in this court being the right of a fraudulent grantor to have assigned him a homestead exemption out of property embraced in the fraudulent conveyance, this court decided that question in favor of the appellant, but out of abundance of caution, and lest there might be some ground in the record not brought to the court\u2019s attention, added the words \u201cunless-it appears that he is not entitled upon some other ground.\u201d But it was never intended to set the whole matter at large and to allow Sears\u2019 executor to set up new grounds of objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>tion to giving him a homestead, which might have been preferred at the former hearing, but were not. If, however, the construction given to these words by Sears\u2019 executor was the right one, we are of opinion that it appears from the affidavit of the Hon. John Heely that ample opportunity was afforded the counsel for Sears\u2019 executor for resisting the entering of the decree granted by the circuit court of Elizabeth City, and that his failure to do so was the result of his having misconstrued something that was \u201c spoken or written to him \u201d by <em>\u201c </em>Mr. Tabb,\u201d and not from lack of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">.Our conclusion is that the decrees appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Decrees affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
