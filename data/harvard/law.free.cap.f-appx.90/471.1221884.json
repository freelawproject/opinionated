Diane Stuart, the director of the Justice Department\u2019s Office on Violence Against Women (the agency that administered one of the grants) wrote Huffer and explained that the Tribal Council was not eligible for the grants because it did not appear on the list of federally recognized Indian tribes. <em>See </em>Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, 65 Fed. Reg. 13,298 (March 13, 2000). Huffer then sued Stuart, alleging that the Tribal Council had been previously recognized as an Indian tribe, and that Stuart had, without due process, taken away \u201capprovals\u201d that Huffer had received for the grants. Huffer requested damages to compensate him personally for the lost grants and the time he spent preparing the applications, and also requested that the district court \u201crule\u201d that the Tribal Council \u201cdoes meet the [d]efinition of \u2018Indian Tribe\u2019 and be added to the list of Federally Recognized American Indian Tribes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The district court granted Stuart\u2019s motion to dismiss. It held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Huffer\u2019s demand for tribal recognition because the Department of the Interior has authority over whether a group qualifies as a federally recognized tribe, <em>see </em>25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83, and Huffer needed to direct his efforts for tribal recognition to that agency. It then concluded that Huffer had failed to state a claim for a due process violation: the attachments to Huffer\u2019s complaint reveal that the \u201capprovals\u201d Stuart took away are approvals of Huffer\u2019s user identification (\u201cchiefajl\u201d) for the online application process, and Huffer has no constitutionally protected property interest in either the user identification \u201capprovals\u201d or the grant funds themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">On appeal we perceive several different problems with Huffer\u2019s suit. Huffer is a non-lawyer (although he identifies himself as a \u201cTribal Court Judge\u201d) and named himself as the only plaintiff. Yet it is the Tribal Council that he alleges has been injured, and the relief he seeks\u2014 federal recognition and the grant funds\u2014 would inure to it. If Huffer is seeking to <em>represent </em>the Tribal Council, his suit must be dismissed because as a non-lawyer, he has no authority to prosecute a suit on behalf of the Tribal Council. <em>See Navin v. Park Ridge Sch. Dist. 64, </em>270 F.3d 1147, 1149 (7th Cir.2001); <em>McCall v. Pataki, </em>232 F.3d 321, 322 (2d Cir.2000). If, on the other hand, Huffer represents only himself, he likely lacks standing to bring the suit to the extent that he is attempting to assert the rights of the Tribal Council. <em>See Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 498-99, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 348 (1975) (noting that a \u201cplaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties\u201d); <em>cf. J.F. Shea Co. v. City of Chicago, </em>992 F.2d 745, 749-50 (7th Cir.1993) (employee has no standing to challenge action that directly injures employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">That leaves at most a personal claim for Huffer\u2019s own damages. But, if that is what this case is about, the appeal nonetheless must fail. In his appellate brief Huffer fails to present any intelligible argument attacking the district court\u2019s conclusions. Instead he repeats allegations from his complaint that the Tribal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Council is a federally recognized tribe, and that he has been denied \u201chis civil right of due process.\u201d Although we construe pro se filings liberally, by and large Huffer\u2019s appellate brief ignores the grounds on which the district court acted, and we will not construct arguments for him. <em>See Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.2001). We have previously warned pro se litigants that this court will dismiss an appeal that fails to specify any error in the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Anderson, </em>241 F.3d at 545 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States ex rel. Verdone v. Circuit Court for Taylor County, </em>73 F.3d 669, 673 (7th Cir.1995) (per curiam); <em>Brooks v. Allison Div. of Gen. Motors Corp., </em>874 F.2d 489, 490 (7th Cir.1989). Because Huffer\u2019s appellate brief fails to address the basis the district court gave for its decision, we dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
