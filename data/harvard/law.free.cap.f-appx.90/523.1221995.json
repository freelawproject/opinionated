We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo due process claims concerning immigration proceedings. <em>Antonio-Cruz v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1129, 1131 (9th Cir.1998). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-20\">Vaddempudi\u2019s contention that he was not given an opportunity to submit a brief to the BIA because the BIA failed to send him notice of the briefing schedule, failed to respond to his request to file a late brief, and failed to mail him its final decision, does not state a due process violation because his notice of appeal to the BIA effectively set forth six alleged errors in the IJ\u2019s decision, his appeal to this Court does not contain any issue not mentioned in his notice of appeal to the BIA, he failed to submit a brief to the BIA within the four week extension that he sought or during the course of the many months that followed before the BIA issued its decision, he provided no explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>tion for these failures, and the BIA\u2019s decision was based on the IJ\u2019s substantive decision under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) rather than a summary dismissal under \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). <em>See Campos-Sanchez v. INS, </em>164 F.3d 448, 450 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cBIA must provide a petitioner with a reasonable opportunity to offer an explanation of any perceived inconsistencies that form the basis of a denial of asylum.\u201d); <em>Casas Chavez v. INS, </em>300 F.3d 1088, 1090 (9th Cir.2002) (notice of reasons for appeal \u201ccan be accomplished in one of two ways: by setting out the reasons on the Notice of Appeal itself or by filing a separate brief.\u201d); <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 965 (9th Cir.2002) (requirement to show prejudice for due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Vaddempudi\u2019s contention that he is eligible to adjust his status is not properly before this Court because he failed to raise the issue before the BIA and there is no final order for this Court to review. <em>See Rashtabadi v. INS, </em>23 F.3d 1562, 1567 (9th Cir.1994); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A), 1252(b)(9). We therefore deny Vaddempudi\u2019s motion to remand to the IJ to adjust his status.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Vaddempudi\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance under the \u201cstreamlining\u201d provisions of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) violates due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 848-49 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Vaddempudi\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">PETITION DENIED and MOTION TO REMAND DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b564-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
