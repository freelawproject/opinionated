The Robins amended the complaint to add as a defendant the Jarreaus\u2019 personal liability insurer, Foremost Signature. The district court dismissed the complaint because there was no allegation of state action, the claims were prescribed, and there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>cause of action based on Kim Robins\u2019 conviction because there was no allegation that those criminal proceedings had been terminated in her favor. The district court found in favor of the Jarreaus on their counterclaim against the Robins and awarded the Jarreaus $2,500 in attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">The Robins contend that the district court erred in denying their second motion to amend the complaint to add as a defendant a state employee whose letter to the defendants allegedly \u201cprecipitated\u201d criminal charges against Kim Robins; that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), on the basis that there was no state action; and that the district court erred in determining that the defendants were a \u201cprevailing party\u201d and in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to them. These arguments are without legal or factual basis and are frivolous. The Robins\u2019 appeal is frivolous and is DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">On cross-appeal, the Jarreaus and Foremost Signature argue that the district court erred in awarding less attorneys\u2019 fees than they had incurred based on the Robins\u2019 unsupported assertions regarding their financial condition. The Jarreaus and Foremost Signature are correct. <em>See Alizadeh v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>910 F.2d 234, 239 n. 7 (5th Cir.1990). We VACATE the award of only $2,500 in attorneys\u2019 fees and REMAND to the district court for further proceedings. <em>See Forbush v. J.C. Penny Co., </em>98 F.3d 817, 821-23 (5th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The Jarreaus and Foremost Signature move in this court for award of appellate costs and attorneys\u2019 fee sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38. Because the Robins\u2019 appeal is frivolous, we GRANT the appellees\u2019 motion and AWARD attorneys\u2019 fees and double costs to them. Fed. R.App. P. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">We ORDER the appellants\u2019 attorney, Clarence T. Nalls, to show cause, within ten days of this order, why this court should not impose sanctions against him pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. If Nalls does not comply with this order, we DIRECT the clerk to assess against Nalls personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees reasonably incurred by the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">The Jarreaus and Foremost Signature are DIRECTED to file a bill of costs together with an affidavit setting forth expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees reasonably incurred by them in connection with this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 39; 5th Cir. R. 39 and 47.8.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">Appeal Nos. 02-30971 and 03-30013 are DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; award of $2,500 in attorneys\u2019 fees is VACATED and REMANDED; Appellees\u2019 Motion for Damages and Attorneys\u2019 Fees is GRANTED; Appellants\u2019 attorney ORDERED to show cause why SANCTIONS should not be imposed against him pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b789-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
