The district court sentenced appellant to 36 months imprisonment, 3 years supervised release, a $10,000 fine, and restitution. Counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>for reversal that the district court erred at sentencing in imposing a 2-level increase for obstruction of justice and in denying a 2-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The district court did not clearly err in finding those calculations justified by Nguyen\u2019s misrepresentations about his financial condition to the probation officer preparing his presentence report (PSR), <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 comment. (n.4(h)) (obstruction adjustment applies for providing materially false information to probation officer with respect to PSR), and did not err in granting the enhancement and denying the reduction based on the same conduct, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 comment, (n.4) (conduct which supports obstruction-of-justice enhancement \u201cordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility\u201d). <em>See United States v. Calderon-Avila, </em>322 F.3d 505, 507 (8th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (clear error review of factual findings and de novo review of Guidelines construction).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Following our independent review of the record, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonirivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-27\">. The Honorable James M. Rosenbaum, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
