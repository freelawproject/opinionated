Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>transitional rules apply, <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for substantial evidence a factual finding that an alien has failed to demonstrate continuous physical presence, <em>id. </em>at 1151 (9th Cir.1997), and review de novo due process contentions, <em>Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 599 (9th Cir. 2002). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Monzon de Rubio failed to establish the requisite seven years of continuous physical presence in the United States prior to issuance of her Order to Show Cause, rendering her ineligible for suspension of deportation. <em>See Otarola v. INS, </em>270 F.3d 1272, 1274 n. 3 (9th Cir. 2001). Munoz de Rubio\u2019s contention that her due process rights were violated because she was denied the right to a full and fair hearing lacks merit because she did not suffer prejudice as a result of any alleged violation in her deportation proceeding. <em>See United States v. Corrales-Beltran, </em>192 F.3d 1311, 1318 (9th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1024-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
