Brazell seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order adopting a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). An appeal may not be taken to this court from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of ap-pealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). \u201cA certificate of appealability may issue ... only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Brazell has not made such a showing. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny Brazell\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
