Spurlock\u2019s motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Spurlock argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider various orders and should have granted a stay pending a ruling in the appellate court on his writ of mandamus, that the district court denied his request for IFP in retaliation for the mandamus action, and that the district court should have recused itself from considering Spurlock\u2019s IFP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Spurlock has filed a motion for leave to supplement his brief. His motion is GRANTED. Spurlock has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. He has not shown that he will present a non-frivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cik. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Spurlock is CAUTIONED that the dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal count as two \u201cstrikes\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT GRANTED; IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b783-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
