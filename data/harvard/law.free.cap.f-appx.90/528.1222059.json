Torres-Garcia\u2019s challenge to his conviction on the ground that two items of evidence were improperly admitted is unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">The evidence of his prior attempts to enter the United States under Del Muro\u2019s name was properly admitted under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), because it illustrated his \u201cmodus operandi,\u201d i.e., his method of attempting to enter the United States. Moreover, at the hearing on the admissibility of that evidence, Torres-Garcia\u2019s counsel \u201cagree[d] with the court\u201d that the evidence was admissible to prove \u201cmodus operandi.\u201d The district court also correctly admitted documents from Torres-Garcia\u2019s Immigration and Naturalization Service \u201cA\u201d file under the public records exception to the hearsay rule. Fed.R.Evid. 803(8); <em>see United States v. Hernandez-Herrera, </em>273 F.3d 1213, 1217-18 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Loyola-Dominguez, </em>125 F.3d 1315, 1317 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-19\">2. Garcia\u2019s pre-sentence report included among his prior criminal convictions a 1992 California state conviction for driving with a license that had been revoked for driving under the influence. This conviction increased his criminal history category by one level and therefore increased the guideline sentencing range. In his objections to the pre-sentence report, Torres-Garcia denied that the conviction (as well as two other similar convictions shown in the report) was \u201chis case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-20\">The record raises questions whether the 1992 conviction was that of Torres-Garcia. In the district court proceedings, Torres-Garcia insisted that he was Del Muro. He therefore may have viewed the conviction as not his because it was that of Torres-Garcia, but he was Del Muro. Alternatively, he might have been convicted under the name Del Muro, so that the conviction was not that of Torres-Garcia.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The record also contains affirmative evidence suggesting that the conviction may have been that of Del Muro, not Torres-Garcia. Del Muro testified that he was convicted of driving under the influence in 1991 by a court in the same county in which Torres-Garcia\u2019s 1992 conviction <em>occurred, </em>and that that case may have occurred in 1992. He further testified that during that proceeding his driver\u2019s license had been revoked, and that later he was ticketed for driving with a suspended license.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">There is an additional item in the pre-sentence report that casts doubt upon the 1992 conviction. The report also includes a conviction for attempted re-entry after deportation and falsely claiming citizenship in December 1991, for which Torres-Gar-da was sentenced in March 1992 to twenty months imprisonment. The next entry is that he was \u201creleased to INS custody\u201d on April 16, 1993. If the dates and information shown on this entry are correct and if he served all or most of that sentence, he would have been incarcerated on August 1, 1992, the date of the arrest for his 1992 driving offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">3. In response to questions about these points that the court raised at oral argument, the government undertook to examine the matter further. It has informed us that, after examining the California Department of Motor Vehicle records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">It appears that when one compares the photograph of Mr. Torres-Garda taken by [Probation Officer] Mudd to the photograph of the person under whose California Driver\u2019s License Number the 1992 conviction was suffered, Mr. Torres-Garda is not that person. That person is the real Alberto Jose Del Muro. Therefore, the 1992 conviction should not have been attributed to Mr. Torres-Garda, and the one additional Criminal History point should not have been added into his score.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">In these circumstances, we vacate Torres-Garcia\u2019s sentence, and remand the case to the district court for resentencing without giving effect to his 1992 California conviction for driving with a revoked license.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED. SENTENCE VACATED AND CASE REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b569-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
