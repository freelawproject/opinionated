Wright appeals from an order entered in the District Court granting Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss her First Amendment retaliation claim pursuant to Fed.R.CivJP. 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wright argues that this Court should entertain a damages claim for this alleged violation of her free speech rights. Because this remedy is expressly forbidden by clear precedent, <em>Bush v. Lucas, </em>462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983), we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of a District Court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is plenary. <em>Langford v. City of Atlantic City, </em>235 F.3d 845, 847 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">As we write solely for the parties, we recite only those facts necessary to our analysis. Wright alleges that her supervisors at a federal veterans hospital unlawfully discharged her in retaliation for a letter she wrote to her senator, complaining about conditions for veterans at the hospital. In September 2000, Wright filed a First Amendment retaliation claim with the District Court based on this allegation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In May 2003, the District Court granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the claim, relying on <em>Bush.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">In <em>Bush, </em>the Supreme Court held that where a federal employee claims his or her First Amendment rights have been violated by a superior, and where the employee is protected by an \u201celaborate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d scheme such as the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> courts must decline to augment such an Act by \u201ccreat[ing] ... a new judicial remedy for the constitutional violation at issue.\u201d <em>Bush, </em>462 U.S. at 388, 390. Following <em>Bush, </em>our Court, in <em>Mitchum v. Hurt, </em>73 F.3d 30 (3d Cir.1995), clearly acknowledged that the CSRA provides the sole remedy for damage claims brought by federal employees who are subject to its protections. <em>Id. </em>at 35. We added, however, that where such employees seek declaratory and/or injunctive relief for alleged violations of their constitutional rights, courts may still entertain the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">First, Wright argues that we should stretch <em>Mitchum </em>to reach cases where damages are sought by federal employees. Second, and alternatively, Wright argues that <em>Bush </em>is unconstitutional and should be overruled.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>It is undisputed that Wright is a federal employee who enjoys the protections afforded by the CSRA. Therefore, it seems clear that <em>Bush </em>controls and that Wright is precluded from raising a damages claim here. Nevertheless, Wright puts forth a perplexing argument that we should broaden <em>Mitchum </em>so that it will apply to federal employees\u2019 actions for damages. Clearly, this is impossible because doing so would directly contradict the holding in <em>Bush. </em>Alternatively, Wright urges us to declare <em>Bush </em>unconstitutional and to overrule it. Quite obviously, however, we are not authorized to overturn a Supreme Court decision. <em>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., </em>490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989); <em>McMahon v. McDowell, </em>794 F.2d 100, 108 (3d Cir.1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Therefore, because the District Court correctly granted the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\">. The District Court referred to the motion in passing as one for judgment on the pleadings rather than one for failure to state a claim. However, because the Court relied solely on Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) in its analysis, we review the dismissal on grounds of failure to state a claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\">. In addition to the First Amendment claim, the original complaint included allegations of Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment violations involving racial harassment as well as a claim of state law intentional interference with a contractual relationship. The District Court granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss these claims in September 2001. Wright did not appeal this dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b682-14\">. Pub. L. 95-454 (codified at various sections of Title 5 U.S.C.). The CSRA affords remedies for federal civil servants challenging allegedly unlawful employment practices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b682-15\">. We have considered Wright's two other contentions 1) that she is entitled to receive a judgment for damages in this Court because prior settlement agreements between the parties state that any damages related to the settlements may be paid in other forums; and 2) that the Defendants waived their right to rely on <em>Bush </em>because they raised it too late below. With regard to the first contention, of course, parties may not stipulate a right of action or a remedy where it is otherwise prohibited by Congress. The second contention lacks sufficient merit to warrant further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>discussion, because the Defendants raised an objection based on <em>Bush even, </em>before the District Court wrote its opinion dismissing the First Amendment claim. Therefore, these contentions are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
