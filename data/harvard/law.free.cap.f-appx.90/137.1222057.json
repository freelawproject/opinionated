Finley, Jr., a Kentucky prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals a district court order dismissing his civil rights complaint filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In 1993, Finley was convicted of two counts of first-degree sodomy committed against his sons. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison for each count, to be served consecutively. In his complaint, Finley claims that the named defendants, all involved in his criminal prosecution, 1) maliciously prosecuted him, and 2) violated his rights under the United States Constitution, specifically, the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. He seeks monetary relief. The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) in light of the holding in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The district court\u2019s order is reviewed de novo. <em>See McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997). Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Finley\u2019s complaint because Finley\u2019s complaint is barred by <em>Heck. </em>In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state prisoner cannot make a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983 for an alleged unconstitutional conviction or for \u201charm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid\u201d unless a prisoner shows that the conviction or sentence has been \u201creversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-87. Furthermore, the claim is not cognizable and must be dismissed whether the plaintiff seeks to obtain monetary damages or to attack the validity of his confinement. <em>Id. </em>at 487; <em>see also Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 488-90, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">As Finley\u2019s conviction has not been invalidated, any ruling on Finley\u2019s arguments would call into question the validity of his conviction. Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing Finley\u2019s civil rights complaint. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
