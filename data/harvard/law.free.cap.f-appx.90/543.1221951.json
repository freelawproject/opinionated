(\u201cQuality\u201d) seeks reversal of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York\u2019s judgment granting Rocket Jewelry Box, Inc. (\u201cRocket\u201d) pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>judgment interest and a permanent injunction as remedies for Quality\u2019s infringement of U.S. Design Patent No. 333,264 (\u201cthe \u2019264 patent\u201d). <em>Rocket Jewelry Box, Inc. v. Quality Int\u2019l Packaging Co., Ltd., </em>250 F.Supp.2d 333 (S.D.N.Y.2003). Although we <em>affirm </em>the district court\u2019s decision to grant such remedies under the arbitration agreements, we <em>vacate-in-part </em>and <em>remand </em>because the permanent injunction does not comply with Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In its Second Amended Complaint, dated December 8, 1998, Rocket sought, <em>inter alia, </em>a finding that certain jewelry boxes manufactured and sold by Quality under the Marseille and Florence trademarks infringed the \u2019264 patent. Rocket therefore sought money damages, prejudgment interest, and a permanent injunction. By stipulation dated March 29, 1999 (\u201cFirst Stipulation\u201d), the parties agreed to submit all issues in the action to an American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) arbitration panel. The parties supplemented this agreement on January 18, 2000 (\u201cSecond Stipulation\u201d), noting that the arbitration panel should decide issues of validity and infringement while reserving for the district court the evaluation of any 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 defenses and assessment of the amount of Rocket\u2019s damages. In its Final Award issued January 8, 2001, the panel found the \u2019264 patent valid and infringed by seven of ten products in Quality\u2019s Florence and Marseille lines of jewelry boxes. It also found that such infringement was willful as of February 9, 1999. The district court confirmed the panel\u2019s Final Award by order filed May 10, 2002. <em>Rocket Jewelry Box. Inc. v. Quality Int\u2019l Packaging Co., Ltd., </em>No. 95 Civ 7900, slip op. (S.D.N.Y. May 10, 2002) (order granting motion to confirm the arbitration award).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The parties held a trial at the district court on May 13, 2002, on the issue of damages. The parties stipulated that the amount of actual damages was $65,054, leaving the question of enhanced willfulness damages to the court. Notably, Rocket also filed a motion at the district court for a permanent injunction. Quality opposed this motion, arguing that only the arbitration panel could grant injunctive relief and prejudgment interest. The court, however, found that it had the authority to grant such relief. On March 3, 2003, the district court entered a money judgment against Quality of $65,504 (finding no enhancement of damages for willfulness), granted Rocket\u2019s motion for a permanent injunction, and awarded Rocket prejudgment interest. <em>Rocket Jewelry Box, </em>No. 95 Civ. 7900, slip op. (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Quality filed a timely appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(4)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">On appeal, Quality argues that the district court did not have the authority under the arbitration agreements to grant a permanent injunction or prejudgment interest. Thus, because Rocket could have but did not request such relief from the arbitration panel, Quality maintains, <em>res judicata </em>applies to the Final Award and bars Rocket from seeking these remedies at the district court. At a minimum, Quality contends that the district court should have let the arbitration panel decide any questions as to the arbitrability of a permanent injunction or prejudgment interest. Quality alternatively argues that Rocket waived its right to a permanent injunction or prejudgment interest by failing to include such claims in the Joint Pretrial Order filed with the district court. Finally, according to Quality, even if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>affirm the district court\u2019s determination regarding remedies, we must vacate and remand because the permanent injunction does not comply with the requirements of Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Rocket responds that the Second Stipulation limited the issues for arbitration, leaving other issues such as remedies to the district court. In addition, Rocket argues it did not waive its right to a permanent injunction or prejudgment interest by not including specific requests therefor in the Joint Pretrial Order because (1) the \u201camount\u201d of damages inherently included the amount of prejudgment interest, and (2) the panel\u2019s finding of infringement entitled Rocket to an injunction. Finally, on the question of whether the injunction complied with Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rocket maintains that the district court has not in fact ordered an injunction given the absence of a separate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">When presented with procedural issues arising out of patent arbitrations, we \u201capply the law of the regional circuit to which the district appeal normally lies.\u201d <em>FlexFoot, Inc. v. CRP, Inc., </em>288 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2001). Conversely, if the issues arising out of the patent arbitration are unique to patent law and are intimately involved in its substance, we will apply our own law. <em>Id. </em>Here, we must determine whether the arbitration panel or the district court had the authority to grant a permanent injunction and prejudgment interest. Because this question is neither unique to patent law nor intimately involved therewith, we will apply the law of the Second Circuit, which reviews a district court\u2019s determination of the arbitrability of a claim <em>de novo. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Swiss Reinsurance Am. Corp., </em>246 F.3d 219, 225 (2d Cir.2001). In addition, the Second Circuit reviews <em>de novo </em>whether the issue of arbitrability is for the court or the arbitrator. <em>Bell v. Cendant Corp., </em>293 F.3d 563, 565 (2d Cir. 2002). Thus, we will also review these issues <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">We begin with an analysis of the arbitration agreements to determine whether the district court or the arbitration panel had the authority to grant a permanent injunction and prejudgment interest. The First Stipulation states that the parties would submit \u201call of the issues\u201d in dispute to an AAA arbitration panel. The Second Stipulation begins by stating that the First Stipulation \u201cshall remain in full force and effect except as modified below.\u201d It thereafter states, however, that \u201carbitration will proceed based on all of the issues related to the validity and infringement\u201d of the \u2019264 patent. In fact, five paragraphs in the Second Stipulation-paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13-characterize the panel\u2019s role as simply ruling on validity and infringement. Finally, in paragraph 9, the Second Stipulation specifically refers to the district court the determination of the amount of damages. Based on this language, the arbitration panel itself issued an order on March 19, 2000, in which it outlined the issues for the hearing as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">(a) validity of the \u2019264 Patent (with the exception of the defenses enumerated in 35 USC Section 112, which are excluded by the first sentence of paragraph 8 of the January 18, 2000 \u201cStipulation\u201d of the parties) and (b) infringement of the \u2019264 Patent by any product or products, including without limitation, the Marseille line, as well as the Florence lines of products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Notably, the panel did not include in its order any issues relating to remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">Based on a combined reading of the stipulations, we conclude that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>trict court had the authority to grant a permanent injunction and prejudgment in-ter\u00e9st. Although the First Stipulation was broad, we agree with the district court that the Second Stipulation limited the panel\u2019s authority to the issues of validity and infringement of the \u2019264 patent, thereby leaving the determination of remedies to the district court. The panel\u2019s March 19, 2000, order is consistent with this reading. Further, the fact that the arbitration panel did not address Rocket\u2019s requests for a permanent injunction and prejudgment interest in its Final Award is an additional indication that these issues were left to the district court. Based on this reading, we also agree with the district court\u2019s threshold decision that the determination of such remedies was within the scope of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Addressing Quality\u2019s waiver argument, we agree with the district court that Rocket\u2019s failure to request a permanent injunction and prejudgment interest in the Joint Pretrial Order did not constitute a waiver of those claims. To begin with, Rocket sought a permanent injunction in its amended complaint. Moreover, as the district court noted, pursuant to Rule 54(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cevery final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, <em>even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party\u2019s pleadings.\u2019\u2019 </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(c) (emphasis added). Thus, whether or not Rocket had specifically requested it, the district court could grant the proper relief, including prejudgment interest and a permanent injunction. In fact, as the district court noted, courts usually grant permanent injunctions, unless the public interest dictates otherwise. <em>See Odetics, Inc. v. Storage Tech. Corp., </em>185 F.3d 1259 (Fed.Cir. 1999) (stating that an injunction should generally follow an infringement verdict). Finally, we agree with the district court\u2019s assessment that, because Rocket filed a separate motion asking for a permanent injunction and gave no indication that it would abandon its pursuit of the matter, Rocket satisfied the notice purpose of the rule that pretrial orders delineate the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Finally, on appeal, Quality also challenges the district court on the grounds that it did not comply with the requirements of Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rocket counters that the district court has not in fact issued an injunction yet and therefore requests a remand. Rocket\u2019s argument rests on the Judgment issued by the district court on March 3, 2003, which orders $65,905 in money damages and prejudgment interest as of February 5, 1999, but does not mention a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">First, we reject Rocket\u2019s argument and conclude that the district court did in fact order a permanent injunction in its Opinion and Order issued March 3, 2003. The district court specifically stated \u201c[t]he Court <em>orders </em>that Quality be permanently enjoined from marketing the Florence and Marseille lines of jewelry boxes, or any similar such boxes, which infringe Rocket\u2019s \u2019264 patent.\u201d <em>Rocket Jewelry Box, </em>250 F.Supp.2d at 340, slip op. at 11 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (emphasis added). In its conclusion it reiterated that \u201cQuality is hereby permanently enjoined from selling any jewelry boxes similar to those sold under the Florence and Marseille trademarks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 13. These statements demonstrate that the district court has ordered a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">We do agree with Quality, however, that neither of the district court\u2019s statements comports with Rule 65(d) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">Every order granting an injunction ... shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained; and is binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-yF\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d). In addition to enjoining Quality from marketing and selling the Florence and Marseille lines of jewelry boxes, the district court also enjoined Quality from marketing and selling \u201cany similar such boxes\u201d and \u201cany jewelry boxes similar to those sold under the Florence and Marseille trademarks.\u201d <em>Rocket Jewelry Box, </em>No. 250 F.Supp.2d at 340, 341, \u201cSlip op. at 11, 13 (S.D.N.Y.2003). In so doing, however, the district court neither set forth the reasons for issuing this broad injunction nor specified and described in reasonable detail the parameters for determining the extent of any such \u201csimilarity.\u201d Therefore the district court\u2019s order does not comply with Rule 65(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">For the reasons given above, we affirm-in-p\u00e1rt, vacate-in-part, and remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
