Smith petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, alleging that prison officials violated his Eighth Amendment and due process rights by assigning him to nonpun-itive administrative segregation without a hearing. The district court concluded that Smith\u2019s petition did not satisfy the \u201cin custody\u201d element of \u00a7 2241 and denied it <em>sua sponte. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-25\">A prisoner seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 must first establish that he is \u201cin custody\u201d by virtue of the process or conduct he challenges, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c); actions by prison authorities that relate only to conditions of confinement and not to the fact or duration of that confinement do not affect custody, <em>see Alejo v. Heller, </em>328 F.3d 930, 937 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Bunn v. Conley, </em>309 F.3d 1002, 1007 (7th Cir.2002); <em>De-Walt v. Carter, </em>224 F.3d 607, 617 (7th Cir.2000). Whether Smith is allowed to remain in the general population at his prison or instead is housed in administrative segregation is a decision that affects only his conditions of confinement. <em>See Bunn, </em>309 F.3d at 1008; <em>Montgomery v. Anderson, </em>262 F.3d 641, 643 (7th Cir.2001). As the district court correctly held, Mr. Smith does not have a due process liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>interest in remaining free from administrative segregation because such segregation does not impose an \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Montgomery, </em>262 F.3d at 644. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Smith\u2019s writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
