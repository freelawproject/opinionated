In response to his termination, Kis-sell filed a complaint in the Western District of Pennsylvania against the DOC for violation of the rights afforded to him under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>After trial, a jury rejected Kissell\u2019s sexual harassment claim, but returned a verdict in his favor on his retaliation claim. The DOC moved for judgment as a matter of law, which was denied, and thereafter filed a timely appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-18\">The DOC raises three issues on appeal. First, the DOC asserts that the evidence does not support the jury\u2019s finding in favor of Kissell on one component of his retaliation claim. Second, the DOC contests certain of the damages assessed against it. Finally, the DOC argues that because the jury\u2019s verdict cannot stand, neither can the District Court\u2019s order to reinstate Kissell.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-19\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation in an employment discrimination suit brought under Title VII, a plaintiff \u201cmust show that (1) he was engaged in protected activity; (2) he was discharged subsequent to or contemporaneously with such activity; and (3) there is a causal link between the protected activity and the discharge.\u201d <em>Woodson v. Scott Paper Co., </em>109 F.3d 913, 920 (3d Cir.1997). The DOC concedes that Kissell at trial established the second and third components of his case. They argue, however, that the evidence, even when viewed in Kissell\u2019s favor, does not support a finding that Kissell was engaged in a protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-20\">\u201cAs a preliminary matter, protesting what an employee believes in good faith to be a discriminatory practice is clearly pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>tected conduct.\u201d <em>Aman v. Cort Furniture Rental Corp., </em>85 F.3d 1074, 1085 (3d Cir. 1996) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a); <em>Grif-fiths v. CIGNA Corp., </em>988 F.2d 457, 468 (3d Cir.1993)). <em>See also Griffiths, </em>988 F.2d at 468 (\u201ca plaintiff need not prove the merits of the underlying discrimination complaint, but only that \u2018he was acting under a good faith, reasonable belief that a violation existed\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Sumner v. United States Postal Service, </em>899 F.2d 203, 209 (2d Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The DOC concedes that Kissell was acting in good faith when he made his complaint. The DOC asserts, however, that Kissell\u2019s complaint was unreasonable. Thus, the issue on appeal is whether adequate evidence was presented to the jury to support a finding that Kissell reasonably believed that he was engaged in protected activity under Title VII. We \u201cview the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and determine whether the record contains the \u2018minimum quantum of evidence from which a jury might reasonably afford relief,\u2019 \u201d <em>Glenn Distribs. Corp. v. Carlisle Plastics, Inc., </em>297 F.3d 294, 299 (3d Cir.2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The evidence sufficiently supports the jury\u2019s finding that Kissell had a reasonable, good-faith belief to complain that he was harassed because he was male even as he also had a reasonable, good faith belief that he was harassed because he was a whistle-blower. Title VII jurisprudence does not require a plaintiffs sex to be the sole motivation or even the primary motivation for the harassment. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) (\u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discharge any individual ... <em>because of </em>such individual\u2019s ... sex\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Miller v. CIGNA Corp., </em>47 F.3d 586, 593-594 (3d Cir.1995) (\u201cCongress, by using the phrase \u2018because of,\u2019 did not mean \u2018solely because of.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">With regard to the damages award, we cannot conclude that $355,696 is an unreasonable amount to compensate for lost back pay and fringe benefits for the nearly eight years between Kissell\u2019s termination and the jury award. Moreover, if the jury should not have been instructed on fringe benefits, it behooved the DOC to say so then, not now. Finally, because we uphold the jury\u2019s verdict, Kissell\u2019s reinstatement as a corrections officer is, as the DOC concedes, appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Because we find in the record the \u201c \u2018minimum quantum of evidence from which a jury might reasonably afford relief,\u2019 \u201d we will affirm the order of the District Court denying the DOC\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>Glenn Distribs. Corp., </em>297 F.3d at 299 (citations omitted).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-15\">. Kissell also alleged violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and under Pennsylvania law.
