Johnson-who had previously worked for St. John\u2019s before injuring her back on the job in 1980-filed a complaint alleging that St. John\u2019s failed to hire her because of her disability. The district court granted summary judgment to St. John\u2019s after finding that Johnson did not present a prima facie case of employment discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-25\">Johnson\u2019s back injury restricts her from lifting more than 20 pounds. When she sought work at St. John\u2019s in 2000, Johnson did not front this restriction on her application or otherwise notify hospital personnel about her disability. She did list St. John\u2019s as a former employer on her application, along with three more recent employers-including one that fired her-but requested that they not be contacted. She also stated that she could work only on Sunday through Tuesday, on the night shift. St. John\u2019s requires that LPN applicants be available to work weekends, have adequate employment references, and a positive work history.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>St. John\u2019s Nursing Recruiter, Amy Yeates, reviewed Johnson\u2019s application and determined that, because Johnson\u2019s work history could not be verified and she was unwilling to work Saturdays, she was not qualified for the LPN position. Yeates notified Johnson by letter that she would not be interviewed. Yeates later stated that she did not consult with anyone at St. John\u2019s about Johnson\u2019s application and that she decided not to hire based solely on the information Johnson gave in her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Johnson did not offer any direct evidence of employment discrimination. Instead she relied on the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden shifting approach to prove her claim. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Lawson v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>245 F.3d 916, 922 (7th Cir. 2001). In applying the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test to Johnson\u2019s claim under the ADA, the district court concluded that Johnson could not establish that: (1) she was disabled, (2) she was qualified for the LPN position at St. John\u2019s given her employment history and unwillingness to work Saturdays, and (3) Yeates knew about her disability. Thus the court' reasoned that Johnson had failed to present a prima facie case of discrimination and granted summary judgment to St. John\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">On appeal Johnson argues that she is disabled, and that, because she previously worked for St. John\u2019s, Yeates must have known about her disability and decided not to hire her because of it. Thus, says Johnson, any other reason St. John\u2019s offered must have been pretextual. This argument, however, is based on speculation about St. John\u2019s underlying motives, an inappropriate inquiry-absent direct evidence of discrimination-unless Johnson first makes out a prima facie case of discrimination, <em>see Coco v. Elmwood Care, Inc., </em>128 F.3d 1177, 1179 (7th Cir.1997), which she failed to do. Moreover, even putting aside the district court\u2019s conclusion that Johnson lacked evidence of a disability, Johnson does not argue that she met St. John\u2019s qualifications or that those qualifications are somehow \u201cphony\u201d or not bona fide. <em>See id. </em>at 1179-80. For that reason alone she failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination, and we need not examine her claim any further. <em>See id.; see also Waggoner v. Olin Corp., </em>169 F.3d 481, 484 (7th Cir.1999) (disabled person must also meet employer\u2019s job qualifications to show prima facie case of employment discrimination under the ADA); <em>DePaoli v. Abbott Labs., </em>140 F.3d 668, 674 (7th Cir.1998) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
