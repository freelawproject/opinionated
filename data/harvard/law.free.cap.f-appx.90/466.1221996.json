NORRIS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">Petitioner Bruce Woods, an Ohio inmate, appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court determined that a two-year delay between entry of judgment and Woods\u2019 motion for leave to file a delayed appeal did not render his petition untimely. Rather, the district court concluded that the one-year statute of limitations for habeas corpus petitions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), was equitably tolled during that period because Woods had been diligent in pursuing his case. However, the court went on to hold that Woods\u2019 petition was nevertheless untimely because a pending petition for certiorari before the United States Supreme Court does not toll the one-year statute of limitations. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the district court\u2019s decision and remand for the court to develop the factual record regarding Woods\u2019 entitlement to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-19\">On June 14, 1996, Woods was convicted in Ohio state court on multiple counts of aggravated burglary, robbery, and kidnap-ing. He was sentenced to a prison term of 75 to 125 years with an additional 12 years for firearms specifications. Because the trial court failed to appoint appellate counsel for him in a timely fashion, he missed the 30-day deadline to file an appeal under Ohio law. On August 28, 1998, Woods filed a motion for leave to file a delayed appeal with the state appellate court. The Ohio appellate court denied the motion on October 10, 1998. The Ohio Supreme Court denied Woods\u2019 petition for review on February 3, 1999. The United States Supreme Court denied Woods\u2019 petition for certiorari on October 4,1999. On September 21, 2000. Woods filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-20\">Upon Woods\u2019 filing in district court, the state filed a motion to dismiss. The district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge, who recommended that the state\u2019s motion be granted because Woods had exceeded the one-year statute of limi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>tations period for habeas petitions by waiting two years to file his motion for leave to file a delayed appeal with the state appellate court. The district court granted Woods\u2019 objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, determining that the limitations period had been equitably tolled during that two-year period because Woods reasonably believed that his appeal had been timely filed and sat pending before the state appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The state then filed a second motion to dismiss, which the magistrate judge recommended granting. The magistrate judge determined that Woods\u2019 motion for leave to file a delayed appeal was a motion for collateral review under Ohio law, and pending petitions for certiorari before the United States Supreme Court do not toll the one-year habeas corpus statute of limitations when they stem from motions for collateral review. Because more than one year passed between the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s denial of review and Woods\u2019 filing his petition in the district court, the magistrate judge recommended dismissal. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and granted a certificate of appealability on October 4, 2002. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">After the briefs were filed in this appeal, this court rendered its decision in <em>Abela v. Martin, </em>348 F.3d 164 (6th Cir. 2003) (en banc) <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(U.S. Jan. 20, 2004) (No. 03-1079), in which we concluded that petitions for Supreme Court review do toll the limitations period. We are bound by our ruling in <em>Abela, </em>so the district court\u2019s dismissal of Woods\u2019 habeas corpus petition on that ground was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">However, in its briefs, the state identified an alternative reason for affirming the district court\u2019s dismissal, namely, that the district court erred in concluding that the statute of limitations was equitably tolled during Woods\u2019 two-year delay in moving for leave to file a delayed appeal. We review a district court\u2019s grant of equitable tolling for abuse of discretion. <em>Dunlap v. United States, </em>250 F.3d 1001, 1007-08 n. 2 (6th Cir.2001). In <em>Dunlap, </em>this court noted that the following factors should be considered when determining whether to apply equitable tolling: \u201c(1) the petitioner\u2019s lack of notice of the filing requirement; (2) the petitioner\u2019s lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement; (3) diligence in pursuing one\u2019s rights; (4) absence of prejudice to the respondent; and (5) the petitioner\u2019s reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the legal requirement for filing his claim.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 1008. In denying respondent\u2019s first motion to dismiss, the district court explained its application of equitable tolling in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel failed to timely file a direct appeal. Petitioner relied on this inadequate assistance of counsel and did not inquire into the progress of [the] appeal because another prisoner assured him that the appeals process takes years. The Magistrate Judge found that this reliance was unreasonable.... The Court disagrees based upon the numerous cases cited by Petitioner in which the appeals process took years to complete and concludes that Petitioner\u2019s failure to realize that his direct appeal had not been timely brought by his trial counsel to be [sic] reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">In its briefs, the state argued that Woods\u2019 two-year delay in moving for leave to file a delayed appeal demonstrated a lack of diligence on Woods\u2019 part and that his reliance on assurances from another prisoner was unreasonable. Therefore, the district court was precluded from applying equitable tolling. The state concluded by urging us to affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal on the grounds that equitable tolling was improperly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>However, at oral argument, counsel for the state requested that we remand the case to the district court for further factual development regarding Woods\u2019 diligence in pursuing his rights and his reasonableness in remaining ignorant of his need to file an appeal. In particular, counsel urged a remand for the district court to ascertain when Woods first requested appellate representation and when he first received it. Woods\u2019 counsel agreed that a hearing was needed. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal and remand for the district court to develop the factual record regarding Woods\u2019 entitlement to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The judgment of the district court is VACATED and the cause REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
