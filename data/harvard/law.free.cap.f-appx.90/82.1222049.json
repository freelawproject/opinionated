Ameristar cross-appeals the damages award. After reviewing the pleadings and hearing oral argument, we affirm the judgment of the district court for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-24\">1. The pretrial order provided adequate notice to Stehr of Ameristar\u2019s claim for conspiracy to commit fraud. <em>See Thrift v. Hubbard, </em>44 F.3d 348, 356 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cUnder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a pleading, or pretrial order, need not specify in exact detail every possible theory of recovery \u2014 it must only \u2018give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-25\">2. The district court did not clearly err in concluding that Durrani acted in a dual capacity on behalf of Signal Composites, Inc. d/b/a Signal Aerospace (\u201cSignal\u201d) and Aerospace Logistics. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). The district court\u2019s finding is supported by evidence in the record that Durrani worked for Signal as a business consultant and that he was paid consulting fees through Aerospace Logistics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>3. There was sufficient evidence presented at trial for the district court to reasonably conclude that Stehr knowingly participated in the conspiracy to commit fraud. The district court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">4. The district court did not clearly err in awarding damages. The district court\u2019s calculation of benefit-of-the-bargain damages is plausible in light of conflicting evidence in the record as to the value of the liners as represented. <em>See St. Martin v. Mobil Exploration &amp; Producing U.S. Inc., </em>224 F.3d 402, 410 (5th Cir.2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b122-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
