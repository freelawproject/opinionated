A state prisoner convicted of two counts of burglary, Smith contends that the increase in his prison sentence following his successful appeals of the original conviction and sentence following a new trial violated his Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights. After review, we will affirm the Distinct Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Smith was convicted by a jury of two counts of burglary in the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas on January 31, 1991. He had proceeded <em>pro se </em>with standby counsel during trial, but was represented by counsel for sentencing. After a three and a half year delay, Smith received on July 24, 1994 concurrent sentences of nine to twenty years for the conviction. The Pennsylvania Superior Court subsequently reversed Smith\u2019s conviction and granted a new trial, finding that Smith had not waived his right to counsel during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Following a second jury trial, Smith was again convicted on September 22, 1995 of two counts of burglary. The trial court subsequently sentenced Smith to twenty to forty years in prison, and denied Smith\u2019s motion to modify the sentence. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Superior Court vacated the sentence and remanded for a new sentence, ruling that the trial court failed to cite any identifiable conduct occurring after the first sentencing to justify a new sentence twice the original length. Smith was then resenteneed to two concurrent nine to twenty year terms on March 11, 1997, but with the sentences running consecutively to any other sentence Smith was then serving. Smith filed a motion for a new trial or arrest of judgment, which the sentencing court denied. The Superior Court affirmed the new sentence on April 21, 1998, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied Smith\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">Smith filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on April 12, 1999. The petition was subsequently transferred to the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In his petition, Smith raised twelve grounds for relief. The District Court subsequently dismissed Smith\u2019s petition, finding that Smith had not exhausted all of his claims in state courts. This court then vacated and remanded the case, finding Smith to have fairly presented the claims in state courts. On remand, the District Court denied Smith\u2019s petition on the merits on January 28, 2002, and declined to issue a certificate of appealability. This court subsequently granted a certificate of appealability with respect to Smith\u2019s claim that his increased sentence violated due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">The District Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 2253. Our review of the District Court\u2019s order is plenary. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), a state court\u2019s adverse resolution of a claim of constitutional error provides a basis for federal habeas relief only if the state adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>or if it \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2089, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), the Supreme Court stated that \u201cDue Process of law ... requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725. As the Court explained in <em>United States v. Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982), <em>Pearce </em>creates a \u201cpresumption of vindictiveness\u201d when the same trial judge imposes a harsher sentence following a new trial after the defendant had successfully appealed his/her original conviction, which presumption \u201cmay be overcome only by objective information in the record justifying the increased sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374; <em>see Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, </em>412 U.S. 17, 27, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 36 L.Ed.2d 714 (1973) (finding that the <em>Pearce </em>presumption derives from the judge\u2019s \u201cpersonal stake in the prior conviction\u201d). The <em>Pearce </em>rule, however, \u201cdo[es] not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial.\u201d <em>Texas v. McCullough, </em>475 U.S. 134, 138, 106 S.Ct. 976, 89 L.Ed.2d 104 (1986). Where there is no \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that \u201cthe increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority ... the burden remains upon the defendant to prove actual vindictiveness.\u201d <em>Alabama v. Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 799-800, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Smith, relying on <em>Pearce, </em>contends that the sentencing court vindictively enhanced his prison sentence after he had successfully overturned, on separate appeals, his original guilty verdict and the twenty-to-forty-year sentence following retrial. He contends that the main reason offered by the sentencing judge for enhancing his sentenee-his prison misconducts prior to sentencing-is so insubstantial that it indicates the sentencing court\u2019s animosity toward him. He further argues that the sentencing court should have credited him with time served from April 6, 1990, the date of his arrest, to March 11, 1997, the date of his final resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">We conclude that the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s upholding of Smith\u2019s sentence is neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, established federal law. By imposing a new sentence to be served \u201cconsecutive to any sentence that [Smith is] currently serving,\u201d App. at 24, rather than dating it from April 5, 1990 (as was the case during Smith\u2019s first sentencing), the trial judge increased Smith\u2019s term of incarceration following retrial. But even if the <em>Pearce </em>presumption were applicable, the record clearly presents sufficient evidence to rebut that presumption here. The presentence investigation report on Smith, completed prior to the most recent sentencing, shows four prison misconducts between June, 1994 and December, 1996. WTiile some of these misconducts may be minor infractions such as possession of excessive commissary, others include assault on a correction officer and conducting a gambling operation while in prison. These are serious misconducts that were unknown to the trial judge during Smith\u2019s first sentencing hearing, and the trial judge properly considered this objective and material information in imposing an increased sentence following retrial. <em>See McCullough, </em>475 U.S. at 142 (\u201cNothing in the Constitution requires a judge to ignore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>objective information ... justifying the increased sentence.\u201d) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Moreover, during the most recent sentencing hearing the trial judge exhibited no signs of animosity toward Smith, and had even stated that \u201cI don\u2019t find you to be a disagreeable fellow.\u201d App. at 23. While such disclaimer alone may be insufficient in overcoming the presumption of vindictiveness, it supports the finding that Smith\u2019s new sentence was the product of the trial judge\u2019s objective reasoning rather than personal emotions. Therefore, we cannot hold that the Pennsylvania Superior Court unreasonably applied existing federal law in affirming Smith\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
