It is</p>\n<p id=\"b41-18\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the sentence imposed by the district court be affirmed. Cunningham contends the court erred because it did not <em>sua sponte </em>convene an evidentiary hearing regarding the Government\u2019s proposed two-level sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice. Because Cunningham neither requested an evidentiary hearing nor objected to the court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing, we review the sentence imposed by the district court only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mendez-Cruz, </em>329 F.3d 885, 886 (D.C.Cir.2003). We may vacate the sentence only if there is (1) an error (2) that is plain, which (3) \u201caffects substantial rights\u201d of the defendant, and (4) which \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 462, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997); <em>see United States v. Olano, 507 </em>U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-20\">The district court did not err; it was well within its broad discretion to decide whether the sentence enhancement was warranted based upon the evidence in the affidavits and submissions of both parties, without holding an evidentiary hearing. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>336 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Berndt, </em>127 F.3d 251, 257 (2d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Gaviria, </em>116 F.3d 1498, 1527 (D.C.Cir.1997). Furthermore, even if there was an error it was not \u201cplain error\u201d because the need for an evidentiary hearing was not \u201cobvious\u201d to the district court given the evidence and the arguments before it. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>115 F.3d 1008, 1010 (D.C.Cir.1997) (\u201c[E]ven for sentencing, \u2018obvious\u2019 means obvious; the district court is not required to have second-sight\u201d). Nor did any error affect Cunningham\u2019s substantial rights; Cunningham has made no showing he was actually prejudiced by the failure to hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 462; <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-22\">In light of the record as a whole \u2014 the submissions of the parties, the documentary evidence, and the oral argument before the district court \u2014 that court was justified in enhancing Cunningham\u2019s sentence for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published.
