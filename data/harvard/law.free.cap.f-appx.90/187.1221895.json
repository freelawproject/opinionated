Anderson argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines in calculating her criminal history points and in denying her a reduction for her role in the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-25\">We conclude the district court did not clearly err in finding that Anderson was not eligible for a mitigating-role reduction. <em>See United States v. Field, </em>110 F.3d 587, 590 (8th Cir.1997). Nor did the court clearly err in calculating Anderson\u2019s criminal history. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.2) (criminal history points are based on sentence pronounced, not length of time actually served), comment, (n.3) (prior sentences are related if they resulted from offenses that occurred on same occasion, were part of single common scheme or plan, or were consolidated for trial or sentencing); <em>United States v. Levi, </em>229 F.3d 677, 679 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review). Accordingly, we affirm. Anderson\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-19\">.
