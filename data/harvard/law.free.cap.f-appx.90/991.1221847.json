Because the transitional rules apply, see <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review constitutional challenges de novo, <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 517 (9th Cir. 2001), and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">Petitioners concede that they did not accrue seven years of continuous physical presence before the government served them with an Order to Show Cause, and that they are ineligible for suspension of deportation under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act\u2019s stop-time rule. Their challenge to the retroactive application of the Act to their case is foreclosed by <em>Ram, </em>243 F.3d at 518 (rejecting constitutional challenge to application of the stop-time rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1032-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
