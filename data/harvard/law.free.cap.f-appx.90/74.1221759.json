Rodriguez-Tamez argues that the district court clearly erred in imposing a two-level offense-level enhancement based on his role as a manager or supervisor in the offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-23\">The record does not contain sufficient reliable evidence to support the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>court\u2019s finding that Rodriguez-Tamez organized, led, managed, or supervised at least one other person who was criminally culpable in, though not necessarily convicted for, the offense. <em>See United States v.

Accordingly, Rodriguez-Tamez\u2019s sentence is VACATED and this case is REMANDED for resentencing as to this issue, without prejudice to the possibility that an upward departure might be warranted for Rodriguez-Tamez\u2019s management responsibility of the property, assets or activities of the conspiracy. <em>See Jobe, </em>101 F.3d at 1068 <em>&amp; </em>n. 30; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b114-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
