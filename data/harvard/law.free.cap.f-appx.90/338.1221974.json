R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Defendant-Appellant Angel Garibay-Anguiano pleaded guilty to one count of violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, re-entry into the United States of a previously removed alien. On appeal, Mr. Garibay-Anguiano challenges the sufficiency of the indictment and the application of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (2002) (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cthe Guidelines\u201d). We take jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), AFFIRM the judgment of the district court, and GRANT Jon D. Williams\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">After Mr. Garibay-Anguiano pleaded guilty to violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, the government moved for a sentence enhancement under subsection b. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) (authorizing increased sentences for certain criminal activity or suspected terrorist involvement committed by aliens who were previously removed from the United States). The district court adopted the government\u2019s recommendation, which closely followed that of the pre-sentencing report. Next, the district court, pursuant to the Guidelines, calculated Mr. Garibay-Anguiano\u2019s offense level at twenty-one and issued a fifty-seven-month sentence, the lowest time permitted for this offense level. Mr. Garibay-Anguiano did not object to the indictment or sentence enhancement before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-17\">On appeal, Mr. Garibay-Anguiano, appearing pro se and through court-appointed counsel,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> raises two general issues for consideration by this Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>challenges the sufficiency of his indictment because he believes it fails to state in a plain, clear, and concise manner all of the charges against him. Second, Mr. Garibay-Anguiano contends that the district court improperly calculated his sentence enhancement. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Because Mr. Garibay-Anguiano raised neither of his issues on appeal in the district court, we review them for plain error. <em>United States v. Ruiz-Gea, </em>340 F.3d 1181, 1185 (10th Cir.2003). \u201cTo notice plain error ... the error must (1) be an actual error that was forfeited; (2) be plain or obvious; and (3) affect substantial rights.... \u201d <em>United States v. Edgar, </em>348 F.3d 867, 871 (10th Cir.2003). Even if these conditions are satisfied, we have discretion to reverse only if the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Mr. Garibay-Anguiano argues that his indictment failed to contain the clarity and specificity necessary to avoid constitutional error because it failed to reference subsection b of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 or the factors set forth therein, which the government relied on in its motion for a sentence enhancement. The indictment did, however, reference \u00a7 1326 generally. \u201cAn indictment must set forth pach element of the crime that it charges. But it need not set forth factors relevant only to the sentencing of an offender found guilty of the charged crime.\u201d <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 228, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (citation omitted). The relevant question, therefore, is: did the Congress intend for \u00a7 1326(b) \u201cto help define a separate crime\u201d from that set forth in \u00a7 1326(a) or to provide \u201ca factor that a sentencing court might use to increase punishment?\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Addressing this precise question, the Supreme Court in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201ceonclude[d] that the subsection is a penalty provision, which simply authorizes a court to increase the sentence for a recidivist. It does not define a separate crime. Consequently, neither the statute nor the Constitution requires the Government to charge the factor that it mentions, an earlier conviction, in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226-27 (interpreting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">We note, however, that in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Court expressed concern about the continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres. Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489 (\u201c[I]t is arguable that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided, and that a logical application of our reasoning today should apply if the recidivist issue were contested.\u201d). Nevertheless, the Court reasoned that any due process or Sixth Amendment concerns \u2014 arising out of the judicial determination of a \u201cfact\u201d that increased punishment beyond the statutory maximum \u2014 were mitigated in <em>Al-mendarez-Torres </em>by \u201c[bjoth the certainty that procedural safeguards attached to any \u2018fact\u2019 of prior conviction, and the reality that [the defendant] did not challenge the accuracy of that \u2018fact\u2019 in his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488. Thus, the Court did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in <em>Apprendi; </em>rather, it made an exception from the general Apprendi-rule for \u201cprior convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">The Ninth Circuit has drawn this same conclusion and noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Because <em>Apprendi </em>preserves <em>Almenda-rez-Torres </em>as a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to Apprendi\u2019s general rule, we can conclude, at most, that <em>Apprendi </em>casts doubt on the continuing viability of <em>Al-mendarez-Torres. </em>If the views of the Supreme Court\u2019s individual Justices and the composition of the Court remain the same, <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>may eventually be overruled. But such speculation does not permit us to ignore controlling Supreme Court authority. Unless and until <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is overruled by the Supreme Court, we must follow it. <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">For these reasons, then, we reject Mr. Garibay-Anguiano\u2019s contention that the government\u2019s failure to include a specific reference to \u00a7 1326(b) and its factors in its indictment is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">IV. APPLICATION OF THE SENTENCING GUIDELINES</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Construing his pleadings liberally, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), Mr. Garibay-Anguiano alleges that the district court improperly enhanced his base offense level by sixteen points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). This provision imposes a sixteen-point enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was deported ... after ... a conviction for a felony that is (i) a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1). Mr. Garibay-Anguiano asserts that this provision does not apply to him because, although he previously received a one to fifteen-year prison sentence for trafficking cocaine, he was released on parole after serving only eleven months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Noting that no courts have ruled otherwise, we adopt the approach taken by the Fifth Circuit in <em>United States v. Mendez-Villa, </em>346 F.3d 568 (5th Cir.2003), the Third Circuit in <em>United States v. Frias, </em>338 F.3d 206 (3d Cir.2003), and the Eight Circuit in <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Ar-reola, </em>313 F.3d 1064 (8th Cir.2002), and hold that the term \u201csentence imposed\u201d means the maximum term of imprisonment given to a defendant at sentencing, not the actual time served. Application Note 1 of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 specifically denotes the instances in which courts should consider prior conviction factors other than the term of imprisonment imposed at sentencing. \u201cIf all or any part of a sentence of imprisonment was probated, suspended, deferred, or stayed, \u2018sentence imposed\u2019 refers only to the portion that was not probated, suspended, deferred, or stayed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, Application Note l(A)(iv). Unlike parole, however, \u201c[pjrobation, suspension, and so forth are actions taken at the time of sentencing. Thus, the Application Note tends to confirm that in this guideline, as in federal criminal law generally, the term \u2018sentence imposed\u2019 means the sentence reflected in the criminal judgment, not the sentence the defendant ultimately serves.\u201d <em>Rodriguez-Ar-reola, </em>313 F.3d at 1066; see <em>also Mendez-Villa, </em>346 F.3d at 570.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, we do not consider the time actually served, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>time to which Mr. Garibay-Anguiano was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Mr. Garibay-Anguiano also argues that his prior one to fifteen-year sentence does not meet the requirements of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) because the bottom range of his sentence falls below the requirement that \u201cthe sentence imposed [must have] exceeded 13 months.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). We reject this argument because \u201cthe sentence imposed is the maximum term of imprisonment in an indeterminate sentence.\u201d <em>Mendez-Villa, </em>346 F.3d at 570 (citations omitted); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48) (\u201cAny reference to a term of imprisonment or sentence with respect to an offense is deemed to include the period of incarceration or confinement ordered by a court of law regardless of any suspension of the imposition or execution of that sentence of imprisonment in whole or in part.\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, Application Note 2 (stating that for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.2(a)-(c) \u201csentence imposed\u201d, in the case of an indeterminate sentence, is the maximum sentence). Because the prior maximum sentence imposed on Mr. Garibay-Anguiano is fifteen-years, his enhancement does not run afoul of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The indictment\u2019s failure to specifically reference \u00a7 1326(b) or its factors is not error. Further, the district court properly calculated Mr. Garibay-Anguiano\u2019s sentence under the Guidelines. Therefore, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court and GRANT Mr. Williams\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-13\">. Mr. Garibay-Anguiano's court-appointed counsel, Mr. Williams, filed a motion for leave to withdraw as counsel pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In his brief to this Court, Mr. Williams provided a succinct description of Mr. Garibay-Anguiano\u2019s claims and stated that, in his view, this appeal is meritless and frivolous. Finding that counsel has satisfied his obligations under <em>Anders, </em>we GRANT Mr. Williams\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-19\">. In his brief, Mr. Garibay-Anguiano denotes five separate grounds for appeal. Four of these grounds, however, contest the adequacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>of his indictment. Thus, we discuss them together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">. The recently enacted 2003 edition of the Guidelines, though not dispositive in this appeal, <em>see United States v. Zamudio, </em>314 F.3d 517, 518 (10th Cir.2002) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.11(a)), supports this conclusion. That edition defines \"sentence imposed\u201d as synonymous with \"sentence of imprisonment [as discussed] in Application Note 2 and subsection (b) of \u00a7 4A1.2[.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, Application Note l(B)(vii). Application Note 2 then holds that sentence of imprisonment under the Guidelines is \"based on the sentence pronounced, not the length of time actually served.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
