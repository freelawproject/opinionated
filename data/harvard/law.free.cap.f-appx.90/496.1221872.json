Keith Idema, Gary Scurka, Kathy Scurka, and Jim Morris filed this copyright action claiming that Defendants\u2019 motion picture, <em>The Peacemaker, </em>infringed eight of Plaintiffs\u2019 works. The district court granted summary judgment to Defendants, and we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">1. We grant Plaintiffs\u2019 request for judicial notice, because the document in question (a copyright registration for a ninth work, a letter from Plaintiff Idema to Defendant Spielberg) is the sort as to which judicial notice is appropriate. Fed. R.Evid. 201(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Nevertheless, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to file a third amended complaint after it entered summary judgment. <em>See Nguyen v. United States, </em>792 F.2d 1500, 1503 (9th Cir.1986) (stating that entry of summary judgment may affect the court\u2019s decision whether to grant leave to amend pleadings). Plaintiffs did not adequately explain all the delay in requesting the amendment, and Defendants would have been prejudiced by having to litigate a new claim when they already had obtained a ruling in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">We express no opinion as to whether the ninth work (the Spielberg letter) may be the subject of a separate copyright action (if one is timely filed), but the district court was not required to allow litigation over the letter in <em>this </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">2. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for discovery insofar as that discovery was to occur before the court ruled on the summary judgment motion. The district court accepted Defendants\u2019 concession (made for the purpose of summary judgment only) that they had access to Plaintiffs\u2019 works, so the additional evidence of access that was sought was not required at that stage of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">3. We have reviewed in painstaking detail Plaintiffs\u2019 eight works and <em>The Peacemaker, </em>and we conclude that no reasonable juror could find substantial similarity of ideas and expression, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. <em>See Shaw v. Lindheim, </em>919 F.2d 1353, 1355 (9th Cir.1990) (stating standard for summary judgment in copyright infringement case). To the extent that there are similarities, many of them relate to historical facts, which are not themselves subject to copyright protection, or to stock characters and scenes \u00e1 faire. The remaining similarities are not substantial, and the differences between the film and Plaintiffs\u2019 eight works are extensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">We express no view on whether the ninth work, which we have concluded is not part of this action, is substantially similar to <em>The Peacemaker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">4. The district court dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of confidence claim under California state law, giving two alternative, independently sufficient reasons: Copyright Act preemption and failure to state a claim under state law. On appeal, Plaintiffs challenge the district court\u2019s first reason, but not the second. In the circumstances, Plaintiffs have waived any argument on appeal that the district court\u2019s second reason (based on the elements of the claim under state law) was erroneous. We therefore uphold the district court\u2019s ruling without expressing any view on the question of preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>5. We lack jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal with respect to attorney fees awarded under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505. Plaintiffs designated for review only the \u201ccivil judgment\u201d on the merits. The judgment so designated was entered on December 12, 2001, and it did not address the question of fees. Fees were addressed in a separate judgment entered on January 10, 2002, from which no appeal was taken. We lack jurisdiction to review an order granting fees in that circumstance. <em>Leslie v. Grupo ICA, </em>198 F.3d 1152, 1160 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">6. We decline to consider additional issues that Plaintiffs raised for the first time in their reply brief. <em>Eberle v. City of Anaheim, </em>901 F.2d 814, 818 (9th Cir.1990) (noting that \u201c[i]t is well established in this circuit that [t]he general rule is that appellants cannot raise a new issue for the first time in their reply briefs\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Request for judicial notice GRANTED. AFFIRMED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
