We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings de novo, <em>Lopez-Urenda v. Ashcroft, </em>345 F.3d 788, 791 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">We review the IJ\u2019s opinion as the \u201cfinal agency determination\u201d for purposes of this appeal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(iii); <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). Because the IJ\u2019s interpretation and application of the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b) was well within the broad bounds of the statutory language, it does not violate due process. <em>See Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1001, 1003 (9th Cir.2003). Once we determine that the IJ\u2019s interpretation falls within this broad range authorized by the statutory language, our inquiry ends. <em>See id. </em>at 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">To the extent Petitioner contends that the BIA\u2019s streamlining procedures violate due process, his challenge is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850-51 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">The Clerk is directed to stay the mandate pending the resolution of <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 03-70477 and further order of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1030-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
