After considering the parties\u2019 arguments and the applicable law, this Court concludes that the employee does not have a protected property interest and AFFIRMS the judgment of the district court finding the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">The appellant, Jesus P. Rodriguez (Rodriguez), worked for the Hidalgo County (Texas) Sheriffs Department for twelve years until he was terminated in the fall of 2001. Rodriguez sought review of his termination by the Hildalgo County Civil Service Commission (the Commission). In the spring of 2002, the Commission ordered the Sheriffs Department to reinstate Rodriguez. But the Sheriff, Appellee Henry Escal\u00f3n, refused to rehire Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">In response, Rodriguez sued Sheriff Es-cal\u00f3n under section 1983 of title 42 for depriving him of property without due process of law as prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Both parties moved for summary judgment. In their motions, the parties addressed whether Rodriguez possessed a protected property interest in his job with the Sheriffs Department. After considering the parties\u2019 motions, the district court found that Rodriguez was an at-will employee of the Sheriffs Department, and thus, Rodriguez lacked a property interest within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, the district court granted Sheriff Escalon\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied Rodriguez\u2019s motion, and dismissed the lawsuit. Rodriguez challenges that determination in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-18\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b817-19\">This appeal presents a question of law; that is, whether Rodriguez had a protected property interest in his job. This Court reviews the district court\u2019s determination about this question of law de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Whether a Property Interest Exists</p>\n<p id=\"A36\">On appeal, Rodriguez maintains the district court erred by concluding that he lacked a property interest in his job with the Sheriffs Department. Rodriguez admits that no contract between himself and the Sheriffs Department existed, but argues that property interests in government employment are commonly created by administrative rule-making. Relying on several Supreme Court opinions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rodriguez argues that the Commission\u2019s rules created a property interest in his employment by prohibiting arbitrary dismissal and allowing him to challenge his termination at a hearing. He also argues that this Court in <em>Glenn v. </em>Newman<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> found that similar policies and procedures indicated a mutual understanding between the employer and the employee that the employee had a property interest in continued employment. In addition, Rodriguez relies on several Commission rules that he asserts indicate he was not an at-will employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\">Only government employees who can show that they have a property interest in continued employment are entitled to the procedural due process protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA property interest in employment can ... be created by ordinance, or by an implied contract. In either case, however, the sufficiency of the claim of entitlement must be decided by reference to state law.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In Texas, \u201cthere exists a presumption that employment is at-will unless that relationship has been expressly altered,\u201d either by contract or by express rules limiting the conditions under which an employee may be terminated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Any agreement to modify the at-will relationship, however, must be clear and specific.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the context of public employment, any ambiguity is resolved in favor of the state.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">In the instant case, no clear and specific agreement exists to modify the at-will relationship. Although the Commission has promulgated rules regarding prohibited employee conduct, those rules are specifically stated in terms of \u201cexamples\u201d of prohibited conduct. Including a non-exhaustive list of prohibited conduct does not constitute an express and specific modification of the at-will employment relationship.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s previous determ\u00edna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>tion in <em>Glenn v. Newman </em>does not control here because the regulations at issue in <em>Glenn </em>listed the reasons an employee could be disciplined and specifically provided that suspension and dismissal could occur only \u201cfor cause.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That is not the case with the Commission\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Likewise, the provision for an employee grievance system such as the one included in the Commission\u2019s rules does not constitute an express and specific modification of the at-will employment relationship.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Even though the Commission\u2019s rules provide that the Commission will reverse the Sheriffs action if it finds the adverse employment action was arbitrary or capricious, in Texas, even an oral or written statement that an employee may be terminated for \u201cgood reason\u201d or \u201cgood cause\u201d without further definition of these terms will not alter the at-will employment relationship.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Additionally, the \u201cat-will\u201d language regarding probationary employees in the Commission\u2019s rules does not constitute an express and specific modification of the at-will relationship. Notably, the rules contain no language that indicates an employee can be terminated only for good reason or for good cause. Without such language, no express and specific modification of the at-will relationship exists. Even if any ambiguity existed about whether the at-will relationship had been expressly modified, this Court must resolve that ambiguity in favor of the Sheriff.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">Because the at-will employment relationship between the Sheriff and his employees was not modified, Rodriguez had no protected property interest. Without a protected property interest, the district court did not err by granting the Sheriffs motion for summary judgment. Consequently, this Court AFFIRMS the district court\u2019s order dismissing Rodriguez\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-20\">. <em>See Wyatt v.
