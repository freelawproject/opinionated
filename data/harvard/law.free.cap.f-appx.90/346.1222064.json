R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-25\">Defendant-Appellant Kurt Merriam entered a conditional plea of guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>serving his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence of the handgun found in his car. He now appeals the denial of this motion. We take jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In response to a dispute with two adolescent boys, Mr. Merriam chased the boys, who were on bicycles, in his car. This chase led through side streets, an apartment complex parking lot, into traffic, and eventually to a restaurant parking lot. During this time, Mr. Merriam\u2019s wife and young child accompanied him in the backseat of his car. Once at the restaurant, the boys ran inside. Mr. Merriam then exited his car and attempted to place one of the boys\u2019 bicycles into his trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">At this time, two Granite School District Police Officers exited the restaurant and stopped Mr. Merriam. The officers, upon confronting Mr. Merriam, noted that he \u201cwas very agitated ..., very mad ... [and] almost hyper....\u201d Additionally, Mr. Merriam\u2019s \u201cappearance, his demeanor, and everything indicated that he was under the influence of some type of controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">While questioning Mr. Merriam regarding his actions, the officers frisked him for weapons and requested identification. Mr. Merriam informed the officers that his identification was in the front seat of his car and moved toward the driver\u2019s door. One of the officers stopped Mr. Merriam, informed him that the officer would retrieve the identification, and confirmed with Mr. Merriam that the identification was on the front seat of the car. The officer picked up the only item on either front seat, a black case. Immediately upon lifting the case, a velcro flap on its bottom opened, revealing the butt of a handgun. The officer then placed the case back in the car and arrested Mr. Merriam for theft and possession of a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Before the district court, Mr. Merriam filed a motion to suppress evidence of the handgun. He alleged that the officer\u2019s entry into the car and handling of the black case constituted an unlawful search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The district court denied his motion, finding the search justified under the officer safety exception as set forth in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">\u201cIn reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we accept the factual findings of the district court, and its determination of witness credibility, unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Cervine, </em>347 F.3d 865, 868 (10th Cir.2003). We consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding of the district court and make the ultimate determination of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">Mr. Merriam claims that the officer\u2019s search of the passenger compartment of Mr. Merriam\u2019s car was not necessary to protect officer safety under <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983). In <em>Long, </em>the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqr6\">the search of the passenger compartment of an automobile, limited to those areas in which a weapon may be placed or hidden, is permissible if the police officer possesses a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant the officers in believing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons. <em>Id. </em>at 1049 (internal quotation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_5\">We reject Mr. Merriam\u2019s argument, holding that a reasonable officer could have reached the conclusion that Mr. Merriam was dangerous and may have gained immediate control of a weapon. Similar holdings from other circuits heavily influence our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>969 F.2d 126, 131-32 (5th Cir.1992), the defendant, a suspected drug trafficker, exited his automobile after being stopped by police officers. <em>Id. </em>When asked for his identification, the defendant stated that it was in a leather pouch in the passenger seat of his automobile. <em>Id. </em>Rather than allow the defendant to get the pouch himself, the officers reached into -the automobile and retrieved the pouch. <em>Id. </em>The officers then opened the pouch, finding a gun. <em>Id. </em>The Fifth Circuit held that, given the circumstances in that case, officer safety concerns justified the officers\u2019 actions in retrieving the pouch themselves. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. Cardona-Rivera, </em>904 F.2d 1149, 1154 (7th Cir.1990), the Seventh Circuit held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">[t]he officers were entitled to demand identification from [the defendant], and when he told them that they would find it, in the form of a ticket, in his ear, they were entitled to enter the car and look for it. It would have been reckless for them, suspecting what they did, to let him enter the car and rummage for the ticket, for he might have had a gun under the seat or in the glove compartment. So the action of the police in entering the car was lawful[.] <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">We face a situation similar to those in <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Cardona-Rivera. </em>Here, as in those cases, the officers had ample reason to view Mr. Merriam as a threat to their safety, thus justifying their retrieval of Mr. Merriam\u2019s identification. First, the officers\u2019 believed Mr. Merriam to be under the influence of an intoxicant. While suspicion of alcohol or illegal drug use <em>on its own </em>does not justify a search premised on officer safety, <em>see United States v. Wald, </em>216 F.3d 1222, 1227 (10th Cir.2000), when combined with Mr. Merriam\u2019s other actions, it enhances officer safety concerns, <em>see Long, </em>463 U.S. at 1050 (noting, as one of the justifications for the weapons search, that the defendant \u201cappeared to be \u2018under the influence\u2019 of some intoxicant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Second, Mr. Merriam, based only on a verbal altercation with two boys, chased them with his car prior to his encounter with the officers. Third, the officers saw Mr. Merriam attempt to steal one of the boys\u2019 bicycles and throw it to the ground when he was unable to fit the bicycle into his trunk. Given this volatile and potentially intoxicant-induced behavior, we find that a reasonable officer, evaluating all of the facts before him, would have reasonably believed that Mr. Merriam was dangerous and that he could have gained immediate control of a weapon, thereby justifying the officer\u2019s retrieval of Mr. Merriam\u2019s identification from the passenger compartment of his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Merriam\u2019s motion to suppress entry of the handgun into evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
