After careful review of the record, we deny the petition because substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the IJ\u2019s conclusions. <em>See Menedez-Donis v. Ashcroft, </em>360 F.3d 915, -, 2004 WL 307451, at *3 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review). The IJ concluded that Oduah was not entitled to asylum: he had been subjected to discrimination and harassment, but not persecution, on account of his religion, <em>see Fisher v. INS, </em>291 F.3d 491, 497 (8th Cir.2002) (slurs and harassment from private individuals do not constitute persecution); and it was reasonable for him to relocate to the southern part of Nigeria to avoid future conflicts, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-21\">As Oduah did not establish a clear probability of persecution or a likelihood of torture upon his return to Nigeria, his claims for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture also failed. <em>See Francois v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 926, 932-33 (8th Cir.2002) (withholding standard is more onerous than asylum standard); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (burden is on applicant to show likelihood of torture upon removal to proposed country).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-22\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
