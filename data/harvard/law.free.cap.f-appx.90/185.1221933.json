Noble appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> judgment entered upon an adverse jury verdict in his employment-discrimination action. Noble has not provided a complete trial transcript, but he raises issues concerning his religious reservations about taking an oath before testifying, his belief that he did not have an opportunity to present rebuttal testimony because the trial was \u201crushed,\u201d and his view that a defense witness lied at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We have carefully reviewed the record before us, as well as the parties\u2019 submissions on appeal, and we conclude that Noble\u2019s contentions do not provide a basis for reversal. <em>See TRI, Inc. v. Boise Cascade Office Products, Inc., </em>315 F.3d 915, 920 (8th Cir.) (party must bring issue to district court\u2019s attention to preserve issue for appeal), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 2655, 156 L.Ed.2d 659 (2003); <em>Briley v. Carlin, </em>172 F.3d 567, 571 (8th Cir.1999) (declining to address arguments raised for first time on appeal); <em>Kramer v. Logan County School District No. R-1, </em>157 F.3d 620, 624-25 (8th Cir.1998) (appeals court does not lightly overturn jury verdict, and leaves credibility determinations to jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R, 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-11\">. The Honorable Robert W. Pratt, United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
