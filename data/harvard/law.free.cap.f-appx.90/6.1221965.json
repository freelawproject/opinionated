The circumstances of the case are limned in our opinion in <em>Bennett v. City of Holyoke, </em>362 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2004) [No. 03-1520], dated March 22, 2004, and need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-25\">In this appeal, plaintiff-appellant Gary A. Bennett challenges two mid-trial evi-dentiary rulings of the district court: (i) the exclusion of so-called comparator evidence anent Ralph DiNapoli and Joseph Garcia, and (ii) the admission of evidence regarding the criminality of Bennett\u2019s conduct in surreptitiously recording a conversation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-26\">It is black-letter law that a district court possesses broad discretion in connection with the admission or exclusion of evidence, and that its determinations in that wise are reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <em>Udemba v. Nicoli, </em>237 F.3d 8, 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>(1st Cir.2001); <em>Iacobucci v. Boulter, </em>193 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir.1999). We have carefully reviewed the rulings at issue here and we are satisfied that the trial court, in both instances, acted well within the en-cincture of its discretion. Given the fact-specific nature of both the case and the disputed rulings, further discussion would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, the judgments entered below in favor of Szost-kiewicz, Cournoyer, and Donoghue will be</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-18\">. Bennett elaborates on this assignment of error by attacking (i) the trial court\u2019s willingness to take judicial notice of the applicable criminal statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, \u00a7 99, and (ii) the jury instructions related to this evidence. We have considered and rejected both theories.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
