On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief in which he raises the validity of Harris\u2019s guilty plea and the length of Harris\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-23\">We find no merit in the issues raised in counsel\u2019s brief. Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the district court complied with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 in taking Harris\u2019s guilty plea, and that the sentence imposed is not subject to review, because it is within a properly determined sentencing guideline range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742; <em>United States v. Smotherman, </em>326 F.3d 988, 989 (8th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 293, 157 L.Ed.2d 203 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-26\">Following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfriv-olous issues. Accordingly, we affirm and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-21\">. The Honorable Linda R.
