R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Appellant Tracy Matthews challenges orders of the district court 1) granting summary judgment to defendants on all claims in his four consolidated cases; and 2) limiting discovery. Our jurisdiction over this appeal arises from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as did the district court in determining appellant\u2019s claims. <em>See Simms v. Okla. ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Mental Health &amp; Substance Abuse Servs., </em>165 F.3d 1321, 1326 (10th Cir.1999). Our review of the court\u2019s discovery rulings, however, is limited to determining whether the court abused its discretion. <em>See GWN Petroleum Corp. v. OK-Tex Oil &amp; Gas, Inc., </em>998 F.2d 853, 858 (10th Cir.1993). Because appellant proceeds pro se, we liberally construe his filings. <em>Cummings v. Evans, </em>161 F.3d 610, 613 (10th Cir.1998). However, we will not imply factual allegations or create legal theories on a pro se plaintiffs behalf. <em>Whitney v. New Mexico, </em>113 F.3d 1170, 1173-74 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">We have carefully reviewed the record in these consolidated cases, together with the parties\u2019 briefs, in light of these standards and applicable law. We note that appellant has raised arguments and theories which were not preserved for appeal, either because they were not raised to the district court or because they were not preserved by inclusion in appellant\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation on his claims, later adopted by the district court. Therefore, we decline to consider these arguments. <em>See Walker v. Mather (In re Walker), </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992); <em>Whitehead v. Okla. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>187 F.3d 1184, 1190 (10th Cir. 1999). In light of appellant\u2019s remaining arguments, we conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment to defendants in these consolidated cases and that the district court\u2019s discovery rulings were not an abuse of its discretion. For substantially the same reasons contained in the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough and careful recommendation, adopted by the district court, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Appellant\u2019s \u201cMotion to Amend\u201d his appeal to include certain discovery rulings is GRANTED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
