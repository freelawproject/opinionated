(\u201cSanderson Farms\u201d), dismissing his Texas state law racial discrimination claims. We affirm, albeit for different reasons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-18\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b755-19\">Manuel filed suit in the County Court of Law No. 2 of Brazos County, Texas against Sanderson Farms, alleging discriminatory discharge and hostile work environment claims under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (\u201cTCHRA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sanderson Farms had hired Manuel in April 2000 as one of three superintendents at its poultry processing plant in Bryan, Texas. Each superintendent was in charge of one of the plant\u2019s three shifts. Manuel, a black male, was hired as superintendent of the second shift. Brian Otto and Ed Cammack, both white males, were superintendents of the first and third shifts, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-20\">The second shift operated from 6:00-p.m. to 2:30 a.m., but Manuel would occasionally leave his shift early. On July 10, 2001, Manuel\u2019s supervisor, David Jarrett, instructed Manuel that, from that day on, he would be required to stay until the second shift had ended. (Although Jarrett did not give similar instructions to Otto and Cam-mack, neither does Manuel contest the record evidence that Otto and Cammack had no history of early departure.) The following week, Jarrett arrived at the plant around midnight and discovered that Manuel had left. Jarrett promptly recommended to Sanderson Farms\u2019 Division Manager, Eric Erickson, that Manuel\u2019s employment be terminated because of his poor performance and his failure to follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Jarrett\u2019s directive that he remain at work until the end of his shift. Erickson agreed with Jarrett\u2019s recommendation and, on July 19, 2001, informed Manuel that his employment at Sanderson Farms would be terminated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">On February 20, 2002, more than 200 days after being informed of his discharge, Manuel filed a charge of discrimination with the Texas Commission on Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) and with the EEOC. The Commission issued Manuel a right to sue letter on September 26, 2002.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Manuel filed suit in state court within 60 days after receiving the Commission\u2019s letter, as required by Texas Labor Code Annotated section 21.254.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> His complaint asserted only state law causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Sanderson Farms removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity, and, following an expedited discovery schedule, moved for summary judgment on Manuel\u2019s claims. The district court granted Sander-son Farms\u2019s motion in June 2003. In its stated reasons, the court said that it found Manuel\u2019s claims time-barred under federal law, and, alternatively, that he had failed to establish genuine issues of material fact with regards to the merits of both his hostile work environment and discriminatory discharge claims. Manuel timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>a grant of summary judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">B. Time Bar</p>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">The district court held Manuel\u2019s claims to be time-barred under 42 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 2000e-5(e), because Manuel did not file suit within 30 days following receipt of his right to sue letter from the Commission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 2000e-5(e) provides, in pertinent part, that an aggrieved party who has filed a charge of discrimination with a state or local agency, such as the Commission, has until the earlier of 300 days after the date of the alleged unlawful employment practice, or 30 days after the date on which he receives notice that the state agency has terminated its proceedings in which to file an EEOC charge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As Manuel correctly points out, the district court erred in applying section 2000e-5(e), both because that provision controls the time for filing an EEOC charge and not the time for filing suit, and because the TCHRA, rather than federal law, controls whether his claims were timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">Sanderson Farms concedes that the district court erred in applying \u00a7 2000e-5(e) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>but argues that Manuel\u2019s claims are time-barred nevertheless under the applicable limitations provision, section 21.202 of the TCHRA. That section requires a complainant to file a charge of discrimination with the Commission within 180 days following the date on which the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred, and directs the Commission to dismiss a late-filed complaint as untimely.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Texas Supreme Court has held that \u201c[tjhis time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Sanderson Farms argues that, because Manuel waited until February 20, 2002\u2014 well over 180 days after the date on which he was informed of his termination \u2014 to file his complaint with the Commission, his claims are time-barred under section 21.202.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Manuel responds, relying on a state intermediate appellate court case, <em>Gorges Foodservice, Inc. v. Huerta,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that his receipt of the Commission\u2019s right to sue letter creates a presumption that his com-</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">plaint was filed timely. His reliance is misplaced: <em>Gorges </em>held only that, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, a jury could infer from the plaintiffs receipt of the Commission\u2019s right to sue letter that his complaint was timely;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it did not hold that issuance of a right to sue letter creates a \u201cpresumption\u201d of timeliness. Additionally, at least one Texas appellate court that addressed this precise point held that issuance of a right to sue letter from the Commission cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction over a plaintiffs complaint when the plaintiff has failed to file his charge with the Commission within 180 days after the alleged adverse employment action, as required by section 21.202.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because it is undisputed that Manuel did not file his charge with the Commission until more than 180 days had elapsed following the alleged act of employment discrimination, his claims are time-barred under the TCHRA. As such, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his action.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Because we hold that Manuel\u2019s claims were time-barred, and affirm the dismissal of his action with prejudice on that ground, we do not reach the merits of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
