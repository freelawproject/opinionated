Counsel for Mr. Wilkins submitted a brief pursuant to <em>An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and moved for leave to withdraw as counsel. Mr. Wilkins responded with a one-page statement regarding \u201cappeal issues.\u201d We have jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and jurisdiction to review the sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We dismiss the appeal and grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Mr. Wilkins was indicted for (1) possession of a firearm after a former conviction of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9), and (2) possession of a firearm after a former conviction of a felony, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). I ApltApp., R. Doc. 1. He pleaded guilty to both counts, and neither he nor his counsel sought to withdraw the plea. At sentencing, the <em>first </em>count was dismissed upon the government\u2019s motion to dismiss due to a plain violation of double jeopardy. On the second count, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) included an offense level of 23 and a criminal history category of VI, resulting in a sentencing guideline range of 92-115 months. II Aplt.App. at 21. No objection was made to the presen-tence report. Mr. Wilkins was sentenced to 115 months imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. He also received a $2,500 fine and a special assessment of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">In his <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel for Mr. Wilkins states that he \u201chas diligently searched the record for any non-frivolous issues which are arguable on appeal,\u201d and having done so, finds there \u201care no appellate issues in this case.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 4. In response, Mr. Wilkins argues that the district court erred by including a prior \u201cvoidable sentence\u201d in calculating his criminal history category. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we must proceed, \u201cafter a full examination of all the proceedings, to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">Mr. Wilkins was reported as having 13 criminal history points in the PSR, which gave him a criminal history category of VI. II Aplt.App. at 16. One point was included under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c) because Mr. Wilkins pleaded guilty to an \u201cAssault and Battery \u2014 Domestic Abuse, After Former Conviction for Assault and Battery \u2014 Domestic Abuse\u201d in Osage County. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 1136. He received supervised probation for two years and his sentence was deferred until October 29, 2003. Another two points were included under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d) because the instant offense was committed while Mr. Wilkins was serving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\u201ca criminal justice sentence\u201d for the Osage County offense. <em>Id. </em>at 15, \u00b6 39. Mr. Wilkins did not object to the inclusion of these points at the time of sentencing. However, he now argues, citing <em>Stewart v. State, </em>989 P.2d 940, 944 (Okla.Crim.App.1999), that the sentence was \u201cvoidable\u201d because he was not eligible for a deferred sentence under OHa. Stat. tit. 22, \u00a7 991c, as he was \u201cpreviously convicted of a felony offense.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 991c(F). Mr. Wilkins therefore argues the district court erred in including the offense in the calculation of his criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Because Mr. Wilkins \u201cfailed to object to the calculation of his criminal history category below, this court reviews the district court\u2019s sentencing determination for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendez-Lopez, </em>338 F.3d 1153, 1159 (10th Cir.2003). Under the plain error standard, we review the district court\u2019s sentencing \u201cfor particularly egregious or obvious and substantial legal error, which our failure to consider would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Lowder, </em>5 F.3d 467, 472 (10th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Even if Mr. Wilkins establishes an error that affects his substantive rights, reversal is nevertheless inappropriate unless the error was also \u201cclear or obvious.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitney, </em>229 F.3d 1296, 1308 (10th Cir.2000). Thus, even assuming the prior sentence was voidable, as Mr. Wilkins argues, this error was not clear or obvious to the district court upon sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In addition, a defendant may not collaterally attack a prior state court conviction under the guidelines unless \u201cotherwise recognized in law.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment n. 6. This court has allowed a collateral attack on a prior conviction only in cases of a \u201ccomplete violation of the right to counsel,\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>42 F.3d 573, 581 (10th Cir.1994), and in this case it is clear Mr. Wilkins was represented by counsel in the prior state court conviction. II Aplt.App. at 14, \u00b6 36. After a full examination of the proceedings, we conclude Mr. Wilkins\u2019s appeal is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b413-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
