We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">Beck filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against prison officials, claiming they violated his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. We affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for defendants on all but one claim, i.e., that officials conditioned needed surgery on his execution of a release of liability. As to that claim, we remanded for further development of the record. <em>See Beck v. Skon, </em>253 F.3d 330, 334 (8th Cir. 2001). On remand, Beck filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and TRO, and for \u201ca three-judge court,\u201d requesting the district court to stop defendants from harassing him, denying him proper placements, denying him proper medical treatment, denying him necessary legal documents, and placing him at further risk of assault. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">We have jurisdiction to review the denial of injunctive relief, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), and \u201cwe will reverse only for dearly erroneous factual determinations, an error of law, or abuse of discretion,\u201d see <em>Manion v. Nagin, </em>255 F.3d 535, 538 (8th Cir.2001). There is no basis for reversal here. <em>See Davis v. Francis Howell Sch. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>Dist., </em>104 F.3d 204, 205 (8th Cir.1997) (factors to determine whether injunctive relief is warranted). To the extent Beck asserted in his motion that he is being denied the opportunity to litigate the claim at issue on remand, there are avenues by which he can seek specific documents and depositions necessary to litigate the relevant claim. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a), 56(f). Beck\u2019s remaining bases for injunctive relief are not within the scope of the remand order. <em>Cf. Children\u2019s Broadcasting Corp. v. Walt Disney Co., </em>357 F.3d 860, 2004 WL 111806, at <em>*8 </em>(8th Cir. Jan.26, 2004) (liability question was beyond scope of limited remand for new trial on damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-24\">. The Honorable Richard H. Kyle, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Franklin L. Noel, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
