Casey, <em>Judge) </em>directing him, as part of his sentence, to pay restitution in the amount of $300,000.00 to the victim of his fraud. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-22\">Cohen\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the district court erred in failing to discuss on the record the mandatory factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2). That argument, however, is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Walker, </em>353 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201c[W]e will not vacate and remand ... solely by reason of the sentencing judge\u2019s failure to indicate consideration of the mandatory factors.\u201d). We have carefully considered all of Cohen\u2019s other arguments and find them, too, to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
