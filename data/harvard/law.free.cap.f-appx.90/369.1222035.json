R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(g). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b410-11\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b410-12\">TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">This appeal raises but one issue, namely, the scope of the the United States Sen-fencing Guidelines (USSG) \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(8)(B)(ii) sentence enhancement for using a computer to solicit sexually explicit conduct from a minor. Holding that it is irrelevant under the Sentencing Guidelines whether a defendant would have exploited his victims even without the use of a computer, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to enhance the sentence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-18\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-19\">Pursuant to a validly executed search warrant, Air Force officials in April 2002 seized defendant Paul Williams\u2019s computer and related items located in his dormitory room at Osan Air Base in South Korea. The data on this computer contained over 900 pages of instant message communications between Williams and his wife Dee Dee. During these chats, Paul Williams repeatedly asked Dee Dee Williams to take pictures of his nine-year-old stepdaughter\u2019s genitalia and send him the images over the internet. Williams once communicated online directly with the victim, asked her to pick out a sex toy from Dee Dee Williams\u2019s collection, take pictures of herself using it, and send the images to him over the internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-20\">During an interview after their arrest, Dee Dee Williams admitted that Paul Williams would use the internet to send her from Korea sexually explicit images of her children taken before he left the country. After pleading guilty to six counts in the indictment, Paul Williams underwent a psycho-sexual assessment, during which he admitted that he allowed the victim to see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>pornographic images on the internet and in his own collection when they resided together. These, he said, would answer the girl\u2019s questions about how to use his wife\u2019s sex toys.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Williams objected to the application of USSG \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3)(B)(ii) to enhance his sentence level. The district court found that the section applied to each of the six counts of sexual exploitation of children, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251, to which Williams pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings and give due deference to the court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts. <em>See United, States v. Hargus, </em>128 F.3d 1358, 1364 (10th Cir. 1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1079, 118 S.Ct. 1526, 140 L.Ed.2d 677 (1998). However, we review de novo the threshold legal question of how to interpret the language of \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Section 2G2.1(b)(3) instructs sentencing courts to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence if his offense involved \u201cthe use of a computer or an Internet access device to ... solicit participation with a minor in sexually explicit conduct.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3)(B)(ii). In <em>United States v. Reaves, </em>we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al4\">Congress\u2019s concerns [in instructing the United States Sentencing Commission to mandate sentence enhancements for the use of computers to commit child-pornography related offenses] were not limited to a pedophile\u2019s ability to use a computer to directly contact increased numbers of children via the internet. Instead, Congress emphasized a broader concern with the ability to exploit a child\u2019s general fascination with computer technology. Thus, it appears Congress was not merely interested in punishing specific ways of using a computer to lure young victims. Rather, Congress wanted to punish more generally the fact that the perpetrator used a computer at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">253 F.3d 1201, 1205 (10th Cir.2001). The defendant in <em>Reaves </em>never used the internet to directly ask his victims to participate in child pornography; rather, he would send them pornographic images which would then inspire them to engage in sexually explicit conduct. We held that \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3) nonetheless did apply, for the verb \u201csolicit\u201d was broad enough to include luring a victim into engaging in sexually explicit conduct without directly asking him to participate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">We hold that \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3) applies in this case as well. Williams argues that \u201cnone of the charges in the present case arose from or as a consequence of [an internet exchange]. Rather, the present case arose because of Mr. Williams\u2019s direct personal solicitation of the children in the home as a step-parent.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 14. This argument reads a limitation into \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3) \u2014 namely, that it only applies to a defendant who exploits children <em>solely </em>through the use of computers \u2014 that the language does not support. On the contrary, the only facts that must exist in order for the enhancement to apply are 1) that the defendant have solicited a minor 2) in sexually explicit conduct 3) through the use of a computer or internet-access device. It is undisputed that all these facts exist in this case. Indeed, unlike the court in <em>Reaves, </em>which resolved an ambiguity as to the meaning of the verb \u201cto solicit,\u201d we cannot see how the language of the Sentencing Guidelines could fail to be interpreted so as to apply to Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">The logic behind Williams\u2019s argument is that enhancing his sentence will not accomplish the purpose of Congress and the Sentencing Commission, which is to protect children from computer-related exploi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>tation, for, as a step-father, he would have exploited the victim even if he did not have internet access. Even if we were, however, to look past the statute\u2019s plain meaning, we would still find that enhancing Williams\u2019s sentence does indeed protect children from computer-related exploitation. Assuming Williams would have exploited his victim without the use of a computer, the use of a computer made the exploitation easier and more frequent, by enabling him to exploit his victim from halfway around the world. Thus, by applying \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3) to cases such as Williams\u2019s, we achieve Congress\u2019s objective of protecting children from exploitation through the use of computers.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The ruling of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b410-21\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
