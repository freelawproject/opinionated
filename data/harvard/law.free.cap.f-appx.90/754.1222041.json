Such was the case for the trial judge in this appeal. We conclude that the learned court below erred when it granted the motion and we thus reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-22\">Appellant Arleen Maddux\u2019s claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is premised on an alleged violation of her Fourth Amendment rights. She alleges that City of Pasadena (\u201cCity\u201d) police officers entered her home intent upon executing a felony arrest warrant, the subject of which was reasonably believed to be in her residence or that of a nearby neighbor, in the absence of consent, exigent circumstances, or a search warrant. She contends that the officers\u2019 entry contravened the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Steagald v. United States</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that absent consent, exigent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>circumstances, or a search warrant, law enforcement officers may not, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, enter a third-party residence to apprehend the subject of an arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">I. Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"ANH\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Maddux, and other Plaintiffs not joining in this appeal, brought suit against the City and eight of its police officers, alleging various federal- and state-law causes of action arising out of City officers\u2019 execution of a valid felony arrest warrant on June 3, 1998. A confidential informant had advised officers that the subject of an outstanding felony arrest warrant could be found at his residence, 2635 Goldenrod in Pasadena. Arleen Maddux and her husband, James Mad-dux, lived in a neighboring house at 2631 Goldenrod. Acting on the information furnished by the confidential informant, an officer surveilled 2635 Goldenrod, as well as surrounding houses on the block, including the Maddux residence, before deciding to execute the felony arrest warrant. At the time the officers converged on the 2600 block of Goldenrod to apprehend the subject of the felony arrest warrant, Maddux, her husband, and their son, who also resided with them, were hosting a backyard barbecue with several friends in attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The parties have throughout offered fundamentally different accounts of the ensuing events. According to Maddux, as she stood in the laundry room of her residence, she was suddenly confronted by an unknown individual who entered without consent, pointed a gun at her, and demanded to know who was inside her house. Maddux claims that the individual failed to identify himself as a police officer and that she assumed that he was an armed intruder. She believed that her safety, and that of the other individuals in the house, was in jeopardy. Maddux was unable to answer the individual\u2019s question and continued to stand in her laundry room, describing her demeanor as \u201ctotally shocked,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>\u201cthinking \u2018I\u2019m never going to make it.\u2019\u201d She alleges that the individual pushed her aside and encountered a guest whom he led at gunpoint to the backyard of the Maddux residence where others were also being detained by other officers. Maddux maintains that certain individuals overheard a police radio transmission advising officers that the subject of the felony arrest warrant was in fact at the \u201ccorner\u201d house, 2635 Goldenrod.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">It was Plaintiffs\u2019, and is now Maddux\u2019s, theory that City officers thought, based on the surveillance that afternoon, that the suspect would be found at either 2635 or 2631 Goldenrod. Acting on that information, Maddux alleges that the officers intended to, and in fact did, enter both residences without a search warrant. Officers testifying at trial admitted that exigent circumstances were lacking. Maddux contends that City officers entered her residence without consent because they believed, in accordance with their knowledge and familiarity with the Pasadena Police Department\u2019s Rules and Procedures Manual, that they were authorized to do so inasmuch as available information placed the subject at one of the two residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">In contrast, the City contends that when officers arrived at the neighborhood, they observed several individuals in the backyard of the Maddux residence, and that a radio transmission advised that the subject of the felony arrest warrant might be among the individuals mingling in that group. The City alleges that, before officers located the subject of the felony arrest warrant, the City alleges that two officers proceeded to the backyard of the Maddux residence to secure the surrounding area in consideration of the safety of the neighbors and the officers involved. Officers reportedly instructed those present to move either inside the house or to the front of the house out of harm\u2019s way. Other officers then requested and obtained consent to enter 2635 Goldenrod, where they located the subject and took him into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">B. Pre-Trial Disposition and Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">The City moved for summary judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 claim brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983. Plaintiffs argued that the City Police Department\u2019s written policy, found in its Rules and Procedures Manual, authorized officers to execute felony arrest warrants on a private residence, where the subject in fact does not reside but is nevertheless believed to be, in violation of <em>Steagald.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The City defended the constitutionality of its written policy and attested to its \u201clong-standing custom and practice\u201d of training and requiring officers to obtain consent before entering any residence for purposes of executing a felony arrest warrant. The district court denied summary judgment, citing the factual issues created by \u201cthe parties\u2019 radically conflicting accounts of the actual events occurring on June 3, 1998 at the Maddux residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">The case proceeded to a jury trial, and at the close of Plaintiffs\u2019 case, the City orally moved for judgment as a matter of law, on the grounds that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the City espoused an official policy or custom allowing officers to execute arrest warrants in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States. The City asserted, to the contrary, that its practice and custom was to abide by the Constitution and laws of the United States, as evinced both in its written policy and in its practice of securing consent before executing a felony arrest warrant at a third-party residence. According to the City, even taking as true Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>that one or more officers entered the Mad-dux residence in the absence of one of the <em>Steagald </em>exceptions (consent, exigent circumstances, or a search warrant), such conduct was in contravention of the City\u2019s official policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The City cited as an additional justification for granting judgment in its favor Plaintiffs\u2019 inability to identify the officer alleged to have entered the Maddux residence. The district court did not reach this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Plaintiffs countered that, in the twenty years since <em>Steagald, </em>the section of the Rules and Procedures Manual pertaining to the execution of arrest warrants had not been modified to instruct law enforcement officers of the steps that are constitutionally required to search a third party\u2019s residence for the subject of an arrest warrant. Plaintiffs repeatedly characterized the City\u2019s written policy as affirmatively unconstitutional in attempting to persuade the district court that the instructions with regard to execution of arrest warrants in the Rules and Procedures Manual were the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the officers\u2019 violation of their Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">C. The District Court\u2019s Grant of Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">In publishing its ruling from the bench, the district court made two findings, either of which would have been decisive of the Rule 50 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">First, even accepting as true Plaintiffs\u2019 version of the events, <em>i.e., </em>that the officers actually entered the Maddux residence, the district court was persuaded that the officers had not acted intentionally. Rather, they had accidentally entered the Mad-dux residence in the mistaken belief that the subject of the arrest warrant would be found at 2631 Goldenrod. The officers\u2019 negligent violation of Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights would not, according to the district court, be cognizable in a \u00a7 1983 claim. The district court raised this issue <em>sua sponte; </em>the City did not argue the absence of a constitutional deprivation as a basis for its Rule 50 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Under the twin assumptions that the officers had (1) intentionally (2) entered the Maddux residence, the district court then addressed the City\u2019s contention that Plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the City, by means of an official policy, was responsible for the alleged deprivation of Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. In doing so, the district court shifted its focus to the quantum of evidence adduced to show that an official policy or custom was the impetus for the deprivation of Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutionally-protected rights. The issue then before the district court was whether the officers, in entering the Mad-dux residence in the absence of the <em>Steag-ald </em>exceptions, acted in accordance with a policy officially adopted and promulgated by the City with deliberate indifference to the known and obvious consequence that the policy could subvert Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">With regard to evidence presented, the district court found that the City\u2019s official policy was to train and require its officers to obtain consent before entering a residence of a third party to execute a felony arrest warrant. In the judgment of the district court, if consent was required as a matter of course in every instance in which an arrest warrant was to be executed, as the City maintained that it was, then the City\u2019s custom and practice could not be interpreted as running afoul of the Fourth Amendment. The City, according to the district court, relied upon \u201cone of three methods that the officers could employ and still be in compliance with the constitutional requirements of ... executing an arrest warrant at the home of a third party, which is consent, exigent circumstances, or a search warrant.\u201d The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>commended this custom the City had in place as having been \u201cdesigned to assure that constitutional violations would not result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The district court reasoned that with this policy in place Plaintiffs were unable to show that the City acted intentionally to deprive them of their right under the Fourth Amendment to be free from an unreasonable search of their home. In the perceived absence of any evidence of a policy statement, custom, or practice enacted by the City in deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of its citizens, the district court determined that the issue of municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 could not proceed to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"At4\">The record indicates that the assistant chief of police, and those officers who had been called by the Plaintiffs as adverse witnesses, were avowedly unaware that a United States Supreme Court opinion had distinguished the privacy interests with which law enforcement officers had to contend in executing arrest warrants. But the district court found that the City\u2019s dereliction in altering its Rules and Procedures Manual, so as to reflect the distinctions made in <em>Steagald, </em>fell short of the necessary showing of deliberate indifference. She noted, \u201cthe fact that they were negligent in not understanding or training or explaining to their officers that an additional method of assuring that constitutional violations would not result in the securing of a search warrant, does not result in municipal liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Thus, the district court held that if the officers in fact acted in violation of the City\u2019s policy, the negligence of those officers could not be attributed to the City under a theory of <em>respondeat superior. </em>The United States Supreme Court indeed has consistently rejected arguments for imposing vicarious liability on municipalities for the actions of their employees under \u00a7 1983 since its decision in <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">Although Plaintiffs argued that the written policy regarding the planned execution of arrest warrants in the Rules and Procedures Manual was affirmatively unconstitutional, the district court insisted that the City trained officers to get consent first. In fact, the district court\u2019s scrutiny of the language in the Rules and Procedures Manual was confined to its assessment that the written policy did not, by omission or otherwise, convey that a search warrant was not required to enter a third-party residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">In conclusion, the district court noted the absence of any \u201clegally sufficient evi-dentiary basis for a jury to find for any of the plaintiffs with respect to the allegations in the lawsuit.\u201d The district court then proceeded to grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law in favor of the City as to all Plaintiffs, and to dismiss the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">II. Standard of Review of Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">On appeal, Maddux broadly phrases the issue as whether the City is liable for the conduct of its officers in entering the Mad-dux residence in the absence of the <em>Steag-ald </em>exceptions, in light of the Pasadena Police Department\u2019s Rules and Procedures Manual\u2019s seeming endorsement of such unconstitutional measures. Specifically, Maddux takes issue with the district court\u2019s two dispositive findings: (1) that the officers did not act intentionally, if at all, and (2) that the City\u2019s official policy was to require and train its officers to get consent before entering all private premises to execute felony arrest warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a)(1) permits a district court during a jury trial to enter judgment as a matter of law against a party with respect to a claim or a defense, but only if that party \u201chas been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>a district-court ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, like the district court, we must review the record as a whole, taking care to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party and to abstain from making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence presented to us. Likewise, as to evidence supporting the moving party, we must credit only that which is uncontradicted, unimpeached, and unattributable to interested witnesses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only in the rare instance in which the facts and inferences favor one party so profoundly that reasonable minds could not disagree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When confronted with \u201cevidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded [people] in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions\u201d a district court should deny the motion for judgment and submit the case to a jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court should be mindful, that \u201cit is the function of the jury as the traditional finder of the facts, and not the Court, to weigh conflicting evidence and inferences, and determine the credibility of witnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">III. Section 1983 and Municipal Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">Without conferring any substantive rights, \u00a7 1983 instead creates a cause of action against any person who, acting under color of state law, deprives another of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court designated municipalities as persons to whom \u00a7 1983 applies and articulated the standard for imposition of municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 twenty-five years ago in <em>Monell.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To establish municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 for the actions of a governing body's officials, the aggrieved individual must prove that an official policy is responsible for the claimed deprivation of the federally-protected right that is at issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-15\">Although official policy is generally to be found in policy statements, ordinances, regulations, or decisions formally adopted and promulgated by the governing body or individuals with policymaking authority, a policy may also be evinced in \u201ca persis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number><em>tent, </em>widespread practice of city officials or employees ... so common and well settled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If the official municipal policy is embodied in a custom, the governing body or policymak-ing individuals must have either actual or constructive knowledge that such custom prevails.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Actions not attributable to execution of an official policy, in whatever form, will not subject the municipality to liability under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In prosecuting her claim against the City under \u00a7 1983, Maddux, in addition to establishing the predicate violation of the underlying constitutional right,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was required to: identify a municipal policymaker with actual or constructive knowledge of the policy that was alleged to have caused her injuries; isolate and present evidence of the official policy of which she was complaining; and show that her alleged injuries were incurred as a result of the law enforcement officers\u2019 execution of that official policy, otherwise referred to as the \u201cmoving-force\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, our decisions insist upon adequate evidence of \u201cboth municipal culpability and causation,\u201d in order to prevent imposition of liability founded on a theory of <em>respondeat superi- or.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">As long as causation is established, an official policy that is facially unconstitutional evinces municipal culpability without more, terminating the inquiry. In contrast, a facially innocuous policy will support municipal culpability only if it was promulgated with objective deliberate indifference to the \u201c \u2018known or obvious consequences\u2019 that constitutional violations would result.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, this Court has previously concluded that as to each policy to which a plaintiff is pointing in support of her claim for municipal liability under \u00a7 1983, \u201cit must be determined whether each one is facially constitutional or unconstitutional.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">IV. Constitutional Deprivation: Negligent Conduct vs. Intentional Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">A. Finding of Negligent Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"acn-dedup-0\">Maddux urges that the district court erred when, without reaching the issue of municipal liability, it found that Plaintiffs had failed \u201cto establish that the defendants acted intentionally with respect to the constitutional rights that they [Plaintiffs] allege have been violated.\u201d Maddux contends that the district court impermissibly weighed the evidence and determined the credibility of testifying witnesses at trial when it concluded that the officers, if they did in fact enter the Maddux residence, did so by accident, in the mistaken belief that they were supposed to be in that house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>and not the one next door. The district court characterized such a scenario as \u201cnegligence which is not cognizable as a claim in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Maddux suggests why the officers reasonably believed that the subject of the arrest warrant might be found at the Mad-dux residence and, thus, why at least one officer intentionally entered the Maddox house looking for the subject of the felony arrest warrant. Maddux\u2019s sons, Gary Maddux and Bryan Maddux,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> both testified that they heard police radio transmissions advising officers that they were at the \u201cwrong house.\u201d Maddux argues that this testimony, coupled with that of one officer who understood that the subject of the arrest warrant could be found at either of the two houses on Goldenrod, or that of another officer who thought the subject was going to be found in the Maddux residence, supports the equally logical inference that the officers intended to enter both residences in an attempt to locate the subject, and that any reference to the \u201cwrong house\u201d could simply have meant that the subject had been located at the <em>other </em>of the two residences. Maddux thus insists that the officers had formed a belief that the subject was in one of the two residences, and that the ensuing radio transmissions informing the officers that they were in the \u201cwrong house\u201d served only to advise that the subject was in fact at 2635 Goldenrod and not the Maddux house.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The district court deduced otherwise, concluding that the evidence <em>only </em>supported the finding that the officers were merely confused about where they were supposed to be. The transcript of the trial contains the district court\u2019s observations pursuant to its ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-9\">Even ignoring all of what the defendant officers have to say about the facts as they occurred on that day and taken [sic] as true the statements that were made by the plaintiffs with respect to the actions of the officers, two of the plaintiffs testified that while the officer was in the home and one while he was outside of the home, that they heard evidence that the officers had not intentionally but accidentally gone to the wrong house, which the Court finds makes it difficult if not impossible, for the plaintiffs to establish that the acts of the officers were committed intentionally-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">B. The Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">Plaintiffs called nine witnesses over the two-day duration of their case, including several plaintiffs, officers and others assembled at the time of the incident, and Assistant Police Chief Cunningham. A summary of these witnesses\u2019 testimony, with regard to the issue of whether a predicate constitutional deprivation was credibly presented, follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">Two witnesses are of no assistance in this endeavor.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> But, assessments of the credibility of the seven remaining witnesses, each of whom offered testimony relevant to this issue, would have enabled the jury to assess the credibility of the various conflicting statements and to determine whether the officers, if they did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>enter the Maddux residence, did so intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Bryan Maddux, who arrived as officers were attempting to locate the subject of the felony arrest warrant, observed officers in the area surrounding his parents\u2019 house, though not inside the residence. Bryan Maddux testified that he overheard a radio transmission telling officers that they were at the \u201cwrong address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Dale Oldfield was among the three individuals \u2014 Arleen Maddux and Gary Maddux included- \u2014 who claimed that while inside the Maddux residence, he had encountered an unknown individual clad in black and displaying a gun.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Oldfield testified that the unknown individual asked him who he was and whether he knew another named individual, presumably the subject of the arrest warrant. After Oldfield exited the house and walked into the backyard as he had been instructed to do, he overheard a garbled radio transmission from which he was unable to distinguish any coherent communication. But he did note that following the transmission, several of the officers within his view retreated from the vicinity of the Maddux residence and converged on the residence at 2635 Goldenrod.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Maddux\u2019s other son, Gary, was living with his parents at the time and was home that afternoon. He testified that the unknown individual whom he encountered inside the Maddux residence said nothing to him other than ordering him to go outside to the backyard. Gary Maddux complied and, according to him, overheard a radio transmission informing officers that they were at the \u201cwrong house.\u201d At that point, Gary Maddux walked back inside his parents\u2019 house without opposition from any officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Lieutenant Michael Jackson, the senior officer at the scene, offered testimony rife with contradictions. He testified that it was his understanding that although a confidential informant had identified 2635 Goldenrod as the residence where the subject of the arrest warrant could be located, the officer who conducted the preliminary surveillance of the neighborhood had observed unknown individuals traveling back and forth between 2635 Goldenrod and the Maddux residence at 2631 Goldenrod. Lieutenant Jackson was among several officers advised by radio transmission that \u201cthere was foot traffic between the two residences at the time we were in the area.\u201d He testified that the information he had received indicated to him that the subject could be \u201cgoing back and forth between the backyards of the two [residences] and inside the corner house [2635 Goldenrod].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">Lieutenant Jackson added later that, upon arrival, he and Officer Tracy Marshall proceeded to the Maddux backyard, but that their focus was the residence next door where the subject was believed to be. On cross-examination, Lieutenant Jackson testified that it was not the intent of the officers executing the arrest warrant to enter the Maddux residence. But in a followup question referring Lieutenant Jackson to his earlier averments in a sworn statement, Lieutenant Jackson acknowledged that, at the time, there was some reason to believe that the subject might be inside the Maddux residence, because an attempt might have been made to elude police and traffic between the two residences had been reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">Officer Candelari drove the confidential informant to the 2600 block of Goldenrod where the informant identified the house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>at 2685 Goldenrod as the residence where the subject of the arrest warrant could be located. Officer Candelari dropped off the informant and returned to the area near the 2600 block of Goldenrod to conduct surveillance of 2685 Goldenrod from a comfortable distance with the use of binoculars. Significantly, he did not know exactly what the subject of the warrant looked like; only a bare description of height, weight, and perhaps hair color had been provided to him. Officer Candelari testified that during his surveillance, he noted several individuals who \u201ccould have possibly matched that description.\u201d In his radio transmission, he indicated that he saw \u201ctraffic\u201d going between 2635 Goldenrod and 2631 Goldenrod; he did not say that he had actually seen the subject or that the subject would only be found at 2635 Goldenrod, the residence identified by the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">In an effort to clarify his earlier statement, Officer Candelari then testified that, despite using the word \u201ctraffic\u201d in his radio transmission, he had only seen several individuals in an area between the two houses, not necessarily traveling back and forth from one to the other. He testified that he was not certain what they were doing \u2014 only that they were leaving that area between the two houses, and \u201cdisappearing between the two residences.\u201d What is significant is that these officers only heard what had been related in the radio transmissions without the benefit of Officer Candelari\u2019s clarification of what he actually saw. When the other officers converged on the scene to execute the felony arrest warrant, Officer Candelari proceeded with them to 2635 Goldenrod, where consent was given to enter and where the subject was eventually located. He recalled seeing still other officers in the front yard of the Maddux residence as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Officer Marshall testified that the information he received in advance of the operation undertaken to execute the felony arrest warrant indicated that the subject could be located at one of two houses, either 2635 or 2631 Goldenrod. He understood that individuals had been seen going back and forth between the two houses, such that officers were uncertain in which house the subject would ultimately be found. Officer Marshall and other officers received this information along with other officers at what appears to have been an informal briefing immediately preceding their arrival at the scene. Once there, Officer Marshall proceeded to the Maddux backyard in order to secure the safety of the people there and to assist in arresting the subject if he was located in that vicinity. Officer Marshall agreed with Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel during his direct examination that as far as Officer Marshall was aware, the subject could have been at the Maddux residence \u201cjust as easily as he could have been at the corner residence [2635 Goldenrod].\u201d At some point during the time he was engaged in the backyard of the Mad-dux residence, Officer Marshall received a radio transmission informing him that the subject had been found next door at 2635 Goldenrod. This is consistent with the Plaintiffs\u2019 explanation that the \u201cwrong house\u201d message meant that the subject of the arrest warrant had been located in the house next door to the Maddux home.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Finally, Officer Isaac Villareal testified that before arriving at the 2600 block of Goldenrod, he had understood that the subject would be located at the Maddux residence and not the neighboring residence at 2635 Goldenrod. He proceeded to the Maddux residence in the hope of arresting the subject. Officer Villareal said that he remained outside the Maddux residence, questioning individuals in the driveway of the home, until he received a radio transmission alerting him that the subject was at the other residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>C. A Question for the Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Officer Villareal is apparently the only witness to have stated unequivocally that he was operating under the assumption that the subject would be found at the Maddux residence, rather than the house next door or either of the houses as related by Officer Candelari, who conducted the surveillance. Officer Villareal\u2019s testimony was not developed to an extent that either the district court or the jury could have determined with any certainty whether he had actually been told that the subject was supposedly going to be, or could be, found in the Maddux residence, <em>ie., </em>whether he believed that information had been obtained that the subject was believed to be at a third-party residence at 2631 Goldenrod, or whether he was merely confused about the information that had been relayed during the briefing for officers participating in executing the felony arrest warrant. Assuming that one or more officers did enter the Maddux residence, a patent variance in the testimony as to whether they did so intentionally was evident even before Officer Villareal testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Bryan and Gary Maddux both reported hearing the same radio transmission using the words, \u201cwrong house.\u201d Neither of them overhead anything more substantive that might have clarified what exactly was meant by the transmission. The district court concluded, based on the testimony of these two individuals alone, that only one meaning could have been assigned: that the officers who purportedly entered the Maddux residence did not do so on purpose, but in the mistaken belief that the subject was supposed to be in the house where the Maddux family resided and not in the one next door at 2635 Goldenrod. Implicit in the ruling was the district court\u2019s belief that the officers involved never anticipated that the subject might be located at either house, but instead had identified <em>one </em>house as <em>the </em>location where the subject was reasonably expected to be; and that certain officers might have thought that the Maddux residence was the correct location and accidentally gone there.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">But the equally reasonable inference\u2014 and certainly the one more favorable to Plaintiffs as non-movants \u2014 was that advanced by Maddux during the Rule 50 arguments at the close of her case and in the brief she submitted to this Court. According to this theory, which is amply supported in the testimonial evidence, officers descended on the 2600 block of Goldenrod with information that the subject could possibly be found at either of the two residences. Maddux thus argues that they intended to go into both houses essentially simultaneously to apprehend the subject of the felony arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">Officer Candelari admitted that he had warned in a radio transmission relayed to other officers assembling to execute the arrest warrant that he had seen \u201ctraffic\u201d between the two houses. That he in fact did not see actual travel in and out of the two residences is irrelevant because the officers relying on his surveillance were never fully apprised of exactly what he had or had not seen. With the exception of Officer Villareal, all of the officers who testified, including Lieutenant Jackson in his supervisory capacity, acknowledged that it was their understanding from the outset that, based on the surveillance that had been conducted, the subject could plausibly have been found in either house. Officer Marshall in particular conceded that the subject could have been found in the Maddux residence as easily as in the residence at 2635 Goldenrod.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Review of the record under the prescribed standard of review demonstrates that the district court ruled in favor of the City based in part on its erroneous conclusion that Plaintiffs had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>presented no legally sufficient evidentia-ry basis from which a reasonable jury could have found that the predicate constitutional violation had been proven. In this regard, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, and without judging the credibility of witnesses or weighing their testimony, a fact issue for jury consideration was presented.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">A reasonable jury might have found evidence of a constitutional deprivation \u2014 that the testimonial evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom did not favor the City so profoundly that reasonable minds could not disagree. The meaning of the radio transmission overheard by Bryan and Gary Maddux is equivocal,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> but more compelling are the portions of the officers\u2019 testimony categorically endorsing Plaintiffs\u2019 \u2014 and now Maddux\u2019s \u2014 argument that both residences were targeted as private premises in which officers could reasonably expect to find the subject of the felony arrest warrant. The district court thus erred in determining as a matter of law that, even accepting as true Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that officers entered the Maddux residence on June 3, 1998, in doing so, they were at most negligent in transgressing Plaintiffs\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The evidence adduced as to whether Maddux\u2019s constitutional rights were intentionally violated created an issue of fact within the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">V. Official Policy: Written Policy vs. Unwritten Practice</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">A. Finding by District Court of a Constitutional Policy and Practice</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Even positing an intentional violation of Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights, the district court concluded that judgment as a matter of law was nevertheless proper because Plaintiffs had not shown that either the City or its policymakers had promulgated or adopted an official policy with deliberate indifference to the known or obvious consequences that constitutional violations would result. In order to reach that conclusion and grant judgment in favor of the City, the district court determined the City\u2019s official policy to be one that requires consent to enter as prerequisite to execution of arrest warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">The district court found that the City had promulgated a policy designed to avoid constitutional deprivations on the order alleged by Plaintiffs. Even if officers had in fact entered the Maddux residence as part of their efforts to apprehend the subject of the felony arrest warrant, such entry without the validation of any of the three <em>Steagald </em>exceptions would only have signified the officers\u2019 direct violation of the City\u2019s policy. The officers, not the City, would then be the moving force behind any injuries sustained by Plaintiffs. Neither Plaintiffs at trial nor Maddux in her appeal has disputed that the City\u2019s liability for the claimed constitutional violation cannot be derived from a theory of <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Instead, Maddux argues that for twenty years the City has ignored the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Steag-ald </em>and affirmatively \u201cenacted and implemented a policy in complete derogation of this decision and the Fourth Amendment.\u201d According to Maddux, the district court erred in simply \u201cabsolving] the City of an arrest warrant policy that was in clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>violation of the Fourth Amendment as interpreted in <em>Steagald. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The question for this Court is whether the City of Pasadena Police Department\u2019s written policy respecting the planned execution of arrest warrants constitutes a legally sufficient evidentiary basis upon which a reasonable jury could have premised the City\u2019s liability under \u00a7 1983 for a violation of Maddux\u2019s Fourth Amendment interest in being free from an unreasonable search of her home by City officers. More precisely, did the district court dismiss the jury after making a factual finding that the City\u2019s unwritten policy trumps its written policy and requires its officers to obtain permission from a person in authority before executing a felony arrest warrant at a private residence? Analysis of this issue is tangled for reasons evident from our review of the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">To begin with, it cannot be argued that the district court decided what the City\u2019s policy for executing arrest warrants entailed. Neither the colloquy between the bench and counsel during arguments on the Rule 50 motion nor the district court\u2019s recitation of its findings helps us to understand whether or to what degree the court considered the significance of the City\u2019s written policy published in the Rules and Procedures Manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The City insisted that both its written policy and its practice of obtaining consent assured its compliance with the Constitution and laws of the United States. In other words, either source of policy was independently capable of surviving scrutiny for purposes of ferreting out potential municipal liability. The district court heard this argument without expressing an opinion as to whether it also thought these two sources of official policy adhered in equal measure to the Fourth Amendment. The court did state, however, that \u201c[i]f they\u2019ve got a policy that says you\u2019ve got to get consent, then they don\u2019t have a policy promulgated with known or obvious consequences that a constitutional violation would result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Thus, the district court repeatedly characterized the official policy as one of getting consent, without reconciling the wording in the Rules and Procedures Manual with an unwritten policy requiring that consent be obtained; without acknowledging a possible infirmity in the wording that was overcome by an unwritten practice; and without stating that the wording, infirm or not, was irrelevant by virtue of that unwritten practice.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">B. The Written Policy and Creation of a Fact Issue for the Jury</p>\n<p id=\"Acz\">Whatever the relationship between the written policy and the unwritten practice, we conclude that it was error for the district court to find that the evidence adduced at trial led inexorably to the conclusion that the City\u2019s policy was to train and require its officers to get consent as a precondition to entering a private residence in the course of executing an arrest warrant. That, at the close of Plaintiffs\u2019 case, the City\u2019s official policy was benign in all relevant respects was not irrefutable from the evidence. Rather, this Court is of the opinion that: (l)the written policy in the Rules and Procedures Manual was indeed facially unconstitutional; and (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>evidence in which the district court so firmly rooted its finding that the City required its officers to gain consent before entering a private premises to execute an arrest warrant is conflicting. The district court\u2019s ruling granting judgment in favor of the City as a matter of law was therefore incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">To begin with, we shall explain why we have concluded that the written policy is infirm. It is necessary in doing so to return to the actual text of the section of the City\u2019s Rules and Procedures Manual dealing with planned execution of arrest warrants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-5\">90.06 <em>Planned Execution of [Arrest] Warrants</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-7\">A. A warrant may be served at any time of the day or night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-8\">B. The warrant may be served at any place, public or private, where the actor is reasonably believed to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-9\">C. When it is necessary for officers to enter a private premises to execute an arrest warrant, they will, before entering, announce their identity and purpose and demand admittance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-10\">D. Announcement of identity and purpose is not necessary when exigent circumstances exist or a felony warrant is executed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-11\">E. When officers are refused entry after demanding admittance, they may forcibly enter the premises in order to execute a felony warrant and secure the premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">Maddux did not premise the City\u2019s liability on either the global import of section 90.06, or the specific language in subsection (E.), which is the portion of the written policy that this Court finds problematic in light of <em>Steagald. </em>Though the entire Rules and Procedures Manual was admitted into evidence, Maddux urged below that it was subsection (B.) that by its terms rendered the written policy facially unconstitutional after <em>Steagald.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">The Court disagrees. Section 90.06 must be read as a single, cohesive, progressive statement of the City Police Department\u2019s written policy respecting the planned execution of arrest warrants. Subsection (A.) establishes that officers are not restricted as to when an arrest warrant may be executed; an arrest warrant may be served at any time. In logical sequence, subsection (B.) adds the requirement that officers must have a reasonable belief that the subject will be found at the place referenced in the warrant. Subsection (C.) then distinguishes the procedure to be followed when officers reasonably believe that the subject is located at a private premises: Officers must identity themselves, explain why they are at the residence, and seek (demand) consent to enter. Exceptions to the prescriptive content of subsection (C.) round out the written policy. Subsection (D.) advises that when exigent circumstances exist or officers have secured a felony arrest warrant, the identity and purpose requirements may be dispensed with. And, under subsection (E.), officers in possession of a felony arrest warrant that is to be executed at a private premises are expressly licensed to effect a forcible entry if consent to enter is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">It is the second caveat to the general requirements governing entry of a private premises that is objectionable. Subsection (E.) permits forcible entry of a private premises without consent, exigent circumstances, or a search warrant when officers are in possession of a felony arrest warrant. But if the subject of a felony arrest warrant does not actually reside at the private premises, then an officer\u2019s reasonable belief that the subject may be found there at the time the warrant is being executed does not go far enough to protect the privacy rights of the third-party owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>of the premises. This is the issue to which the United States Supreme Court turned its attention in <em>Steagald.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">In <em>Steagald, </em>the Court reasoned that an arrest warrant constitutes only a judicial finding of probable cause to believe that the subject committed a felony and a concomitant authorization to seize the subject.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> An arrest warrant issues to protect the subject from an unreasonable seizure.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Court had already sanctioned reliance on an arrest warrant alone to enter a person\u2019s home to effect his arrest, having found in that case that it was \u201cconstitutionally reasonable to require him [a person for whom probable cause of commission of a felony had been established] to open his doors to the officers of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">But if the subject of an arrest warrant is reasonably believed to be at the home of a third party, as opposed to a public place or the subject\u2019s home, the limited authority to enter the premises where the subject is reasonably expected to be is not implicit; more is required to safeguard the third party\u2019s \u201cprivacy interest in being free from an unreasonable invasion and search of his home.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The arrest warrant, in such circumstances, does not carry with it any derivative authority to deprive the third party of his privacy interest because the warrant did not issue to protect the third party from an unreasonable search of his home. Officers must justify such a deprivation with additional evidence that the subject of the arrest warrant is reasonably believed to be in that third person\u2019s home.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> A judicial officer has to make such a determination. An officer\u2019s personal determination \u2014 \u201ca judicially untested determination\u201d \u2014 that probable cause exists to enter a third-party residence, in the absence of exigent circumstances, is \u201cnot reliable enough\u201d to justify a search of that private premises for the subject of an arrest warrant.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The Court cited many examples of the \u201csignificant potential for abuse\u201d inherent in a system administered without the benefit of \u201cthe detached scrutiny of a judicial officer.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">The holding in <em>Steagald, </em>according to the Court, was dictated by its earlier reasoning in cases wherein the Court held that, \u201cin the absence of exigent circumstances ... judicially untested determinations are not reliable enough to justify an entry into a person\u2019s home to arrest him without a warrant, or a search of a home for objects in the absence of a search warrant.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The search of a home for a person should entail no less of an assurance that every effort has been made to guarantee the reasonableness of that action on the part of law enforcement.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>While subsection (E.) of the Rules and Procedures Manual is a correct statement of the law apposite to law enforcement officers entering the home of the subject of an arrest warrant in the reasonable belief that the subject will be found there, it is unconstitutional as applied to a third-party private premises where the subject does not live, regardless of any reasonable belief as to his whereabouts. <em>Steagald </em>distinguished the two interests at stake in the latter situation: (1) the suspect\u2019s interest in being free from an unreasonable seizure, and (2) the third party\u2019s interest \u2014 here, Maddux\u2019s interest \u2014 in being free from an unreasonable search of her home.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> If no exigent circumstances are apparent and the third party does not give consent for entry, the search of a third party\u2019s home for purposes of locating the subject of a felony arrest warrant is \u201cno more reasonable,\u201d as viewed by the third party, \u201cthan it would have been if conducted in the absence of any warrant.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The language in subsection (E.) ignores \u201cthe right ... of presumptively innocent people to be secure in their homes from unjustified, forcible intrusions by the Government.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The City\u2019s continued maintenance of a written policy facially inconsistent with established constitutional rights renders suspect the entirety of the City\u2019s protestations respecting its purported unwritten policy for execution of arrest warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">The record shows that Maddux pleaded, argued, and then adduced evidence that (1) the City\u2019s official policy on forcible entry of a third-party residence to execute an arrest warrant, the subject of which did not reside there, was memorialized in section 90.06 of the City Police Department\u2019s Rules and Procedures Manual; (2) the City had every expectation that officers would follow those published rules and procedures that formed the basis of their training; (3) the Rules and Procedures Manual is intended to undergo change to keep pace with evolving law; (4) the Rules and Procedures Manual had not been amended to comply with <em>Steagald; </em>(5) the City\u2019s written policy, as embodied in the Rules and Procedures Manual, was facially unconstitutional in light of this dereliction; and (6) the City\u2019s argument that an unwritten practice of training and requiring officers to get consent, even if borne out by the evidence, does not dismiss, or neutralize the effect of, the affirmatively unconstitutional written policy.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Maddux was attempting to persuade the jury that officers entered the Maddux residence in the absence of all of the three <em>Steagald </em>exceptions and that their actions were sanctioned, as far as they and other officers with the Pasadena Police Department understood, by the express terms of section 90.06 in the Rules and Procedures Manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">The significance of the entire written policy to Plaintiffs\u2019 case is evident insofar as the full text of the Rules and Procedures Manual is a part of the record, which is replete with references both to it and section 90.06 respecting the planned execution of arrest warrants. Counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Plaintiffs consistently questioned the officers in regard to the prominence of the Rules and Procedures Manual in the officers\u2019 training and the Police Department\u2019s expectation that they would familiarize themselves with, and adhere to, the written policy set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Officers were also asked specific questions about the methods prescribed for execution of arrest warrants in the Rules and Procedures Manual. For example, in questioning Assistant Police Chief Cunningham, counsel for Plaintiffs asked whether, to his knowledge, \u201cthe manual\u201d drew any distinction between whether the subject was believed to be at his house or the house of an innocent third party. Assistant Police Chief Cunningham responded that such a distinction did not exist in the written policy.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> An almost identical inquiry had earlier been directed to Officer Marshall, who replied that no provision of the Rules and Procedures Manual drew such a distinction. Officer Villareal was asked the more explicit question of whether he understood from his reading of \u201cthe whole section [90.06],\u201d that a felony arrest warrant could be executed at any place, public or private, where the actor is reasonably believed to be, even though consent is not given and exigent circumstances are lacking.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">In analyzing the written policy of the City, we must do so in the context of the whole. Thus, to confine our consideration to a subsection that Maddux finds particularly troublesome, narrowly examining in a vacuum, a single sentence of section 90.06, would be inconsistent with generally applicable principles of interpretation regularly employed by this Court in the construction of a controlling writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">The district court appears not to have discerned the extent to which the City\u2019s written policy necessarily ran afoul of the Fourth Amendment. City officers\u2019 reliance on a facially unconstitutional written policy conflicted with the testimony offered to show that officers were in fact trained and required to secure consent before executing a felony arrest warrant at a third party\u2019s residence. The written policy provided a legally sufficient evidentiary basis from which a reasonable jury could have found that the City\u2019s official policy was other than what the district court found. The jury could have weighed the discrepant evidence regarding the City\u2019s official policy and reasonably disbelieved the testimony of certain of the officers regarding an unwritten consent requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">Maddux suggests that the district court \u201cwas under the mis-impression that the policy to seek consent somehow absolved the City of an arrest warrant policy that was in clear violation of the Fourth Amendment as interpreted in <em>Steagald.\u201d </em>But to reiterate, this Court has found no statement in the record that definitively tells us the manner in which the district court scrutinized the written policy. Moreover, we note that the jury, once confronted with the evidence of a written policy such as the one at issue here, alongside evidence of an alleged practice of training and requiring officers to obtain consent under circumstances akin to those at issue here, could find in effect that a policy of seeking consent absolved the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>of its problematic written policy. It is plausible that the jury could believe that, though the written policy had not been updated to reflect current law, officers were nevertheless trained in protocol that complied with decisional law interpreting the extent of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">As a second matter already adverted to, the record also discloses that the district court overstated the quantity, and most probably the quality, of the testimony supporting the City\u2019s claim that, in practice, its consent requirement ensured the constitutionality of arrests effected by its officers and any searches conducted in pursuance thereof. In response to Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to explain that officers entered the Maddux residence in a manner violative of <em>Steagald </em>and that they did so in accordance with the training that they had received, the district court rejected that characterization of the City\u2019s official policy by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">Every bit of evidence is that they [the officers] were trained to get consent.... [Y]ou\u2019ve got a policy in place that, in essence, complies with the constitutional requirements that are applicable here, because they have advised their officers to get consent.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">C. The Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">This Court has found notable instances in the trial testimony in which it was not at all clear whether at the time of the events underlying this case certain officers had received training in regard to, or otherwise knew of, the overarching consent requirement advanced by the City. Assistant Police Chief Cunningham testified unequivocally that throughout his tenure with the Pasadena Police Department, the policy had been to obtain \u201cpermission by a person in authority\u201d before entering a private residence to execute a felony arrest warrant, but his statements were not corroborated in a consistent, coherent fashion by testimony elicited from the four other officers called by Plaintiffs as adverse witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">For example, Officer Marshall testified that, at the time he assisted in executing the felony arrest warrant, he understood he would have needed consent to enter a third-party residence, in the absence of a search warrant or exigent circumstances. Counsel for Maddux later used Officer Marshall\u2019s deposition testimony to impeach his trial testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-11\">Q. Okay. And then were you asked: \u201c... Since everyone is saying they did not go into the Maddux residence, my question to you is, even though you say you didn\u2019t go into the Maddux residence, was it your understanding that you had the authority to go into the Maddux residence had you wanted to do so?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-12\">And your answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-13\">A. \u201cThat did not cross my mind at the time I was going in the backyard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-14\">Q. Next question. \u201cAs we sit here today, is it your understanding that you would have had the authority to enter the Maddux residence because you had a felony arrest warrant for [the subject of the felony arrest warrant]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-15\">What was your answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-16\">A. \u201cIf the suspect was inside that residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-17\">Q. Were you then asked: \u201cSo it\u2019s your understanding that if the suspect is in the residence and you have a felony arrest warrant for that suspect, then you have the authority to go into that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>residence to arrest that suspect?\u201d What\u2019s your answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">A. \u201cIf the suspect is there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">In an exchange following the impeachment, Officer Marshall testified that without consent, a search warrant or exigent circumstances, he could not enter a residence where the subject of an arrest warrant was reasonably believed to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Likewise, Officer Villareal\u2019s answers to similar questions were confusing and seemingly inconclusive. On direct examination, he testified thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">Q. What were you trained?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-9\">A. In order to execute a search warrant-I mean, an arrest warrant, a felony arrest warrant, we have to obtain consent prior to going in that house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-10\">Q. What if you don\u2019t obtain consent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-11\">A. Then I\u2019m not going into that house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUE\">Q. You didn\u2019t know that at the time your deposition was taken, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-12\">A. I don\u2019t know that that question was even asked. I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">In reading the relevant portion of Officer Villareal\u2019s deposition for the jury thereafter, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-14\">Q. \u201cLet\u2019s put us back at the police academy; okay? And you\u2019ve got an arrest warrant for suspect A and suspect A is not in suspect A\u2019s house, he\u2019s in B\u2019s house. Does it make any difference to you in executing that warrant whether suspect A is in his own house or whether he\u2019s in B\u2019s house?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-15\">What\u2019s your answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-16\">A. \u201cIt\u2019s a felony warrant. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-17\">Q. Okay. Isn\u2019t it true that on May 22nd, 2000, your understanding is that you had a felony arrest warrant and didn\u2019t make any difference whether he was in his own house or an innocent third party\u2019s house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-18\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-19\">Q. You\u2019ve found out since your deposition that that\u2019s not the way it works; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-20\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-21\">Q. But the way that you were trained by the City of Pasadena is consistent with what you\u2019ve said in the deposition, that it didn\u2019t make any difference which house; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-22\">A. Not according to the rules manual, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-23\">Q. And according to the way you were trained at the police academy; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afm-dedup-0\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-24\">Q. You also testified in your deposition, did you not, that the arrest warrant alone gave you the right to enter the Maddux residence to arrest [the subject of the felony arrest warrant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-25\">A. If I remember correctly, that question I replied was I never went inside the Maddux residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-26\">Q. Correct. And I understand that, but the, hypothetically, that arrest warrant gave you the authority to enter the Mad-dux residence to arrest [the subject of the felony arrest warrant]. It gave you that authority even though you never went in the house. Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019ve testified to at your deposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdW2\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-27\">During the subsequent cross-examination, Officer Villareal testified that the City\u2019s official policy on executing felony arrest warrants was to obtain consent to enter a residence, that he \u201calways practiced that policy,\u201d that this comported with the training he had received, and that he had never been denied consent to enter a residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-28\">Finally, in one of the last series of questions asked of Officer Villareal on redirect, he was asked to read section 90.06 and answer whether it was his understanding from that section that a felony arrest warrant could be executed \u201cat any place, public or private, where the actor is reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>ably believed to be, even if you do not have consent and even if there are not exigent circumstances.\u201d He indicated that this was his understanding of the Rules and Procedures Manual, and further, that this was the way he had been trained \u201cprior to this incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Officer Villareal\u2019s testimony is, in sum, puzzling. Although he seemed to give a definitive answer on cross-examination regarding what the City\u2019s official policy for execution of felony arrest warrants was at the time of the underlying events, his answers to questions posed by counsel for Plaintiffs, both at trial and during his deposition, reasonably undercut the statements he made during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The testimony of Officers Marshall and Villareal alone was sufficient to create an issue of fact regarding the existence of a consent requirement. In particular, Officer Marshall\u2019s, and possibly Officer Villa-real\u2019s, knowledge of what was required to execute a felony arrest warrant at a private premises, at the time relevant herein, seems to coincide with section 90.06 of the Rules and Procedures Manual, according to their own statements. Thus, reasonable jurors could find that at least these officers were following, and indeed may only have known of, the procedures set forth in section 90.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">At a minimum, the testimony elicited raises a factual question as to what City officers seeking to execute a felony arrest warrant at a private premises were trained to do if consent was withheld. Officer Marshall\u2019s deposition testimony indicated his belief that, so long as he held a valid felony arrest warrant, his entry by whatever means necessary was validated. The law does not condone such a course of action if the subject in fact is not in residence, no exigent circumstances exist, and no search warrant has been procured to protect the privacy interest of the third-party owner. Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, this evidence conflicts with the evidence that the officers were trained to get consent, demonstrating that reasonable and fair-minded jurors in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Though the City may ultimately prove that it trained its officers to seek consent before entering a private residence to execute a felony arrest warrant, the record raises a salient factual question that precludes judgment as a matter of law. Did the City and its officers apprehend that if an innocent third party withheld consent to enter her home, officers would then be unable to enter forcibly in the absence of exigent circumstances or a search warrant? It does not appear that officers were made unaware that in executing a felony arrest warrant, the United States Supreme Court had drawn from its interpretation of the Fourth Amendment proscription of unreasonable searches a fundamental distinction between the circumstances under which law enforcement officers could lawfully enter the subject\u2019s home, as opposed to that of an innocent third party. The written policy condoned forcible entry of a third-party premises despite the absence of the <em>Steagald </em>exceptions, and certain testimony in the record causes us to question whether the City in practice went any further in protecting the privacy interests of third parties caught in the melee.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Paradigmatically, a district court regarding a Rule <em>50 </em>motion under these circumstances would thoroughly study the entirety of the written policy, as well as evaluate the testimony of the officers on the issue of consent. The district court would itself only rule as to the substance of the City\u2019s official policy if the facts and inferences favored one party so profoundly that reasonable minds would be incapable of disagreeing. Beyond cavil, it is critical that the district court be certain that no factual issue remains in order to justify taking a case from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">VI. District Court\u2019s Order Excluding Evidence of an Alleged Similar Incident</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">As part of an omnibus motion in limine before trial, Defendants sought to exclude from the jury\u2019s consideration any evidence relating to an alleged warrantless entry of another third-party residence by City of Pasadena police officers attempting to arrest a felony suspect.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The City argued, among other grounds, that such evidence was irrelevant, unduly prejudicial, and had the potential to confuse the issues and mislead the jury. Plaintiffs intended to use the evidence to prove that, as a result of the City\u2019s written policy respecting the planned execution of arrest warrants, a persistent and widespread practice inhered whereby felony arrest warrants could be executed at the home of a third party in the absence of exigent circumstances and without first obtaining consent or a search warrant. The district court granted that portion of the City\u2019s motion in limine by Order of December 7, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">Maddux submits that the district court erred in granting the City\u2019s motion for two reasons: (1) the longstanding position of this Court that a separate, isolated incident is insufficient to prove a persistent and widespread practice of a municipality \u201cshould not apply where there is a written policy that may be inferred to cause a persistent practice;\u201d and (2) the evidence of this \u201cidentical situation\u201d is admissible to contradict the City\u2019s assertion that its officers always sought consent before entering a private premises to execute a felony arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion, reserving the harmless-error doctrine for any perceived miscues.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Although the district court apparently made no findings on the record in support of its decision, we cannot say, based on the evidence and the arguments before us, that it abused its discretion in excluding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">Two affidavits submitted by the couple who owned the home in the alleged similar incident describe the events attendant to the City officers\u2019 entry for purposes of apprehending an individual identified in an arrest warrant.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Maddux refers us to no other evidence adduced in support of her contention of error. Insofar as neither affiant avers facts that would tend to demonstrate that their home should in fact be considered a third-party residence, Mad-dux has not proved that the incident in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>question was sufficiently similar to the alleged entry of the Maddux residence. Further, Maddux provides no sound basis for our departure from this Circuit\u2019s rule that a persistent and widespread practice so common and well settled as to constitute a custom or policy cannot be founded on mere \u201cisolated violations.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Maddux sought to introduce evidence of this one incident, which without more, even assuming its relevance, exemplifies the type of isolated civil rights violation referred to above.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Because Maddux was unable to show that the district court clearly abused its discretion in excluding this evidence, the district court\u2019s decision as to this portion of the City\u2019s omnibus motion in limine is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">VII. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Special difficulties confront trial judges charged with reviewing all of the evidence before them as prelude to ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law in the midst of trial. Nevertheless, the district court improvidently granted judgment as a matter of law for the City of Pasadena in this case, which presented a complicated set of conflicting facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">We reiterate that judgment as a matter of law at this stage of the proceedings is appropriate only where the facts and the inferences resolve themselves into a single reasoned conclusion. Here, the record contains conflicting evidence as to both the intent of the officers who allegedly entered the Maddux residence and the existence of the oral policy and its displacement of the unconstitutional written one.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Resolution of those disputed fact issues should have been left to the jury. For these reasons, a new trial must be granted. REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b795-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

Petitioner Gary Steagald was indicted on federal drug charges after Drug En<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>forcement Administration agents discovered cocaine in Steagald's house during their search for the subject of an outstanding felony arrest warrant. A confidential informant tipped off the agents that the subject of the warrant could be reached at the phone number matching that belonging to the Steagald residence. DEA agents entered the Steagald residence without the consent of the individual who answered the door and searched for the subject of the warrant. DEA agents conducted a second search, which revealed additional incriminating evidence. It was after securing a search warrant for still another search that DEA agents found the cocaine. Steagald moved to suppress all evidence uncovered during the searches, because the DEA agents had failed to obtain a search warrant before entering the house. The district court denied the motion. A divided panel of judges of this Circuit affirmed, in reliance on a previous decision, finding that it was unnecessary for an officer to obtain a search warrant to enter a third-party premises to arrest the subject of an arrest warrant, so long as the warrant was valid and the officer had a reasonable belief that the subject was within the third-party premises. <em>United. States v. Cravero, </em>545 F.2d 406, 421 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 983, 97 S.Ct. 1679, 52 L.Ed.2d 377 (1977). The-search at issue in <em>Steagald </em>had taken place in the absence of either consent or exigent circumstances, leaving the Court to determine whether the arrest warrant alone was adequate to protect the Fourth Amendment interests of the third party whose home DEA agents had entered to search for the subject of the arrest warrant. Justice Marshall, writing for the majority, held that \"in order to render the instant search reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, a search warrant was required.\u201d <em>Steagald, </em>451 U.S. at 222, 101 S.Ct. 1642. In doing so, the majority weighed the additional burden on law enforcement officers attendant to a warrant requirement against the \"right protected-that of presumptively innocent people to be secure in their homes from unjustified forcible intrusions by the Government,\u201d and found that the balance favored the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\">.
