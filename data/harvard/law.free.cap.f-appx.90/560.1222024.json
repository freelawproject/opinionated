Brieant, <em>District </em>Judge), granting summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee Boston Land Company Management Services, Inc. (\u201cBLC\u201d) on Magee\u2019s claim that BLC discriminated against him in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604 (2000) (the \u201cAct\u201d). We review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Tenenbaum v. Williams, </em>193 F.3d 581, 593 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The Act prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion] against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a handicap of ... that person.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(2)(A) (2000). Under the Act, \u201ca refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling\u201d constitutes discrimination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B) (2000). \u201c[I]f the reasonable accommodations provision is triggered, a defendant can be required to incur reasonable costs to accommodate a plaintiffs handicap, provided such accommodations <em>do not </em>pose an <em>undue hardship </em>or a <em>substantial burden. \u201d Salute v. Strat-ford Greens Garden Apartments, </em>136 F.3d 293, 300 (2d Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">With respect to Magee\u2019s contention that BLC impermissibly denied his requests for a key to the back door of his building and for a parking space in the lot behind the building, Magee has neglected to submit any medical or other trustworthy documentation establishing that his condition requires him to use the building\u2019s back entrance. He has thus failed to show, as required by the Act, that such accommodations are \u201cnecessary to afford [him] equal opportunity to use and enjoy [the] dwelling.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">As to Magee\u2019s claim that BLC has failed to make reasonable accommodations in response to his requests that his apartment not be entered in his absence and that papers not be slipped under his door, BLC has submitted evidence that Frances Knapp, the property manager, directed BLC employees not to enter Magee\u2019s apartment for any reason and to direct all communications to his mailbox. Magee does not contest that Ms. Knapp gave this instruction but argues that it was not sufficient because in August 2001, a flier was slipped under his door notifying him that BLC planned to replace his windows. No reasonable juror could, however, conclude from the fact that a single flier was slipped under Magee\u2019s door by an unknown person that BLC\u2019s accommodation was inadequate. The evidence also undisputably shows that BLC adequately responded to Magee\u2019s concerns about the scheduled window replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">Upon consideration, all of Magee\u2019s other claims, are also without merit. Aecording<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
