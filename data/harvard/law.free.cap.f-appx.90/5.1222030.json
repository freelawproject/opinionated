Sorema, </em>534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002). However, <em>Swierkiewicz </em>is inappo-site. First, the appellant\u2019s case was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>dismissed solely on the basis of the allegations of his complaint. Secondly, the Energy Reorganization Act, unlike the statutes at issue in <em>Swierkiewicz, </em>includes a gatekeeping restriction. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5851(b)(3)(A); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 24.5(b); <em>Trimmer v. Department of Labor, </em>174 F.3d 1098 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument that he was entitled to additional discovery is unavailing, as are his remaining arguments. The requested discovery would not have tended to rectify the defect in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\"><em>Affirmed. </em>Loc. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
