After a <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Sample argues that Dr. Reginald Stanley was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs by removing a ground floor housing restriction without conducting a physical examination. Sample subsequently fell down a flight of stairs after being placed in a second-floor cell. Sample argues that defendants Simmons, Franchesta Brown, and Greenle were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs by disregarding a risk that he might fall and failing to assist him down the stairs. He further argues that defendants Dana Brown, Austin, and Payne were deliberately indifferent before the fall when they ignored his claims that his housing assignment in a second-floor cell was erroneous. We conclude that Sample has not shown the defendants acted with subjective recklessness or that they were aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm existed, and also drew the inference. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Sample argues that defendants Rodeen, Melvin, Catoe, and Gurley failed to properly train correctional officers and also maintained a policy or custom of not permitting officers to contact superiors with inmate complaints. Sample\u2019s failure-to-train claim is raised for the first time on appeal and may not be considered. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). His claim concerning an improper policy is conclusional and insufficient to survive summary judgment. <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">Sample has not briefed his claim raised in the district court concerning alleged excessive force by defendant Simmons, and that claim is deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Sample\u2019s motion to compel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">AFFIRMED. MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
