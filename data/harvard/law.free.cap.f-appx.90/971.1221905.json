The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted defendants summary judgment, ruling that Hampton had failed to present any admissible evidence supporting his claims. Hampton appeals, arguing that the court erred in allowing his court-appointed counsel to withdraw, and in granting defendants summary judgment; and that his counsel failed to provide him with any representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">The district court properly granted summary judgment. <em>See Moody v. St. Charles County, </em>23 F.3d 1410, 1411 (8th Cir.1994) (de novo review). Hampton did not establish that the alleged unconstitutional conduct was part of an official policy or custom of the Jonesboro police. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91 &amp; n. 55, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (local governments and local government officials sued in their individual capacities are liable under \u00a7 1983 if \u201cthe action alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers\u201d or if the unconstitutional act is governmental \u201ccustom\u201d). Nor did Hampton submit any admissible evidence to contradict defendants\u2019 evidence that the police officers were properly trained, or that the officers did not bribe any witnesses. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge and set forth facts admissible in evidence; party adverse to summary judgment may not rest upon mere allegations or denials of other party\u2019s pleadings; adverse party\u2019s response must set forth facts, by affidavits, showing genuine issue for trial). Hampton also failed to present any evidence suggesting that the officers had reason to know that the information impheating Hampton in the murder was false, or that they failed to properly investigate the information. <em>See Moody, </em>23 F.3d at 1411-12 (information in affidavit to establish probable cause must be believed or appropriately accepted by affiant as true; lying in affidavit may serve as basis for \u00a7 1983 action; summary judgment appropriate where plaintiff could not substantiate his allegations with sufficient probative evidence that would permit finding in his favor).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">Because Hampton did not object after the court allowed his counsel to withdraw \u2014 indeed, he decided to proceed pro se \u2014 we need not address Hampton\u2019s argument that the district court erred in doing so. <em>See Briley v. Carlin, </em>172 F.3d 567, 571 (8th Cir.1999) (arguments raised for first time on appeal need not be addressed). Hampton\u2019s argument that his counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>ineffective is meritless. <em>See Glick v. Henderson, </em>855 F.2d 536, 541 (8th Cir. 1988) (no constitutional or statutory right to effective assistance of counsel in civil case).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">. The Honorable Stephen M. Reasoner, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
