We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-22\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Ripley is able to work as a semi-conductor bonder, a job existing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>significant numbers in the national and regional economy. <em>See Flaten v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>44 F.3d 1453, 1464-65 (9th Cir.1995); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1566(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Taken as a whole, the record establishes that the ALJ found that Ripley could work an eight-hour day. <em>See Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1103 (9th Cir.1999). The record also establishes, consistent with Social Security Rulings 96-8P and 96-9P, that the ALJ and vocational expert understood the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical to mean work in an eight-hour day. Any error in stating Ripley\u2019s cognitive limitation was harmless because his limitations were adequately accounted for in the job recommended by the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The ALJ\u2019s rejection of Dr. Harris\u2019s opinion as to Ripley\u2019s inability to work was supported by adequate findings and by substantial evidence of the opinion of other experts, including treating physicians. <em>See Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1148-49 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Morgan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 600-01 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Matthews v. Shala-la, </em>10 F.3d 678, 680 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Finally, we decline to consider Ripley\u2019s argument that the ALJ erred by failing to note to the vocational expert that a claimant who cannot stoop, and who is restricted to sedentary, unskilled work, is \u201cusually\u201d disabled, as the argument was not raised in the district court and no exceptional circumstances indicate that we should. <em>See Copeland v. Bowen, </em>861 F.2d 536, 540 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
