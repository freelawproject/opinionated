Leighton, United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b280-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-24\">Adam Fliess, an elementary school student with severe emotional and behavioral problems, brought this suit against the Washoe County School District (\u201cDistrict\u201d) through his guardian, Kenneth Fliess. Pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400-1487, Adam and the District formulated an Individualized Education Plan (\u201cIEP\u201d) that specified the disciplinary protocol that District officials were to use in order to control Adam\u2019s behavioral prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>lems. In his complaint, Adam alleged that on two separate occasions District officials and police officers violated the discipline provisions of his IEP. The first time, someone handcuffed Adam and placed him in the back of a police car. The second time, police officers cited Adam without notifying his guardian, and attempted to get Adam\u2019s signature on the citation. Both incidents caused Adam to suffer severe emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Adam filed suit in federal district court, alleging a federal claim under the IDEA and a state-law claim for negligent supervision. The district court dismissed his IDEA claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. It dismissed his state-law negligence claim for lack of supplemental jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a). On appeal, Adam contends that he was not required to pursue his administrative remedies because doing so would have been futile. We review the question of whether Adam was required to exhaust his administrative remedies <em>de novo. Witte v. Clark County Sch. Dist., 197 F.3d </em>1271, 1274 (9th Cir.1999). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The purpose of the IDEA is to require that state and local educational agencies provide disabled children with a \u201cfree and appropriate public education\u201d and ensure that \u201cthe rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(d). Section 1415 of the act, entitled \u201cProcedural Safeguards,\u201d gives parents the right to submit complaints to school district officials regarding any aspect of a school\u2019s compliance with the IDEA, and entitles them to an \u201cimpartial due process hearing\u201d with their local educational agency to resolve those complaints. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1415(f)(1). Parents dissatisfied with the decision rendered in the \u201cdue process hearing\u201d can appeal it to state-level decision makers. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1415(g). Parties are generally required to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to filing suit under the IDEA, <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A), and before filing any action under any other federal law in which they seek \u201crelief that is also available\u201d under the IDEA, <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7 1415(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required, however, where it would be \u201cfutile or inadequate.\u201d <em>Hoeft v. Tucson Unified Sch. Dist., </em>967 F.2d 1298, 1303 (9th Cir.1992); <em>Doe v. Ariz. Dep\u2019t of </em>Educ., 111 F.3d 678, 681 (9th Cir.1997). Exhaustion is not \u201cfutile\u201d unless the injuries complained of could not be redressed, to any degree, through the IDEA\u2019S administrative procedures. <em>Robb v. Bethel Sch. Dist. # 403, </em>308 F.3d 1047, 1050 (9th Cir.2002). Parties wishing to bypass the administrative appeals process bear the burden of showing futility. <em>Id. </em>at 1050 n. 2. Where the ability of the local educational agency to alleviate the alleged problem is unclear, exhaustion is required. <em>Id. </em>at 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Adam has failed to show that the injuries about which he complains could not have been redressed, to any degree, by way of the IDEA\u2019S administrative procedures. As we held in <em>Robb, </em>\u201csevere emotional distress\u201d suffered as a result of a district\u2019s failure to comply with a child\u2019s IEP can be relieved, to some extent, by providing the child with psychological counseling. <em>Id. </em>(holding that a child\u2019s \u201cpsychological\u201d injuries caused by a violation of her IEP could be redressed, to some degree, by providing \u201crelated services\u201d under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(22), such as \u201cpsychological services, ... therapeutic recreation, social work services, [and] counseling services\u201d). Because an administrative hearing officer could have ordered the district to provide Adam with psychological counseling, and psychological counsel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>ing might have relieved, to some extent, the emotional harm he suffered, he was required to exhaust the IDEA\u2019S administrative procedures prior to bringing suit in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Adam argues that he should not be required to exhaust his administrative remedies because he seeks only retroactive money damages, which an administrative hearing officer arguably lacks the power to grant. <em>See Witte, </em>197 F.3d at 1275. But we have previously rejected attempts by IDEA plaintiffs to avoid the exhaustion requirement by narrowly framing the relief sought. <em>Robb, </em>308 F.3d at 1049 (holding that \u201ca plaintiff cannot avoid the IDEA\u2019S exhaustion requirement merely by limiting a prayer for relief to money damages\u201d). In doing so, we emphasized that the \u201cprimary concern in determining whether a plaintiff must use the IDEA\u2019S administrative procedures relates to the source and nature of the alleged injuries for which he or she seeks a remedy, not the specific remedy requested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1050. Thus, Adam\u2019s attempt to avoid the exhaustion requirement by limiting the relief he seeks to money damages must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Because Adam has failed to show that pursuit of administrative remedies would have been futile, and pursuit of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to bringing an IDEA claim, <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A), the district court\u2019s order dismissing the action is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b280-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
