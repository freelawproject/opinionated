For the reasons that follow, we affirm the denial of preliminary injunctive relief and the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Full familiarity with the factual record and procedural history of this action is here assumed. In granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss - a decision we review <em>de novo, see Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. 2002) - the district court looked beyond the face of the complaint to the employment agreement incorporated therein by reference, and it found that it overreaches. We agree. In its complaint, AM Medica sought (without qualification) \u201cto restrain defendant Kilgallen from the breach of her obligations,\u201d which relief, according to the employment agreement, would bar Kilgal-len for two years from \u201cprovid[ing] to any person [anywhere in the world] the same or similar products or services as are provided by [AM Medica]\u201d - which is to say, it would prevent Kilgallen from earning a living as a conference planner. Such a restrictive covenant is not \u201creasonable in time and geographic scope\u201d such that a court may enforce its terms as written. <em>Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. Cohen, </em>173 F.3d 63, 70 (2d Cir.1999); <em>accord BDO Seidman v. Hirshberg, </em>93 N.Y.2d 382, 388-89, 690 N.Y.S.2d 854, 856-57, 712 N.E.2d 1220 (1999); <em>Reed, Roberts Assocs., Inc. v. Strauman, </em>40 N.Y.2d 303, 307, 386 N.Y.S.2d 677, 679, 353 N.E.2d 590 (1976). Because the district court found that AM Medica\u2019s employment agreement was \u201coverreaching,\u201d it was entitled to exercise its discretion to decline to narrow the restrictive covenant in an effort to render it enforceable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See BDO Seidman, </em>93 N.Y.2d at 394, 690 N.Y.S.2d at 860-61, 712 N.E.2d 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">Nor does the restrictive covenant protect a legitimate business interest. A conference organizer - who coordinates hotels, caterers, and printers and who makes about $50,000 a year - does not provide the \u201cspecial, unique or extraordinary\u201d services, <em>Ticor, </em>173 F.3d at 70, that would justify injunctive relief. Cases involving salesmen or brokers, who develop close relationships of trust with their customers, are easily distinguishable. <em>See Ticor, </em>173 F.3d at 71; <em>Natsource LLC v. Paribello, </em>151 F.Supp.2d 465, 469, 472-74 (S.D.N.Y.2001); <em>Maltby v. Harlow Meyer Savage, Inc., </em>166 Misc.2d 481, 633 N.Y.S.2d 926, 930 (Sup.Ct.1995). If such a relationship was present here, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>discern it from the vague and conclusory allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">As the complaint did not state a claim, the plaintiff necessarily failed to prove the likelihood of success that is a prerequisite to injunctive relief. <em>See Kamerling v. </em>Massanari, 295 F.3d 206, 214 (2d Cir.2002) (per curiam); <em>Straus v. Prudential Employee Sav. Plan, </em>253 F.Supp.2d 438, 453 (E.D.N.Y.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-11\">. We note that plaintiff never moved to amend the complaint to narrow the relief sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
