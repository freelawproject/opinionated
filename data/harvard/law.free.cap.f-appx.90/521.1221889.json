Codified Laws \u00a7 22-22-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">In determining whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense for sentencing enhancement purposes, we initially apply the categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), looking only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense, not the underlying facts. <em>See United States v. Pimentel-Flores, </em>339 F.3d 959, 967-68 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">If the statute criminalizes conduct that would not constitute a qualifying offense, we may \u201clook a little further\u201d and \u201cconsider whether other documentation and judicially noticeable facts demonstrate that the offense was, indeed, within the Guidelines\u2019 definition.\u201d <em>United States v. Shumate, </em>329 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir.), <em>amended by </em>341 F.3d 852 (9th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 1118, 157 L.Ed.2d 944 (2004). The documentation we may consider includes \u201cthe indictment, the judgment of conviction, jury instructions, a signed guilty plea, or the transcript from the plea proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905, 908 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). The purpose of this modified categorical approach is \u201cto determine if the record unequivocally establishes that the defendant was convicted of the generically defined crime, even if the statute defining the crime is overly inclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>sive.\u201d <em>United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1211 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Even assuming the South Dakota statute under which Zamora-Brambila pled guilty fails the categorical test, his conviction nonetheless constitutes a crime of violence under a modified categorical approach. The indictment charges that \u201con or about the 6th of July, 1999,\u201d ZamoraBrambila \u201cknowingly engage[d] in sexual contact with another person, to wit: K.E.T. \u2014 DOB: 10-2-85.\u201d The indictment also describes Zamora-Brambila as follows: \u201cSERGIO ENRIQUE ZAMORA, DOB: 8-17-65.\u201d Thus, at the time of the sexual contact, Zamora-Brambila was 33 and his victim was 13. Zamora-Brambila\u2019s conviction qualifies as the \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>See United States v. Baron-Medina, </em>187 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir.1999) (holding California crime involving the sexual touching of a child under 14 years of age constituted the \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Pereira-Salmeron, </em>337 F.3d 1148, 1154-55 (9th Cir.2003) (concluding that defendant convicted of \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d of a 13-year-old when he was 26 had committed the sexual abuse of a minor). It was therefore a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. 1(B)(ii)(II) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">We also reject Zamora-Brambila\u2019s argument that whether a conviction qualifies as a crime of violence turns on the sexual intrusiveness involved in or the physical harm caused by the conduct reached by the statute. Any sexual abuse of a minor is sufficient. <em>See Pereirar-Salmeron, </em>337 F.3d at 1152 (\u201c[A]n offense constituting \u2018sexual abuse of a minor,\u2019 whether it includes-or even explicitly excludes-'force\u2019 as an element, is deemed to be a \u2018forcible sex offense\u2019 and thus a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 for the purposes of the Guideline.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b562-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
