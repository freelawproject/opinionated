Rushton, a former Warren police officer, charges the City and DeVooght. Rushton\u2019s former commanding officer, with age discrimination. Specifically, Rushton claims that De-Vooght transferred him from a regular patrol position to an \u201cextra\u201d position because of his age. In his original complaint, Rushton asserted claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 621 et seq. (1999), (the \u201cADEA\u201d) and Michigan\u2019s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 37.2101 et seq. (2003), (the \u201cElliott-Larsen Act\u201d). Later, he moved the district court for leave to amend his complaint to add a procedural due process claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">The district court denied Rushton\u2019s motion for leave to amend on the ground that Rushton had not stated a viable due process claim. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Rushton\u2019s ADEA and Elliott-Larsen Act claims on the ground that the transfer did not constitute \u201can adverse employment action\u201d \u2014 a prerequisite for relief under either statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">Rushton has not created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the transfer constituted an adverse employment action, and he failed to designate the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for leave to amend in his notice of appeal, as required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)(1)(B). Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">Rushton worked as a police officer for the City from January 20, 1975 until July 23, 2000. During most of his tenure, he served as a patrol officer. However, he volunteered for permanent duty at the lock-up area twice during his career (from November 1979 to the spring of 1981 and from the fall of 1986 to April 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">The duties of a patrol officer include both road patrol as well as inside station duties such as court officer, property room officer, and jail officer. Officers are assigned to a patrol area on a monthly basis. An officer on road patrol is assigned to one of eight designated patrol areas \u2014 identified by the letters \u201cA\u201d through \u201cH\u201d \u2014 within the City, or to the \u201cextra\u201d position. An officer serving as an \u201cextra\u201d either covers one of the eight patrol areas or performs inside duty. Officers assigned to specific areas are often moved to other areas or to inside duty on an as-needed basis. Officers receive the same salary and benefits regardless of their patrol area and regardless of whether they are assigned to a specific area or to the \u201cextra\u201d position.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-15\">The parties differ on the procedure for the assignment of officers. According to Rushton. \u201c[t]he basic custom or established practice was to allow officers to choose their patrol areas based upon seniority.\u201d Conversely, according to the defendants, officers do not bid on the areas where they will patrol; rather, the commanding officer makes assignments based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>primarily on scheduling needs and officer productivity. The defendants maintain that management possesses the contractual right to make assignments and that it regularly exercised this right by rotating officers among the patrol areas <em>(e.g., </em>moving an officer scheduled for Area A to Area B to cover for a sick or vacationing colleague).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The parties also differ on the nature of the \u201cextra\u201d position. Rushton characterizes the extra as a \u201cgopher\u201d and maintains that only \u201crookies\u201d were assigned to the position. Conversely, the defendants contend that various officers have filled the position, including senior officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">On February 25, 2000, DeVooght became shift commander for Rushton\u2019s shift. Upon assuming command. DeVooght implemented a plan to improve the performance of his officers. He established performance criteria, prepared a written summary of his expectations and the officers\u2019 responsibilities, and informed the officers that failure to comply with performance directives would result in removal from their assigned areas regardless of their seniority. In the course of evaluating his officers, DeVooght determined that Rushton\u2019s performance was \u201csubstandard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">On March 18, 2000, DeVooght met with Rushton and informed him that he was being reassigned from Area D to the \u201cextra\u201d position. According to Rushton, De-Vooght stated that Rushton \u201cwas getting older\u201d and \u201cwas slowing down.\u201d De-Vooght further stated that \u201cin his opinion. [Rushton] was cruising,\u201d and that \u201che needed somebody more aggressive working the area.\u201d DeVooght denies making these statements; instead, he claims that he merely critiqued Rushton\u2019s performance and told him that he would return Rushton to Area D if his performance improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">After leaving DeVooght\u2019s office, Rushton ran into Philip Coraci, a fellow officer and an official in the Warren Police Officers Association. According to Coraci, Rushton was \u201cvisibly upset\u201d and told Coraci \u201cthat he was being removed from his area because lieutenant [sic] wanted to put a younger guy down there.\u201d However, Rushton declined to file a grievance, lamenting that \u201chis spirit was gone.\u201d Nevertheless, Coraci approached DeVooght about the incident. DeVooght told Coraci that \u201cGeorge was getting older\u201d and that \u201che wanted a younger guy to go down there to be more aggressive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">In June 2000, Rushton submitted his retirement application. Rushton claims that he decided to retire because of the \u201chumiliation\u201d and \u201cembarrassment\u201d engendered by the transfer. Specifically, he claims</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-9\">basically everybody in the department knew that I worked [in Area D] and had done so for many years, and when I was removed from that area. I was humiliated, embarrassed, there was no pride left, everything was gone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">The defendants assert that Rushton had discussed retirement with his colleagues for several years up to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">On July 6, 2000, prior to his retirement date, Rushton encountered Police Commissioner Louis J. Nardi. When Nardi congratulated him on his retirement, Rushton indicated that he had decided to retire because he was unhappy with the transfer. Nardi replied that Rushton \u201cshouldn\u2019t go away from here feeling bad,\u201d and he suggested that they meet with Chief James P. Vohs to discuss the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">Later that day, Rushton met with Nardi and Vohs at Nardi\u2019s office. Rushton related his version of the May 18 meeting and stated that he was retiring because of his embarrassment at the transfer. Vohs asked Rushton to rescind his retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>application so that they could discuss the issue with DeVooght when he returned from vacation. Rushton agreed and withdrew his application after the meeting. However, days later, before the meeting with DeVooght and Vohs, Rushton resubmitted his retirement application</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">On June 14, 2001, after receiving a 90-day \u201cRight to Sue\u201d letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Rushton filed a complaint against the City. In his complaint, Rushton alleged that the transfer constituted prohibited age discrimination under the ADEA and the Elliott-Larson Act. On January 31, 2002, Rushton filed a motion to amend his complaint to add DeVooght as a defendant and to allege a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">On March 11, 2002, at the hearing on Rushton\u2019s motion, the district court granted Rushton\u2019s motion to add DeVooght as a defendant. However, it denied Rushton\u2019s motion to add a procedural due process claim, reasoning that Rushton\u2019s amended complaint did not state a valid claim. It explained that \u201cto dignify a transfer of assignment which apparently did not even violate a union contract \u2014 to make that a due process claim is to trivialize our Const-itition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">On April 1, 2002, following a hearing, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The court ruled that Rushton had not shown that the reassignment from Area D to the \u201cextra\u201d position was an adverse employment action, and also ruled that the transfer was not a constructive discharge as \u201c[n]o reasonable person would have felt constrained to quit his job because of [the transfer].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">On April 1, 2002, the district court entered separate orders denying Rushton\u2019s motion for leave to amend and granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. On April 19, 2002. Rushton filed a timely notice of appeal of the order granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">\n<em>1. ADEA Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, as Rushton has not created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his transfer from Area D to the extra position constituted an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Williams v. Gen\u2019l Motors Corp., </em>187 F.3d 553, 560 (6th Cir.1999). The evidence should be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and summary judgment should be granted only when there is no genuine issue of material fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">The ADEA \u201cbroadly prohibits arbitrary discrimination in the workplace based on age.\u201d <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, </em>469 U.S. 111, 120, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cA plaintiff who brings a claim under [the ADEA] must prove that age was a determining factor in the adverse action that the employer took against him or her.\u201d <em>Phelps v. Yale Sec., Inc., </em>986 F.2d 1020, 1023 (6th Cir.1993) (citation omitted). A plaintiff may use direct evidence or circumstantial evidence to make this showing. <em>Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chems. Co., </em>29 F.3d 1078, 1081 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">A plaintiff can establish a <em>prima facie </em>case \u201cby presenting credible, direct evidence of discriminatory intent.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Toledo Hosp., </em>964 F.2d 577, 582 n. 4 (6th Cir.1992). Direct evidence is \u201cthat evidence, which if believed, requires the conclusion that unlawful discrimination was at least a motivating factor in the employer\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Wexler v. White\u2019s Fine Furni</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number><em>ture, Inc., </em>317 F.3d 564, 570 (6th Cir.2003) (en banc) (internal quotation omitted). Once the plaintiff has shown that the decision was made at least in part on a discriminatory basis, the burden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same adverse action even if impermissible factors had not entered into its decision. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 258, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989)). An \u201cisolated.\u201d \u201cambiguous,\u201d or \u201cabstract\u201d remark cannot serve as direct evidence of age discrimination. <em>Phelps, </em>986 F.2d at 1025-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">A plaintiff can also rely on circumstantial evidence under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework. First, a plaintiff must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by introducing evidence sufficient to support a finding that (1) the plaintiff was at least 40 years of age at the time of the alleged discrimination, (2) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, (3) the plaintiff was qualified for the position, and (4) the plaintiff was replaced by a younger person. <em>Cooley v. Carmike Cinemas, Inc., </em>25 F.3d 1325, 1329 (6th Cir. 1994). Next, if the plaintiff has established <em>a prima facie </em>case, the burden shifts to the employer \u201cto articulate some legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason\u201d for its action. <em>LaPointe v. United Autoiuorkers Local 600, </em>8 F.3d 376, 379 (6th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). \u201cOnce the employer carries this burden, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the employer were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Importantly, whether proceeding by direct or circumstantial evidence, an ADEA plaintiff must demonstrate that he suffered \u201can adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Policastro v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>297 F.3d 535, 539 n. 1 (6th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cAn adverse employment action is a materially adverse change in the terms or conditions of employment because of the employer\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539 (internal quotation omitted). \u201cTo be materially adverse, a change in working conditions must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.\u201d <em>Galabya v. New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>202 F.3d 636, 640 (2nd Cir.2000) (internal quotation omitted). Examples of a materially adverse employment decision include a termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices unique to a particular situation. <em>Id; Hollins v. Atl. Co., Inc., </em>188 F.3d 652, 662 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">\u201cReassignments without changes in salary, benefits, title, or work hours usually do not constitute adverse employment actions.\u201d <em>Policastro, </em>297 F.3d at 539. \u201cWhen a reassignment rises to the level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>a constructive discharge, however, the reassignment is an adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reassignment does not amount to a constructive discharge \u201cunless the proffered employment options would have been so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee\u2019s shoes would have felt compelled to resign.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber, </em>932 F.2d 510, 515 (6th Cir.1991) (internal quotation omitted); <em>see also Policastro, </em>297 F.3d at 539 (holding that for a transfer to amount to a constructive discharge \u201cits conditions must be objectively intolerable to a reasonable person\u201d). \u201cAn employee\u2019s subjective impressions as to the desirability of one position over another are not relevant.\u201d <em>Policastro, </em>297 F.3d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Rushton argues that his reassignment to the \u201cextra\u201d position amounted to a constructive discharge. He claims that he was deprived of his right, enshrined by departmental practice, to choose his assigned area. He further claims that the extra position was a \u201cgopher\u201d position traditionally assigned to rookie officers and that, at this position, he was forced to deliver mail to city offices and to pick up prescriptions for inmates. In sum, he maintains that the transfer \u201cwas intolerable to him as it was demeaning to a seasoned officer with many, many years of service,\u201d and it ultimately resulted \u201cin [his] humiliation, depression, and eventual choice to retire earlier than originally anticipated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The district court properly concluded that Rushton has not created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was constructively discharged. The transfer did not produce a change in Rushton\u2019s salary, fringe benefits, or schedule. Rush-ton\u2019s daily responsibilities did not change significantly; Rushton split his time between inside duty and road patrol both before and after the transfer, though after the transfer Rushton rotated between Areas A through D instead of patrolling only Area D. As Rushton testified. \u201c[b]asically what changed was where [he] would actually work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">Moreover, though commanding officers apparently accommodated the preferences of senior officers when possible, the evidence does not support the conclusion that senior officers had any \u201cright\u201d to select their positions. Finally, the transfer was not permanent. <em>See Bowman v. Shawnee State Univ., </em>220 F.3d 456, 462 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that \u201ccases where the employment action, while perhaps being materially adverse if permanent, is very temporary also do not constitute materially adverse employment actions\u201d). At the May 18 meeting, DeVooght informed Rushton that he could return to Area D if his performance improved, and the Police Commissioner \u2014 who had the authority to reverse DeVooght\u2019s decision \u2014 set up a meeting with DeVooght and Rushton to discuss the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">Admittedly, a transfer \u201cinvolving loss of prestige or an objectively demeaning change of working conditions\u201d can amount to a constructive discharge. <em>Darnell v. Campbell County Fiscal Court, </em>731 F.Supp. 1309, 1313 (E.D.Ky.1990). However, the record is barren of evidence supporting Rushton\u2019s charges the extra position was \u201ca gopher job\u201d and that the position was demeaning for an experienced officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, his construc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>tive discharge claim rests on his subjective impression that he was placed in a \u201chumiliating\u201d position, and it therefore fails. <em>See Wilson, </em>932 F.2d at 515 (\u201cWhen an employee alleges that he was forced to resign, the employee\u2019s perception must be judged objectively without consideration of his undue sensibilities.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">\n<em>2. ElliotL-Larsen Act Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">For the same reasons, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Rushton\u2019s Elliott-Larsen Act claim. The parties claim that federal precedent controls the application of the Elliott-Larsen Act. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 25, 45: Appellees\u2019 Br. at 40. Actually, federal civil rights cases are persuasive rather than controlling authority. <em>Bryant v. Automatic Data Processing, Inc., </em>151 Mich.App. 424, 390 N.W.2d 732, 734 (1986). However, the parties have not identified any relevant difference between federal and state law. Therefore, for the reasons stated in Section 1 <em>supra, </em>we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">\n<em>3. Denial of Rushton\u2019s Motion for Leave to Amend</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">Though the parties have not raised the issue, the court does not have jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s denial of Rushton\u2019s motion for leave to amend. Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure requires the appellant to designate the judgment or order from which an appeal is taken in his notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B). This rule is jurisdictional and may not be waived by the court. <em>United States v. Universal Mgmt. Servs., Inc., </em>191 F.3d 750, 756 (6th Cir.1999). \u201c[Ajlthough a court may construe the Rules liberally in determining whether they have been complied with, it may not waive the jurisdictional requirements of Rules 3 and 4, even for \u2018good cause shown\u2019 under Rule 2, if it finds that they have not been met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., </em>487 U.S. 312, 317, 108 S.Ct. 2405, 101 L.Ed.2d 285 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">Rushton\u2019s notice of appeal provides that Rushton \u201cappeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, from an Order granting Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgement, entered in this action on the 1st day of April, 2002.\u201d J.A. at 14. This notice clearly establishes jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling. However, the district court denied Rushton\u2019s motion for leave to amend in a <em>separate </em>order, albeit an order that was entered on the same day as the order granting summary judgment. J.A. at 3,13, 435. Hence, we lack jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for leave to amend. <em>See Universal Mgmt., </em>191 F.3d at 756 (stating the general rule that if an appellant chooses to designate specific determinations in his notice of appeal, rather than simply appealing from the entire judgment, only the specified issues may be raised on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-5\">. Rushton argues that an ADEA plaintiff is not required to show that he suffered an adverse employment action if he presents direct evidence of age discrimination. Appellant's Br. at 17, 19, 23. This assertion is unfounded. <em>See Policastro v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>297 F.3d 535, 539 n. 1 (6th Cir.2002) (stating that \u201cwhether she proceeds on the basis of direct evidence or circumstantial evidence, she must demonstrate an adverse employment action\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Antonucci </em>v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>No. 93-3135, 1994 WL 49569, at *3 (6th Cir. Feb. 17, 1994) (\u201cRegardless of whether a plaintiff seeks to make a <em>prima facie </em>case under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>or proceeds on the basis of direct evidence of age discrimination, he must show at least that there remains a genuine issue as to the adverse employment action which he claims as the injury in his suit.\u201d (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b957-7\">. In his brief and his oral argument. Rush-ton mustered only a citation to his counsel\u2019s oral argument before the district court. Obviously, this is not sufficient to create a triable issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">In its review of the record, the court has found a piece of evidence that arguably supports Rushton\u2019s argument that the extra position was objectively intolerable. Apparently, on July 17, 2000, after Rushton agreed to withdraw his retirement papers, Rushton had a conversation with another officer who \"laughed\u201d at Rushton and said \"at least he still had his area.\" J.A. at 123. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>this isolated incident is not sufficient to establish that an objectively intolerable work environment existed-especially given that Rush-ton was unable to identify \"any other incident where people ridiculed or demeaned [him] relative to being an extra in any way, verbally or through cartoons or postings or any other way.\u201d J.A. at 348.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
