While 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) provides appellate jurisdiction over the portion of the district court\u2019s order relating to the denial of in-junctive relief, it does not provide appellate jurisdiction over the portion of the district court\u2019s order relating to the protective order. <em>See Sherri A.D. v. Kirby, </em>975 F.2d 193, 204-05, fn. 18 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-18\">The protective order issued by the district court is designed to shape the changing needs of the litigation and subject to continued modification by the district court. The order that is on appeal did not alter the inconclusive nature of the protective order. The order thus is not appealable as a final order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Sherwinski v. Peterson, </em>98 F.3d 849, 851 (5th Cir.1996). The inconclusive nature of the order also indicates that it is not appealable pursuant to the collateral order doctrine. <em>See A-Mark Auction Galleries, Inc. v. American Numismatic Ass\u2019n, </em>233 F.3d 895, 898-99 (5th Cir.2000). That portion of the appeal concerning issues that Granger raises in connection with the protective order is therefore DISMISSED for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-19\">Granger argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion for injunctive relief. He asserts that the appellees are threatening to pursue criminal charges against him in Mississippi state court in bad faith. A federal court should abstain from interfering with state criminal proceedings except under extraordinary circumstances. <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 53-54, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). Granger has failed to show that an exception to <em>Younger </em>is warranted because he has failed to show that the appellees have undertaken a prosecution in bad faith. <em>See Perez v. Ledesma, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>401 U.S. 82, 85, 91 S.Ct. 674, 27 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971); <em>see also Kugler v. Helfant, </em>421 U.S. 117, 124-25, 95 S.Ct. 1524, 44 L.Ed.2d 15 (1975). The district court\u2019s ruling denying Granger\u2019s request for injunctive relief is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b782-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
