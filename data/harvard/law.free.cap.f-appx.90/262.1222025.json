Rajan (\u201cRajan\u201d) appeals the decision of the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u2018VA\u201d), affirmed by the Disciplinary Appeals Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) and the district court, to discharge him from his position as a physician at the Las Vegas Veterans Medical Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The VA\u2019s termination decision was based on seven charges against Rajan, all of which were reasonably deemed by the agency to be violations of the VA\u2019s Medical Center Memorandum and a federal regulation prohibiting a government employee from engaging in \u201cconduct prejudicial to the Government.\u201d <em>Leave Administration, </em>Medical Center Memorandum, 05-98-06 (August 1998); <em>Employee Conduct, </em>Medical Center Memorandum, 05-98-25 (September 1998); 5 CFR \u00a7 735.203. Under the highly deferential standard of review of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7462(f)(2)(A), we cannot say that the agency\u2019s decision to terminate an employee who had violated the agency\u2019s policy memorandum and the applicable, albeit broader, federal regulation was arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Hotel Employers Ass\u2019n of S.F. v. Gorsuch, </em>669 F.2d 1305, 1307 (9th Cir.1982) (agency action must be affirmed if \u201ca reasonable basis existed for its decision\u201d);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>McClaskey v. United States Dep\u2019t of Energy, </em>720 F.2d 583, 586 (9th Cir.1983) (dismissal by an agency is excessively harsh \u201conly when the offense committed was extremely minor.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The district court was also correct to find that, under <em>Hibbs v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>273 F.3d 844, 873 (9th Cir.2001), Ra-jan\u2019s receipt of \u201cnotice [of charges] and an opportunity to respond\u201d satisfied the due process requirements of a public employer. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7462(f)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Additionally, even in the face of conflicting evidence, the Board had substantial evidence to conclude that Rajan had violated the norms of professional conduct required of a VA physician. <em>See In re Transcon Lines, </em>89 F.3d 559, 564 (9th Cir.1996) (substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7462(f)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\">. Although the Ninth Circuit has not specifically interpreted the arbitrary and capricious standard of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7462(f)(2), the standard of review directly mirrors the standard for judicial review of other administrative actions. <em>See </em>Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2); <em>Rainsong Co. v. FERC, </em>106 F.3d 269, 272 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
