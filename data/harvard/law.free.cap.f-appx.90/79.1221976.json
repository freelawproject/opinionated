She argues that the district court erred when it denied a mitigating role reduction and that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 952 and 960 are facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Tamez concedes that her second argument is foreclosed but nevertheless raises the issue to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Contrary to her argument on appeal, Tamez\u2019s role in the offense was more than that of a mere courier. Tamez packaged and transported the heroin from Mexico, met with the confidential source once before another meeting with the confidential source and the undercover prospective buyer, stayed overnight with the drugs, and informed the undercover agent that she could deliver additional amounts of heroin. Considering her role in the offense, it cannot be said that Tamez was \u201cperipheral to the advancement\u201d of the illicit heroin activity. <em>See United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 446-47 (5th Cir.2001). The district court did not clearly err in determining that Tamez was not entitled to a minor role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). <em>See United States v. Zuniga, </em>18 F.3d 1254, 1261 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">Tamez\u2019s argument regarding the constitutionality of the statutes of conviction is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000). The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b120-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
