After Wells Blue Bunny terminated her employment as a full-time quality control laboratory technician, Miller brought a disability discrimination action against Wells. The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> granted summary judgment to Wells concluding Miller had not generated genuine issues of material fact that would allow a jury to find she was actually disabled or perceived as disabled. <em>Miller v. Wells Dairy, Inc., </em>252 F.Supp.2d 799, 806-11 (N.D.Iowa 2003). Miller ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>peals arguing the district court committed error in deciding as a matter of law that she did not establish a prima facie case of actual or perceived disability. Having carefully reviewed the record and the applicable law, we conclude the district court properly analyzed Miller\u2019s claims and appropriately granted summary judgment. Because we have nothing to add to the district court\u2019s thorough analysis, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s published opinion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b233-28\"> The Honorable Mark Bennett, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
