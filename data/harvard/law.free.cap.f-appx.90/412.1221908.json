POOLER, SONIA SOTOMAYOR, and RICHARD C. \u201cWESLEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b453-15\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the <em>An-ders </em>motion made by counsel for appellant John E. Elejalde and the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance of Ele-jalde\u2019s conviction and sentence are granted; that the judgment of said District Court as to appellants Restrepo, Yusty, Torres, and Vadas is AFFIRMED; that Lopez\u2019s appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction; and that we remand to the district court for further findings with respect to Barrientos.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-17\">Counsel for appellant Elejalde moves to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and the government moves for summary affirmance. Having reviewed all of the parties\u2019 submissions\u2014 including those from Elejalde opposing both motions \u2014 we find no arguable basis for vacating Elejaide\u2019s plea or reversing his sentence. We therefore grant both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The remaining defendants, all of whom pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, appeal the resulting sentences on various grounds. We assume the reader\u2019s familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the specification of appellate issues and affirm the sentences of Restrepo, Yusty, Torres, and Vadas, dismiss Lopez\u2019s appeal, direct further factual findings with respect to Barrientos, and hold as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The evidence before the district court was sufficient to support each challenged factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">(2)Yusty, Restrepo, and Torres, who argued that their sentences must be vacated pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), are not entitled to relief under <em>Apprendi </em>because the offenses for which they were indicted and to which they pleaded guilty carried maximum sentences higher than they actually received. <em>See United States v. Luciano, </em>311 F.3d 146, 151-54 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">(3) Yusty and Restrepo contend that the district court erred by failing to apply a standard of proof higher than preponderance to certain of their sentencing adjustments. The standard of proof for sentencing fact finding is preponderance of the evidence, although defendants who can demonstrate \u201ca combination of circumstances ... including (i) an enormous upward adjustment (ii) for uncharged conduct (iii) not proved at trial and (iv) found by only a preponderance of the evidence, (v) where the court has substantial doubts as to the accuracy of the finding,\u201d may be eligible for a downward departure upon request. <em>United States v. Cordoba-Murgas, </em>233 F.3d 704, 708-09 (2d Cir.2000). The record does not indicate that the district court had substantial doubts about any of the findings relevant to this claim. Moreover, neither Yusty nor Restrepo asked the district court to depart downwardly based on the standard of proof. Because neither we nor the Supreme Court has ever found error based on a district court\u2019s failure to depart downward on a burden of proof analysis and because defendants did not make such a motion, we do not find plain error here. <em>See United States v. Dukagjini, </em>326 F.3d 45, 61 (2d Cir.2003) (holding that an error is plain if it is clear at the time of appellate review); <em>United States v. Belk, </em>346 F.3d 305, 315 (2d Cir.2003) (holding that we will not ordinarily find plain error where defendant does not propose a downward departure because we assume the district court understood the law and applied it correctly).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">(4) The district court correctly found that Yusty is ineligible for safety valve relief because he did not satisfy his burden of showing that he provided \u201call information and evidence [he had] concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). Defendant Yadas is ineligible for the same relief because he failed to demonstrate that he did not possess his \u201cfirearm[s] ... in connection with the offense\u201d for which he was convicted, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">(5) Because, contrary to Lopez\u2019s position, the district court did not err in the standard it applied to Lopez\u2019s motion for a diminished capacity departure, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 cmt. n. 1, or misconceive its powers, we lack jurisdiction to consider Lopez\u2019s appeal and must dismiss it. <em>See United States v. Silleg, </em>311 F.3d 557, 561 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">We also hold that Barrientos\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment challenges to his obstruction of justice enhancement are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>devoid of merit. <em>See United States v. Carmona, </em>873 F.2d 569, 574 (2d Cir.1989) (\u201cIt is not a denial of due process for the trial judge, when determining sentence, to rely on evidence given by witnesses whom the defendant could neither confront nor cross examine\u201d or to rely on evidence stemming from a proceeding in which the defendant did not have counsel); see <em>also Colorado v. Spring, </em>479 U.S. 564, 574-75, 107 S.Ct. 851, 93 L.Ed.2d 954 (1987) (holding that voluntary waiver of Fifth Amendment privilege requires only that defendant be advised of his right to remain silent and warned that anything he says may be used against him and that defendant need not be warned of every possible way information he discloses could harm him). However, the district court did not make the factual findings required for an obstruction of justice adjustment. <em>See United States v. Ben-Shimon, </em>249 F.3d 98, 102-04 (2d Cir.2001) (holding that to enhance offense level for obstruction of justice, district court must make specific factual findings that defendant willfully gave false testimony on a material matter); <em>United States v. Zagari, 111 </em>F.3d 307, 329 (2d Cir.1997) (holding that where perjury occurred not in defendant\u2019s criminal trial but in a separate but related matter, the court must find materiality both as to the proceeding in which the testimony was given and the defendant\u2019s own trial or sentencing). Because the district court did not make sufficiently specific findings, we remand for findings on each of the elements of an obstruction of justice enhancement. <em>See United States v. Jacobson, </em>15 F.3d 19, 21-22 (2d Cir.1994). We retain jurisdiction over any claims that result from the district court\u2019s further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Accordingly, the clerk is directed to issue the mandate, whieh-in addition to affirming the district court\u2019s judgment with respect to Restrepo, Yusty, Torres, and Yadas, granting Elejaide\u2019s counsel\u2019s <em>An-ders </em>motion and the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance, and dismissing Lopez\u2019s appeal, shall provide that either the government or Barrientos may restore jurisdiction over Barrientos\u2019s appeal to this panel by filing with the Clerk\u2019s Office, a copy of the district court\u2019s further findings and a letter advising the Clerk\u2019s Office that jurisdiction should be restored.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
