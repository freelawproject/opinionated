The SEHO officer took oral and documentary evidence. On July 3, 2002, he issued an opinion determining whether the Hart School District had provided Aja with a free and appropriate public education (\u201cFAPE\u201d) between October 3, 2001 and July 3, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-22\">The isolated issue of whether Aja was entitled to have Westmark designated as her stay-put placement is closely related to the appropriateness of Hart\u2019s proposed interim placement and whether Hart provided Aja with FAPE. Under these circumstances, the stay-put issue should not be considered in isolation. The SEHO has developed a factual record, and its record presumably includes facts that will allow a determination as to whether it was \u201cpossible\u201d for Hart to implement Aja\u2019s previous individualized educational placement \u201cin full.\u201d <em>See Ms. S. ex rel G. v. Vashon Island Sch. Dist., </em>337 F.3d 1115, 1134 (9th Cir.2003). That record is not before us, and it would be inappropriate for us to determine the stay-put placement issue in this case without it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The parties have appealed the decision in the due process hearing to the district court. We direct that the district court vacate its opinion that is the subject of this appeal and reconsider its opinion in light of <em>Vashon Island Sch. Dist., </em>the record in the appeal from the due process hearing and any additional evidence it may take at the request of the parties or either of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">REMANDED with instruction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-18\">.
