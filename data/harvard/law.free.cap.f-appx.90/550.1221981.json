It is</p>\n<p id=\"b591-16\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. FDIC, 310 </em>F.3d 202, 205 (D.C.Cir.2002). Appellee\u2019s alleged liability to appellant arises from the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause of paragraph 2 of the parties\u2019 Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d). Under that paragraph, ap-pellee is to use its \u201cbest efforts\u201d to secure a release for appellant and her husband from all personal liability for the debts of their company, Atchison &amp; Keller, Inc. To fulfill that commitment, paragraph 3 states appellee is to secure a working capital fine of credit of $1 million for the company, and appellee\u2019s \u201cbest efforts\u201d includes \u201cthe possible guarantee\u201d of the debt. Simply put, the \u201cbest efforts\u201d language in the MOU does not state a commitment by appellee to guarantee the entire loan or to procure the loan with no liability on the part of appellant and her husband. Furthermore, pursuant to the personal guaranty of appellant and her husband for the full amount of the loan, and their several pledges of collateral, the bank had discretion to seek repayment of the loan from them and to sell the collateral before pursuing any claim against appellee. Finally, by the terms of paragraph R.2 of the Extension Agreement between appellee and the bank, appellee\u2019s liability was limited to fifty percent of the aggregate amount of the outstanding loan up to $500,000. Appellee put up no collateral for the loan and its acknowledgment in paragraph R.6 of the then outstanding amount of the loan did not change the terms of its liability to the bank under paragraph R.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-18\">Accordingly, there is no basis upon which appellant can prevail on her cross-claim against appellee for a credit greater than the amount awarded by the district court, and the district court did not err in dismissing the cross-claim. <em>See Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); <em>Baker v. Dir., United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>916 F.2d 725, 726 (D.C.Cir.1990); <em>Pleasants v. Locke, </em>924 F.2d 1144, 1146 (D.C.Cir.1991). The lack of notice of the court\u2019s intent to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the cross-claim resulted in no prejudice to appellant. <em>See Baker, </em>916 F.2d at 726; <em>Omar v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., </em>813 F.2d 986, 991 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
