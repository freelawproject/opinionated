Pozo also alleged that the officials\u2019 actions were in retaliation for complaining about prison conditions. The parties proceeded to trial, and a jury found in favor of the defendants. Pozo appeals, but because he has failed to provide us with trial transcripts, we must dismiss his appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-18\">Pozo\u2019s allegations stem from an April 2001 incident in which the defendants transferred him from one prison cell to another. During the transfer, Pozo contends, he was assaulted by the defendants, causing injuries to his head and back. Pozo submits that those injuries were not treated until five or six days later. Further, Pozo claims, he was then placed in a cold cell without clothing or bedding for three days. Pozo argues that the defendants\u2019 actions were malicious and intended to cause him harm and that as a result of the incident he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, nightmares, phobias, and difficulty sleeping and concentrating.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-19\">On appeal Pozo challenges the district court\u2019s evidentiary and procedural rulings at trial as well as the jury\u2019s verdict. First, Pozo contests the district court\u2019s admission of a videotape of the April 2001 cell transfer; he believes that the defendants altered the videotape by erasing the portion showing them using excessive force. Next, Pozo submits that the district court erred at trial by refusing to give him copies of two prison policies concerning the transfer of inmates. Pozo also argues that the district court erred in refusing to permit several of Pozo\u2019s witnesses to testify at the trial. Further, Pozo challenges the jury\u2019s conclusion that the defendants were not deliberately indifferent to his medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>needs. Finally, Pozo contends that the trial was unfair both because the district court did not appoint counsel to represent him and because the court made negative comments about him that biased the jury toward the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Pozo, however, has not included a trial transcript in the record, so we cannot meaningfully review any of his arguments or verify any of his claims. <em>See LaFollette v. Savage, </em>63 F.3d 540, 544 (7th Cir.1995). Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(b)(2) provides that \u201c[i]f the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to that finding or conclusion.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2); <em>see Learning Curve Toys, Inc. v. PlayWood Toys, Inc., </em>342 F.3d 714, 731 n. 10 (7th Cir.2003). Without the transcript, \u201cwe are unable to evaluate the evidence submitted in this case.\u201d <em>Hotaling v. Chubb Sovereign Life Ins. Co., </em>241 F.3d 572, 581 (7th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). Since all of Pozo\u2019s arguments require us to evaluate the evidence presented at trial, all of his arguments are forfeited and we may dismiss his appeal. <em>LaFollette, </em>63 F.3d at 544 (\u201cdismissal is the appropriate course if the absence of a complete record precludes meaningful appellate review\u201d). We note that Pozo\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status does not prohibit dismissal. <em>See Woods v. Thieret, </em>5 F.3d 244, 245-46 (7th Cir.1993) (dismissing appeal of <em>pro se </em>plaintiff for failure to provide transcript).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Although we have the authority under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(e) to order Pozo to supplement the record to include the trial transcript, we decline to exercise that authority because Pozo has \u201chad ample opportunity to correct the problem but [has] failed to do so.\u201d <em>LaFollette, </em>63 F.3d at 545. Pozo twice requested a copy of the trial transcript from the district court, noting that he needed the transcript to prepare his appeal. The district court denied both motions, concluding that because the transcript was not necessary for his appeal, Pozo would have to prepay to receive it. But he never paid to have the transcript prepared. Afterwards in this court Pozo four times renewed his motion to receive a free transcript; each motion was denied. In denying one of his motions, we notified Pozo that he was not entitled to receive free transcripts because he was not proceeding <em>informa pauperis </em>on appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f). Since Pozo still did not order and arrange to purchase the transcript, we see no purpose in affording him yet another chance to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">The defendants request that Pozo be sanctioned for filing a frivolous appeal, but they have not submitted the \u201cseparately filed motion\u201d necessary for us to consider their request. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 38 (requiring \u201cnotice\u201d and a \u201creasonable opportunity to respond\u201d before sanctions can be imposed); <em>LINC Fin. Corp. v. Onwuteaka, </em>129 F.3d 917, 924-25 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
