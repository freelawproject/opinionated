Their virtually identical complaints alleged numerous constitutional violations, ostensibly pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1985, and a variety of state law claims. The gravamen of the plaintiffs\u2019 action is that, following the respective retirements of Alice Clissuras in 1982 and Patricia Clissuras in 1986 from the faculty of the New York City College of Technology, a CUNY senior college, they were denied certain pension and health benefits because of improper calculations and mis-classifications by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The district court (Scheindlin, <em>J.) </em>dismissed the claims against defendant CUNY at the outset of the litigation on the ground that CUNY was \u201can arm of the state\u201d and consequently entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. We take up the issue of sovereign immunity in a separate <em>per curiam </em>opinion. The court below also dismissed the actions against the remaining named defendants pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and enjoined the plaintiffs from instituting any future federal litigation against CUNY and these defendants without seeking leave of the court. In this order, we affirm the dismissal \u2014 pertinent to TRS, the Union, and the Fund \u2014 and the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims of wrongdoing stem from events the latest of which occurred at least a decade before they filed their present suit, in October 2002. The statute of limitations for causes of action brought pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 in New York is three years, <em>see Jaghory v. N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>131 F.3d 326, 331 (2d Cir. 1997), and a claim accrues \u201cwhen the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of [her] action.\u201d <em>Pearl v. City of Long Beach, </em>296 F.3d 76, 80 (2d Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). The record reflects that both plaintiffs had reason to know of their alleged injuries more than ten years ago. And, on the facts of their cases, the plaintiffs cannot point to any continuing violation that would preserve their claims. <em>See Florida v. Long, </em>487 U.S. 223, 239, 108 S.Ct. 2354, 101 L.Ed.2d 206 (1988) (\u201cIt is not correct to consider payments of benefits based on a retirement that has already occurred as a sort of continuing violation.\u201d). Because plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims are time-barred, they were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">In the absence of any viable federal claims,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court was well within its discretion in declining to exercise sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>plemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 state law causes of action, which it dismissed, of course, without prejudice. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) (2000); <em>Ametex Fabrics, Inc. v. Just In Materials, Inc., </em>140 F.3d 101, 105 (2d Cir.1998). And, having reviewed the history of this case, we find no abuse in the lower court\u2019s decision enjoining plaintiffs from filing another federal lawsuit against these defendants without first obtaining the court\u2019s permission. <em>See Covan-ta Onondaga Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Onondaga County Res. Recovery Agency, </em>318 F.3d 392, 398 (2d Cir.2003) (noting that district courts have the power to issue injunctions to prevent vexatious litigation). Moreover, the court acted within the range of permissible discretion in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration, and we find this to be so even if we construe the filing as a motion for relief from judgment under Fed R. Civ. P. 60(b). <em>See Eisemann v. Greene, </em>204 F.3d 393, 395 n. 2 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam) (\u201cTo be entitled to reargument, a party must demonstrate that the Court overlooked controlling decisions or factual matters that were put before it on the underlying motion.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, plaintiff Alice Clissuras\u2019s production and recusal motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">We have considered all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims with respect to defendants TRS, the Union, and the Fund and find them merit-less. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court as it pertains to these defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-9\">. In their cavalcade of claims, plaintiffs make creative arguments regarding obstruction of justice and theft of identity. These claims are either time-barred or do not constitute private federal causes of action, or both. The only other potentially colorable federal claim asserted in plaintiffs\u2019 complaints is a violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Act (\"ERISA\u201d), <em>see 29 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a) (2000). The statute of limitations for ERISA breach of fiduciary duty claims provides for a bar on any action brought more than \"three years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation\u201d or six years after discovery in the case of fraud or concealment. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113(2) (2000); <em>see Caputo v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>267 F.3d 181 (2d Cir.2001). Here, plaintiffs had actual knowledge of the alleged violation more than six years before they instituted their suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
