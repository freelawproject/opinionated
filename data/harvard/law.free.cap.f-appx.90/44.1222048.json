His first petition addresses the alleged difficulties he has had getting papers filed in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) action. Watkins seeks to have the magistrate judge recused from his case and an investigation ordered into the magistrate judge, district court judge, and their clerks. In his second petition, Watkins seeks an order requiring the district court to give specific reasons for failing to grant him a certificate of appealability, and in his third petition, Watkins requests that we order the district court to file his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-17\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir. 1987). It is available only where there are no other means by which the relief sought could be granted. <em>Id. </em>Mandamus may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>In re Catawba Indian Tribe, </em>973 F.2d 1133, 1135 (4th Cir.1992). The party seeking mandamus relief carries the heavy burden of showing that he has no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires and that his entitlement to such relief is clear and undisputable. <em>Allied </em>Chem. <em>Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-18\">Regarding Watkins\u2019 first mandamus petition, all of Watkins\u2019 documents were filed with the exception of a letter dated September 18, 2003, in which Watkins inquired about his reply brief. Since this letter may have been construed as an inquiry rather than a motion, it is likely that it was intentionally and properly not \u201cfiled.\u201d The other motions were apparently not properly sent to the clerk\u2019s office, even though Watkins was informed in an August 14, 2003 court order that his documents should be filed with the clerk\u2019s office. In any event, Watkins fails to show prejudice from any of the filing delays, and any errors were quickly rectified. Accordingly, Watkins does not establish the requisite extraordinary circumstances for mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-19\">Watkins\u2019 two other mandamus petitions are moot, as he has already received the relief he requested. The district court\u2019s January 12, 2004 order specifically stated why Watkins\u2019 motion for a certificate of appealability was denied, and Watkins\u2019 notice of appeal was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-20\">Accordingly, we grant Watkins\u2019 motion to proceed in forma pauperis and deny his mandamus petitions. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
