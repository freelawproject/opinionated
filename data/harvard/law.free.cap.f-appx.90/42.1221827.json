Gadsden\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Gadsden has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-20\">Counsel questions whether the district court fully complied with the mandates of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in accepting Gadsden\u2019s guilty plea. Because Gadsden did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, we review his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.) (providing standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 899, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002). Our review of the record convinces us that there is no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-21\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Gadsden contends that counsel improperly advised him to plead guilty to the \u00a7 924(c) offenses. However, \u201c[i]neffective assistance claims are not cognizable on direct appeal unless counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 1111, 157 L.Ed.2d 939 (2004). Because Gadsden has failed to meet this high standard, we decline to address his ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-24\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Gadsden\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>sel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
