Darouse, Jr., a federal prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). We affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Darouse appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal as moot his claim that the Parole Commission, in violation of his due process rights, held an untimely revocation hearing on November 11, 2000, a period more than ninety days after the parole warrant was executed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4214(c) (2000). The district court found this claim moot because Darouse was released from incarceration on December 21, 2000. A consequence of the parole revocation hearing, however, was the continuation of Darouse\u2019s parole until February 17, 2009, beyond his original release date of November 28, 2000. Thus, we conclude that Darouse is still in custody for purposes of this claim, and there is accordingly a live controversy. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 8, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>Jones v. Cunningham, </em>371 U.S. 236, 243, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963) (holding that parole amounts to custody under habeas corpus statute). We vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim as moot and remand this claim to the district court for further proceedings regarding the significance, if any, to the alleged delay in holding Darouse\u2019s revocation hearing. <em>See Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 488, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972); <em>Gaddy v. Michael, </em>519 F.2d 669, 673 (4th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">We have reviewed the record relating to Darouse\u2019s other claims and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm as to the remaining claims for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Darouse v. United States Parole Commission, </em>No. CA-01-137 (E.D.Va. Mar. 28, 2003). We grant Darouse\u2019s motion to proceed in for-ma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
