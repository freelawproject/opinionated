We have jurisdiction to review Morales-Campos\u2019s contention that NACARA section 202(b) violates equal protection, and we review this constitutional claim de novo. <em>See Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 599 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">\u201c \u2018Line drawing\u2019 decisions made by Congress ... in the context of immigration and naturalization must be upheld if they are rationally related to a legitimate government purpose,\u201d <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 517 (9th Cir.2001), and \u201c[cjhallengers have the burden to negate \u2018every conceivable basis which might support [a legislative classification] ... whether or not the basis has a foundation in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hernandez-Mezquita v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 1161, 1164 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Heller v. Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 320-21, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993)). Morales-Campos has not met this burden, because a rational basis exists for distinguishing groups of aliens from Mexico from those from Nicaragua or Cuba based on conditions in their home countries. <em>See Jimenez-Angeles, </em>291 F.3d at 597. Moreover, we have specifically held that NACARA section 203 does not violate equal protection. <em>See Ram, </em>243 F.3d at 517 (Congress\u2019s decision to favor aliens from specific war-torn countries \u201cstems from a rational diplomatic decision to encourage such aliens to remain in the United States.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">The Clerk is directed to stay the mandate pending the resolution of <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 03-70477 and further order of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1038-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
