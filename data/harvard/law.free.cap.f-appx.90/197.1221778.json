Queen, Olathe, KS, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b238-5\">Before MELLOY, HANSEN, and COLLOTON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b238-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Nancy Queen pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess and distribute pseudoephed-rine, having reasonable cause to believe it would be used to manufacture methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(c)(2) and 846. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> departed downward from the Guidelines and sentenced Queen to time served and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, Queen\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In lengthy pro se submissions, Queen contends she received ineffective assistance of counsel because her indictment would have been dismissed outright under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers if her counsel had so moved. Queen seeks to supplement the record with exhibits in which she reiterates her ineffective-assistance claim. The government has moved to dismiss the appeal based on an appeal waiver in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">We find that Queen\u2019s appeal should not be dismissed based on the appeal waiver, because the waiver in the plea agreement specifically permits Queen to challenge her conviction on ineffective-assistance grounds. To the extent Ms. Queen challenges her conviction on grounds other than ineffective assistance of counsel, we conclude that those arguments are waived by the plea agreement. <em>Cf. United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-91 (8th Cir.) (en banc) (appellate court may dismiss appeal if it falls within scope of appeal waiver), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 501, 157 L.Ed.2d 398 (2003). We decline to address Queen\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim, which should be raised \u2014 if at all \u2014 in collateral proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>330 F.3d 1068, 1069 (8th Cir.2003) (ineffective-assistance claims should be deferred to \u00a7 2255 proceedings unless miscarriage of justice would obviously result, or outcome would be inconsistent with substantial justice); <em>United States v. Cain, </em>134 F.3d 1345, 1352 (8th Cir.1998) (claim that ineffective assistance of counsel\u2019 tainted defendant\u2019s guilty plea should be raised in \u00a7 2255 motion and not on direct appeal); <em>cf. United States v. Pregent, </em>190 F.3d 279, 283 (4th Cir.1999) (prisoner on supervised release is \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of filing \u00a7 2255 motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">We have carefully reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm. We deny all other pending motions, including the petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-10\">. The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
