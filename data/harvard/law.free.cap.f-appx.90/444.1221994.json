McClung sought restoration of good conduct time that was forfeited as a result of a disciplinary conviction. McClung asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for possession of a dangerous weapon and that his due process rights were violated because (1) informant information was withheld from the hearing officer; (2) McClung was denied the ability to call witnesses, present evidence, and be represented by a staff representative; and (3) the district court erred in denying him discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-21\">Federal prisoners must exhaust their administrative remedies prior to filing \u00a7 2241 petitions. <em>Carmona v. United States Bureau of Prisons, </em>243 F.3d 629, 634 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Little v. Hopkins, </em>638 F.2d 953, 953-54 (6th Cir.1981). Failure to exhaust may only be excused upon a showing of cause and prejudice. <em>Carmona, </em>243 F.3d at 634-35. In his final administrative appeal, McClung failed to allege that informant information was withheld or that he was denied due process at the hearing, and he provides no excuse for his failure to do so. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>these claims were procedurally defaulted and unreviewable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. In addition, because his informant claims are defaulted, McClung\u2019s related request for discovery was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Turning to his claim of insufficient evidence, the requirements of due process in a prison disciplinary hearing are met when there is \u201csome evidence\u201d that supports the decision to revoke good time credits. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). Constructive possession provides \u201csome evidence\u201d of guilt only when relatively few inmates have access to the area. <em>See Broussard v. Johnson, </em>253 F.3d 874, 877 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that, when only evidence linking weapon to inmate is that it was found in an area accessible to 100 inmates, there is insufficient evidence to satisfy \u201csome evidence\u201d standard); <em>Hamilton v. O\u2019Leary, </em>976 F.2d 341, 345-46 (7th Cir.1992) (finding some evidence (although \u201cmeager\u201d) existed when inmate was one of four with access; noting that, if inmate were one of thirty-two with access, constructive possession would be insufficient evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The Hearing Officer relied on the following as evidence of McClung\u2019s guilt: (1) the fact that a sharpened instrument was found in McClung\u2019s living area and (2) the prison\u2019s rule of \u201cconstructive possession\u201d which states that \u201c[w]hen positive ownership can not be determined, all occupants of the cell are equally responsible.\u201d McClung stated, when he was given his incident report, that his cell was unlocked and, therefore, accessible by other inmates. In his informal brief, he states that the number of inmates with access to his cell was 130. McClung has consistently repeated these assertions throughout both his administrative appeals and the instant action. If indeed McClung\u2019s cell was accessible by 130 inmates, we find that there was insufficient evidence to connect him to the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The district court did not address this issue and merely found that \u201csome evidence\u201d supported McClung\u2019s conviction, without either a hearing or discussion of reasons. At the summary judgment stage, the court does not weigh evidence or determine the truth of asserted matters. The only issue is whether there is a \u201cgenuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Ca-trett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Here, McClung has raised a genuine issue as to whether the weapon with which he was charged was found in an area accessible to 130 other inmates. Notably, Defendant provides no evidence whatsoever regarding the accessibility of McClung\u2019s cell. Since the resolution of this issue cannot be determined on summary judgment, we vacate a portion of the district court\u2019s order and remand the case for a hearing to determine whether \u201csome evidence\u201d supported McClung\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Thus, we grant MeClung\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment on McClung\u2019s claim that insufficient evidence supported his disciplinary conviction and remand for further proceedings. We affirm the remainder of the district court\u2019s order and deny McClung\u2019s motion to consolidate. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
