For reversal Holmes argues, among other things, that the district court should have considered his \u201cMotion for Trial by Jury\u201d before entering judgment against him; he explains that the motion was filed several days after entry of judgment because initially he sent it to the wrong address. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we find that the district court properly dismissed Holmes\u2019s FOIA action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, <em>see Brumley v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>767 F.2d 444, 445 (8th Cir.1985) (per curiam), as defendant\u2019s unrebutted evidence showed that Holmes failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. As to the postjudgment \u201cMotion for Trial by Jury,\u201d the district court clearly considered and denied the motion, and nothing in or attached to the motion casts doubt on the propriety of the district court\u2019s dismissal of Holmes\u2019s FOIA action as unexhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">We have considered and find meritless Holmes\u2019s remaining arguments. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-10\">. The Honorable Stephen N. Limbaugh, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
