Carney contests the merits of the BIA\u2019s decisions that he was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal on the ground of moral character and because he faded to demonstrate the requisite hardship. The Respondent contends that Carney\u2019s petition should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the BIA\u2019s determinations on hardship and moral character are discretionary determinations precluding judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-23\">This court does not have jurisdiction to review the Immigration Judge\u2019s discretionary determination that Carney\u2019s children would not suffer an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if Carney were deported to Guatemala. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D); 8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(B)(I); <em>Bravo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 590, 592 (5th Cir.2003). Because the Immigration Judge\u2019s determination on hardship is fatal to Carney\u2019s application, and that determination is not renewable, it is unnecessary to address the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding on moral character.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-25\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b119-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
