He contends that the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges of Black potential jurors denied him equal protection, in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). The United States District Court for the Central District of California rejected this contention and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">The prosecutor used at least nine peremptory challenges during jury selection. Smith\u2019s counsel told the district court that of the nine jurors thus eliminated, \u201csix ... [were] Black, two ... were Hispanic, and one ... [was] mideastern.\u201d The jury that tried and convicted Smith consisted of six Blacks, two Asians, one Latino and three whites; an alternate juror was Black. At oral argument we were told that the prosecutor did not use all her peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">Smith contends that the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges of six Black jurors itself established a <em>prima facie </em>case under <em>Batson </em>\u201cthat the prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race,\u201d which then shifted \u201cthe burden ... to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for challenging [B]lack jurors.\u201d 476 U.S. at 96-97. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">In <em>Wade v. Terhune, </em>we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of habeas in a similar case coming from California, because the convicted defendant had not \u201cshow[n] that the circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used a peremptory challenge to exclude a potential juror because of race.\u201d 202 F.3d 1190, 1198 (9th Cir. 2000). There the alleged <em>Batson </em>violation was the prosecution\u2019s peremptory challenge of Ms. Rutherford, the first of three Black jurors considered. Prior to challenging her, the prosecutor peremptorily challenged two non-Blacks. Subsequently, the prosecutor peremptorily challenged another Black, but the third one was seat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ed. We held that the convicted defendant had not \u201cmade a <em>prima facie </em>showing that Ms. Rutherford was peremptorily struck because of her race.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Although <em>Wade </em>is factually different from the present case, it shows that Smith\u2019s numerical analysis here does not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case that the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges of the Black jurors were based upon race. The jury ultimately selected had six Black jurors and three other members of racial minorities, and only three whites. This jury sharply contrasts with the situation in <em>Batson, </em>where \u201c[t]he prosecutor used his peremptory challenges to strike all four [Bjlack persons on the venire, and a jury composed only of white persons was selected.\u201d 476 U.S. at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The judgment of the district court denying the petition for habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b571-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
