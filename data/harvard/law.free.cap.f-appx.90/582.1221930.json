Mistu-rak\u2019s case was dismissed as a sanction for his failure to comply with the District Court\u2019s scheduling order by not appearing at the pretrial conference and by not submitting a pretrial memorandum. At the pretrial conference, the defendants made an oral motion to dismiss as a sanction pursuant to Rule 16(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The District Court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">We review for abuse of discretion a District Court\u2019s dismissal of an action for failure to comply with its orders. <em>See Emerson v. Thiel College, </em>296 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir.2002). Although we defer to the District Court\u2019s discretion, dismissal is appropriate only in \u201climited circumstances and doubts should be resolved in favor of reaching a decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court\u2019s approach to sanctions emphasizes that \u201cdismissal is a drastic sanction and should be reserved for those cases where there is a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Donnelly v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>677 F.2d 339, 342 (3d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">Before dismissing an action the District Court is required to make explicit findings regarding the factors enumerated in <em>Poul-is v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>747 F.2d 863 (3d Cir.1984). <em>See Emcasco Ins. Co. v. Sambrick, </em>834 F.2d 71, 74 (3d Cir. 1987). The <em>Poulis </em>factors the District Court must consider are: \u201c(1) the extent of the party\u2019s personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice to the adversary caused by the failure to meet scheduling orders ...; (3) a history of dilatoriness; (4) whether the conduct of the party ... was willful or in bad faith; (5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal, which entails an analysis of alternative sanctions; and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim.\u201d <em>Poulis, </em>747 F.2d at 868. This Court\u2019s function is to determine whether the District Court properly balanced the <em>Poulis </em>factors and whether the record supports its findings. <em>Livera v. First Nat. State Bank of New Jersey, </em>879 F.2d 1186, 1194 (3d Cir.1989)(citing <em>Hicks v. Feeney, </em>850 F.2d 152 (3d Cir.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-18\">In dismissing the complaint, the District Court did not conduct any <em>Poulis </em>analysis. We conclude that the District Court erred in dismissing Misturak\u2019s complaint without making the requisite findings. <em>Livera, </em>879 F.2d at 1193. Given the record presented,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we will not conduct our own <em>Poulis </em>test as it would require factual findings not within the parameters of our review. <em>See id. </em>at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>By failing to conduct a <em>Poulis </em>balancing test, the District Court abused its discretion thereby necessitating a remand to the District Court for consideration of the <em>Poulis </em>factors. <em>See id. </em>at 1188. Accordingly, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s order entered April 14, 2003 and remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-13\">. Neither party has presented this Court with its position concerning the application of the <em>Poulis </em>factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
