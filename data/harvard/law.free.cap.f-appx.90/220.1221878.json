Aguilar\u2019s motion to reopen was subsequently denied by the Immigration Judge and the BIA. While the denial of her motion to reopen was still pending on appeal before the BIA, Aguilar self-deported in 1997 to visit her ailing father in Guatemala. She reentered the United States seven days later using a multiple entry visa issued to her in 1988. Aguilar remained in the country, and on October 28, 2002, she was interviewed by an immigration officer in connection with her application for adjustment of status. When the officer discovered Aguilar\u2019s 1997 self-deportation and reentry, he reinstated her prior order <em>of </em>removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5). Aguilar appeals the reinstatement of her removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Aguilar argues that the Department of Homeland Security erred in applying the reinstatement statute, \u00a7 1231(a)(5), because she reentered the country upon authorization and inspection by an immigration official, and thus, did not reenter the United States \u201cunlawfully\u201d as required by the provision. However, under the express terms of the Agency\u2019s implementing regulations, a self-deported alien may not reenter for five years following deportation unless she has filed an 1-212 Form requesting the permission of the Attorney General, and has obtained his consent to reenter pursuant to this specified procedure. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2. Accordingly, we are compelled to conclude that, because Aguilar failed to obtain the consent of the Attorney General pursuant to the section 212.2 procedures, her use of a facially valid visa, her inspection by border officials, and the issuance to her of an 1-94 upon reentry did not make her entry lawful for purposes of \u00a7 1231(a)(5). <em>See United States v. Pina-Jaime, </em>332 F.3d 609, 611-612 (9th Cir.2003),</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Aguilar also argues that the reinstatement provision, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5), and the Agency\u2019s implementing regulation, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.8, violate due process. While the procedures for imposing reinstatement orders do raise substantial due process concerns, <em>see Castro-Cortez v. INS, </em>239 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir.2001), Aguilar cannot show that any procedural defect prejudiced her because she raises no factual dispute regarding the three relevant determinations underlying a reinstatement order. <em>Padilla v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 921, 924-25 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cAs a predicate to obtaining relief for a violation of procedural due process rights in immigration proceedings,\u201d an alien must \u201cdemonstrate a plausible ground for relief from deportation.\u201d) (internal citations omitted). Because Aguilar admits that (1) she is an alien (2) who was previously removed and (3) reentered without the \u201cconsent\u201d of the Attorney General, as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.2, a full hearing before an immigration judge \u201ccould not help her because those are the only three elements at issue in determining whether a reinstatement order is valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 925. Under these circumstances, we are compelled to reject Aguilar\u2019s argument that the reinstatement procedures violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">For the foregoing reasons, Aguilar\u2019s appeal of the \u00a7 1231(a)(5) reinstatement of her removal order is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
