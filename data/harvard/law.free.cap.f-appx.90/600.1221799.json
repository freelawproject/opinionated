Stat. \u00a7 951 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cthe PHRA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-20\">Parker was diagnosed with diabetes in 1993. She began working for the Port Authority as a bus operator trainee on March 15, 1999. After initial training and before entering a 90-probationary period, Parker received a copy of the Port Authority\u2019s Performance Code for Probationary Employees. The Performance Code sets out the Port Authority\u2019s attendance policy and outlines each action considered sufficient cause for a final written warning, suspension, or immediate discharge. Additionally, the Performance Code notes that \u201c[wjithin the first thirty (30) scheduled working days, all incident/occurrences may be viewed for possible disciplinary action up to and including discharge.\u201d Parker began her 90-day probationary period on May 16,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-21\">On May 18, 1999, the Port Authority learned that Parker had been involved in an incident during which she did not follow proper routing, became lost, and then failed to follow the proper procedure of reporting her location to the Traffic Division of the Port Authority and obtaining re-routing directions. Instead, Parker im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>properly obtained directions from the bus passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">On May 20, 1999, the Port Authority\u2019s Employee Relations Representative, the Director of Service Delivery for the Port Authority\u2019s Harmar Division, and an instructor met with Parker regarding the May 18th incident and issued a Final Written Warning in accordance with the Performance Code. On June 1, 1999, two complaints were lodged against Parker. One complaint alleged that Parker\u2019s bus missed a stop. The other complaint alleged that Parker\u2019s bus was 25 minutes late at a different stop. The next day, Parker met with Robin Rochez, her Port Authority supervisor, to discuss the complaints. Ro-chez retrained Parker on a variety of procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">On June 3, 1999, Parker called the Port Authority to report that she would not be at work. Parker spoke with Teenya McLellan (an instructor) and Tom Collins (a Harmar Supervisor), neither of whom was her supervisor. Parker stated that she was not feeling well because of her diabetes. When Rochez learned of this, she agreed that Parker should not report to work because, among other reasons, Rochez did not believe that it was safe for Parker to return until she had been cleared by the Port Authority\u2019s medical department. Parker asked Collins about the possibility of a light-duty position with the Port Authority. Collins followed up with Donna Lucas, the Employee Relations Representative. On the same day, Lucas informed Parker that light-duty positions were not available for probationary employees because those employees needed to work in the positions for which they were hired in order to be evaluated.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Also on June 3, the Port Authority informed Parker that she needed to obtain information from her doctor regarding her medical status in order to return to work. The Port Authority requested information to evaluate whether Parker\u2019s medical condition disqualified her from operating a bus. Approximately one week later, Parker faxed a note from her doctor indicating that she had an appointment on June 15, 1999. Several days after the fax was received, Parker still had not provided any medical documentation for her absences. Accordingly, the Port Authority gave her an authorization for the release of her medical records. After Parker failed to provide any information regarding her status, supervisors at the Port Authority scheduled a meeting with her to review her performance since her probationary period commenced. The meeting occurred on June 23, 1999. Due to Parker\u2019s overall unsatisfactory work performance and excessive, unexcused absenteeism, the Port Authority terminated her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">On October 8, 1999, Parker filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) alleging disability discrimination under the ADA and the PHRA. After receiving the EEOC\u2019s notice of dismissal and right to sue, Parker filed this action. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Port Authority, and the Court denied as moot Parker\u2019s motion to strike as inadmissible hearsay various assertions in the Port Authority\u2019s Statement of Material Facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">We exercise plenary review over a District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and therefore apply the same legal standards applied by the District Court. <em>Courson v. Bert Bell NFL Retirement Plan, </em>214 F.3d 136, 142 (3d Cir.2000). In evaluating the Port Authority\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to Parker and must decide whether the Port Authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ty was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, All </em>U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The ADA prohibits \u201cdiscrimination against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). To establish that she has a disability, Parker must show that: (i) she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of her major life activities; (ii) she has a record of such impairment; or (iii) she was \u201cregarded as\u201d having such an impairment by the Port Authority. <em>See Marinetti v. City of Erie, Pa., </em>216 F.3d 354, 359 (3d Cir.2000) (applying 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Parker\u2019s claims are based on diabetes, a condition with which she was diagnosed in 1993. Parker concedes that her diabetes was controlled and that it did not substantially limit a major life activity. Therefore, her claims are dependent on her ability to prove that the Port Authority regarded her as having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">To be \u201cdisabled\u201d under the \u201cregarded as\u201d portion of the ADA\u2019s definition of disability, Parker must demonstrate either that: (i) although she had no impairment at all, the Port Authority erroneously believed that she had an impairment that substantially limited major life activities; or (ii) she had a non-limiting impairment that the Port Authority mistakenly believed limited a major life activity. <em>See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Tice v. Ctr. Area Transp. Auth., </em>247 F.3d 506, 514 (3d Cir.2001). In either case, the definition of \u201csubstantially limits\u201d remains the same as it does in other parts of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To establish that the Port Authority believed her to be limited in the life activity of \u201cworking,\u201d \u201cworking\u201d must encompass \u201ceither a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities.\u201d <em>Sutton, </em>527 U.S. at 491, 119 S.Ct. 2139 (citation and internal quotations omitted); <em>accord Murphy v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>527 U.S. 516, 523, 119 S.Ct. 2133, 144 L.Ed.2d 484 (1999). Thus, \u201cto be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working, one must be regarded as precluded from more than a particular job.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>527 U.S. at 523, 119 S.Ct. 2133; <em>accord Sutton, </em>527 U.S. at 492, 119 S.Ct. 2139.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">In this case, the record, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Parker, is insufficient to show that the Port Authority regarded her \u201cas precluded from more than a particular job.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>527 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>U.S. at 523, 119 S.Ct. 2133. Parker relies heavily on Donna Lucas\u2019s alleged statement that Parker \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle the stress that goes along with the job.\u201d Parker suggests that Lucas\u2019s statement shows that Lucas regarded her as unable to perform \u201ca variety of jobs [that] involve stress, driving and the public.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 19. We reject this argument. While we give Parker the benefit of any reasonable inferences from the record, this argument draws inferences that are not reasonable. Lucas\u2019s statement cannot reasonably be interpreted to mean that she felt that Parker was incapable of performing all jobs that involved any degree of stress, any type or amount of driving, and any type or degree of interaction with the public. Rather, all that Lucas\u2019s statement may reasonably be interpreted to mean is that she did not think that Parker could handle the particular mix of stress, driving, and public interaction involved in the particular job of driving a bus. Considering Lucas\u2019s alleged statement and all of the other evidence on which Parker relies, we do not find sufficient evidence to support a regarded-as claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Parker argues that her regarded-as claim is supported by the Port Authority\u2019s insistence that she provide medical information before returning to work. Requiring an employee to \u201csubmit a medical release and be cleared by [her] physician\u201d is not evidence that an employer regards the employee as disabled. <em>See Somers v. City of Minneapolis, </em>245 F.3d 782, 788 (8th Cir.2001). As we noted in <em>Tice, </em>247 F.3d at 515, \u201can appropriately \u2014 tailored examination only establishes that the employer harbors <em>doubts </em>(not certainties) with respect to an employee\u2019s ability to perform a <em>particular </em>job\u201d (emphasis in original). \u201cDoubts alone do not demonstrate that the employee was held in any particular regard, and, as we have explained, inability to perform a particular job is not a disability within the meaning of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Therefore, the Port Authority\u2019s request for a medical excuse for Parker\u2019s absences does not indicate that the Port Authority regarded her as disabled, in violation of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">We have considered all of Parker\u2019s arguments, but we find no basis for reversal. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Port Authority is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-15\">. This Court\u2019s analysis regarding Parker\u2019s ADA claim is dispositive of her PHRA claim. <em>Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., </em>184 F.3d 296, 306 (3d Cir.1999) (\u201canalysis of an ADA claim applies equally to a PHRA claim\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\">. The plaintiffs in <em>Sutton </em>had vision impairments which were correctable by prescriptive glasses. The plaintiffs' vision problems caused them to be denied positions as commercial airline pilots. The plaintiffs sued under the ADA\u2019s \"regarded as\u201d prong, and the Supreme Court denied their claim, <em>inter alia, </em>because \"if jobs utilizing an individual\u2019s skill (but not his or her unique talents) are available, one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs. Similarly, if a host of different jobs are available, one is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.\u201d <em>Sutton, </em>527 U.S. at 492, 119 S.Ct. 2139.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b643-13\">. The EEOC regulations also allow for an individual to establish that s/he is \"regarded as\" disabled if s/he \"[h]as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(1)(2). \"These mispercep-tions often \u2019resul[t] from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of ... individual ability.'\u201d <em>See Sutton, </em>527 U.S. at 490, 119 S.Ct. 2139 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(7)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b644-5\">. We do not find the EEOC Policy Statement on which Parker relies (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 24) to be apposite. There, the employee was regarded as incapable performing any job requiring the ability to work well with the pub-lie. Here, Lucas\u2019s statement may not reasonably be read as expressing any similar view about Parker\u2019s abilities. Instead, Lucas allegedly referred just to the job of driving a bus.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
