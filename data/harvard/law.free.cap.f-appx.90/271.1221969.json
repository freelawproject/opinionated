We deny the petition for review. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-24\">The IJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. The harm suffered by Ontimare was not sufficient to constitute past persecution within the meaning of immigration law. Being subjected to a work dress code \u2014 the only harm that arguably has a governmental nexus \u2014 does not qualify as persecution. Because she did not suffer past persecution, she is not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). The record supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Ontimare\u2019s testimony and the background materials she submitted did not demonstrate a reasonable possibility that her life or freedom would be threatened by a return to the Philippines. Because Ontimare has failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she has failed to meet the \u201cmore stringent\u201d standard for withholding of removal. <em>Al-Harbi v.
