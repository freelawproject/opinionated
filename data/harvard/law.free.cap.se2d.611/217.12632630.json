Harper, Jr., and Digestive Diseases Diagnostic Center, P.A.). Defendant (Dr. Robert N. Harper, Jr.) appeals from the trial court's dismissal of his counterclaims. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The relevant factual and procedural background is summarized as follows: On 7 January 2000 plaintiff Carol Iadanza (Iadanza) consulted defendant Dr. Robert Harper (Harper), for treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thereafter, Harper provided medical care to plaintiff; the parties agree they had a physician-patient relationship, but disagree on its duration. The parties also agree that there were non-professional interactions between them. However, plaintiff and defendants are in sharp disagreement on key issues, including: who initiated the non-professional contacts; their respective personal hopes for a romantic or sexual relationship; the extent of their interactions; and which of them \"pursued\" the other. Iadanza generally alleges that during the time she was Harper's patient he persistently sought a sexual relationship with her, as demonstrated by his phone calls; his insistence on private meetings; his sexual advances and remarks; and his giving plaintiff a glass of drugged wine. Harper admits that the two had a \"friendly non-professional relationship,\" but denies any romantic interest in Iadanza, and asserts that she was the one who pursued a sexual relationship, which he consistently rebuffed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 27 February 2003, Iadanza filed suit against defendants seeking compensatory and punitive damages for professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. On 10 March 2003, defendants filed an answer denying the material allegations of Iadanza's complaint. Harper also asserted counterclaims against Iadanza and her husband Anthony Iadanza seeking compensatory and punitive damages for slander\n   <em>\n    per se,\n   </em>\n   unfair and deceptive trade practices, civil conspiracy, facilitation of fraud, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process. Plaintiff replied, denying all material allegations and moving for dismissal of defendant's counterclaims. Thereafter, defendants moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of actual damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 13 February 2004 the trial court ruled on the parties' pretrial motions, in an order stating in relevant part that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [1] Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary judgment on the issue of actual damages with respect to each and every claim for relief set forth in the Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is ALLOWED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [2] Counter Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Counterclaimant's Robert N. Harper, Jr., M.D. counterclaims is ALLOWED as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [a] The counterclaim for slander\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   is dismissed as barred by the one year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [b] The counterclaim for unfair and deceptive trade practice is dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [c] The counterclaim for malicious prosecution is dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to allege special damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [d] The counterclaim for abuse of process is dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to allege a wrongful act was committed by the Counter Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [e] The counterclaim for civil conspiracy is dismissed because said counterclaim is a derivative claim and fails as the underlying tort claims fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [f] The counterclaim for facilitation of fraud is dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   From this order the parties appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Appeal from Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff Carol Iadanza appeals from the trial court's award of summary judgment in favor of defendants on her claim for compensatory damages. She argues that the trial court erred in ordering summary judgment because the evidence raises genuine issues of material fact on the issue of compensatory damages. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Summary judgment is properly granted if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a\n   matter of law.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2003). In ruling on summary judgment:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   a court does not resolve questions of fact but determines whether there is a genuine issue of material fact....

This issue is not properly before this Court. Defendants moved for partial summary judgment only on plaintiff's claim for compensatory damages, and the trial court's order was confined to a ruling on that issue. The adequacy of plaintiff's complaint to state claims for infliction of emotional distress was neither raised at the trial level nor assigned as error on appeal. \"[Defendant] raise[s] th[ese] issue[s] for the first time on appeal to this Court.

Review of defendant's counterclaim reveals no allegations of any\n   <strong>\n    oral\n   </strong>\n   defamation, or slander, occurring after 10 March 2002. Indeed, the counterclaim includes only one allegation of behavior that is arguably within the statute of limitations:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   32. In the fall of 2002, Dr. Harper's partner began receiving unsigned letters advising him that he had made a mistake entering into a partnership with Dr. Harper and should reconsider that partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The parties have presented arguments about whether other paragraphs of defendant's counterclaim sufficiently attribute the anonymous letter-writing to the Iadanzas, and on whether the written statement, that Harper's partner had \"made a mistake\" by going into business with Harper, can be considered defamatory. We conclude that there is no need to address these issues. Paragraph 32 refers\n   <strong>\n    only\n   </strong>\n   to \"unsigned letters\" and not to\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   spoken or oral communication. Regardless of their content, \"unsigned letters\" cannot constitute\n   <strong>\n    slander\n   </strong>\n   because they are written rather than spoken.

As we are upholding the trial court's dismissal of defendant's counterclaims, we have no occasion to rule on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the trial court erred by not dismissing defendant's \"counterclaim\" for punitive damages. We agree. \"As a general rule, `[p]unitive damages do not and cannot exist as an independent cause of action, but are mere incidents of the cause of action[.] ... If the injured party has no cause of action independent of a supposed right to recover punitive damages, then he has no cause of action at all.' North Carolina follows this general rule of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8527942\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/101/529/#p532\">\n    101 N.C.App. at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20S.E.2d%20472\">\n    400 S.E.2d at 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting J. Stein,\n   <em>\n    Damages and Recovery\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 195 at 389 (1972)). In the instant case, the trial court properly dismissed defendant's counterclaims. Accordingly, defendant has no basis on which to claim punitive damages. We conclude the trial court's order should be reversed and remanded for dismissal of defendant's \"counterclaim\" for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We conclude the trial court erred by granting partial summary judgment in favor of defendants on the issue of compensatory damages; that the trial court did not err by dismissing defendant's counterclaims; and that the trial court erred by not dismissing defendant's claim for punitive damages. Accordingly, the trial court's order is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Affirmed in part, and reversed and remanded in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Judges TIMMONS-GOODSON and HUDSON concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Defendant did not assign error to the court's dismissal of his other claims, for facilitation of fraud and abuse of process, and any issues pertaining to those dismissals are deemed abandoned.
