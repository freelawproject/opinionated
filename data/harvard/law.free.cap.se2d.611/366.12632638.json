Each of the children was born in Virginia and adopted pursuant to judgments issued by courts of competent jurisdiction in other states. The three sets of adoptive parents are each \"same-sex\" adoptive parents. None of the seven petitioners resides in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioners sought the issuance of new birth certificates listing both adoptive parents on each certificate pursuant to Code \u00a7 32.1-261. Deborah Little-Bowser, Registrar of Vital Records and Health Statistics (\"Registrar\"), refused their requests. Petitioners filed a Bill of Complaint and Petition for Writ of Mandamus against the Registrar and Robert B. Stroube, State Health Commissioner (\"Commissioner\"), in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, seeking a declaration that the Registrar and the Commissioner\n   must issue such new birth certificates and requesting the issuance of a writ of mandamus or an injunction to enforce the declaration. The trial court decided the issues on cross-motions for summary judgment, granting the motions of the Registrar and Commissioner and denying the motions of the Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. Proceedings Below\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Katherine Anne Fisher Davenport was born in Arlington, Virginia on March 26, 1990 and a birth certificate was issued. Timothy M. Fisher is her biological father and has not been divested of his parental rights. The parental rights of the biological mother were terminated by order dated April 13, 1990. W. Scott Davenport filed a petition to adopt Katherine in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia and a Decree of Adoption was entered on April 19, 1992. After providing a certified copy of the adoption decree to the Registrar and requesting the issuance of a new birth certificate, the Registrar issued a new birth certificate that listed only Mr. Davenport as Katherine's father and excluded any mention of Mr. Fisher, who is the biological father. Efforts to have yet another birth certificate issued have been rejected by the Registrar and the Department of Health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cameron Fredrick Fisher Davenport was born on May 18, 1992, in Arlington, Virginia and a birth certificate was issued. Mr. Fisher is his biological father and has not been divested of his parental rights. The parental rights of the biological mother were terminated by order dated May 20, 1992. Mr. Davenport filed a petition to adopt Cameron in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia and a Decree of Adoption was entered on August 6, 1993.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 16, 2000, the Superior Court for the District of Columbia issued Amended Final Decrees of Adoption for both Katherine and Cameron. In each decree, the court found that the child had been in the \"legal care, custody and control of the natural father,\" and that adoption by Mr. Davenport would be \"for the best interests of the adoptee.\" Upon receipt of the Amended Final Decrees of Adoption, the Registrar issued new birth certificates for Katherine and Cameron each indicating Mr. Davenport as \"father\" and excluding Mr. Fisher, despite his status as biological father who has not been divested of custody or parental rights. Requests to have new birth certificates issued to reflect both adoptive parents on the certificates have been refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hillary Anne Dalton-Moffit was born in Arlington, Virginia on August 15, 1991 and a birth certificate was issued. On September 19, 1995, the Superior Court for the District of Columbia entered a Final Decree of Adoption \"establishing the relationship of parents and child for all purposes\" between Mark M. Dalton, Bruce H. Moffit, and Hillary. After providing proof of the adoption, Mr. Dalton requested that the Registrar issue a new birth certificate listing both Mr. Moffit and Mr. Dalton as parents. His request was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   John Doe was born on February 27, 1999, in Falls Church, Virginia and a birth certificate was issued. On December 23, 1999, an order of adoption was entered in the Family Court of Dutchess County, New York, decreeing Jean Doe and Jane Doe to be the adoptive parents of John Doe. After providing proof of the adoption, Jane Doe requested the issuance of a new birth certificate reflecting both adoptive parents' names. Her request was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B. Proceedings Below\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Petitioners filed a bill of complaint and petition for writ of mandamus against the Registrar and the Commissioner contending that the refusal to provide new birth certificates listing the names of both adoptive parents in each case violates Code \u00a7\u00a7 32.1-261(A) and 8.01-389,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201738\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), and both the Full Faith and Credit Clause of Article IV, Section 1, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. They sought an injunction or writ of mandamus requiring the Commonwealth to issue the requested birth certificates, a declaration that the Commonwealth's conduct was unlawful, nominal damages, and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Commonwealth filed a demurrer, which was subsequently denied, and then an answer. After discovery, Petitioners moved for summary judgment and the Commonwealth filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Both parties submitted briefs to the trial court. After oral argument, the trial court granted the Commonwealth's motion for summary judgment and denied Petitioners' motion for summary judgment. In its final order, the trial court held that \"there is no issue of material fact\" and that the Commonwealth was \"entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Petitioners filed a timely petition for appeal. We granted three assignments of error: whether the trial court's grant of summary judgment violated \"the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Article 4, Section 1 of the United States Constitution [sic], and Section 8.01-389 of the Virginia Code [sic]\"; whether the trial court's grant of summary judgment was contrary \"to Section 32.1-261(A) of the Virginia Code [sic]\"; and whether the trial court's denial of the Petitioners'\"Motion for Summary Judgment Interprets Virginia Law So As to Deny [Petitioners] the Equal Protection of the Laws.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The three assignments of error are questions of law which we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Wilby v.

Because Petitioners argue that Virginia law requires the Commonwealth to issue a new birth certificate listing both adoptive parents in each case, we will consider this assignment of error first.\n   <em>\n    See Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Smit,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"622335\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/266/444/#p454\">\n    266 Va. 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 454,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=587%20S.E.2d%20526\">\n    587 S.E.2d 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532 (2003) (it is an \"established principle of constitutional law that a court will not rule upon the constitutionality of a statute unless such a determination is absolutely necessary to decide the merits of the case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B. Issuance of Birth Certificates Under Virginia Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In its ruling, the trial court gave two reasons for granting the Commonwealth's motion for summary judgment. First, the trial court held that \"under current Virginia law, birth certificates can only list the name of a mother and a father. Birth certificates cannot list the names of two mothers or the names of two fathers. It just cannot be done.\" Second, the trial court held that \"what [it] is being asked to do in directing the registrar to change the birth certificates, in spite of the language that the [Petitioners] try to couch their argument in, is asking [it] to recognize a status that Virginia does not accord to its own citizens.\" In support of this second reason, the trial court stated that Petitioners were asking it \"to do something which the public policy of Virginia just simply does not allow. Whether that is right or whether that is wrong, is not for this [court] to determine. It is something that needs to be addressed by the legislature, if it is addressed at all.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the outset, it is important to state what this case is not about. There was much discussion in the trial court, and some before this Court, concerning homosexual marriage. This case is about issuing birth certificates under the provisions of Virginia law; it is not about homosexual marriage, nor is it about \"same-sex\" relationships, nor is it about adoption policy in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The primary statutory provision governing the issuance of a new Virginia birth certificate upon proof of adoption, legitimation, or determination of paternity is Code \u00a7 32.1-261. When issuing a new birth certificate,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The State Registrar shall establish a new certificate of birth for a person born in this Commonwealth upon receipt of the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   An adoption report as provided in \u00a7 32.1-262, a report of adoption prepared and filed in accordance with the laws of another state or foreign country, or a certified copy of the decree of adoption together with the information necessary to identify the original certificate of birth and to establish a new certificate of birth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Code \u00a7 32.1-261(A)(1). The relevant Administrative Code section promulgated to carry out this statutory provision states,\n   The new certificate of birth prepared after adopting . . . shall be on the form in use at the time of birth and shall include the following items and such other information necessary to complete the certificate:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   . . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The names and personal particulars of the adoptive parents or of the natural parents, whichever is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   12 VAC \u00a7 5-550-330. In both of these provisions, and in the other provisions concerning adoption and the issuance of new birth certificates, the term \"adoptive parents\" or \"intended parents\" is used.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 32.1-261(A)(3); Code \u00a7 32.1-261(A)(4); and 12 VAC \u00a7 5-550-280. No definition is provided for these terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In its brief and in much of its oral argument, the Commonwealth argued that \"this Court should defer to the Executive Branch's interpretation unless that interpretation is patently unreasonable and represents an abuse of discretion\" and that \"[i]t is well established that the interpretation of the agency entrusted with the administration of a statute is entitled to deference by this [C]ourt.\" In support of these contentions, the Commonwealth cites\n   <em>\n    Department of Taxation v.

Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632447\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/608/901/#p313\">\n    269 Va. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632447\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/608/901/#p313\">\n    608 S.E.2d 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904 (2005). Only when the statute is obscure or its meaning doubtful will courts defer to an administrative interpretation. In such circumstances, as in the tax cases cited by the Commonwealth, courts will generally give great weight to the administrative interpretations of statutory provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In this case, we are presented with a statutory scheme and regulations promulgated pursuant to that scheme. Neither the statute nor the regulations define \"adoptive parents.\" Stated differently, there is nothing in the statutory scheme that precludes recognition of same-sex couples as \"adoptive parents.\" The statute does not refer to a listing of a \"mother\" or a \"father;\" rather, it refers only to the undefined term \"adoptive parents\" and \"intended parents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Commonwealth advances several arguments in support of its contention that issuance of a new birth certificate listing the names of the adoptive parents in these cases is not required or authorized by statute. For each of the arguments, the Commonwealth uses administrative regulations in an attempt to interpret Code \u00a7 32.1-261.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Commonwealth's first statutory interpretation argument involves 12 VAC \u00a7 5-550-100 involving a certificate of live birth and 12 VAC \u00a7 5-550-330 concerning the issuance of a new certificate after, among other circumstances, adoption. The Commonwealth reasons that a certificate of live birth provides for listing of a mother and a father and a new certificate \"shall be on the form in use at the time of birth.\" 12 VAC \u00a7 5-550-330. The Commonwealth argues that Code \u00a7 32.1-261(B) provides that \"[w]hen a new certificate of birth is established pursuant to subsection A of this section ... [i]t shall be substituted for the original certificate of birth.\" Because the statute requires \"substitution\" and the certificate of live birth provides for a listing of a mother and a father, any new certificate \"on the same form in use at the time of birth\" is inadequate to list two same-sex adoptive parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   However, the Commonwealth's restrictive definition is undermined by its own administrative regulations. The provisions of 12 VAC \u00a7 5-550-330 further require that the new certificate of birth \"shall include ... the names and personal particulars of the adoptive parents or of the natural parents, whichever is appropriate.\" Clearly, the statute, Code \u00a7 32.1-261, anticipates the listing of adoptive parents without specific restrictions. Further, the administrative regulations plainly require the listing of adoptive parents without restriction. The only perceived impediment\n   is the Commonwealth's insistence upon utilization of a particular form adopted by the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Here, the Commonwealth's reliance upon a restrictive interpretation of the word \"substitution\" or \"substitute\" is misplaced. The Commonwealth insists on brief that the word \"substitute\" is a verb. We will treat it as such. To \"substitute\" means \"to put in the place of another; exchange.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2280 (1993). The restrictive use of a particular form by the agency for live births and the administrative requirement that such a form also be used for new certificates after adoption is contrary to the ordinary and plain language of Code \u00a7 32.1-261, and the agency's own regulations, 12 VAC \u00a7 5-550-330. Nothing in the statute requires a particular form and the regulations only require that the \"names and particulars of the adoptive parents\" be placed on the form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Additionally, the Commonwealth argues that its restrictive interpretation should be adopted because it is consistent with Code \u00a7 63.2-1201, which limits the filing of an adoption petition to single individuals or to married couples. However, this case does not involve Virginia adoptions. Rather, this case involves out-of-state adoptions and the issuance of new certificates of birth for children born in the Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We need not address federal constitutional or statutory issues in this case because we hold that a proper interpretation of Code \u00a7 32.1-261 requires that the Registrar issue a new certificate of birth listing both of the adoptive parents in each of the cases before us. The sole issue in this case is the enforcement of the directive of the General Assembly concerning the issuance of new certificates of birth upon receipt of notice of an out-of-state adoption. Just as we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the General Assembly, neither can an agency of the executive branch of government. Code \u00a7 32.1-261 provides that a new certificate of birth shall be given upon application when there has been receipt of an out-of-state judgment or decree of adoption of a child born in the Commonwealth. Pursuant to statute, the issuance of the new certificate of birth is to include \"the names of the intended parents.\" Pursuant to administrative regulation, the new certificate of birth should include \"the names and personal particulars of the adoptive parents or the natural parents, whichever is appropriate.\" The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Registrar. The judgment of the trial court will be reversed and the case will be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion and for the issuance of appropriate relief to the Petitioners herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Chief Justice HASSELL, with whom Senior Justice COMPTON joins, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   I respectfully dissent from the opinion of the majority. The laws of Virginia simply do not require that the Registrar of Vital Records and Health Statistics issue a birth certificate that identifies two people of the same gender as the parents of a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Code \u00a7 32.1-261 authorizes the Registrar to issue a new certificate of birth for a person born in this Commonwealth upon the satisfaction of several conditions, including an adoption. The Registrar issued the following regulation pursuant to Code \u00a7 32.1-269(A). Regulation 12 VAC 5-550-330 states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \"12 VAC 5-550-330. New certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"The new certificate of birth prepared after adopting, legitimation, court determination of paternity, or acknowledgement of paternity shall be on the form in use at the time of birth and shall include the following items and such other information necessary to complete the certificate:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \"1. The name of the child;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \"2. The date and place of birth as transcribed from the original certificate;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \"3. The names and personal particulars of the adoptive parents or of the natural parents, whichever is appropriate;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \"4. The name of the attendant, printed or typed;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"5. The birth number assigned to the original birth certificate;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \"6. The original filing date. The information necessary to locate the existing certificate and to complete the new certificate shall be submitted on forms prescribed by the State Registrar.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Among other things, the Regulation requires that the Registrar issue the new certificate of birth \"on the form in use at the time of [the adopted child's] birth,\" and the form must include the names and personal particulars of the adoptive parents or of the natural parents, whichever is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The form that was in use when the youngest of the adopted children in the case before this Court was born is set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   NOTE: OPINION CONTAINING TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This form is identical in all pertinent respects to the forms that were used when the other adopted children involved in the appeal were born.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   There is no designation on the form that will permit the Registrar to issue a birth certificate that contains the names of two mothers of a child or the names of two fathers of a child. The General Assembly, when it enacted Code \u00a7 32.1-261(A), never contemplated that it had authorized the Registrar to issue a birth certificate that identifies two men as the parents of a child or two women as the parents of a child. Additionally, the Regulation does not contemplate such result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Petitioners assert \"[t]here is nothing in [the Regulation] that precludes the inclusion in the birth certificate of information-such as the name of a second mother or father-in addition to that specified on the form.\" However, the dispositive question is not whether the Regulation bars the issuance of the requested birth certificates. The pertinent inquiry is whether the Regulation mandates the issuance of the requested birth certificates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Petitioners do not, in their assignments of error, challenge the validity of the Regulation. Petitioners do not assert that the Registrar lacked the authority to promulgate the Regulation. Therefore, I am compelled to apply this Regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Registrar has opined that the Regulation, which I note was properly promulgated, does not require the issuance of a birth certificate to two people of the same gender who adopted a child outside of the Commonwealth. This Court has consistently held that an administrative agency's decision is entitled to great weight and deference.\n   <em>\n    See Carr v.
