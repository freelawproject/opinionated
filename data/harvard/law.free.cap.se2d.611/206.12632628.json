Boyd,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2569213\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/321/574/#p577\">\n    321 N.C. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20S.E.2d%20118\">\n    364 S.E.2d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119 (1988). In this appeal from his convictions on possession of cocaine and being an habitual felon, Defendant David Kinnard Stevenson contends that evidence of prior incidents was not sufficiently similar or proximate to the present offense to show intent, knowledge, or a common plan under Rule 404(b). Because we find that notable similarities and temporal proximity exist between the offense being appealed and the prior incidents, we affirm Defendant's convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reflects that, on 12 November 2002, Defendant stood with several other men, including Nathaniel Galloway, on premises of the Winston-Salem Housing Authority. Noticing the men, Winston-Salem police officers patrolling the area in an unmarked vehicle exited their vehicle to speak to the men. But upon seeing the officers approach them, the men ran, leading the officers to chase Defendant and Galloway, with whom they were \"very familiar\" and who were on a list of persons banned from Winston-Salem Housing Authority property. During the chase, the officers observed Galloway throw something to Defendant. They also observed that Defendant had a plastic bag in his hands, which he ripped open while running. Ultimately, the officers apprehended Defendant and found on his person, a bag of marijuana, a bag with cocaine residue, and $304 in cash. The officers then traced Defendant's path and found a plastic bag and crack cocaine on the ground. The record reflects that Defendant, after having been given his Miranda warning, confessed that the marijuana and plastic bag found on his person were his, but he denied that the materials found on the ground were his.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant was indicted and tried for possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine and being an habitual felon. At trial, the court held a hearing on a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   regarding the admissibility of proposed testimony by Officer Delray Anthony about Defendant's prior criminal activities. The State sought to admit the testimony to show \"modus operandi, intent, knowledge of the substance, and probably common plan or scheme[.]\" Defense counsel argued that the prior incidents were not sufficiently similar to the offense for which Defendant was being tried, that the prior incidents did not demonstrate sale of cocaine and thus could not show intent to sell, and that, even if the prior incidents were sufficiently similar to be admissible, their probative value was outweighed by their prejudicial effect. The trial court held that the testimony was admissible and gave the jury a limiting instruction that the testimony regarding the prior incidents\n   could be used only to show intent, knowledge, and existence of a common plan involving the crime charged in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 15 October 2003, a jury found Defendant guilty of possession with intent to sell, and Defendant was sentenced to 120 to 153 months imprisonment. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting testimony by Officer Delray Anthony regarding two incidents of Defendant's prior criminal activities. First, Officer Anthony testified that on 28 August 1996, he saw Defendant on premises of the Winston-Salem Housing Authority; Defendant ran, was chased, and was apprehended; Defendant was found to have approximately thirty rocks of crack cocaine on his person. Second, Officer Anthony testified that on 23 July 1997, he observed Defendant on premises of the Winston-Salem Housing Authority, where he had been banned. When Officer Anthony approached Defendant, Defendant ran and threw something in a trash can; Defendant was apprehended, and in Defendant's path, a bag containing rocks of crack cocaine and a handgun were found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant argues that the prior incidents were irrelevant and not sufficiently similar to the present offense to show intent, knowledge, or a common plan under North Carolina General Statute section 8C-1, Rule 404(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rule 404(b) states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.
