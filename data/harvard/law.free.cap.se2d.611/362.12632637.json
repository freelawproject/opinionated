The question arose from an incident occurring on October 1, 2000, when the defendant, Tarik Hasan Hudgins, pushed eleven-year-old Benjamin S. Brinkley (Benjamin) from his bicycle and took the bicycle from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   An indictment returned by a grand jury charged that the defendant \"did rob [Benjamin] of U.S Currency or other personal property, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58.\" In a bench trial, the defendant was acquitted of robbery. Ten days later, a grand jury returned an indictment charging that the defendant \"did steal property having a value of five dollars ($5) or more from the person of [Benjamin], in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant moved to dismiss the second indictment on the ground of former jeopardy because of his prior acquittal of robbery involving the same bicycle.
