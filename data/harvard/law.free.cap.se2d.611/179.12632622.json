Because we have concluded that competent evidence supports the trial court's determination that defendants have sufficient minimum contacts with North Carolina to meet the requirements of due process, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Banc of America Securities LLC (\"BAS\") is incorporated in Delaware, but has its principal place of business in Charlotte, North Carolina. Over the course of 2002, BAS entered into a series of contracts to provide assistance with the restructuring of debt for defendant Evergreen International Aviation, Inc. (\"Evergreen\") and its subsidiaries, defendants Evergreen International Airlines, Inc. (\"EIA\"), Evergreen Agricultural Enterprises, Inc. (\"EAE\"), Evergreen Air Center, Inc. (\"EAC\"), Evergreen Aircraft Sales &amp; Leasing Co. (\"EASL\"), Evergreen Aviation Ground Logistics Enterprise, Inc. (\"EAGLE\"), and Evergreen Helicopters, Inc. (\"Helicopters\"). A seventh subsidiary, defendant Quality Aviation Services, Inc. (\"Quality\"), has merged into Helicopters and no longer exists independently. Evergreen, EIA, EAE, and Helicopters are all Oregon corporations headquartered in Oregon. EAC, while incorporated in Oregon, has its\n   principal place of business in Arizona. EASL and EAGLE are incorporated in Nevada and Delaware, respectively, with their principal places of business in Oregon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BAS sued defendants in Mecklenburg County Superior Court for breach of contract and quantum meruit. Defendants collectively moved to dismiss the action under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of personal jurisdiction and under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for relief. Alternatively, defendants moved pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-75.12(a) (2003) for a stay of further proceedings based on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   and, in accordance with the statute, stipulated to suit in Oregon, New York, or Washington, D.C. In support of this motion, defendants submitted the affidavit of Timothy G. Wahlberg, President of Evergreen. BAS responded by filing the affidavit of Kurt C. Brechnitz, Vice President of BAS' Restructuring Advisory Group. Mr. Wahlberg subsequently submitted a second affidavit addressing assertions made by Mr. Brechnitz. On 18 November 2003, Judge Yvonne M. Evans entered an order denying defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants appealed the denial of their motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Although the order denying the motion to dismiss is an interlocutory order, defendants' interlocutory appeal of the trial court's Rule 12(b)(2) decision is proper under N.C.

According to Mr. Brechnitz' affidavit, defendants - through their CEO - initiated contact with BAS' Restructuring Advisory Group (\"the Group\"), which has a single office located in Charlotte, North Carolina. The affidavits submitted by defendants did not dispute this assertion by Mr.\n   Brechnitz. Subsequently, defendants forwarded various corporate documents to the Group's office in North Carolina for review prior to the Group's agreeing to accept the engagement. As a result of the initial contact and the subsequent document review, BAS and defendants entered into three contracts (in April, July, and October) that were set forth in letter agreements sent from and signed by the Group in North Carolina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants offered evidence in the form of Mr. Wahlberg's affidavit that \"it was represented to Evergreen that all of the work in connection with that contract would be performed by BAS personnel working out of Evergreen's headquarters in McMinnville, Oregon or out of New York City....\" Nevertheless, Mr. Brechnitz' affidavit stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To the best of my knowledge, no such representation was ever made by BAS' representatives to Defendants. More importantly, any such representation would not make sense because the Group was located in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Defendants hired Charlotte law firms to assist in the debt restructuring efforts. In fact, all of the significant work performed by BAS for Defendants was performed in Charlotte, North Carolina with Defendants' knowledge. I routinely discussed the progress of our work with Defendants' representatives by telephone or e-mail from my office in Charlotte, North Carolina. To the best of my knowledge, Defendants never complained or objected that the work was being substantially performed in North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   By describing the various tasks actually performed in North Carolina, Mr. Brechnitz' affidavit also provided evidence that the Group performed the work required under the July and October contracts primarily in North Carolina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We believe that this evidence parallels the evidence found sufficient in\n   <em>\n    Tom Togs.\n   </em>\n   BAS' evidence indicates that defendants solicited the Group in North Carolina to perform services for it, BAS agreed to do so in North Carolina, and the contracts were substantially performed in North Carolina.
