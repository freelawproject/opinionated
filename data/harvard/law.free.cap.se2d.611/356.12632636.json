The Court of Appeals of Virginia transferred the appeals to this Court pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-677.1. In addition to assigning error to the rulings of the circuit court, XL asserted that the Court of Appeals improperly transferred the appeals to this Court. We conclude that jurisdiction is in the Court of Appeals because XL's ability to file its civil actions against VDOT required compliance with the administrative provisions for claims resolution set out in Code \u00a7 33.1-386, and, therefore, the cases are appeals from a final decision of a circuit court \"on appeal from ... a decision of an administrative agency.\" Code \u00a7 17.1-405(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bravos Concrete, Inc. (Bravos) contracted with VDOT to perform two public construction contracts, one in Chesterfield County and the other in York County. XL was the surety for payment and performance bonds on both contracts. Bravos defaulted on the construction projects, and VDOT required that XL complete the unfinished work. XL and VDOT executed takeover agreements for both projects, and XL completed the projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   XL submitted a demand for payment of the costs of repairing work allegedly not completed or defectively completed by Bravos but for which Bravos had been paid. XL pursued its claims in accord with the provisions of Code \u00a7 33.1-386. Following a hearing, the Deputy Commissioner denied XL's claims. XL then filed two motions for judgment, one for each construction project, in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. The motions for judgment contained two counts, each asserting a claim based on breach of the construction contract by VDOT.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   XL did not allege breach of the takeover agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   VDOT filed pleas of sovereign immunity and motions to dismiss in each case arguing that there was no express contract between VDOT and XL and, therefore, XL was not entitled to the waiver of sovereign immunity for contract disputes. XL argued that its actions were not barred by sovereign immunity because the bonds and construction contracts constituted an express contract between XL and VDOT or, alternatively, that XL, as subrogee, assumed the status of the contractor, Bravos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following briefing and oral argument, the trial court issued a letter opinion and entered an order in each case sustaining VDOT's pleas of sovereign immunity and granting VDOT's motions to dismiss. XL filed motions asking the circuit court to reconsider its rulings, or, in the alternative, to grant XL leave to amend the motions for judgment to include allegations of breach of the takeover agreements. The circuit court denied these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   XL filed notices of appeal in each case with the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals\n   combined the two appeals, and,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte,\n   </em>\n   transferred the case to this Court stating that it \"does not have jurisdiction.\" XL filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   XL raises six assignments of error. Before we can address those assignments of error dealing with the actions of the trial court, we must resolve a threshold issue raised by XL. XL asserts that jurisdiction of this appeal lies with the Court of Appeals, not this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over appeals from a circuit court in cases that were appeals \"from ... a decision of an administrative agency.\" Code \u00a7 17.1-405(1).

Thus, if XL's right to file the instant action was dependent on invoking the administrative review procedures of Code \u00a7 33.1-386, jurisdiction of this appeal lies in the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Code \u00a7 33.1-387 provides in pertinent part\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As to such portion of the claim as is denied by the Commonwealth Transportation Commissioner, the contractor may institute a civil action for such sum as he claims to be entitled to under the contract for himself ... by the filing of a petition in the Circuit Court ....

XL replies that it was a contractor with VDOT by virtue of the \"tripartite agreement\" arising from the performance bond and the construction contract. XL acknowledges that neither the construction contract nor the performance bond is a direct contract between XL and the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, citing cases in which this Court has discussed such \"tripartite agreements,\" XL concludes that a \"direct contractual relationship\" exists between XL and VDOT.

XL's \"tripartite agreement\" theory is insufficient to make XL a contractor with VDOT for purposes of Code \u00a7 33.1-387 and thus subject to the administrative process requirements of Code \u00a7 33.1-386.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   XL also asserted that it qualified as a \"contractor\" based on the doctrine of equitable subrogation. As a performing surety, XL maintains that the doctrine of equitable subrogation placed it \"in the shoes\" of Bravos and thus, in the posture of \"contractor\" in the construction contract between Bravos and VDOT. To address XL's argument we first review the doctrine of equitable subrogation as it applies to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Equitable subrogation is subrogation that arises by operation of law. It is not based on contract or privity of parties, but is \"purely equitable in nature, dependent on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    Centreville Car Care, Inc. v.

When a principal defaults on a contract guaranteed by a performance or payment bond and the surety performs on the bond, principles of surety law and the doctrine of equitable subrogation impose certain rights and duties running between the surety, principal, and obligor, and allow the surety to enforce such rights and duties.\n   <em>\n    See Dickenson v.

The surety, however, does not actually \"step into the shoes of\" the principal because, by defaulting, the principal lost the right to enforce the contract provisions. For example, if a contractor defaults on a bonded construction contract, a performing surety may recover retainage held by the owner even though the contractor could not recover such retainage.\n   <em>\n    See International Fidelity Ins.

And this Court has held that a surety could recover amounts improperly paid by the owner to the contractor because \"[w]hen the surety is required to make reimbursements for a loss occasioned by the default of the principal, it has a right to require the owners to show how and in what manner they have performed their part of the contract.... The obligee in the bond is not only required to exercise good faith with the surety at the time the obligations are assumed, but this good faith must be kept inviolate in all subsequent transactions affecting their rights and obligations created by the contract and the bond.\"\n   <em>\n    Plank &amp; Whitsett, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4859352\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/159/1/#p10\">\n    159 Va. at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=165%20S.E.%20660\">\n    165 S.E. at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   These examples of the application of equitable subrogation show that the rights assumed by the surety when the surety has\n   performed its obligations under the bond allow the surety to assert claims based on the underlying construction contract which, for various reasons, the contractor could not assert. Thus, because a surety claiming equitable subrogation is entitled, under certain circumstances, to enforce contractual claims beyond those the contractor could raise, a surety does not simply \"step into the shoes of\" the contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We have not previously considered whether a surety advancing a claim relating to the construction contract based on equitable subrogation is a \"contractor\" for purposes of Code \u00a7 33.1-387.

This construction is consistent with the statutory framework for filing contract-based claims against VDOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Code \u00a7 33.1-192.1 provides in pertinent part that \"[n]o suit or action shall be brought against [VDOT] by a contractor\n   <em>\n    or any persons claiming under him . . .\n   </em>\n   on any contract. . . unless the claimant shall have exhausted the review process provided by Code \u00a7 33.1-386.\" (Emphasis added). This provision includes situations where a contractor's claims have been acquired by another and that entity seeks to assert the claims against VDOT. If, as XL suggests, the term \"contractor\" in Code \u00a7 33.1-387 includes entities that are \"claiming under\" the contractor, this provision of Code \u00a7 33.1-192.1 would be unnecessary and meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude the term \"contractor\" in Code \u00a7 33.7-387 applies only to those entities with a direct contractual relationship with VDOT and that the doctrine of equitable subrogation does not qualify XL as a \"contractor\" under that statute. Accordingly, XL was not entitled or required to proceed under Code \u00a7 33.1-387. The provisions of Code \u00a7 33.1-192.1, however, apply\n   to XL because XL was an entity \"claiming under\" the contractor on a contract executed with VDOT.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Code \u00a7 33.1-192.1 requires compliance with Code \u00a7 33.1-386, XL's right to file a civil action was dependent on its compliance with the administrative procedures prescribed by that section. Thus, XL's civil action was an appeal from the decision of an administrative agency and its appeal from the judgment of the circuit court was within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Our conclusion requires that we return this case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration. The Commonwealth suggests, however, that the appeal should be dismissed because XL did not file a notice of appeal to this Court regarding the jurisdictional issue. The Commonwealth provides little support for its position other than stating at oral argument that XL failed to perfect its appeal because no notice of appeal was filed, citing Rule 5:14. We reject the suggestion that a notice of appeal was required in this case. Rule 5:14 does not apply to transfers of appeal under Code \u00a7 8.01-677.1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and nothing in that section requires that a notice of appeal be filed with the Court of Appeals when that court transfers an appeal to this Court. Unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    E.W. Yeatts,\n   </em>\n   where the appeal was filed in the wrong court (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2096614\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/233/17/\">\n    233 Va. at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=353%20S.E.2d%20717\">\n    353 S.E.2d at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), in this case, XL filed the appeal in the correct court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We also reject XL's suggestion that even though the case was properly appealed to the Court of Appeals, the provisions in Code \u00a7 8.01-677.1, directing that no appeal should be dismissed if filed in the wrong court, allow this Court to exercise jurisdiction and resolve the appeal on the merits. The language cited by XL is not applicable here because this appeal will not be dismissed but will be remanded for further consideration. Nothing in that section suggests that if the transferee court determines the transfer was made in error and jurisdiction resides in the other appellate court, the transferee court should nevertheless proceed to resolve the matter on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the reasons stated, we will reverse the Court of Appeals' transfer order and return XL's appeal to the Court of Appeals for consideration under the Court's appellate jurisdiction set forth in Code \u00a7 17.1-405(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and returned.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The construction contract, performance bond, and takeover agreement for the Chesterfield County project were exhibits to the motion for judgment regarding that project.
