It is there said: \u201c as there is nothing in the record to show that the appellant <em>suggested </em>any particular return day, we must consider the order of appeal as the act of the judge, and that it was not one of the errors which, under the statute, might be imputable to the appellant.\u201d Here a day was suggested by. the appellant, and then under the phraseology of the order as asked by him (being in the alternative), it may have been possible for him to have brought up the appeal within the ten days prescribed in such cases. Be this as it may, the return day having been fixed as demanded by the appellant, we must conclude that the error is imputable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Appeal dismissed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Rehearing refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
