Evidence, offered by the plaintiff, of the value of the building, before and after the construction of the railroad, was excluded by the court upon the defendant\u2019s objection. The defendant contended that the plaintiff\u2019s damages should be limited to the date of bringing the action. But the court ruled that they might be recovered to the time of the trial; and evidence was introduced in accordance with that ruling without objection or exception by the defendant to the admission of the evidence, or to the ruling under which it came in. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant could not except to a subsequent refusal of the court to admit evidence that the value of the plaintiff\u2019s property had been increased by the construction of the railroad ; nor to an instruction allowing damages to be Recovered to the time of trial; nor to the refusal of an instruction, requested by the defendant after the charge, that the recovery could be had only for the permanent injury to the plaintiff\u2019s property.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>An abutter on a street in the city of New York may recover against a company constructing an elevated railroad and station-house in front of his building, damages for the discomforts and inconveniences in the occupation of the building, caused by the erection of the defendant\u2019s structure, independently of the running of trains thereon.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-4\">This was an action brought March 5,1880, by a national bank against an elevated railroad company to recover damages for the construction of the defendant\u2019s track and station-house in front of the plaintiff\u2019s banking-house at the southwesterly corner of Third Avenue and Twenty-third Street in the city of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-5\">The complaint claimed damages for the interference with the use, enjoyment- and value of the plaintiff\u2019s building, ana the obstruction of light and air, by the construction of the defendant\u2019s track and station; and for the interference with the use, comfort and enjoyment of the building by the plaintiff, its officers, servants and tenants, caused by the noise, steam, smoke and noxious smells attending the running of the trains, and for the consequent lessening of the rents and profits of the building; and also for the-permanent injury to the use of the building and to its market and rental value, by the -construction of the track and station, and by the jarring and concussion attending the running of the trains.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-6\">The answer denied that the plaintiff had any interest in Third Avenue and Twenty-third Street, except as shared with the public at large; denied the other allegations of the complaint, except that it admitted the erection of the elevated railway and station; and alleged that these structures were authorized by and in conformity with the statutes of New York of 1850, c. 140; 1866, c. 697; 1867, c, 489; 1868, c. 855; 1875, cc. 595, 606.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-7\">A verdict recovered by the plaintiff at a trial in February, 1885, was set aside and a new trial ordered. 24 Fed.

Judgment was thereupon entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $5068.33, being the amount of the verdict and interest-; and the defendant sued out this writ of error, which the plaintiff unsuccessfully moved to dismiss for want of a sufficient amount in dispute to give this court jurisdiction. 118 U.

Kegarding this as an action upon the case for a continuing interference with certain easements, appurtenant to the premises of the defendant in error, it was error for the court to admit evidence and permit a recovery of damage to the defendant in error, accruing after the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-7\">The action must be regarded as brought upon one or the other of two distinct and conflicting theories; either as an action to recover damages consisting of a permanent depreciation in the valu\u00e9 of the premises, due to the destruction, once for all time, of certain rights or attributes, of value to the premises in question, due to the erection in the'street of a structure confessedly permanent; or, on the other hand, as an action on the case to recover, for a continuing interference with such rights, damages thereby accruing from day to day, up to the commencement of the action, by the continued maintenance' of a structure, which, because temporary, had not destroyed the rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>In contemplation of law the trespass is a fresh offence each day of its continuance, and each trespass constitutes a fresh cause of action. The plaintiff can bring suit each day upon the preceding day\u2019s trespass; and in no one suit is it possible to make compensation for all possible trespasses in the future. From this it follows that the plaintiff is restricted in his recovery, in any one suit, to the amount of damage suffered by him up to the time of beginning that suit. This is the doctrine of the Federal Courts. <em>Wightman </em>v. Providence, 1 Cliff. 524 ; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Washington, Alexandria and Georgetown, Steam Packet Co., </em>9 Pet. 107; <em>Baltimore &amp; Potomac Railroad </em>v. <em>Fifth Baptist Church, </em>108 U.

The Court erred in failing to instruct the jury that the damages which they should assess must be the permanent injury, if any, to the plaintiff\u2019s premises by reason of the defendant\u2019s interference with the easements appurtenant to the same. <em>Story </em>v. <em>New York Elevated Railroad, </em>90 N. Y. 122.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-6\">The law recognizes the existence of such a cause of action as is set forth in this complaint. There is recognized by law such a claim as a claim for permanent depreciation in the value of real estate, due to the destruction of a right appurtenant to the same, as will appear by the following English and American cases: <em>Nicklin </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>10 Exch. 259; <em>Bonomi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>v. <em>Backhouse, </em>1 El.

New York Cen. Railroad, </em>101 N. Y. 98.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-4\">The theory for which we contend is, that the structure, as matter of fact, is presumably permanent; that any damage therefore inflicted upon abutting premises by such permanent .obstruction of easements, consists of a depreciation in the value of the premises; that this can be measured and recovered in an action at law;. that such recovery is a full adjustment of the rights of the parties as to any particular parcel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-5\">But whether or not this prove true, independently of any <em>assent </em>of <em>theparties </em>to the proposition that the road is permanent, it would appear that the recovery should be measured by the permanent depreciation in the value of the premises in any action where such <em>assent is given.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-6\">In such case the recovery is had, once for all, and the judgment a bar to any further action. The New York Court of Appeals has expressly so decided in reference to this railroad in an action at law by an abutter in which the recovery was measured by the permanent depreciation in the value of the abutting premises, and also decided that such assent of the parties was evidenced by the form of action brought by plaintiff, and by the request of defendant corporation to instruct the jury that the recovery should be measured by the depreciation in value of the premises. <em>Lahr </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Elevated </em>Railroad, 104 N. Y. 268.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-7\">So far as the record goes, it may well be that although a temporary loss may have occurred at first, due to the interference with the use and occupation, yet that the railroad Company might have shown, had it been permitted, that the value of the premises had been enhanced, not reduced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>It proved true in many instances that the elevated railways in New York \u00e9aused a temporary loss of rents for a period of a few years, and yet produced in such cases either no permanent depreciation or far less than that anticipated by the owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-4\">Here in the case at bar we have the assent of both parties to this proposition of the permanency of the structure. The complaint states the permanency,-and contains allegations of permanent depreciation,' which would be false if the structure were not permanent. The railroad company assents by expressly requesting the court to charge that the recovery must be measured by the depreciation and not by the loss of rents or interference with the enjoyment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-5\">III. The court erred in permitting the jury to include in the verdict any damages for loss of rent or interference with the enjoyment of that portion of the premises occupied by the bank itself for banking purposes.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b460-6\"><em>Mr. W.

Justice Gray,</author>\n<p id=\"A8E\">after stating the case as above, delivered</p>\n<p id=\"AyG\">the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The law of the State of New York, as declared by the Court of Appeals, appears to be as follows: An elevated railroad erected in and over a street pursuant to the statutes of the State, and with due compensation to the owners of property taken for the purpose, is a lawful structure. The owners of lands abutting on a street in the city of New York have an easement of way, and of light and air, over it; and, through a bill in equity for an injunction, may recover of the elevated railroad company full compensation for the permanent injury to this easement; but, in an action at law, cannot, without the defendant\u2019s acquiescence, recover permanent damages, measured by the diminution in value of their property, but can recover such temporary damages only as they have sustained to the time of commencing the action. <em>In re New York Elevated Ra</em>ilroad, 70 N. Y. 327; <em>In re Gilbert Elevated Rai</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>lway, </em>70 N. Y. 361; <em>Story </em>v. <em>New York Elevated </em>Railroad, 90 N. Y. 122 ; <em>Lahr </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Elevated </em>Railway, 104 N. Y. 268; <em>Pond </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Elevated </em>Railway, 112 N. Y. 186. This rule .of damages at law has not prevailed in analogous cases decided in other jurisdictions, and collected in the briefs of counsel; and in the case last above cited the court observed that \u201cit might be productive of less inconvenience on the whole, if an opposite rule could be adopted.\u201d 112 N. Y. 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">But we are relieved from the necessity of laying down a general rule on the subject, because in this case it clearly appears that the defendant procured or acquiesced in the rulings under which the trial was conducted, and thereby waived the right to object to them. <em>Lahr </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Elevated </em>Railway, 104 N. Y. 268, 294; <em>Drucker </em>v. <em>Manhattan </em>Railway, 106 N. Y. 157; <em>Hussner </em>v. <em>Brooklyn </em>Railroad, 114 N. Y. 433 ; <em>Shaw </em>v. Stone, 1 Cush. 228, 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The complaint was framed in the double aspect of claiming damages for the injury accruing to the use and enjoyment of the plaintiff\u2019s property by the obstruction of light and air and the diminution of rents, as well as damages for the permanent injury to the market and rental value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The plaintiff began by introducing evidence, to the admission of which the defendant took no objection or exception, of the injury to the use and enjoyment of the property by obstructing the access of light and air, and by diminishing the rents, down to the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">When the plaintiff afterwards offered evidence of the value of the building, before and after the erection of the defendant\u2019s structure, the defendant objected to this evidence, and it was excluded by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The defendant\u2019s cou\u00f1sel thereupon suggested that the plaintiff\u2019s damages should come down to the commencement of the action only ; and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel replied that they claimed damages for the permanent injury. The court declined to adopt either of these views, and refused to allow damages to be recovered for the permanent injury, but ruled that damages might be recovered to the time of trial. Neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>party having excepted to this ruling at the time, both parties must be presumed to have assented to it.</p>\n<p id=\"AAV\">In accordance with that ruling, the trial proceeded upon the theory that damages were not to be awarded for permanent injury, but were to be assessed down to the time of trial; and in accordance with that theory further evidence was introduced by both parties, without any objection or exception by either party to the admission of the evidence or to the rulings under which it came in. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The defendant having, by his objection sustained by the court, prevented the plaintiff from introducing evidence of permanent injury to the building, and having permitted the trial to proceed in accordance with the ruling of the court admitting evidence of injury to the time .of the trial, without excepting either to that ruling or to the evidence admitted in accordance with it, could not afterwards be permitted to change front, and to insist either that the damages must be assessed for the permanent injury, or that the damages must be limited to the time of the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The court therefore rightly declined to permit the defendant to' introduce evidence (competent only upon the issue of injury to the permanent value of the property, which by the defendant\u2019s procurement had been excluded from the consideration of the jury) that the value of the property had been creased by the erection of the defendant\u2019s structure; and r nhtly refused the instruction, requested by the defendant ai sr the charge, that the recovery could be only for the permanent injury to the plaintiff\u2019s property. For the same reason, the defendant\u2019s exception to so m\u00fcch of the charge as allowed damages to be recovered to the time of the trial cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">There can be no doubt-that the court rightly declined to order a verdict for the defendant, or a verdict for the plaintiff-with nominal damages; and that the instruction which allowed the jury to award a fair compensation for the discomforts and inconveniences in the occupation of the plaintiff\u2019s building, caused by -the existence of the defendant\u2019s structure in front of it, independently-of the running of trains thereon, was suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ciently favorable, to the defendant. <em>Baltimore &amp; Potomac Railroad </em>v. <em>Fifth Baptist </em>Church, 108 U.

L. 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">As the damages recovered appear by the bill of exceptions, made part of the record, to have been assessed to the time of trial, the judgment in this case may be a bar to any subsequent action, at least for damages suffered before that time. <em>Hussner </em>v. <em>Brooklyn </em>Railroad, 114 N. Y. 433, 438; <em>Warner </em>v. Bacon, 8 Gray, 397, 402; <em>Goslin </em>v. <em>Corry, </em>7 Man. &amp; Gr. 342, 345; <em>S. C. </em>8 Scott N. R. 21, 24. But that point is not now presented for adjudication. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b463-6\">Mr. Justice Brewer, not having been a member of the court when this case was argued, took no part in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
