The defendant entered a general appearance in the action, which was filed July 17, 1889. On the 25th day of September,'1889, the defendant verified his answer, which contained a plea to the jurisdiction of the District Court in the following language :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">\u2022 \u201cThe defendant alleges that he-is now, and ever since the month of July, 1887, has been, the Consul General of the Ee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>public of Guatemala at the city of New York, and that in or about the month of May, 1889, he received from the Republic of Guatemala a duly authenticated copy of a decree in the English language, dated at the National Palace in Guatemala, May 14,1889, with instructions in writing from said government to publish the same in the newspapers of the United States, and which said decree had previously be\u00e9n published in the official Gazette, or newspaper, published in said republic, and that pursuant to such instructions,\u2019 which were sent to him both by letter and by cable, and not otherwise, he did, on or about the 9th day of June, 1889, send to the managers of the Associated Press, in the city of New York, said authenticated copy of said decree, stating that it was possible that said managers would find it of sufficient interest to publish. That prior to the 16th day of January, 1889, one Se\u00f1or Don Francisco Lainfiesta was envoy ..extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the Republic of Guatemala in the United States, and on or about that day he departed from the United States upon a temporary leave of absence, duly granted to him, and that from on or about that day, down to on or about the 10th day of July, 1889, this defendant became and was the acting minister and sole representative of the said Republic of Guatemala in the place, and during the absence, of the said envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, and was exclusively in charge of the diplomatic affairs of the said republic in the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">\u201c And by reason of the facts herein alleged this defendant claims that this court has no jurisdiction of this action, and that if any jurisdiction for said act in fact exists in any court, it is vested solely in the Supreme Court of the United States, pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution and the statutes of the United States in such case made and provided'.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-6\">In January, 1890, a motion was made \u201cfor an order settjng aside the service of the summons and all subsequent proceed ings in the action, and that the court dismiss the same, on the ground that it has no jurisdiction of this action, and had.no jurisdiction over the defendant .at the time of the. commencement thereof.\u201d.

On the 17th day of February the motion was denied, and an application was then made to this court for a rule to show cause why a writ of prohibition should not issue to the judge of the District Court, prohibiting him from proceeding further in said action; or if a writ of. prohibition could not issue, then for a rule to show cause why a writ' of mandamus should not issue, commanding the judge' to enter an order dismissing the cause, for the reason that the jurisdiction of said action existed solely in the Supreme Court under the Constitution and laws of the United States; or for such other and further relief as might be proper in the premises. The application was made upon the petition of' the defendant in the action in the District Court, and annexed to the petition and forming a part of it was a certified' copy of the entire record in the District Court, including every paper used upon the motion, and the opinion of the court. A rule having been issued, the judge of the District Court returned thereto that the motion was denied upon the facts and considerations appearing in the record and opinion, copies of which were attached to the petition, and to the order to show cause, and submitted to this court whether the District Court should take further cognizance of the said cause or should dismiss the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATa\">It appeared before the district judge, as it does here, that Mr.' Baiz was and is a citizen of the United States and a resident of the city of New York, and that he has been since 1887 Consul General of Guatemala; that Se\u00f1or Lainfiesta was, on the 16th day of January, 1889, the minister of Guatemala, of Salvador and of Honduras, in the United States, and that on that day Se\u00f1or Lainfiesta addressed a note to the Secretary of State, advising him that he was compelled to go to \u2022Guatemala for a short time, and saying: \u201c Meanwhile, I beg your Excellency to please allow that the Consul General of Guatemala and Honduras in New York, Mr. Jacob Baiz; should communicate to the office of the Secretary of State. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>any matter whatever relating to the peace of Central America,* that should without delay be presented to the knowledge of* your Excellency.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">The' Secretary of State accordingly, on the 24th day of.

Hall, as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States to the Republics of Guatemala, Salvador and Honduras, and of the appointment by the President, by and with the .advice and consent of the Senate, of Mr. Lansing B. Mizner to that post. Mr. Baiz was requested to apprise the respective governments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>of this \u00e1ppointment. This communication Mr. Baiz acknowledged on April 2d, 1889. On'May 17th, 1889, Mr. Baiz announced to the Department your appointment by the government of Guatemala as its minister plenipotentiary at this capital in place of Mr. Lainfiesta, which was duly acknowledged by the Department on the 20th of the same month. Subsequently correspondence took place between the Department and. Mr. Baiz in relation to'your entrance into the United States and to your reception as minister. On June 14, 1889, Mr. Baiz enclosed to the Department an autograph letter from the President of Guatemala dated May 20, 1889, to the President of the United States, relative, to the recall of Mr. TTall as United States minister to the States of Central America. Of this communication the Department acknowledged the receipt, on June 25, 1889. This, it is believed, is a correct r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the facts in regard to Mr. Baiz\u2019 action as the representative of Guatemala in the absence of her duly accredited minister from the United States.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-4\">After the- return to the rule, counsel appearing in opposition to granting the writ moved for an order that the petitioner show cause why certain papers presented by him should not be submitted for the consideration of the court in the determination of the matter; and the petitioner, after objecting to the granting of the order and protesting against the receipt of the papers, submitted certain papers on his part. These papers taken in chronological order are as follows: A letter dated February 2, 1886, from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Honduras to- Mr. Baiz, transmitting an appointment as charge d\u2019affaires of' the Republic of Honduras to the government of the United States, and hoping that he will accept said appointment, \u201cfilling it.to the best interests of the country, endeavoring principally to prevent \u25a0filibustering expeditions,\u201d etc., etc. Accompanying it -was a communication addressed to the State Department under date of February 1, 1886, and conveying information of the fact of the appointment. This was presented to Mr. Bayard then Secretary of State, who replied on the 22d of March, 1886, as follows:.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u201c Agreeably to the promise made to you in persofi recently by Assistant Secretary Porter, I have considered the questions involved in your nomination as charge d\u2019affaires of Honduras in the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">\u201c A difficulty arises in the fact stated by you to Mr. Porter, that you are a citizen of the United States. It has long been the. almost uniform practice of this government to decline to recognize American citizens as the accredited diplomatic representatives of foreign powers. The statutory and jurisdictional immunities and the customary privileges of right attaching to the office of a foreign minister make it not only inconsistent, but at times even inconvenient, that a citizen of this country should enjoy so anomalous a position. ' The very few past exceptions to this rule have served to' show its propriety, especially when, as in your case, it has been sought to supplement the consular functions (which an American citizen, may, if otherwise acceptable, hold with perfect propriety) by an added diplomatic rank and function.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aai\">\u201cWere it merely a question of conducting public business with you as the <em>die facto </em>charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires <em>act interim </em>during the absence of a regularly accredited envoy of Honduras, there would be little difficulty. In fact, you now stand on that footing for all practical purposes, since the Department of State corresponds with you as consul general, upon whatever diplomatic business may arise; but it is to be borne in' mind that this is done because the office of the envoy is for the time being unfilled. Your substitutionary agency is cheerfully admitted, but this is different from recognizing you as invested with the diplomatic character as the incumbent of the mission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-7\">\u201cWhile this motive would alone constrain me, although with regret, from acceding to the expressed desire of the government of Honduras and receiving you as its diplomatic representative, I find another consideration in the phraseology of your official letter of credence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-8\">The Secretary then considers the objection arising out of the fact that that instrument \u201c announces-''that the office of charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires is conferred upon you for the express purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>of negotiating with this government to prevent th,e organization in the United States of hostile expeditions against Honduras and causing certain persons named therein to be put under bonds, \u2018not to contrive in any way against the peace of Honduras.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\">The letter of credence and also the letter of the Honduranean Minister of Foreign Relations were returned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-5\">On the 24th day of March, 1886, Consul General Baiz acknowledged the receipt of the dispatch \u25a0 of the 22d, and said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">\u201c I will lose no time to inform the government of Honduras of our correspondence, and that Your Excellency has kindly consented to admit my substitutionary agency in the absence of a minister by virtue of my being the consul general.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-7\">\u201cI thank you for this recognition, the extent of which I appreciate, but in order to fully satisfy the government of Honduras, which has conferred this honor on me, I take the liberty to ask whether, in the absence of a minister, the State Department will consider the consul general charge d\u2019affaires <em>ad </em>hoc, or as. diplomatic agent of Honduras, for all practical as well as official purposes, without relieving me of duties and responsibilities incumbent on a citizen of the United States?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-8\">\u201c The declination of the State Department of my credentials on the ground that they express a purpose of a negotiation not admissible under the laws of the United States will, no doubt, be satisfactory to the government of Honduras.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-9\">\u25a0 On the 3d day of April, 1886, the Secretary of State answered the inquiry of Mr. Baiz in these words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATA\">\u201cI have received your letter of the 24th ultimo, in which, after referring to the willingness expressed\" in my letter to you of the 22d March to admit, in .the absence of a minister of Honduras, your substitutionary agency in virtue of. your office as ponsul general, you enquire \u2018whether, in the absence of a minister, the State Department will consider the consul general charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires <em>ad hoc </em>or as a diplomatic agent of Honduras for all practical as well as official purposes, without relieving \u2019 you \u2018 of. duties and responsibilities incumbent on a citizen of the United States.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u201c In reply, I have to inform you that it is not the purpose of the Department to regard the substitutionary agency, -which it cheerfully admits in your case, as conferring upon you personally any diplomatic status whatever. Your agency is admitted to be such only as' is compatible with the continued existence of a vacancy in the diplomatic representation of Honduras in the United States. To recognize you as charge d\u2019affaires <em>ad hoc </em>would be to announce that the vacancy no longer existed, and that diplomatic representation was renewed in your person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\">\u201cIt is a common thing to resort to a t\u00e9mpora^ agency, such as yours, in the conduct of the business of a mission. A foreign minister, on quitting the country, often leaves the affairs of his office in the friendly charge of the minister of another country, but the latter does not thereby become the diplomatic agent of the government in whose behalf he exerts his good offices. The relation established is merely one of courtesy and comity. The same thing occurs when the temporary good offices of a consul are resorted to.

The object of the constitutional and statutory provisions respecting \u201c ambassadors and other public ministers,\u201d (Const. Art. III. \u00a7 2; Rev. Stat, \u00a7 687,) was to prevent such person from being sued in any court save the highest court of the nation, trusting to it alone to determine whether the act complained of could be punished by any judicial tribunal \u201c consistently with'the law of nations.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-8\">II.

If this court has no power to issue a writ of prohibition under \u00a7 716, then it may issue a writ of mandamus under \u00a7 688, Rev. Stat.

Seventeenth. Of'all suits against consuls or vice-consuls,\u201d except for certain offences. The petitioner 1ms been, since July, 1887, .the consul general of the BepUblic ot\u2018 Guatemala, and therefore the District Court had jurisdiction of the' action in question, unless he belonged to the class of official personages subject to suits or proceedings only in this court. This he insists was the fact, and avers in his petition, as he did in his plea in the District Court,, that at the time of the commencement. of the action and until and including the 10th day of- July, 1889, which was the eighth day after service of process upon him, he was \u201cthe acting minister and sole representative of said .republic [of Guatemala] in the United States,\u201d and for that reason came within the words of section 687, \u201c other public ministers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AzM\">The exemption asserted ceased on the 10th of July, 1889, and on the 17th of July the petitioner gave a general notice' of appearance in the action, but did not set up the want of jurisdiction until the 25th of the following September. _ Suit could have been brought-in that court against him on the 11th day of July, but as in his view this could not have been done on the 29th of June or the 2d of July, he contends that the District Court should be ordered to dismiss the suit, though it .could at once be recommenced therein. But it is said that the appearance did not waive the right to be sued in this court rather than in the District Court, because that was the privilege of the country or government which he represented. \"Without pausing to inquire how far this is \u00e1 correct application of the international privilege of not being sued at all, its assertion, even in this restricted form, serves to' emphasize petitioner\u2019s contention that he was at that time the minister or. diplomatic agent of the republics of Guatemala, Salvador and Honduras in the United States, entrusted by virtue of his office with authority to -represent those republics in their negotiations and to vindicate their prerogatives.</p>\n<p id=\"AmT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Under section 2, Art- II, of the Constitution, the President is-vested with power to \u201cappoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls,\u201d and by section 3 it is provided that <em>\u201c </em>he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7Q\">These words are descriptive of a cla,ss existing by the law of nations, and apply to diplomatic agents whether accredited by the United States to a foreign power or by a foreign power to the United States, and the words are so used'in section 2 of Art. III. These agents may be called ambassadors, envoys, ministers, commissioners, charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires, agents, or otherwise, but they possess in substance the same functions, rights and privileges as agents of their respective governments for the transaction of its diplomatic business abroad. Their designations are chiefly significant in the relation of rank, precedence or dignity. 7 Opinions Attys. Gen. (Cushing), 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Hence, when in subdivision fifth of section 1674 of the Revised Statutes we find \u201cdiplomatic officer\u201d defined as including \u201c ambassadors, envoys extraordinary, ministers plenipotentiary, ministers resident, commissioners, charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires, agents and secretaries of legation, and none others,\u201d we understand that to express the view of Congress as to what are included within the term \u201cpublic ministers,5\u2019 although the section relates to diplomatic officers of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajj\">But the scope of the words \u201c public ministers \u201d is defined in the \u2022 legislation embodied in Title XLVII, \u201c Foreign Relations,\u201d Rev. Stat., 2d ed. 783. Section 4062 provides that \u201c every person who violates any safe conduct or passport duly' obtained and issued under authority of the United States ; or who assaults, strikes, wounds, imprisons or in any other manner offers violence to the person of a public minister, ,in violation of the law of nations, shall be imprisoned for not more than three years, and. fined, at the- discretion of the court.\u201d Section 4063 enacts that whenever any writ or process is sued out or prosecuted by any person in any court of the United States, or of a State, or by any judge or justice, whereby the person of any public minister of any foreign prince or state, authorized and received as such by the President, or any domestic or domestic servant of any such minis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ter, is arrested or imprisoned, or his goods or chattels' are distrained, seized or attached, such writ or process shall be deemed void. Section 4064 imposes penalties for suing, out any . writ or process in violation'of the preceding section ; and section 4065 says that the two preceding sections' shall not apply to any case where the person against whom the process' is issued is a citizen or inhabitant of the United States \u201c in the service of a public minister,\u201d and process is founded upon a debt contracted before he entered upon such service; nor shall the preceding' section apply to any ease whei\u2019e the person against whom the process is issued is a \u201c domestic servant of a public minister,\u201d unless the name of the servant has been registered and posted as therein prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">. Section 4130,, which is the last section of the title, is as follows : \u201c The word \u2018 minister,\u2019 when used in this title, shall be understood to mean the person invested with, and exercising, the principal diplomatic functions. The word \u2018 consul \u2019 shall be understood to mean a,ny person invested by the United States with, and exercising, the functions of consul general, vice-consul general, consul or vice-consul.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">. Sections 4062, 4063, 4064 and 4065 were originally sections 25, 26, 27 and 28 of the Crimes Act of April 30, 1790, c. 9, 1 Stat. 118; and these were drawn from the statute 7 Anne, c. 12, which was declaratory simply of the law of nations, which Lord Mansfield observed, in <em>Heathfield </em>v. Chilton, 4 Burrow, 2015, 2016, the act did not intend to alter and could not alter.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In that case, involving the discharge of the defendant from custody, as a domestic servant to the minister of the Prince Bishop of Li\u00e9ge, Lord Mansfield said: \u201c I should desire to know in what manner this minister was accredited \u2014 certainly, he is' Uipt an ambassador, which is the first rank \u2014 envoy, indeed, is \u00e1 second class ;\u2022 but he is not shown to be even an envoy. He is called \u2018 minister,\u2019 \u2019tis true; but minister (alone) is an equivocal term.\u201d The statute of Anne was passed in consequence of the arrest of an ambassador of Peter the Great for debt, and the demand by the Czar that the sheriff of Middlesex and all others concerned in the arrest should be punished with instant death, 1 Bl. Com. 254; and it was in reference to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>that Lord Ellenborough, in <em>Viveash </em>v. Becker, 3 M. &amp; S. 284, where it was held that a resident merchant of London, who is appointed and acts as consul to a foreign prince, is not exempt from\u2019 arrest on mesne process, remarked: \u201cI cannot help thinking that the act of Parliament, which mentions only \u2018 ambassadors and public. ministers,\u2019 and which was passed at a time when it was an object studiously to comprehend all kinds of public ministers entitled to these privileges, must be considered as declaratory, not only of what the law of nations is, but of the extent to which that law is to be carried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ASe_\">Three cases are cited by counsel for petitioner arising under or involving the act of 1790. In <em>United States </em>v. Liddle, 2 Wash. C. C. 205, in the case of an indictment.\u2019for an assault and battery on a member of a foreign legation, it was held that the certificate of the Secretary of State, dated subsequently to the assault and battery, is the best \u00e9vidence to prove the diplomatic character of a person accredited as a minister by the government of the United States. The certificate from the Secretary of State, Mr. Madison, stated that \u201c when Mr. Feronda produced to the President his credentials as charg\u00e9 des affaires of Spain, he also introduced De Lima, as a gentleman attached to- the legation and performing the duties of secretary of legation,\u201d and the certificate was held to be the best evidence to prove that Feronda was received and accredited, and that at the same time De Lima was presented and received ' as secretary attached to the legation. In <em>United States </em>v. Ortega, 4 Wash. C. C. 531; there was produced in court an official' letter from the Spanish minister to the Secretary of State,' informing him that he had appointed Mr. Salmon charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires; a letter from the minister to Mr. Salmon ; a letter from the Secretary of State addressed to the Spanish minister, recpgnizing the character of Mr. Salmon; two-letters from the Secretary of State addressed to Mr. Salmon as charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires; and the deposition of the chief clerk of the State Department that Mr. Salmon was recognized by the President as charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, and was accredited by the Secretary of State. In <em>United States </em>v. Benner, Baldwin, 234, the court was furnished with a certificate from the Secretary of State that th\u00e9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Danish minister had by letter informed the Department' that Mr. Brandis had arrived in this country in the character of attach\u00e9 to the legation, and that said Brandis had accordingly, since that date, been recognized by the Department as attached to the legation in that character.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">These cases clearly indicate the nature of the evidence proper to establish whether a person is a public minister within the meaning of the Constitution and the laws, and that the inquiry before us may be answered by such evidence, if adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u2022Was Consul General Baiz a person \u201cinvested with and exercising the principal diplomatic functions,\u201d within section 4130, or. a \u201c diplomatic officer,\u201d within section- 1674 ? His counsel claim in their motion that he was \u201cthe acting minister or charge d\u2019affaires of the Republics of Guatemala, Salvador and Honduras in the United States,\u201d and so recognized by the State Department, and that he exercised diplomatic functions as such, and therefore was a public minister, within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">By the Congresses of Vienna and Aix-la-Chapelle four distinct kinds of representation were recognized, of which the fourth comprised charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires, who are appointed by the minister of foreign affairs, and not as the others, nominally or actually by the sovereign. Under the regulations of this government the representatives- of the United States have heretofore been ranked in three grades, the third being charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires. Secretaries of. legation act <em>ex offieio </em>as charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires <em>ad </em>interim, and in the absence of the secretary of legation the Secretary of State may designate any competent person to act <em>ad interim, </em>in which case- he is specifically accredr ited by letter to the minister for foreign affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Wheaton says: \u201c Charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires, accredited to the ministers of foreign affairs of the court at which they reside, are either charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires <em>ad hoe, </em>who are originally sent, and accredited by their governments, or charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires <em>per </em>interim, substituted' in the place of- the minister of their respective nations during his absence.\u201d Elements Int.

Paris 1870, and among the numerous authorities on international laws, cited and quoted from by petitioner\u2019s counsel, the attitude of-consuls, on.Avhom this function is occasionally conferred, is perhaps as well put by De Clercq and De Vallat as by any, as follotvs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\"><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c There remains a last consideration to notice, that of a consul who is \u25a0 charged for the time being with the management' of the affairs of the diplomatic post; he is accredited in this-case in his diplomatic capacity, either by' a letter of the minister-of foreign affairs of France-to the minister of' foreign affairs of the country where he is about to reside, or by a letter of the diplomatic agent whose place he is about to fill, or finally by a personal presentation of this agent to -the minister of foreign affairs of the country.\u201d Guide Pratique des Consulats, Vol. 1, p. 93.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>. That it may sometimes happen, that consuls are so charged is recognized 'by section 1738 of the Revised Statutes, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">\u201cNo consular officer shall exercise diplomatic functions, or hold any diplomatic correspondence or relation on the part of (the United States, in, with, or to the government or country .to which he is appointed, or any other country or government. When there is in such country any officer of the United States authorized to perform diplomatic functions therein; nor in any case, unless expressly authorized by the President so to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">But in such case their consular character is necessarily subordinated to their superior diplomatic character. \u201c A consul,\u201d, observed Mr. Justice -Story, in <em>The </em>Anne, 3 Wheat. 435, 445, \u201c though a public agent, is supposed. to be clothed with authority only for commercial purposes. .He has an undoubted right to interpose claims for the restitution of property belonging to the subjects of his own country; but he is not considered as a minister, or diplomatic agent of his sovereign, intrusted, by .virtue of his office, with- .authority to represent him in his negotiations with foreign states, or to vindicate his prerogatives. There is no doubt that his sovereign may specially intrust him with such authority; but in such case his diplomatic character is superadded to his ordinary powers, and ought to be recognized by the government within whose dominions he assumes to exercise it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">When a consul is appointed charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, he has a double political capacity; but though invested with full diplomatic privileges, he becomes so invested as charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires and not- as consul, and though authorized as consul to communicate directly with the government in which he resides, he does not thereby obtain the diplomatic privileges of a minister.

This is not the language of designation to a representative position, and is the language designating a mere medium of communication; and the reply of Mr. Secretary Bayard so treats it, in declaring that the-department would be pleased to receive any communication in relation to Central America of which Consul General Baiz might be made the- channel. This reply is addressed to Mr. Baizas \u201cConsul General of Guatemala and Honduras,\u201d and not as charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires <em>ad interim. </em>.The mere fact that .the usual note conveying the information to the legations of Mr. Secretary Blaine\u2019s accession chanced, to be addressed to \u201cSe\u00f1or Don Jacob Baiz, in charge of the legations of Guatemala, Salvador and Honduras,\u201d was not a recognition that he was charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires <em>ad </em>interim, or exercising diplomatic functions; and Mr. Baiz in acknowledging the receipt of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>announcement properly signs his letter \u201cConsul General.\u201d It may be that such announcements are not sent to any but those exercising diplomatic functions; but this courtesy could not operate as in itself a deliberate recognition of the right to exercise such functions, nor that the person to whom the communication was addressed was in such exercise as a matter of fact. It was entirely proper, since Consul General Baiz was the channel of communication between Guatemala, Honduras and Salvador and the State Department, that the notification should be sent to him,'and. even if that course had not been usual, the courtesy could not' be availed.*of to impart a character which the recipient did not otherwise possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The proofs show that of ten letters from the State Department to Mr. Baiz, between January 16 and'July 10,1889, two were addressed to him as in charge of the legations, .or the business of the legations, of Guatemala, Salvador and Horn duras; two were addressed to him as Consul of Honduras; and six as Consul General of Guatemala, or Guatemala and Honduras. Of seven letters from Mr. Baiz to the department, one was signed Jacob Baiz, and six, Jacob Baiz, Consul General. The acknowledgment, of notice of the-accession of the Secretary of State, and of the appointment of Mr. Mizner, and the transmission of a letter from the President of Guatemala, and the announcement of the appointment of Minister Cruz, by the Consul General, can hardly be regarded as the performance of diplomatic functions as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The official circular issued by the Department of State, corrected to June 13,-1889, gives the names and description of the eharg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires <em>ad </em>interim, in the case of countries represented by ministers who were absent and of countries having no minister, and the date of their presentation. In the instance of Portugal, the name is given of \u201c Consul and acting Consul General, in charge of business of legation,\u201d and the fact of the presentation with the date appears in the list; while in the instance of Guatemala, Salvador' and Honduras, the name of Mr. Baiz is referred to in a foot-note, with the title of Consul General only; nor does it appear, nor is it claimed to be the fact, that he was ever presented. As stated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>counsel, Mr. Webster took the ground, in the case of M. Hiilse-. mann, that as charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires he was not, as matter of strict right, entitled to be presented to the President; and this is in accordance with the regulations of the State Department. Cons. Keg. 13. Put such presentation is undeniably evidence of the possession of diplomatic character, and so would be the formal reception of a charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires <em>ad interim </em>by the Secretary of State. The inference is obvious, that if the Department of State had regarded Mr. Baiz as charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires <em>ad </em>interim, or as \u201c invested with and exercising the principal diplomatic functions,\u201d his name would have been placed in the list, with some indication of .the fact, as the title of charg\u00e9, or, if he had been presented, the date of his presentation. Nor can a reason be suggested why the petitioner has not produced in this case a certificate from the Secretary of State that he had been recognized by the Department of State as charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires <em>ad interim </em>of Guatemala, or as intrusted with diplomatic functions, if there had been such recognition. A certificate of his status was requested 'by the Guatemalan minister, and if the State Department had- understood that Mr. Baiz was in any sense or in any way a <em>\u201c </em>diplomatic representative,\u201d no reason is perceived why the Department would not have f\u00farnished a certificate to that effect ;\u25a0 but instead of that, it contented itself with a courteous reply, giving what was in its judgment a sufficient r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the facts; the letter being in effect a polite declination to give the particular ' certificate desired, because that could n'ot properly be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Mr. Baiz was a citizen of the United States and a resident of the city' of New York. In many countries it is a state maxim that one of its own subjects or citizens is not to be received as a foreign diplomatic- agent, and a refusal to receive, based on that' objection, is always regarded as reasonable. The expediency of avoiding a possible conflict between his privileges as such and his obligations as a subject or citizen, is considered reason enough in itself.

Even an appointment as consul of a native of the place where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>consular service is required, is, according to' Phillhnore' \u201cperhaps, rightfully pronounced, by a considerable authority, to, be objectionable in principle.\u201d Vol. II. p. 291, citing De Martens <em>&amp; </em>De Cussey, Recueil des Trait\u00e9s, Index explicatif, p. XXX, tit. \u201c Consuls.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">1 \u201cOther powers,\u201d says Calvo, vol. 1, p. 559, 2d ed., \u201cadmit .without difficulty their own citizens as representatives of foreign States, but imposing on them the obligation of amenability to the local laws as to their persons and property. These conditions, which, nevertheless, ought never to go so far as to modify or alter the representative character, ought always to be defined before or at the time of .receiving the agent; for otherwise, the latter\u2019 might find it impossible to claim the honors, rights and prerogatives attached to his employment.\u201d See also Heffter, 3d Fr. ed. 387.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In the United States, the rule is expressed by- Mr. Secretary Evarts, under date of September 19, 1879, thus: \u201c This government objects to receiving a citizen of the United States as a diplomatic representative of a foreign power. Such citizens, however, are frequently .recognized \u2022 as consular officers of other nations, and this policy is not known to have hitherto occasioned any inconvenience.\u201d And again, April 20, 1880, while waiving the obstacle in the particular instance, he says : \u201cThe .usage of diplomatics intercourse between nation\u00bb is averse to the acceptance, in the representative, capacity, of a person who,, while native born in the country\u2018which sends him, has yet acquired lawful statu? as'a citizen'by naturalization of the country to -which he is. sent.\u201d 1 Wharton Dig. Int. Law 2d ed. \u00a7 88a, p. 628. Of course the objection would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>not exist to the same extent in the case of designation for special purposes or temporarily, but it is one purely for the receiving government to insist upon or waive at its pleasure. The presumption, therefore, would ordinarily be against Mr. Baiz\u2019s contention, and, as matter of fact, we find that when in 1886, he was-appointed charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires of the Republic of Honduras to the government of the United States, Mr. Secretary Bayard- declined receiving him as the diplomatic \u25a0epresentative of the government of that country, because 6f his being a citizen of the United States, and advised him that\u201c It has long been the almost uniform practice of this government to. decline to recognize American citizens as the accredited diplomatic representatives of foreign powers. The statutory and jurisdictional immunities and the custopaary ..privileges of right attaching to the office of a foreign minister make it not only., inconsistent, but at times even inconvenient, that a citizen of this country should enjoy so anomalous<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>'V position.\u201d And in a subsequent communication rendered necessary by a direct question of Mr. B\u00e1iz, the Secretary informs him \u201c that it is not the purpose of the department to regard the substitutionary agency, which it cheerfully admits in your case, as conferring upon youfpersonally any diplomatic status whatever.\u201d This.correspondence disposes of the question, before us. The objection which existed in 1886 to the reception of Mr. Baiz \u00e1s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires <em>ad hoc </em>or <em>ad in</em>terim, or according to him any diplomatic status whatever, whether temporary or otherwise, existed in 1889; and it. is . out of the question to assume that the\u2019. State Department in,tended to concede the \u2022 diplomatic status between January 16- and July 10, .1889, upon the request of Se\u00f1or Lainfiesta'Ahat Consul- General Bai'z might be allowed to be a 'medium of communication during his absence, which it had refused to accord to the Republic of Honduras itself. It is evident that ' the statement^! the Assistant Secretary, October 4,1889, was quite correct, that \u201cthe business of the legation [of Guatemala], was conducted by Consul General Baiz, but without diplomatic character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Jt is objected that we ought not to have allowed these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>official papers to come before us, but. should have prohibited .the District Court from exercising jurisdiction, because the evidence that established it had not all been before that court when the question was raised; but the rule governing this clafes of cases involves no such consequences. The district .judge was of opinion that inasmuch as there were two kinds of direct evidence which would show that the defendant was a \u25a0\u201c public minister,\u201d to wit: (1) A certificate of the Secretary of State that he was such, was received as such and was exercising such functions; or (2) pi\u2019oof of the exercise by the :defendant of \u201cthe principal diplomatic functions,\u201d' under, some one off the titles of diplomatic' office, as recognized by oui* statutes and the law of nations; and as such direct evidence had not been furnished, and the plaintiff was not required to produce his counter evidence on a motion like .that under consideration instead of at the trial, he was justified in retaining jurisdiction until the issue raised by the pleadings was regularly determined. But to this latter suggestion, counsel for petitioner answered in argument:. \u201c At any rate, in this court, exercising its appropriate jurisdiction to entertain an application for a writ of prohibition or mandamus, the respondent here is called upon to produce any evidence that exists to countervail the petitioner\u2019s proof of his privilege.\u201d This is undoubtedly the correct view. The question here is whether the District Court had jurisdiction, and not whether its order refusing to set aside the service of summons and the subsequent proceedings' in the action, and dismissing the same, should be reversed..</p>\n<p id=\"A_Q\">; The practice in prohibition was formerly to file a suggestion, an affidavit in support of which was. required where the pro-' hibition was moved for upon anything not appearing upon the fac\u00e9 of the proceedings; - Upon a rule to show cause,' if it \u2022appeared to the court, on cause shown, that the surmise was not true, or not clearly sufficient to ground the prohibition upon it would be denied, otherwise the rule would be made absolute : or, if the matter were doubtful, the party was ordered to declare, and issue joined on such declaration was regularly tried, being in the nature of an issue .to inform the conscience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>of the court. 2 Sellon\u2019s Practice, 313, 321, 325. And in mandamus, if the case were not governed by the return to the alternative writ, but a traverse of the return was allowed, issues were made up and a trial had. ' If the matter can be disposed of upon the rule to show cause, that course may be pursued, but the applicable principles are the same. The alleged want of jurisdiction depends upon questions of fact. It was purely discretionary whether this evidence should be admitted at the time it was presented ; and in a proceeding involving the inquiry under consideration, it was plainly our duty to permit it to come in, the petitioner- being afforded, as he was, the opportunity for explanation and the introduction. of such other evidence as he chose to produce.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In <em>Ex parte Hitz, </em>Petitioner, 111 U.
