M- Whitehill <em>&amp; </em>Co. was indebted to the firm bf Biddle, Coleman &amp; Co. in the sum of $10,000 for plant, stock, boats, barges, flats, ferry-boats, tugs, anchors, etc., etc., and for c'oal furnished and supplied to J..M. Whitehill <em>&amp; </em>Co. by Biddle, Coleman &amp; Co.; that Biddle, Coleman &amp; Co. were entitled to -one-half of the profits realized by said firm, and also entitled to one-half of the assets of the firm of J.

Whitehill <em>&amp; </em>Co., which amounted in part to over $63,000, given in various items; that defendant Whitehill published a dissolution' of the firm, and took and retained possession of all its asset's, and on the 10th day of March, 1-881, sold and delivered to Brown, Jones &amp; Co. a part of the property of the firm of J.

M. \"Whitehill &amp; Co., from which defendant Whitehill has collected rents and received the profits since the date of the assignment of Riddle, Coleman &amp; Co.; that Whitehill has carried on the business of a receiving and forwarding merchant and ferryman, by reason of holding the river front, and derived la\u201dge profits;. that he has received annually large sums of money for the rent of houses and a hotel, built with the money of the firm of J. If. Whitehill &amp; Co. and Riddle, Coleman &amp; Co. are entitled to one-half of all these receipts; that defendant Whitehill has sold some of the lots embraced in the conveyances aforesaid and received the money therefor, and has exchanged some of the lots for other property situated in the town, and, as the title was in some- instances taken m his own name, the purchasers, or grantees of some of the lots may have taken the same for a valuable consideration without notice of the rights of Riddle, Coleman <em>&amp; </em>Co., but defendant Whitehill should be held to account for the proceeds of such lots, to one-half of.which complainants are entitled ; and that, as complainants charge, on information and belief, Whitehill purchased with the money of Whitehill <em>&amp; </em>Co. a plantation,- and took the title thereto in the name of his wife and his- brother, and ought to be required to account for the same. The bill then prayed that an account be taken of the partnership business of the firm of J. M. Whitehill &amp; Co. ; that that firm may be dissolved; that a master may be appointed to state an account of the business - apd property, and the liabilities of the firm; the indebtedness of'J. M. Whitehill &amp; Co. to Riddle, Coleman &amp; Co.; the interest of Riddle, Coleman &amp; Co. in the assets of the business - of J. M. Whitehill <em>&amp; </em>Go.; the profits realized by\" Whitehill from the property and privileges of J. M.

The bill was verified by one of the complainants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-4\">The defendant .Whitehill demurred, and assigned for causes of demurrer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-5\"><em>\u201c </em>First. That said bill, in case the same were true, contains no matter of equity; whereon this court can ground any decree or give complainants any relief as against this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Second. That it appears by the bill that said James Lynn is a necessary party,, inasmuch as it is stated that said Riddle, Coleman <em>&amp; </em>Co. assigned to him all the. real and personal property of said firm, and it does not appear .that he has disposed of the same, and the bill seeks action in relation thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-7\">\u201c Third. That the right of action, if any existed, to sue for the settlement of the partnership matters, accrued at the time of the dissolution -of said firm of J. M. Whitehill <em>&amp; </em>Co., on October 15, 1877, and more than seven years next- before the institution of this suit,, and that the demand is stale and is barred as a cause of action against this-defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-8\">- Fourth. That it appears from the bill that the creditors of said Riddle, Coleman &amp; Co. were paid before the pretended sale'to complainants by said James Lynn, as assignee, on January 3, 1885, and that there is no privity between complainants and this defendant to enable them to call on' him for a settlement of said partnership matters.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-9\">.On the 14th of April, 1886, the court sustained the demurrer, and ordered the bill to be dismissed for want of equity, and complainants prayed an appeal to this court, which was allowed.- On the 7th of October, 18.86, one of the days of the same term, the complainant moved to set aside the decree dismissing the bill, and for leave to amend the sanie by inserting therein : That the defendant continued in- the possession and control of the assets belonging to the firm of J. M. Whitehill' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>&amp; Co. for the professed purpose of paying the debts of the firm, representing to the assignee, Lynn, that J. M. Whitehill &amp; Co. were indebted in the sum of $20,000; that he, the defendant, had, in 1879, made arrangements to pay said indebtedness by instalments.of $6000 per year, and that he was using the assets .of- the firm for that purpose; that defendant did not make any adverse claim to the assets belonging to J. M. Whitehill &amp; Co., until long after the sale hereinbefore stated,, in 1881 ; and that, after paying all the debts of J. M. Whitehill &amp; Co., the defendant is indebted to the firm of Riddle, Coleman <em>&amp; </em>Co., and subject to account, as hereinbefore stated. This motion to set aside the decree and for leave to amend was continued on the 23d day of October, 1886, to the next term, at which term the motion was overruled. The transcript of record was filed in this court on the 2d day of April, 1887..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-4\">The sections of the statute of limitations of Arkansas referred to ar\u00e9 as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\">\u201c S\u00e9c. 4471.

Arnot, 29 Hun, 146 ; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Carrollton Railroad, </em>11 Wall. 624.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-7\">The allegation in the bill that the business was continued,is -in plain contradiction of the legal effect of the assignment, and of the statement of- the bill that notice of dissolution was published by Whitehill, and the continuance was impossible from the nature of the business, as the failure of Riddle, Coleman <em>&amp; </em>Co. to supply coal to sell closed the business, and the allegation of continuance must be treated as surplusage, and as not admitted by the demurrer. The contract exhibited with the. bill must therefore be held to govern and limit any; statement in the bill inconsistent therewith. <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>21 Wall. 430, 437; <em>Bonnell </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>68 N. Y. 294.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-8\">By the assignment of Riddle, Coleman <em>&amp; </em>Co., the assignee acquired only the right of Riddle, Coleman &amp; Co. in the partnership of J. M. Whitehill &amp; Co., that is to say, the right to a share of what might remain after payment of the debts of the firm and the settlement of its accounts. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Carrollton Railroad, </em>11 Wall. 624, 628 ; <em>Case </em>v. <em>Beauregard, </em>99 U. S. 119.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-9\">After the assignment of Riddle, Coleman <em>&amp; </em>Co, it was the duty of the assignee to act promptly and take charge of and gather up the assets and reduce the same to money and pay the debts of the assignors and turn over to the assignors any surplus,.after saving any sum necessary to pay off the debts of J. M. Whitehill &amp; Co., over and above the assets of said firm duly applied. <em>Raleigh </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>37 Arkansas, 150; <em>Teah </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>39 Arkansas, 66.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-10\">The laws of Arkansas and the laws of Pennsylvania contemplate that the assignee shall, within a year after the assignment, convert the assets into money to pay the debts of thet assignor, and immediately after the expiration of the year, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>file in court an account current of his business as assignee for settlement. It was the duty of the assignee, if there was anything that might go to Kiddle, Coleman &amp; Co. upon settlement of the partnership o\u00a3 Whitehill &amp; Co., to sue for a settlement; and this suit should have beeri brought within the time given for such assignee to close his trust, viz.: one year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-4\">If any one could maintain this kind of suit, it must be the assignee, as he was invested by the assignment -with the rights of the .assignors, and it does not appear that he has parted with these rights; for, if as alleged, the debts of Kiddle, Coleman <em>&amp; </em>Co. were paid before the pretended sale of January 3, 1885, the assignee had no power to sell, and complainants as purchasers, acquired no rights by the sale and transfer that will authorize them to sue for a settlement of the partnership matters of J. M. \"Whitehill <em>&amp; </em>Co. without joining with the assignee, and with the legal representatives of T. J. Coleman, deceased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-5\">And if all the right of action in the assignee was barred in January, 1885, he could transfer no right to any one by deed, sale or otherwise. The statute bar destroys the right that once existed, and confers title on\u2019 claimant in possession. <em>Meeks </em>v. <em>Olpherts, </em>100 U. S. 564; <em>Trimble </em>v. Woodhead, 102 U. S. 647.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-6\">It seems to be well settled, that in regard to real estate, the undisturbed possession of the wrong-doer for the time necessary to bar the action vests of itself a good title in the party holding such possession. It would be a curious application of this principle in the present case, which concerns real estate, to hold that this same lapse of time, instead of making good the defendant\u2019s title, or acting as a bar to the right to bring suit, transfers that right to another unimpaired by the lapse of time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-7\">The right of action, if any existed, to sue for the settlement of the partnership matters of J. M. 'Whitehill &amp; \u25a0 Co. accrued at the time of the dissolution of said firm on October 15,1877, and more than seven years next before the institution of this suit, and therefore the demand is stale and is barred as a cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>of action against the defendant Whitehill, by the statute of limitations of three years, of five years and of seven, years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-4\">\u2022 Constructive trusts and all trusts, save, purely equitable or express trusts, are in equity subject to the statute of limita-, tions. A clear distinction is made, recognized and acted on, between parties ,who are actual trustees of express trusts, and. those who are placed in relations of trust and confidence \u2014 between actual trustees created by deed, and whose relations can only be established by the deed creating the trust, and such persons as are constructively trustees, and whose relations as trustees may be established -by parol proof.

Should- this conclusion have been reached upon the facts admitted <em>% \u25a0 </em>By the terms of the agreement in question, the partnership was to continue for five years, provided Kiddle, Coleman &amp; Co. wished to remain in the coal business; but, if not, or if they desired to terminate this particular, connection, J. M. \"Whitehill &amp; Co. were \u201cto wind up-their affairs and sell the stock to the best advantage for all parties concerned.\u201d The five years ran out on the 7th day of March, 1875, but the firm went on in business. Many of the lots in question had been conveyed to Whitehill <em>&amp; </em>Co. prior to 1875, and the term of the lease of the river front did not expire until May, 1877, when it was renewed for twenty years, an indication that the firm had then no intention of bringing its business to an end. The management at Arkansas City was confided to Whitehill, while Kiddle, Coleman &amp; Co. furnished the capital invested in the plant, and the coal from year to year, dealing in which was the specific object of the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">On the 15th day of October, .1877, the firm of Kiddle, Coleman &amp; Co., which had then been carrying on business at 'Pittsburg for more than twenty-seven years, was compelled to make an assignment. If a member of an ordinary partnership assigns,-where the partnership is at will, the assignment dissolves it, and if it is not at will, the assignment may be treated by the other members -of the concern as a cause for dissolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>tion. The assignee of one partner cannot be made a member of a partnership against the will of the other partners, but the absolute right to have the affairs of the firm at once wound up; when the specified duration of the partnership has not expired, may be subject to modification according to circumstances. <em>Taft </em>v. Buffum, 14 Pick. 322; <em>Buford </em>v. Neeley, 2 Devereaux Eq. 48; <em>Monroe </em>v. Hamilton, 60 Alabama, 226; Lindley on Part. *364; <em>Helmore </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>35 Ch. Div. 436. In the case at bar J. M. Whitehill &amp; Co. continued in business after October, 1877, although the bill does not state for how long a time. The failure of Piddle, Coleman <em>&amp; </em>Co. presumably prevented their furnishing coal, yet the averments of the bill show that the business of Whitehill &amp; Co. had expanded far beyond the traffic to which it had been originally confined. But assuming that by the assignment the partnership of J. M. Whitehill <em>&amp; </em>Co. was dissolved, it was the duty of Whitehill to proceed at once to wind up the business and sell the stock to the best advantage, not only for himself, but for Piddle, Coleman <em>&amp; </em>Co.,.and this was in compliance with the express provisions of the agreement. It appears that a portion of the stock, to the amount of $16,000, was not sold until the 10th day of March, 1881, at which time the coal privilege at the landing was leased for ten years; and while some of the real estate had been disposed of, a large part remained yet to be divided, when the bill was filed. The proposed amendment showed that the firm\u2019s liabilities were not liquidated until 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">According to the allegations of the bill, on the 15th day of October, 1877, when Piddle, Coleman &amp; Co. assigned, the firm, of J. N. Whitehill &amp; Co. was the owner of town lots, of river front, residences, store-houses, and a hotel, bought and paid for with the partnership funds. The title stood in the name either of J. M. Whitehill or of J. M. Whitehill &amp; Co.; and part of the property was in use for partnership purposes -and so employed, while a part was not, but represented the investment of partnership gains. A partnership,- as such, could not hold the legal title to real estate, as it is not a person- in fact or in law, and the situation in this case is' well described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>Percifall </em>v. Pratt, 36 Arkansas, 464, where it was held: \u201c If the title be made to all the partners by name, \u00a3hey hold the legal title as tenants in common, without survivorship. If to one partner alone, -the whole legal title vests in him, which is the case, also, where the title is to a partnership name, which, as in this case, expresses the name of one party only, with the addition of \u2018 and company.\u2019 If the deed be to a name adopted as the firm style, which includes the name of no party, it' passes nothing in law. The same occurs where the deed is to one already dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYJ\">\u2022 As to this real estate, whether the deeds ran to J. M. Whitehill &amp; Co. or to J. M. Whitehill the latter held the title in trust, and it was so ruled in <em>McGuire </em>v. Ramsey, 9 Arkansas, 518. It is there said that \u201c where real estate is purchased and paid for with partnership funds, but conveyed to one of the partners alone, a trust results in favor of the other partners ; \u201d and that lapse of time \u201c cannot.be allowed in favor of one partner in possession of real estate against the other, for the possession of one is the possession of both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Lord Redesdale in <em>Hovenden </em>v. <em>Lord Annesley, </em>2 Sch. <em>&amp; </em>Lef. 607, 633, laid down the rule, that if the trust be constituted by act of the parties, the possession of the traste\u00e9 is the possession of the <em>cestui que </em>trust, and no length of such possession will bar; but if a party is to b\u00e9 constituted a trustee by the decree of a court of equity, founded on fraud or the like, his possession is adverse, and the statute of limitations will run from the time that the circumstances of the fraud were discovered. .</p>\n<p id=\"A92i\">\u201cAs a general rule, doubtless,\u201d said Mr. Justice Gray, delivering the opinion of the court in <em>Speidel </em>v. Henrici, 120 U. S. 377, 386, \u201c length of time is no bar to a trust clearly established, and express trusts are not within the statute of limit'ations, because the possession of the trustee is presumed to be the possession of his <em>cestui que trust.' </em>But this rule is, in accordance with the reason on \u2019Vhich it .is founded, and as has been clearly pointed out by Chancellor Kent and Mr. Justice Story, s\u00fab'ect. to this qualification, that time begins to run against a trust\u201e.as soon as it is openly disavowed by the trustee, insisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>upon an adverse right and interest which is clearly and unequivocally made known to the <em>cestui que </em>trust; as when, for instance, such transactions take place between the trustee and the <em>cestui .que trust </em>as tvould in case of tenants in common amount to an ouster of one of them by the other. ... In 1;he case of an implied or constructive trust, unless there has been a fraudulent concealment of the cause of action, lapse, of time is as complete a bar in equity as at law.\u201d Courts of equity sometimes act in obedience-to the statute, and sometimes apply it by way of analogy. Where the cause of action is legal and the statute ha's barred the remedy at'law,the defence is as complete in equity as at law, but where the case falls within the proper, peculiar and exclusive jurisdiction of a court of equity the statute is not necessarily applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Beal estate purchased with partnership funds for partnership uses, though the title be taken in. the'name of one partner, is in equity treated as personal property, so far as is. necessary to pay the debts of the partnership and to adjust, the equities of the partners; but the principle of equitable conversion has no further application. <em>Clagett </em>v. <em>Kilbourne, </em>1 Black, U. S. 346, 349; <em>Shanks </em>v. Klein, 104 U. S. 18; <em>Allen </em>v. Withrow, 110 U. S. 119; <em>Buchan </em>v. Sumner, 2 Barb. Ch. 165; <em>Collumb </em>v. <em>Read, </em>24 N. Y. 505. Whitehill here was .in possession for the benefit of the parties lawfully entitled, and apparently occupied no position adverse to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Gye, </em>L. R. 5 H. L. 656, the effect of the statute of limitations, 21 Jac. 1, c. 16, providing that all actions of account and upon the case should be commenced and sued within six years next after the cause of such action or suit, and not after, as repeated in the 9th section of the 19th <em>&amp; </em>20th Vict. c. 97, with this additional provision, namely, that \u201c no claim in respect of a matter which arose more than six years before the commencement of such action or suit shall be enforceable by action or suit by reason only of some other matter or claim comprised in the same account having arisen within six years next before the commencement of such action or suit,\u201d upon a bill for an account brought by the executor of a deceased partner against the survivor, more than six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>years after the death, was considered. It was held that the matter, namely, The dissolution of the partnership, and, consequently, the possession of the partnership property by the ' surviving partner, arose more than six years before the commencement of the suit and was barred; that the right of action arose upon the death of the deceased partner, and the cause of action was the possession of the partnership estate by the surviving partner; that where, in the matter of the enforcement of a legal right, a court of common law would, under the provisions of the statute of limitations, refuse the enforcement after the lapse of six years from the accruing of the right of action, a court of equity would, where its power to-grant relief was asked for under similar circumstances, adopt \u2022 the principle of the statute, and decline to grant such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Lords \"Westbury, Colonsay and Chelmsford concurred in the result, while the Lord Chancellor (Lord Iiatherley) dissented. It was held by Lord \"Westbury that \u201cthere is no fiduciary relation between a surviving partner and the representatives of his deceased partner; there are legal obligations between them equally binding on both ; \u201d but the Lord Chancellor insisted-with emphasis that \u201cthere is a fiduciary relation between them. The surviving partner alone having the legal interest in the partnership property, and being alone able to collect it, there arises a right in the representatives' of the deceased.partner to insist on the surviving parther holding the property, whenever -received, subject to the rights of the deceased partner, and he cannot make use of the partnership assets without being liable to an account for them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">.- We are not prepared to decide that there is a definite rule of law that statutes of limitation commence to run immediately upon the dissolution of a partnership, irrespective of the circumstances of the particular case. Hr.\u2019 Justice Lindley, in his excellent work on Partnership, says: \u201c So long, indeed, as \u00e1 partnership is subsisting, and each partner is exercising his rights and enjoying his own property, the statute of limitations-has,- it is conceived, no application at all; but as soon as the partnership is dissolved, or there is any exclusion of one partner by the others, the case is very different;, and the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ute begins to run.\u201d American ed. 1888, * 510. The learned author in his last edition cites <em>Xnox </em>v. <em>Gye, supra, </em>and <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Crawley, </em>10 Ch. Div. 31, in which Vice Chancellor Malins quotes the above language with commendation, and dissents from <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>L. R. 8 Eq. 499. Where, however, partnership affairs are being wound up in due course, without antagonism between the parties, or cause for judicial interference; where assets are being realized upon and liabilities extinguished, and no settlement has been made, the cause of action has not accrued, and the statute has not begun to run. Of course, where the partnership expires in accordance with its terras, or is dissolved by agreement, \u2022 each partner as a general rule has an\u2019 equal right to the possession of the partnership property, and if they cannot agree as to the disposition and division of it, a court of equity will appoint a receiver to collect and apply .the effects. Each partner has a right to have the partnership assets applied in liquidation of the partnership debts, and to have the surplus assets divided, and each may insist on a sale, and that nothing shall be done except with a view to wind up the concern. But in case of dissolution by death, surviving partners are invested with the exclusive right of possession and management of the whole partnership property and business, for the purpose of paying the partnership debts and disposing of the effects of the concern for the benefit of themselves and the estate of the deceased. <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Senter, </em>118 U. S. 1. If they go on with the business under the credit, and risking the effects of 'the firm, and profits result, they will be bound to account for those profits as belonging to the firm, and they are liable- to be charged with interest on the funds they use, though no profit, or even a loss, is made. And so, upon dissolution by an assignment, the solvent partners are in equity entitled to hold the effects and property in the way that surviving partners do, and if they continue the business it is at their own peril, in the absence of special provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">When the right of action accrues, so as to set the statute of limitations in motion, depends, as we have said, upon circumstances, and cannot be held as matter of law to arise at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>date of the dissolution, or to be carried back by relation to that date. <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Rafferty's Administrator, </em>30 N.

Ch. 417: In <em>Causler </em>v. <em>Wharton, </em>62 Alabama, 358, the court held that where one partner, by a written agreement with the other, left the partnership assets with him to dispose of, whenever he could do so at a fair price,' a continuing trust was thereby created, and the bar of the statute of limitations would not begin to run against the right to an account of the partnership dealings, so long as the party to whom the assets were delivered acted under the trust or admitted that it was still continuing. Under the agreement here, it is obvious that it was Whitehill Aho was to close up the business at Arkansas City, which had. been under his management; and under the averments of this bill such a trust was created as would not be barred by the statute of limitations until it was repudiated by Whitehill, which attitude on his part there is nothing here to disclose unless his defence to the bill may be construed as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>14 Arkansas, 62, it was held that \u201c the relation between copartners does not create such a trust as will exempt a bill for a mere account and settlement from the operation of the statute of limitations, or the analogous bar by lapse of time, or staleness of the demand.\u201d That was a case where a partner came into chancery eight years after the dissolution of the partnership, for an account and settlement, and no circumstances of fraud, accident or concealment were alleged to have prevented the settlement after the partnership affairs had been Avound up. The question of when the right of action accrued did not arise, nor was that anything more than, as stated by the court, a bill for a mere account and settlement ; whereas we have in this case the state of affairs which existed in <em>McGuire </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>9 Arkansas, 518, where, with respect to real estate paid for Avith partnership funds, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>held that the plea of the statute could not be allowed in favor of one partner in possession of such real estate as against the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The case of <em>Chouteau </em>v. Barlow, 110 U. S. 238, is very much in point. Sanford, Chouteau, Sarpy and Sire were copartners in business in St. Louis. During its existence the partnership purchased and paid for with the partnership funds, acre lahds and town lots in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and held the same for the benefit of the copartnership. The firm was dissolved in 1852 by the retirement of . Sanford, and some twenty-four years thereafter his executor and trustee filed a bill against the representatives of the other members of the firm, who had all died,- to compel an accounting touching the property of the partnership and the proceeds of such property. The dispute between the parties was as to the terms of the agreement of dissolution of the partnership in 1852. The complainants alleged that Sanford released to Chouteau all his interest in the estate of the firm, except its lahds and town lots in Minnesota, and that Chouteau- agreed to relieve Sanford from the debts of the firm and assure to him his proportion of the lands and town lots free from any debt or liability growing out of the copartnership affairs. The answer alleged that Chouteau agreed to relieve Sanford from the debts of the 'firm, and that Sanford released to Chouteau all his interest in the assets of the firm, including his interest in any of the lands and town lots \"in Minnesota; and further averred, by way of defence, that more than six years had elapsed since the accruing of any of the alleged causes of action set out in the bill. The opinion of the court thus concludes: \u201c On the whole case, we are of opinion, that,- after the dissolution of the St. Louis firm, the members other than Sanford were entitled to collect and dispose of all its assets, including the Minnesota \u00a3 outfit \u2019 and the Minnesota lands, to liquidate its affairs, without the interference of Sanford; that all claim on their part against Sanford individually was relinquished, leaving recourse only to those assets; and that, if there should be any surplus of those assets, after paying the debts of the firm and- the advances of any of the other partners therefor, Sanford\u2019s executors would bei entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>to his proper proportion of such surplus. No judicial accounting has been had on the basis of the rights of the parties as we have defined them. The bill prays that the defendants may account touching the affairs and property of the copartnership and touching the proceeds of any such property. We think the plaintiffs are entitled to such an accounting, and are not barred from it by laches or by the operation of any statute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In the. case at bar, the business of Kiddle, Coleman &amp; Co. was finally wound up by the. payment of its debts in full, to do which, as we understand the bill, coupled with the terms of the deed to the complainants, a public sale was had with the consent of the creditors, and the complainants purchased the interest in and the rights and claims against certain companies and individuals in the South, along the Mississippi Kiver, including the interest and claims against Whitehill and the late firm of I. M. Whitehill <em>&amp; </em>Co. This was within four years after Whitehill had disposed of the enumerated assets, and made the lease of the coaling privilege, and within three years after the payment of the outstanding indebtedness, according to the amendment. Certainly Whitehill ought not to be allowed to complain that he was permitted to take his time in selling the stock of the concern to the best advantage; and it is clear, as the case stands at present, that the statute did not run as against the trust in the real estate conveyed to him or to \u00cd. M. Whitehill <em>&amp; </em>Co., and purchased with the money of the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\n<em>The decree is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to allow the complainants to amend thevr bill, andfor further proceedings in conformity with this opinion..</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
