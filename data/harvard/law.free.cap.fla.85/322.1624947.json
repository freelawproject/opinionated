Gen. Stats. 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">There are no statutes regulating the procedure in contempt eases in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">As to contempts at common law and the procedure, Blackstone says: \u201cContempts are either <em>direct, </em>which openly insult or resist the powers of the courts or the persons of the judges who preside there, or else <em>consequential, </em>which (without such gross insolence or direct'opposition) plainly tend to create a universal disregard of their authority and if the contempt be committed in the face of the court, the offender may be instantly apprehended and imprisoned, at the discretion of the judges, without any further proof or examination. But in matters that arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>at a distance, and of which the court cannot have so perfect a knowledge, unless by the confession of the party or the testimony of others, if the judges upon <em>affidavit </em>see sufficient ground to suspect that a contempt has been committed, they either make a rule on the suspected party to show cause why an attachment should not issue against him, or, in very flagrant instances of contempt, the attachment issues in the first instance; as it also does if no sufficient cause be shown to discharge; and thereupon the court confirms and makes absolute the original rule. This process of attachment is merely intended to bring the party into court; and, when there, he must either stand committed, or put in bail, in order to answer upon oath to such interrogatories as shall be administered to him for the better information of the court with respect to the circumstances of the contempt. These interrogatories are in the nature of a charge or accusation, and must by the course of the court be exhibited within the first four days; and if any of the interrogatories are improper, the defendant may refuse to answer it, and move the court to have it struck out. If the party can clear himself upon oath, he is discharged; but, if perjured, may be prosecuted for the perjury. If he confesses the contempt, the court will proceed to correct him by fine or imprisonment, or both, and sometimes by a corporal or infamous punishment. If the contempt be of such nature that, when the fact is once acknowledged, the court can receive no further information by interrogatories than it is already possessed of, the defendant may be admitted to make such simple acknowledgment, and receive' his judgment without answering to any interrogatories; but if he wilfully and obstinately refuses to answer, or answers in an evasive manner, he is then clearly guilty of a high and repeated contempt, to be punished at the discretion of the court. In equity after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the party in contempt has answered the interrogatories, such his answer may be contradicted and disproved by-<em>affidavits </em>of the adverse party; whereas, in the courts of law, the admission of the party to purge'himself by oath is more favorable to his liberty, though perhaps not less dangerous to his conscience; for, if he clears himself by his answers, the complaint is totally dismissed. This method of examining the delinquent himself upon oath, with regard to the contempt alleged, is at least of as high antiquity, and by long and immemorial usage is now become the law of the land.\u201d 4 Lewis\u2019 Blackstone Com. p. 286 <em>et seq. </em>and Notes; Appeal of Verdon, 89 N. J. L. 16, 97 Atl. Rep. 783; In re Gonzalez, 88 N. J. L. 536, 97 Atl. Rep. 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In contempt proceedings at common law the general rule is that if the matters complained of were not perpetrated in the presence of the court or judge or so near the court or judge as to impede or embarrass judicial procedure, the rule issued to the accused to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt, should be predicated upon affidavits of those who have personal knowledge of the facts alleged as the contempt. If the charge is not so predicated the rule should be discharged or quashed upon appropriate motion. See 13 C. J. 64 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">If the charges duly made are admitted to be true and they clearly constitute contempt whether so intended, or not, appropriate punishment follows. If the matters charged and admitted to be true are ambiguous or do not clearly constitute contempt, and an intent to offend is duly denied under oath, a discharge from custody follows. See In re. Chadwick, 109 Mich. 588, 67 N. W. Rep. 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">If the matters charged are denied under oath and the denial is false, prosecution for perjury is the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>It does not appear that the Circuit Judge had any personal knowledge of the making of the statements alleged to have been made about him, or of the respondent\u2019s part, if any, in the publication of the statements, and there are no affidavits supporting the allegations in the rule that the respondent made the statements and \u201ccaused them to be published\u201d in a newspaper in another county and judicial circuit; therefore the 8th ground of the motion to quash the rule was well taken. See <em>Ex parte </em>Duncan, 78 Tex. Crim. 447, 182 S. W. Rep. 313, 2 A. L. R. 222 and note; 13 C. J. 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In view of the finding of the Circuit Judge that the published statements \u201ccame to the attention of this court and did embarrass this court in determining the ease\u201d on appeal before him, and as in <em>habeas oorpios </em>the scope of the inquiry is limited to matters affecting the authority to imprison for contempt, those matters will be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The respondent does not appear to have been an owner or editor or officer of the newspaper in which the publication was made. See Telegram Newspaper Co. v. Commonwealth, 172 Mass. 294, 52 N. E. Rep. 445, 44 L. R. A. 159; <em>In re </em>Hayes, 72 Fla. 558, 73 South. Rep. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">1 The statements with reference to- the Judge found to have been made and published, were made and published 'in another city in another county and judicial circuit. There was no jury for the publication to affect. Even though by reasonable inference the speech complained of and its publication, as set out in the statement, were intended to be and were personally offensive to the judge to whom the statements referred, -and as such were an unjustifiable personal affront, yet such statements as made and published in another county and circuit even though they \u201ccame to the attention of the court,\u201d could, in view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>of the assumed character and fortitude of a Circuit Judge, reasonably have had no real tendency to embarrass the court in determining the cause referred to,- or to interfere with and hinder and embarrass the court in arriving at a decision and final order in said cause. This being so, the express finding of the judge that \u201cthe speech and threats and insinuations and words as set forth and alleged in the rule nisi, came to the attention of this Court and did embarrass this Court in determining the said cause of Antelo v. Bailey, and did interfere with and hinder and embarrass this Court in arriving at a decision and final order in said cause, \u2019 \u2019 is not warranted by the acts charged and found to have been committed as charged. As a necessary result, the finding is in law not a sufficient predicate for the order adjudging imprisonment of the respondent, petitioner here, as for contempt of court. The determining point is not alone what effect the acts complained of actually had on the Judge but what were the reasonable tendencies of the acts with reference to the integrity of the court and to the performance- of judicial functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The right to make fair comments and criticisms of official conduct, does not warrant or excuse offensive statements reflecting upon officials as such; but unless acts or words of criticism or condemnation affecting a judicial officer not perpetrated in or near his presence when acting judicially, are of such a nature and occur under such circumstances as to offend the court as such or to hinder or embarrass the orderly discharge of judicial functions, such acts, words or other conduct do not in general warrant imprisonment as for contempt of court. See <em>Ex parte </em>Earman, decided this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">A Circuit Judge is expected to be a man of ordinary firmness of character; and if the matter complained of as constituting contempt, when fairly interpreted, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>have a reasonable tendency to degrade or to embarrass or hinder such a judge in performing his own duty, or to affect a mind of reasonable fortitude it is not a criminal contempt for which imprisonment may be lawfully adjudicated, particularly when an intent to offend is denied on oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Generally it is the nature and reasonable tendencies of the matter complained of that controls; and if the matter is of doubtful tendency or might or might not be considered ambiguous as to its general or specific purpose, the circumstances under which the thing was done or in which its consequences are to appear, may be considered in determining the reasonable tendency of the matter to affect judicial authority or dignity; and express denials of a desire or an intent to offend, when duly supported or corroborated by pertinent circumstances may be considered in determining the real nature and reasonable tendency of the matter complainned of as being calculated to affect the functions of the court. See 6 R. C. L. 584; <em>In re. </em>Chadwick, 109 Mich. 588, 67 N. W. Rep. 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The statement that the Judge \u201cis as weak as water\u201d was made in another circuit and not in or near the presence of the Judge when acting judicially so as to be a direct insult to the court as a tribunal, and the statement under the circumstances, had a personal rather than a judicial reference, particularly when considered in connection with another statement in the same speech that the Judge was a candidate for another office. The statement that \u201cour court is absolutely annulled if a man has money and influence,\u201d had reference to the municipal' court in which the convictions referred to were had; and the part of the statement as to \u201cmoney and influence\u201d may reasonably have had reference to the expense and help necessary in employing counsel and paying costs and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>giving' bond in obtaining a review of convictions adjudicated in the municipal court. The statement that he spoke \u201cwithout fear of being in contempt,\u201d like the other statements, is ambiguous and did not necessarily reflect upon the court and could not impede judicial functionsy'The respondent denied under oath that he intended to reflect upon or impugn the integrity of the judge and denied that he caused the statement to be published. These denials should be given due weight in determining whether a contempt of court was committed. All the statements were made in one speech in another circuit, and even if the respondent caused them to be published in a newspaper that circulated within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Judge, the statements when taken together and considered in the light of the attending circumstances, were not a direct -insult to or in the presence of the court as a judicial tribunal, and they had no real tendency to hinder or impede or in any way to affect the judicial functions of the Circuit Judge, who proceeded in due course to dispose of the pending ease as his judicial authority and duty appeared to him. See 13 C. J. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In <em>Ex parte </em>Hayes, 72 Fla. 558, 73 South. Rep. 362, the respondents were writers for or connected with the newspaper that published, within the jurisdiction of the court while it was in daily session, plain and ambiguous charges against the integrity of the court, and the newspapers were circulated in the presence of the court. Upon the filing of an admission of the publication with a disclaimer of any intent to reflect upon the court, the respondents were adjudged guilty of contempt because of the plainly impugning nature of the admitted publication, and the respondents were discharged upon payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In this ease the person who made the statement about the Circuit Judge was apparently not connected with or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>writer for the nenwspaper in which the.publication was made, the newspaper was published in another judicial circuit, there was no affidavit to support the charge that the respondent \u201ccaused\u201d the publication to be made and the respondent specifically denied under oath that he \u201ccaused\u201d the publication to be made in the newspaper which was circulated in the circuit where the judge resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The petitioner will be discharged.</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-6\">Taylor, C.

Ex parte Pitts, 35 Fla. 149, 17 South. Rep. 96; Ex parte Prince, 27 Fla. 196, 9 South. Rep. 659; Ex parte Bowen, 25 Fla. 214, 6 South. Rep. 65,\u201d cited in Ex parte Senior, 37 Fla. 1, 19 South. Rep. 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">The rule adopted, in the Senior case, <em>supra, </em>is the rule which obtains in this State and the one supported by the courts generally throughout the United States. It is: \u201cthat the conduct charged as constituting the contempt must be such that <em>some degree </em>of delinquency or- misbehavior can be predicated of it; for if the act be <em>plainly indifferent </em>or meritorious, or if it be only the assertion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the undoubted, right of the party it will not become a criminal contempt by being adjudged to be so. The question whether the alleged offender really committed the act charged, will be conclusively determined by the order or judgment of the court; and so with equivocal acts, which may be culpable or innocent according to the circumstances ; but where the act is necessarily innocent or justifiable, it would be preposterous to hold it a cause of imprisonment. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is, according to the rule announced in the Senior case, <em>supra, </em>conclusive upon Mr. Biggers that he committed the acts charged. Whether he actually printed the article in the newspaper is immaterial. He gave publicity to his thoughts and words by publicly expressing them in a speech before the assembled members and visitors at a meeting of the Florida League of Municipalities. Be that however as it may, according to the decision and opinion of this court in the Senior case, the charge that he caused the spoken words to be published in the newspaper is conclusively determined by the order or judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The \u201coverwhelming weight of authority\u201d is that \u201cwhere a court has jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, and of the subject-matter out of which the alleged contempt arises, he is not entitled to relief by means of this writ.\u201d 6 R. C. L. 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The Senior case, <em>supra, </em>modifies the rule to the extent stated. Any further modification of the rule seems not to be justified by precedent or principle. The views expressed by the court in <em>Ex parte Hayes, </em>72 Fla. 558, 73 South. Rep. 362, are in conformity with the views entertained by the courts generally upon the subject of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The words of Mr. Biggers cannot be said to be \u201cplainly indifferent or meritorious\u201d nor \u201conly the assertion of the undoubted right of the party,\u201d nor can they be said to be either innocent or justifiable. I think his words amounted to a charge against the judge of inefficiency and venality. Whether his words actually influenced the court or not is not the test of liability as it is impossible to say just what effect such an attempt has had. 6 R. C. L. 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">I am not concerned nor should an appellate court be concerned with the expediency or propriety of a circuit judge\u2019s action in noticing any such verbal attacks upon him.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
