Staehle, appeals from the judgment of the trial court awarding him compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees on counts of conversion and violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) failed to allow attorney\u2019s fees for the department of motor vehicles (DMV) administrative hearing, (2) awarded only partial attorney\u2019s fees for the CUTPA action, and (3) failed to award sufficient punitive damages. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The trial court found the following facts. On or about January 22, 1990, the defendants, Michael\u2019s Garage, Inc., and Jack Michael, president and treasurer of Michael\u2019s Garage, Inc., through their agents, servants or employees, towed the plaintiff\u2019s 1972 Chevrolet pickup truck from a parking lot of the Chestnut Hill apartment complex in Middletown to the defendants\u2019 junkyard located at 314 Turkey Hill Road in Haddam. On March 3,1990, after repeated attempts to have the vehicle returned, the plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants with the DMV. An administrative hearing was held by the DMV to determine whether the defendants had violated specific licensing provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-67m (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 14-67n.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought either party or intervenor status, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-177a. The request was denied as untimely, but the DMV hearing officer indicated that the DMV hearing would not affect the plaintiffs right to bring a civil suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The DMV hearing officer concluded that the defendants had violated General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-150 (g),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>14-67m (a) and (b), and 14-67n. Pursuant to the DMV\u2019s decision, the defendants were required to make restitution to the plaintiff in the amount of $600.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The plaintiff subsequently brought a civil action, alleging conversion and violation of CUTPA. The trial court concluded that the defendants\u2019 actions constituted both a conversion and a violation of CUTPA and awarded damages of $2025 plus interest in the amount of $708.55 on the conversion count, and $2025 in punitive damages and $11,250 in attorney\u2019s fees on the CUTPA count. The plaintiff appeals from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly excluded the work performed by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney for the DMV proceeding in the calculation of attorney\u2019s fees under General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>In deciding this issue, we look first to the language of General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d). In analyzing the statutory language, we employ the standard rules of statutory construction. \u201cTo determine the collectively expressed legislative intent, we look first to the language of the statute itself. If that language is plain and unambiguous, we go no further. ... If, however, the statute is ambiguous, e.g., either opaque or susceptible to alternative conflicting interpretations, we will seek guidance from \u2018extrinsic aids,\u2019 e.g., the legislative history.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 187, 592 A.2d 912 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">According to the statute, \u201cthe court <em>may award, </em>to the plaintiff, in addition to the relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees based on the work reasonably performed by an attorney . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d). The use of the word \u201cmay\u201d indicates that the statute does not provide a mandatory award of fees to the plaintiff; rather, the court has discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees. The language of the statute is clear and unambiguous; the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees is within the discretion of the trial court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The cases interpreting the attorney\u2019s fees provision of CUTPA also indicate that the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees is within the discretion of the trial court. In <em>Gargano </em>v. <em>Heyman, </em>203 Conn. 616, 622, 525 A.2d 1343 (1987), our Supreme Court held that \u201c[ajwarding . . . attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA is discretionary . . . and the exercise of such discretion will not ordinarily be interfered with on appeal unless the abuse is manifest or injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Citations omitted.) See also <em>Woronecki </em>v. <em>Trappe, </em>228 Conn. 574, 580-81 n.7, 637 A.2d 783 (1994); <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 590, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989); <em>Ven Nguyen </em>v. <em>DaSilva, </em>10 Conn. App. 527, 530, 523 A.2d 1369 (1987); <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Petrazzuoli Bros., Inc., </em>10 Conn. App. 22, 32-33, 521 A.2d 212 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The trial court concluded that the defendants\u2019 actions with regard to the plaintiff were in violation of CUTPA. Pursuant to \u00a7 42-110g (d), the trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff in the amount of $11,225, noting that this award did not include the $7626.72 in attorney\u2019s fees related to the DMV proceeding. We conclude that the trial court reasonably could have determined that the legal expenses incurred in the DMV proceeding should be excluded from a calculation of attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA. \u201cCUTPA . . . allow[s] attorney\u2019s fees only subject to the sound discretion of the court\u201d; <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>supra, 209 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>590; and this court will not upset the trial court\u2019s judgment without a showing of manifest abuse of discretion or injustice. There being no indication of either in this case, we conclude that it was within the discretion of the trial court to exclude attorney\u2019s fees related to the DMY proceeding in its award of attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly awarded only partial attorney\u2019s fees for the CUTPA action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">As noted previously, \u201c[ajwarding . . . attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA is discretionary . . . and the exercise of such discretion will not ordinarily be interfered with on appeal unless the abuse is manifest or injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Gargano </em>v. <em>Heyman, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 622. The statute contains no standard by which a court is to award attorney\u2019s fees, thus leaving it to the sole discretion of the trial court to determine if attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded and the amount of such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">In <em>St. Margaret\u2019s-McTernan School, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>31 Conn. App. 594, 627 A.2d 449 (1993), we concluded that an award of $500 in attorney\u2019s fees was improper, and directed to the trial court to determine reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court in <em>St. Margaret\u2019s </em>made no finding that the fees awarded were either reasonable or unreasonable. This case is distinguishable from <em>St. Margaret\u2019s </em>because, here, the trial court implicitly found that the amount of fees awarded was reasonable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In its memorandum of deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>sion, the trial court adopted the reasonableness standard contained in General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d) and thus impliedly found that the attorney\u2019s fees awarded were reasonable. This is further demonstrated through the trial court\u2019s citation to <em>Barco Auto Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>House, </em>202 Conn. 106, 520 A.2d 162 (1987), for the proposition that a court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding less than the full amount of attorney\u2019s fees claimed, on the basis of that court\u2019s implied finding that the fees awarded were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to award sufficient punitive damages. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">We first analyze the language of the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOg (a) provides that \u201c[t]he court <em>may, in its discretion, </em>award punitive damages . . . as it deems necessary or proper.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The language is clear and unambiguous; the awarding of punitive damages is within the discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The standard for awarding punitive damages under CUTPA was established in <em>Gargano </em>v. <em>Heyman, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 622, where our Supreme Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>punitive damages are available when there is evidence of <em>\u201ca </em>reckless indifference to the rights of others or an intentional and wanton violation of those rights. ... In fact, the flavor of the basic requirement to justify an award of punitive damages is described in terms of wanton and malicious injury, evil motive and violence. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Although the statute provides no guidance as to a method for determining the amount of a punitive damages award, several methods have gained acceptance by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The method used in this case for determining punitive damages was to award an amount equal to the plaintiffs actual damages.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This is a recognized method for determining punitive damages under CUTPA. See <em>Tessmann </em>v. <em>Tiger Lee Construction Co., </em>228 Conn. 42, 43, 634 A.2d 870 (1993); <em>Lembo </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, </em>15 Conn. App. 150, 153, 543 A.2d 780 (1988). It is not an abuse of discretion to award punitive damages based on a multiple of actual damages. See, e.g., <em>Bailey Employment System, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>545 F. Sup. 62, 73 (D. Conn. 1982), aff'd, 723 F.2d 895 (2d Cir. 1983); <em>Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co., </em>193 Conn. 208, 234-38, 477 A.2d 988 (1984); <em>Lembo </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, </em>supra, 155-56. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding punitive damages in an amount equal to actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a) provides: \u201cNo person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-67m (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cEach motor vehicle junk yard licensee shall maintain a suitable office and keep accurate records of all motor vehicles or major component parts thereof received, dismantled or sold.

Unless title has already vested in the municipality pursuant to subsection (d), if the current market value of such motor vehicle as determined in good faith by such owner or keeper does not exceed five hundred dollars and such motor vehicle has been stored for a period of not less than fifteen days, such owner or keeper may, unless an application filed by the owner pursuant to subsection (d) of this section is pending and the owner of such motor vehicle has notified such owner or keeper that such application for hearing has been filed, sell the same for storage and towing charges owed thereon, pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>vided a notice of intent to sell shall be sent to the commissioner and the owner of such motor vehicle, if known, five days before the sale of such vehicle. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b476-11\"> The amount was set at $600 on the basis of the valuation report of Inspector Richard Santoro of the dealers and repairers division of the DMV. This valuation method does not take into consideration the contents of the truck, including three outboard motors and various tools allegedly in the truck\u2019s bed when towed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">In the CUTPA action, the trial court valued the items as follows: three outboard motors at $1150, vehicle\u2019s cap at $500, four outboard motor gas tanks at $125, tools and a toolbox at $150 and two snow tires at $100. The total fair market value was $2025.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b476-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d) provides: \u201cIn any action brought by a person under this section, the court may award, to the plaintiff, in addition to the relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees based on the work reasonably performed by an attorney and not on the amount of recovery. In a class action in which there is no monetary recovery, but other relief is granted on behalf of a class, the court may award, to the plaintiff, in addition to other relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. In any action brought under this section, the court may, in its discretion, order, in addition to damages or in lieu of damages, injunctive or other equitable relief.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> Although the plain language of the statute is unambiguous, and we need not examine the legislative history, we note that the legislative history plainly supports our conclusion that the legislative intent was that the award of attorney\u2019s fees would be in the discretion of the trial court. CUTPA was enacted in 1973. The purpose of the statute was to provide a remedy for consumers who had been victimized by unfair or deceptive trade practices, through both private and public enforcement. R. Langer &amp; D. Ormstedt, \u201cThe Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act,\u201d 54 Conn. B. J. 388, 389-90 (1980). In 1976, an amendment to the statute was made concerning attorney\u2019s fees. Prior to the amendment, the court could award attorney\u2019s fees to either party, plaintiff or defendant. The 1976 amendment allowed for the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff only.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">During the legislative debate of the 1976 amendment, Representative Alan H. Nevas commented that \u201c[w]hen the initial legislation was enacted, the language provided that if there was litigation, the court, at the end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>of that litigation, <em>could make an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees to either party, depending on the discretion of the court </em>and in its judgment as to which party should be entitled to such an award.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 19 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1976 Sess., p. 2189. Responding to a complaint that the new amendment would be unfairly harsh to businessmen, Senator Louis S. Ciccarello observed, \u201cI think it\u2019s fair and I think it should also be pointed out that <em>reasonable attorney\u2019s fees are granted only upon discretion of the court, so therefore, a plaintiff may not be able to receive any fees whatsoever. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 19 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1976 Sess., p. 2278. These comments strongly indicate that the intent behind \u00a7 42-110g (d) was for an award of attorney\u2019s fees to be determined at the discretion of the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b479-9\"> The plaintiff requested attorney\u2019s fees of $28,468.53. The trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees of $11,250.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\"> Another distinguishing factor is that the <em>St. Margaret\u2019s </em>case involved a contract that \u201cexpressly allowed for \u2018all attorney\u2019s fees and reasonable costs of collection for any outstanding amounts due under this contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>St. Margaret\u2019s-McTernan School, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>598-99. This provision of the contract was quoted by this court in its decision to vacate the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees, and was an additional factor in the decision to vacate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a) provides: \u201cAny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b, may bring an action in the judicial district in which the plaintiff or defendant resides or has his principal place of business or is doing business, to recover actual damages.
