We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On May 17, 1992, New Haven police officers Andrew Muro and Peter Carusone were working in the Newhallville section of New Haven. Muro received information from an informant that the defendant was selling drugs at 51 Lilac Street, which was approximately 820 feet from the Lincoln Bassett School. He and Carusone, both of whom knew the defendant, drove by the address and saw the defendant on the front porch. They set up a surveillance of the defendant\u2019s activities. Muro watched the front porch from a nearby alley. Carusone remained at a police substation parking lot, ready to assist Muro upon apprehension of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Muro observed a female walk up to the porch of the building and heard her say she \u201cwanted one.\u201d The defendant reached into his right pants pocket, pulled out a clear plastic bag, removed an item from it, and handed it to the female. The female then gave the defendant money. A short time later, Muro saw the defendant carry out a second transaction with another individual similar to the previous transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">After informing Carusone of his observations, the officers returned to the premises under surveillance where Muro encountered the defendant in the hallway and arrested him. In his right pocket, the defendant had a clear plastic bag containing packets of white powder that field-tested positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury on an essential element of the crime charged, thereby depriving him of his federal and state due process rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He asserts that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>trial court failed to instruct the jury that a conviction pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 21a-278a (b) required the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant specifically intended to sell narcotics in, on or within 1000 feet of the real property of a public or private elementary or secondary school. The defendant contends that a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 21a-278a (b) requires a dual intent: (1) the violator must intend to sell the narcotics in his possession; and (2) the violator must intend to sell the narcotics within 1000 feet of a school. This conclusion, the defendant asserts, is supported by the presence of an \u201cirrebuttable presumption\u201d in the statute that any defendant within the 1000 foot zone intended to sell the drugs in his possession. He finds this presumption in the following statutory language: \u201cTo constitute a violation of this subsection, an act of transporting or possessing a controlled substance shall be with intent to sell or dispense in or on, or within one thousand feet of, the real property comprising a public or private elementary or secondary school.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 21a-278a (b). The defendant concedes that this claim was not properly preserved at trial, but contends that it is nonetheless reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>is not of constitutional magnitude and, therefore, does not satisfy the second requirement of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">\u201cIt is . . . constitutionally axiomatic that the jury be instructed on the essential elements of a crime charged.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>206 Conn. 685, 708, 539 A.2d 561 (1988). \u201cThe due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects an accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>192 Conn. 405, 413, 473 A.2d 300 (1984). Consequently, the failure to instruct a jury on an element of a crime deprives a defendant of the right \u201c \u2018to have the jury told what crimes he is actually being tried for and what the essential elements of those crimes are.\u2019 \u201d Id., 414.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Proof that the defendant specifically intended to sell narcotics within 1\u00d300 feet of the real property of a school is not an element of the crime charged. In interpreting \u00a7 21a-278a (b), we must adhere to \u201c \u2018well defined principles of statutory interpretation that require us to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u2019 . . . To determine the intent of the legislature, we first consider whether the statutory language \u2018yields a plain and unambiguous resolution.\u2019 ... \u2018If the words are clear and unambiguous, \u201cit is assumed that [they] express the intention of the legislature\u201d; <em>Mazur </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>184 Conn. 116, 118-19, 441 A.2d 65 (1981); and we need inquire no further. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>210 Conn. 573, 576, 556 A.2d 584 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>The language of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 21a-278a (b) is clear that any person who violates General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278, and who does so within 1000 feet of a school shall be subject to an additional penalty of three years imprisonment. The provision that the defendant characterizes as an \u201cirrebuttable presumption\u201d serves instead to reinforce the requirement that, for an accused to be subject to the additional penalty, any act of transporting or possessing narcotics must be with the intent to sell the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The relationship between General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278a (b) and 21a-278 is similar to that between General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59a<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 53a-59.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>53a-59a provides for an enhanced penalty if a person commits an assault in the first degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (2) or \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) and the victim is sixty years old or older. <em>In State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>180 Conn. 557, 564, 429 A.2d 960 (1980), our Supreme Court stated that \u201c[b]y providing for a mandatory one year term of imprisonment, which term may not be suspended or reduced, for the crime of assault in the third degree where the victim is sixty or over the legislature clearly expressed its intent to punish one convicted of that crime more severely than one convicted of assault in the third degree where the victim is under sixty.\u201d Similarly, the legislature designed \u00a7 21a-278a to punish one convicted of a violation of \u00a7 21a-278 more severely when the prohibited activity occurred within a prescribed distance from a school.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">To obtain a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 2 la-278a (b), as with \u00a7 53a-59a, the state is required to prove the defendant\u2019s intent to commit the substantive underlying crime \u2014 in this case, the intent to sell the narcotics in his possession. The fact that the defendant sold narcotics within 1000 feet of a school subjects him to the enhanced penalty. It was not required to prove that the defendant specifically intended to sell within the 1000 foot zone because, by the clear language of the statute, such an intent is not an element of the crime.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We conclude that the trial court properly instructed the jury as to the intent necessary to support a conviction of the crime charged. Because the defendant\u2019s claim is not one of constitutional dimension; <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40; we decline to review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The defendant further claims that the trial court improperly refused to allow the defendant to elicit certain testimony relating to his defense of drug dependency. He claims that the court\u2019s refusal violated his constitutional right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The following facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. The defendant and his brother-in-law, Willie Garvin, testified as to the defendant\u2019s drug dependence. The defendant sought to elicit further testimony as to his dependency from Lester Moore. During the defendant\u2019s direct examination of Moore, the defendant inquired as to whether the witness had ever used drugs with the defendant, and the state objected.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court, after excusing the jury, heard the parties\u2019 arguments, sustained the state\u2019s objection, and noted the defendant\u2019s exception. The defendant, however, failed to present an offer of proof as to Moore\u2019s testimony, and failed to request that the trial court articulate its reason for sustaining the state\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In order to evaluate any claim of error, this court must be furnished with \u201can adequate record on which to review the rulings of the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James L., </em>26 Conn. App. 81, 86, 598 A.2d 663 (1991). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>It is the appellant\u2019s burden to create an adequate appellate record to support his claim. Id., 84. The defendant has failed to meet this burden. \u201cIf he wanted to provide this court with an adequate appellate record, he should have presented an offer of proof. An offer of proof, properly presented, serves three purposes. First, it should inform the court of the legal theory under which the offered evidence is admissible. Second, it should inform the trial judge of the specific nature of the offered evidence so the court can judge its admissibility. Third, it thereby creates a record adequate for appellate review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">\u201cIn the absence of an appropriate offer of proof, this court cannot speculate as to what line of questioning defense counsel intended to follow. A claim on appeal cannot be based on an assumption that the trial court acted improperly. . . . Without an adequate record on which to review the rulings of the trial court, this court must assume that the trial court acted properly.\u201d Id., 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the defendant\u2019s drug dependency. He concedes that this claim is unpreserved but again seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">A <em>Golding </em>review permits an appellant tribunal \u201cto respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d Id., 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">\u201c[T]he language of \u00a7 21a-269, which places the \u2018burden of proof\u2019 on a defendant invoking the exemption specified by \u00a7 21a-278 (b), requires the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>carry the burden of persuading the jury by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is drug-dependent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>221 Conn. 595, 609, 605 A.2d 1366 (1992). In <em>Hart, </em>the court \u201cconclude[d] that the state did not have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not drug-dependent . . . .\u201d Id., 611-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">\u201c[T]he absence of drug dependency is not an element of the offense of sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b). Rather, it is an exemption from liability under \u00a7 21a-269. <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 166, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981). Therefore, it was not necessary for the state to negate drug dependency, but, rather, the defendant had the burden of proving that she was drug-dependent.\u201d Id., 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Because the claimed error does not involve an element of the offense, it is not of constitutional magnitude. The defendant\u2019s claim does not satisfy the second prong of <em>Golding </em>and we decline to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The defendant finally claims that the trial court improperly permitted the state to impeach his testimony by referring to a prior conviction for conspiracy to sell narcotics. The defendant, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>194 Conn. 1, 480 A.2d 489 (1984), argues that the admission of the prior narcotics conviction in a trial in which he is charged with narcotics offenses was unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The defendant testified in his own behalf. His testimony sought to demonstrate that he was drug-dependent, thereby rendering inconsistent the police officers\u2019 account of his intention to sell drugs. When asked on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the state\u2019s cross-examination whether he had ever sold drugs, the defendant replied that he had not. The state also asked the defendant whether he dealt drugs to maintain his lifestyle. The trial court ruled that a proper foundation for introducing the defendant\u2019s prior conviction had been laid for the purposes of impeaching his credibility, and allowed the state to question the defendant about his 1989 conviction for conspiracy to distribute narcotics.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\u201cEvidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice. . . . It is well established that the trial court has discretion on the admissibility of prior convictions. In such instances, the test is whether the prejudicial effect of the evidence did not outweigh its probative value. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>221 Conn. 58, 72, 602 A.2d 571 (1992).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>29 Conn. App. 584, 588, 617 A.2d 174 (1992), appeal dismissed, 228 Conn. 59, 634 A.2d 293 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\u201cThree factors should be examined to determine whether a prior criminal conviction properly has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>admitted: (1) the extent to which admission is likely to prejudice the defendant\u2019s cause; (2) the significance of the prior crime as bearing on the defendant\u2019s truthfulness; and (3) the remoteness in time of the prior conviction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 11.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">\u201c \u2018As to the first criterion, a high degree of prejudice can be expected when the prior crime is quite similar to the crime charged because of the jury\u2019s tendency to believe that \u201cif he did it before, he probably did it again.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>[189 Conn. 631, 644, 458 A.2d 379 (1983)].\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 73. The defendant argues that it is for this reason that the evidence is overly prejudicial, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 1. In <em>Geyer, </em>the court held that evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions was inadmissible because they were similar to the charges pending, and, therefore, the resulting prejudice outweighed the probative value as to the defendant\u2019s credibility. The <em>Geyer </em>court, however, was faced with four rather remote prior convictions that tended to engender \u201ca greater prejudice than a single prior conviction might create.\u201d Id., 14. The court weighed the prejudicial possibility of the multiple, similar prior convictions. The court did not hold that if a defendant had a prior conviction or convictions similar to the pending charges, evidence of those convictions were inadmissible as a per se rule. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 74.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 588, the court was presented with evidence of a similar prior conviction, but determined that \u201c[w]here . . . a <em>party </em>\u2018opens the door\u2019 to a subject that goes directly to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>credibility of the witness, he does so at his risk.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this case, the state questioned the defendant and he testified that he had never sold drugs and that he did not deal drugs to maintain his lifestyle. He also testified that he did whatever handy work necessary to get drugs for his alleged dependency, and that because of his dependency, he would fight to retain drugs rather than consider exchanging them for money. \u201cThis testimony suggested the nonexistence of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction [for conspiracy to distribute drugs] and squarely implicated the defendant\u2019s credibility.\u201d Id., 589. Therefore, the defendant opened the door to the introduction of a prior conviction because it went directly to his credibility as a witness. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the state to elicit testimony from the defendant with regard to his prior drug related conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years.
