On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the arbitrators exceeded their authority or imperfectly executed their powers in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the trial court improperly denied the application to vacate. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case with direction to render judgment vacating the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The record discloses the following facts. In October, 1986, the defendant, the city of Waterbury, properly appointed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lieutenant Erwin Hale to the temporary position of acting fire marshal. Hale held this position until his retirement in August, 1987. Upon retirement, Hale received a pension based on a fire marshal\u2019s pay rather than the lower pay of a lieutenant. The plaintiff filed a grievance challenging the amount of Hale\u2019s pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>The collective bargaining agreement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides for the arbitration of grievances between the parties. Article V limits the arbitrators\u2019 authority as follows: \u201cSection 6a. The authority of the arbitrator shall be limited to the interpretation and application of this Contract. He shall have no right to add or subtract from the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">\u201cSection 6b. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Pursuant to this agreement, the plaintiff filed a grievance claiming that the defendant had violated article XXX, \u00a7 11 (E), of the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties submitted the following issue to arbitration: \u201cDid the City violate Article XXXII of the contract by basing E.H. Hale\u2019s pension benefit on his Acting Fire Marshal\u2019s pay. If so, what shall be the remedy, to the extent the SBMA [State Board of Mediation and Arbitration] may order a remedy under the law.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On February 10,1992, the arbitrators rendered the following award: \u201cBased on the extenuating circumstances in this case as well as the fact that the panel is without jurisdictional authority to make any pension adjustments ... it has unanimously decided to deny the grievance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>The plaintiff applied to the Superior Court, pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4), to vacate the arbitration award claiming that \u201cthe arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d The Superior Court denied the application to vacate, stating that the award conformed to the submission because it answered the specific questions presented. From that judgment, the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">\u201cWhen the parties agree to arbitration and establish the authority of the arbitrator through the terms of their submission, the extent of our judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement. . . . When the scope of the submission is unrestricted, the resulting award is not subject to de novo review even for errors of law so long as the award conforms to the submission. . . . Because we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 4-5, 612 A.2d 742 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">We agree with the trial court that the submission was unrestricted. In determining whether a submission is unrestricted we look at the authority of the arbitrator. \u201cThe authority of an arbitrator to adjudicate the controversy is limited only if the agreement contains express language restricting the breadth of issues, reserving explicit rights, or conditioning the award on court review. In the absence of any such qualifications, an agreement is unrestricted.\u201d Id., 5; <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>189 Conn. 16, 20, 453 A.2d 1158 (1983). In the present case, the collective bargaining agreement does not limit or condition the arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>authority in a manner that would make this a restricted submission. Thus, the submission is unrestricted and our review is accordingly limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">\u201cEven in the case of an unrestricted submission, we have, however, recognized three grounds for vacating an award: (1) the award rules on the constitutionality of a statute ... (2) the award violates clear public policy ... or (3) the award contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 6; <em>State </em>v. <em>Connecticut Employees Union Independent, Inc., </em>33 Conn. App. 737, 740-41, 638 A.2d 619 (1994). The plaintiff maintains that the award should be vacated because the arbitrators exceeded their powers in violation of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) by (1) making an award that failed to conform to the submission, (2) referring to \u201cextenuating circumstances,\u201d (3) considering matters outside the collective bargaining agreement, (4) deciding whether arbitrability was at issue, and (5) manifestly disregarding the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">In deciding whether the arbitrators have exceeded their powers under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4), we compare the award with the submission to determine if the award and the submission conform. See <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 530, </em>208 Conn. 411, 415, 544 A.2d 186 (1988); <em>Forge Square Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Construction Services of Bristol, Inc., </em>33 Conn. App. 669, 671, 638 A.2d 606 (1994); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Local 760, </em>6 Conn. App. 11, 13, 502 A.2d 429 (1986); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Local 818, </em>5 Conn. App. 636, 639-40, 502 A.2d 426 (1985). \u201cThe burden of demonstrating the nonconformity of the award to the submission is on the party seeking to vacate the award.\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Hartford Federation of School Secretaries, </em>26 Conn. App. 351, 353-54, 600 A.2d 1053 (1992). Although we recognize that it is the exceptional case that is vacated on appeal because our courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>faithfully given great deference to arbitrator\u2019s decisions, we believe that this is such a case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Connecticut Employees Union Independent, Inc., </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Here, the submission expressly asked the arbitrators to determine whether the defendant had violated the collective bargaining agreement by basing Hale\u2019s pension benefits on the higher pay of acting fire marshal, and if it had, to provide an appropriate remedy. The submission was specific in form and could have been answered with precision and exactitude. It required a clear, unequivocal answer as to whether the agreement had been violated. See <em>Local 1078 </em>v. <em>Anaconda American Brass Co., </em>149 Conn. 687, 690, 183 A.2d 623 (1962). By failing to answer the submitted question, the arbitrators imperfectly executed their powers under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Moreover, \u201c[t]he submission defines the scope of the entire arbitration proceedings by specifically delineating the issues to be decided and <em>no matter outside the submission may be included in the award. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Hartford Federation of School Secretaries, </em>supra, 26 Conn. App. 353; <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>AFSCME, </em>195 Conn. 266, 272,487 A.2d 553 (1985). Instead of answering the question submitted, the arbitrators stated that they were denying the grievance <em>because </em>of \u201cextenuating circumstances\u201d and <em>because </em>they were \u201cwithout jurisdictional authority to make the pension adjustments.\u201d The arbitrators, therefore, also exceeded their powers under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) because their award included matters outside the submission, namely the arbitrators\u2019 noncontractual reasons for denying the grievance. See <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>AFSCME, </em>supra, 273; <em>Local 1078 </em>v. <em>Anaconda American Brass Co., </em>supra, 149 Conn. 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>We conclude that the arbitrators exceeded their powers and imperfectly executed them so as not to render a \u201cmutual, final and definite award\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment vacating the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon the application of any party to an arbitration, the superior court . . . shall make an order vacating the award if it finds any of the following defects . . . (4) if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b794-8\"> Article XXX, \u00a7 11 (A) of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement provides: \u201cIn the event of the absence for any reason of the occupant of the Fire Marshal\u2019s position, such absence shall be filled by a \u2018qualified Deputy Marshal\u2019 . . . .\u201d It is uncontested that Hale was a qualified deputy marshal because he met the requirements set out in article XXX, \u00a7 11 (D), by being a bargaining unit member holding proper state certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b795-6\"> On December 18, 1986, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a collective bargaining agreement that was retroactively effective from July 1, 1986, to June 30, 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\"> Article XXX, \u00a7 11 (E) provides: \u201cWhen any Deputy Marshal performs the duties of the Marshal (as prescribed in the preceding sub-sections) such Deputy Marshal shall receive his normal base pay plus the difference between his normal base pay and the Marshal\u2019s base pay. Said difference shall not be considered for the purposes of Article XXXIII (pension).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b795-8\"> The plaintiff contends that the wording of the submission in the SBMA arbitration award, dated February 10,1992, which erroneously stated article XXXII as opposed to the correct citation of article XXX, \u00a7 11, evidences the arbitrators\u2019 confusion. We conclude that this is merely a typographical error and that the arbitrators considered the pertinent sections of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
