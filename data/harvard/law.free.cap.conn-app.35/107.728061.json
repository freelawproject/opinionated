On August 12, 1988, the defendant was convicted of two separate drug violations and sentenced to two concurrent terms of imprisonment of eight years, suspended after three years, and three years probation. On March 18,1992, the defendant was released and placed on probation. A probation officer reviewed with the defendant the conditions of his release, under which the defendant agreed, inter alia, not to violate any criminal law of the United States, Connecticut or any other state or territory. The defendant signed a standard conditions of probation form.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">On May 24, 1992, the defendant went uninvited to the home of Kathy Foster.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Foster pushed the defendant in an effort to block the defendant\u2019s entrance to her apartment. In an attempt to enter, the defendant pushed and struck Foster. Foster\u2019s houseguest, Elias Torres, interceded and began to struggle with the defendant. The defendant stabbed Elias Torres in the abdomen and right forearm. Following a telephone call from Foster, police officer Joseph Pirolo arrived, but the defendant had left Foster\u2019s home. The victim and Foster related the events to the officer, and the defendant was arrested that same day for assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59, assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61, and criminal trespass in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-107.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On September 11, 1992, an information was filed charg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ing the defendant with a violation of his probation, and a hearing was held on March 19,1993, in which the trial court found that the defendant had violated his probation in that he had violated the criminal laws of the state of Connecticut.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and ordered him to serve the suspended portion of the original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">At the time the court made its ruling, the case law in the area of probation revocation had been enunciated by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>29 Conn. App. 801, 618 A.2d 577 (1993). In <em>Davis, </em>this court held that the reasonable satisfaction standard to be applied in probation revocation hearings required only a minimal level of certainty that the probationer had violated a condition of his probation \u2014 a level of proof below that of a fair preponderance. Our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 641 A.2d 370 (1994), held that the fair preponderance of the evidence standard is the appropriate standard of proof that the state must meet to establish a violation of a condition of probation. The <em>Davis </em>court remanded the case to the trial court for a new revocation hearing because it could not determine from its review of the record what standard of proof the trial court had applied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In this case, the trial court found that \u201cthe state has met its burden of proof, that the defendant is in violation of the conditions of probation and on that basis the probation is found to be and has been violated.\u201d The trial court did not articulate the standard of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>on which it had relied in revoking the defendant\u2019s probation, but we have to presume that it correctly followed the rule set out by this court in <em>Davis. </em>The trial court, therefore, employed the incorrect standard of proof in its determination of whether the defendant had violated a condition of his probation. The fact that the trial court stated that the evidence was \u201cclear to the court that these wounds were inflicted upon Elias Torres by this defendant\u201d cannot be construed as satisfying the fair preponderance test. This case is controlled by our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Davis.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, or a narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned; and for a second offense shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned; and for each subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) At any time during the period of probation or conditional discharge, the court or any judge thereof may issue a warrant for the arrest of a defendant for violation of any of the conditions of probation or conditional discharge ....
