We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The defendant was charged in two substitute informations. In the first case, the defendant was charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>with robbery in the first degree, kidnapping in the second degree,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and larceny in the first degree. In the second case, the defendant was charged with robbery in the first degree, conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, attempted assault in the first degree, larceny in the second degree, and theft of a firearm. The defendant elected to be tried by a jury of six and the two cases were consolidated for trial. The defendant was convicted of all charges except kidnapping in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the early morning of October 18, 1991, Gary Malanson of West Haven drove his red Honda Civic to New Haven to buy cocaine. Underneath the front floor mat on the driver\u2019s side was the passbook for a joint account held by Malanson and his mother. At about 1 a.m., Malanson saw Eddy Rosenbloom and James Fields standing together on Edgewood Avenue. Malanson had purchased cocaine from Rosenbloom on several occasions and knew that Fields was Rosenbloom\u2019s supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Rosenbloom and Fields entered Malanson\u2019s Honda and Malanson drove to Rosenbloom\u2019s apartment at 59 Derby Avenue. When Malanson stopped the car, Fields pointed a sawed-off shotgun at him and demanded $500. Malanson refused to give him the money. Fields told Malanson that he needed to borrow the car to take care of some business. He directed Malanson to go into Rosenbloom\u2019s apartment and tell \u201cE.K.,\u201d later identified as the defendant, to come outside. Malanson waited in the apartment while Rosenbloom, Fields and the defendant drove away in the Honda. About forty-five minutes later, the three men returned to the apartment with the shotgun and four small bags of cocaine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Malanson and Fields used some of the cocaine. At about 3:30 a.m., Rosenbloom, Fields and the defendant took the shotgun and drove away in the Honda.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">At 4 a.m., Gianfranco Benedetti left work at the New Haven Register. While he was stopped at a traffic light, a woman flagged him down, and stated that she needed a ride to Branford. Although Benedetti was heading in another direction, he agreed, after some pleading by her, to drive her to Branford.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">On the way, the woman suggested taking a shortcut onto Dwight Street. While Benedetti was traveling on Dwight Street, a small red car sped past his car, cut in front of him and stopped. Three men got out of the car, identified themselves as police officers, and approached Benedetti\u2019s car. Benedetti got out of his car, claiming to have done nothing wrong. The woman disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">One of the men, later identified as the defendant, grabbed Benedetti, while a second man stood behind the defendant holding a sawed-off shotgun. Hoping to stop the men from harming him, Benedetti shouted, \u201cI\u2019m a cop!\u201d When asked for identification by the defendant, Benedetti pulled a silver .22 caliber pistol out of his pocket. Although loaded, the pistol could not be fired until it was cocked and the safety was taken off. The defendant grabbed the pistol by the barrel and a struggle ensued between the defendant and Benedetti. The man with the shotgun ran down the street, while the third man began to hit Benedetti in the face and ribs. About three to five minutes later, the man with the shotgun returned and hit Benedetti with the gun. Benedetti let go of the pistol. The defendant told the man with the shotgun to shoot Benedetti, but he did not respond. The defendant then pointed the pistol in Benedetti\u2019s face and pulled the trigger. The gun did not fire. The three men entered the red car and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>At about 5:30 a.m., Rosenbloom, Fields and the defendant returned to Rosenbloom\u2019s apartment. The three men left the apartment and returned about thirty minutes later. The defendant suggested that Malanson accompany them in the Honda. After driving a short time, they parked the car. The defendant pointed the shotgun at Malanson and, while holding Malanson\u2019s bank passbook, demanded all the money in the account, $641. Malanson explained that there was a hold on the account for approximately $500, but that he would withdraw the balance when the bank opened. They drove back to Rosenbloom\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Later that morning, the defendant accompanied Malanson to a branch of Centerbank. The defendant concealed the shotgun under his jacket. Malanson withdrew $161 and gave it to the defendant. Fields was waiting outside the bank. They drove to another branch of Centerbank where Malanson unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw the remaining money from the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The three then drove to Malanson\u2019s home in West Haven. The defendant told Malanson to tell his mother that he had been in a car accident with the defendant and needed a check for $600 to pay for the damage to the defendant\u2019s car. The defendant accompanied him inside the house. Malanson\u2019s mother agreed to give him the money. Malanson made out a check to himself for $600, drawn from a joint account that he and his mother held at New Haven Savings Bank. Fields drove the defendant and Malanson to a New Haven Savings Bank branch in West Haven, where Malanson cashed the check and gave the proceeds to the defendant and Fields. Malanson was dropped off at Rosenbloom\u2019s apartment, where he waited for Fields and the defendant to return with his car. They returned at about 7:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Four days later, on October 22,1991, Malanson saw the defendant at a gas station in West Haven. The defendant demanded $100, and Malanson gave him $20. Later that day, Fields knocked on Malanson\u2019s door. Malanson looked out and then called the West Haven police. Upon the arrival of the police, Malanson told them about the events of October 18 and Fields was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied the motion to suppress the identification procedure used by the police, in violation of his right to counsel pursuant to the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. The defendant also claims that the denial of the motion to suppress the identification procedure violated his right to due process of law under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. Because the defendant did not preserve these claims at trial, and can prevail only if the claims meet the conditions set out in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), the claims will be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The following additional facts are necessary to resolve this matter. The defendant was charged with the robbery of Malanson and arraigned on November 7, 1991. Counsel was appointed at that time. On November 18,1991, Benedetti was asked to come to the police station to look at some individuals with regard to the crimes committed against him. Detective Mel Cartoceti of the New Haven police took Benedetti to the courthouse. When they entered the courthouse lobby, Cartoceti told Benedetti to look at everyone in the building, including those in the hallway, and to keep in mind the persons who had robbed him. They entered courtroom B. Court was not yet in session and there were ten to twenty other people in the room, including some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>African-Americans. The sheriff told Cartoceti that \u201cthey are going to bring in the individuals.\u201d Twenty-three men came in and sat down. Fourteen were African-American. After looking at the men for a few minutes, Benedetti pointed out the defendant as the man he believed to be the robber who had fought with him for the pistol. Benedetti later indicated he was 80 percent sure of his identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>[supra, 213 Conn. 233] our Supreme Court reformulated the test of reviewability in <em>[State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973)]. The <em>Golding </em>court held that when a defendant fails to preserve his claim at trial he can prevail on that claim only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Velez, </em>30 Conn. App. 9, 20, 618 A.2d 1362, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 907, 621 A.2d 289 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>27 Conn. App. 1, 13, 604 A.2d 366, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 901, 606 A.2d 1329 (1992). We conclude that the defendant has failed to provide an adequate record on which to review these claims and thus fails to meet the first prong of <em>Golding.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Our Supreme Court stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240, that \u201c[t]he defendant bears the respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>sibility for providing a record that is adequate for review of his claim of constitutional error. If the facts revealed by the record are insufficient, unclear or ambiguous as to whether a constitutional violation has occurred, we will not attempt to supplement or reconstruct the record, or to make factual determinations, in order to decide the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d The record in this case does not provide an adequate basis for reviewing either of the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The evidentiary support for the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment claim consists entirely of the representations of counsel at trial regarding what allegedly had occurred leading up to the identification procedure. \u201c[Statements of counsel are not evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>224 Conn. 63, 68, 616 A.2d 266 (1992), cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 1868, 123 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1993). There is no actual evidence in the record establishing that the defendant objected to being taken to the courthouse for the lineup. The record is insufficient, as well, to determine whether the defendant invoked his fifth amendment right to counsel prior to the identification proceeding. See <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S. Ct. 1880, 68 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1981). Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment claim must fail because he cannot satisfy the first prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The defendant\u2019s fourteenth amendment due process claim also fails for lack of an adequate record on which to review the claim. The defendant failed to incorporate into the record the decision of the trial court from the suppression hearing on this issue. Neither a written memorandum of decision nor a transcript signed by the trial court presiding at the suppression hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>included in the record. See Practice Book \u00a7 4059. We, therefore, have no way of knowing the reasoning of the trial court in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The record, therefore, contains no evidence indicating that the identification procedure used \u201cwas so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of an irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>13 Conn. App. 687, 690, 539 A.2d 581, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 805, 545 A.2d 1103 (1988). Because the defendant has not provided us with an adequate record, he fails to satisfy the first prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence the identification procedure in violation of his sixth amendment right to counsel. Because the issues are inadequately briefed, we decline to review this question. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rumore, </em>28 Conn. App. 402, 410-11, 613 A.2d 1328, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 906, 615 A.2d 1049 (1992). In the absense of a sufficient review and analysis of the case law applicable to this case, we have no basis on which to determine whether the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly granted the state\u2019s pretrial motion to consolidate the two informations filed against him over his objection. He asserts that the resulting prejudice was beyond the curative power of the trial court\u2019s instructions and deprived him of his right to due process of law as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>The trial court has broad discretion as to whether to join separate charges for trial. Practice Book \u00a7 829;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 720, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>29 Conn. App. 421, 429-30, 615 A.2d 1058, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 923, 618 A.2d 529 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>19 Conn. App. 48, 62, 562 A.2d 35, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 804, 567 A.2d 834 (1989). \u201cThe court enjoys broad discretion which, absent manifest abuse, an appellate court may not disturb.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>25 Conn. App. 181, 193, 594 A.2d 991, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 910, 597 A.2d 337 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>187 Conn. 292, 299, 445 A.2d 901 (1982). To demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion, the defendant bears the heavy burden of showing that the joinder resulted in substantial injustice beyond the curative power of jury instructions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 94-95, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989). Whether a joint trial will be substantially prejudicial to the rights of the defendant means more than that it will be less advantageous to the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>188 Conn. 406, 411, 450 A.2d 356 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>supra, 429-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">When a defendant stands accused of two or more similar offenses, they may be joined at trial if they are based on related acts that evince a common scheme, intent or motive. <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>209 Conn. 458, 464-65, 551 A.2d 1231 (1988). In this case, the crimes arose out of a sequence of events, with interrelated facts, occurring in the same twenty-four hour period.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Joinder is considered appropriate where evidence of one crime is admissible in the trial of another. Id., 464; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 61, 68, 530 A.2d 155 (1987). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>In this case, much, if not all, of the testimony of the two victims was admissible in both cases. \u201cWhere evidence of one incident <em>can </em>be admitted at the trial of the other, separate trials would provide the defendant no significant benefit. It is clear that, under such circumstances, the defendant would not ordinarily be substantially prejudiced by joinder of the offenses for a single trial.\" (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>supra, 68. There would be no significant benefit to the defendant by having separate trials because evidence of one crime would be admissible in the other trial. Therefore, the defendant is not substantially prejudiced by the joinder of the informations.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Our Supreme Court has held that a trial court should consider several factors in determining whether severance is required. \u201cThese factors include: (1) whether the charges involved discrete, easily distinguishable factual scenarios; (2) whether the crimes were of a violent nature or concerned brutal or shocking conduct on the defendant\u2019s part; and (3) the duration and complexity of the trial. ... If any or all of these factors are present, a reviewing court must decide whether the trial court\u2019s jury instructions cured any prejudice that might have occurred.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>216 Conn. 647, 658, 583 A.2d 915 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 429-30. We conclude that joinder did not result in substantial injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">First, the charges against the defendant involved discrete, easily distinguishable factual scenarios. Although both crimes occurred in the same twenty-four hour period, they had different factual circumstances and different victims. One case did not involve violence, but rather a victim, Malanson, who knew the people who robbed him. The other case involved the stopping of a car, and a violent struggle over a pistol in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>victim sustained injuries. In that case, the victim, Benedetti, was not familiar with the perpetrators. The distinctiveness of the factual scenarios made it unlikely that the jurors would confuse the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Second, although an element of violence was involved in this case, the conduct was not so brutal or shocking as to create a substantial risk that the jury, with explicit instructions to treat each offense separately, would nevertheless treat the evidence cumulatively. The physical harm inflicted on Benedetti was not of the type the Supreme Court considered brutal or shocking in <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 723; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Third, the trial was of short duration and the evidence was not complex. The jury heard the testimony of ten witnesses over six days with the admission of twenty-nine exhibits. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 97; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 723-24. \u201cThe complexity and risk of confusion [at] trial did not approach that involved in <em>Boscarino.\u201d State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">\u201cFinally, although \u2018 \u201ca curative instruction is not inevitably sufficient to overcome the prejudicial impact of [inadmissible other crimes] evidence\u201d \u2019; <em>State </em>v. <em>Boscarino, </em>supra, [204 Conn.] 724-25, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>180 Conn. 167, 170, 429 A.2d 848 (1980); where the likelihood of prejudice is not overwhelming, such curative instructions may tip the balance in favor of a finding that the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial has been preserved.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 97. In this case the trial court admonished the jury to keep the informations separate and consider only the evidence that was pertinent to the particular charge in reaching a verdict on that charge. The trial court\u2019s instruction further minimized any risk of prejudice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>might have been caused by the joinder in this case.
