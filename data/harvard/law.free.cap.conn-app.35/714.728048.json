We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The following facts are necessary to the disposition of this appeal. On November 9,1992, the defendant was arrested and charged with arson in the third degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-113,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and false statement in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-157.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The arson charge arose from a fire on February 28, 1992, at 132 Gold Street in New Britain. The subject premises, an abandoned three-family dwelling, had been an arson target in 1991. As of February 28,1992, the building was boarded up and scheduled for demolition. On November 9, 1992, in an unrelated matter, the defendant was also charged with conspiracy to commit burglary in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 53a-103.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On December 1, 1992, the defendant was arrested in another unrelated matter and charged with burglary in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103, lar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>ceny in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and conspiracy to commit larceny in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-123. On March 9,1993, the state filed a substitute information, raising the charge of arson in the third degree to arson in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-111.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">On May 13,1993, the defendant pleaded guilty, pursuant to <em>Alford, </em>to arson in the first degree, burglary in the third degree and larceny in the second degree. The state entered a nolle prosequi of the remaining charges. On September 14, 1993, following a presentence investigation, the court, <em>Damiani, J., </em>sentenced the defendant to concurrent sentences of ten years on the arson charge, and five years each on the burglary and larceny charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The defendant first claims on appeal that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made and, therefore, he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea and to proceed to trial. The defendant provides two reasons why his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made: (1) the failure of the court to inform him of the mandatory minimum sentence for arson in the first degree, and (2) the inadequate factual basis for the plea to arson in the first degree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>The defendant concedes that he failed to preserve this issue for appeal by moving to withdraw his plea prior to the conclusion of sentencing. The defendant seeks review pursuant to the <em>Evans-Golding </em>constitutional bypass doctrine. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\u201c \u2018In <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>[supra, 213 Conn. 233] our Supreme Court reformulated the test of reviewability in <em>[State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 61]. The <em>Golding </em>court held that when a defendant fails to preserve his claim at trial he can prevail on that claim only if all of the following conditions are met: \u201c(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d. . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Velez, </em>30 Conn. App. 9, 20-21, 618 A.2d 1362, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 907, 621 A.2d 289 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>27 Conn. App. 1, 13, 604 A.2d 366, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 901, 606 A.2d 1329 (1992); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>33 Conn. App. 763, 768-69, 638 A.2d 1084 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The first and second prongs of the <em>Golding </em>test dictate whether an issue will be reviewed, and the third and fourth prongs constitute review of the issue on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>merits. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>223 Conn. 595, 602, 613 A.2d 731 (1992); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>222 Conn. 591, 603, 610 A.2d 1177 (1992). The first prong of <em>Golding </em>is satisfied in this case, as the record is clearly adequate to review the alleged claim of error. \u201cIn determining whether the second <em>Golding </em>requirement is satisfied, we do not evaluate the merits of the claim, except to determine whether the claim is frivolous.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>supra, 603. The second prong merely asks if the defendant\u2019s claim is in fact constitutional, and not a \u201c \u2018patently unconstitutional claim\u2019 [or] one \u2018masquerading\u2019 as a constitutional claim.\u201d Id. On its face, the claim that a plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made, is precisely the kind of claim appropriate for constitutional bypass review pursuant to <em>Evans. State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 119, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\u201c[A] defendant who pleads guilty waives certain constitutional rights, including his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to trial by jury, and his right to confront his accusers.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>29 Conn. App. 359, 366, 614 A.2d 864 (1992), citing <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969). \u201cA waiver is an <em>intentional </em>relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d (Emphasis <em>added.) Paulsen </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>203 Conn. 484, 489, 525 A.2d 1315 (1987), citing <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938). Without having been knowingly and voluntarily made, therefore, a waiver should not be given effect. We cannot presume waiver from a silent record. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>221 Conn. 635, 640, 605 A.2d 1381 (1992), citing <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 243-44, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969). Thus, the record must disclose that a plea of guilty was made knowingly and voluntarily; otherwise, that plea has been obtained in violation of due process and is voidable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>supra, 365-66. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>that his plea violates due process because it was not knowingly and voluntarily made satisfies the second prong of <em>Evans-Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We proceed to the third prong of the constitutional bypass doctrine <em>o\u00ed Evans-Golding </em>in order to determine whether \u201cthe alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. The questions we must resolve here are whether (1) the failure of the trial court to advise the defendant of the ten year mandatory minimum sentence for arson in the first degree or (2) the alleged absence of a factual basis preclude a finding that the defendant\u2019s plea was knowingly and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The first factor that the defendant claims interfered with the knowing and voluntary nature of his plea was the failure of the trial court to inform him of the ten year mandatory minimum sentence for arson in the first degree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cA determination as to whether a plea has been knowingly and voluntarily entered entails an examination of all of the relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>207 Conn. 276, 287, 542 A.2d 299 (1988). From such examination we conclude that we need not determine whether an actual constitutional error existed because, even if a constitutional violation did occur, it did not clearly deprive the defendant of a fair trial under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>During the plea canvass in this case, the trial court first ascertained that the defendant was not under the influence of drugs, alcohol or medication, and that the defendant had had enough time to talk to his attorney about the case and the decision to plead guilty. The court next informed the defendant of the elements of each of the three charges to which he was pleading guilty, and of the maximum sentence that could be imposed for each charge. The court then enumerated the rights that the defendant was giving up by his decision to plead guilty. After ensuring that no one had forced or threatened the defendant to plead guilty, the trial court told the defendant that the state would be \u201crecommending substantial incarceration\u201d and that the court was planning to impose a sentence of ten years. The trial court explained to the defendant: \u201c[Y]our lawyer will have the right to argue for less than [ten years], but I\u2019ve told him not to be optimistic; it would take a miracle for me to give you less than ten years.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> After the defendant consistently acknowledged that he understood what the court planned to do, the state\u2019s attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>ney described the allegations supporting the charges. Then after asking the defendant, the defendant\u2019s attorney, the state\u2019s attorney, and the defendant\u2019s mother if there were any questions or problems, the trial court accepted the defendant\u2019s plea as knowing and voluntary, and found the plea to be supported by a factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to inform the defendant of the mandatory minimum does not render the plea unknowing or involuntary. In light of the detailed explanation of the sentence the trial court planned to impose,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we cannot reasonably find that the defendant had any realistic expectation of getting less than a ten year sentence, despite the bargained for opportunity to argue for less than ten years. We are unpersuaded that the defendant would have changed his plea if informed of the mandatory minimum sentence of ten years, part of which could have been suspended. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>210 Conn. 519, 525, 556 A.2d 1007 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, 200 </em>Conn. 268, 289, 511 A.2d 321 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Although the opportunity to argue for less than ten years may have been a factor in the defendant\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>sion to accept the plea bargain, a \u201cless than perfect understanding of all aspects of his situation does not \u2018inevitably render his guilty plea \u201cunknowing\u201d and therefore involuntary ....\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>17 Conn. App. 307, 312, 552 A.2d 442 (1989), quoting, <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>193 Conn. 144, 154, 476 A.2d 543 (1984). \u201cMany factors may have been considered by the defendant and his attorney in determining whether to plead guilty to the charges. No doubt of great significance was the strength of the admissible evidence, the defendant\u2019s maximum exposure if convicted, and his possible release date if imprisoned.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>207 Conn. 590, 596, 542 A.2d 1131 (1988). Without a realistic basis for believing that he could conceivably get a sentence of less than ten years at the time his plea was accepted, we cannot find that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was obtained in violation of due process. Under these circumstances, the failure of the trial court to inform the defendant of the mandatory minimum sentence for arson in the first degree did not deprive the defendant of his right to a fair trial and cannot lead to reversal under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The second factor that the defendant claims interfered with the knowing and voluntary nature of his plea was the factual impossibility of his conduct constituting the crime of arson in the first degree. The defendant argues that the abandoned dwelling that he is charged with setting on fire was not a building pursuant to the definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100. The defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, is that it was impossible for the court to find a proper factual basis for arson in the first degree, which requires that a person \u201cwith intent to destroy or damage a building, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>as defined in section 53a-100 . . . starts a fire or causes an explosion . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-111.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s very creative argument that an abandoned building is not a building. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100 defines \u201cbuilding\u201d in part as follows: \u201c[I]n addition to its ordinary meaning, [a building] includes any watercraft, aircraft, trailer, sleeping car, railroad car or other structure or vehicle or any building with a valid certificate of occupancy. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">If a statute is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for statutory construction. <em>University of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 322, 328, 585 A.2d 690 (1991); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>216 Conn. 220, 225, 578 A.2d 1071 (1990). General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) provides that in construing statutes \u201cwords and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language.\u201d On its face, \u00a7 53a-100 defines building to include anything within the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of that word, as well as anything specifically enumerated in the statute or any \u201cother structures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">It is appropriate for us to look at dictionary definitions in order to clarify the ordinary meaning of various terms. <em>AirKaman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>221 Conn. 751, 756-57, 607 A.2d 410 (1992); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Marx, </em>24 Conn. App. 81, 84, 585 A.2d 1253 (1991). Building has been defined as a \u201c[structure designed for habitation, shelter, storage, trade, manufacture, religion, business, education, and the like. A structure or edifice inclosing a space within its walls, and usually, but not necessarily, covered with a roof.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). Building has also been defined as \u201ca usu[ally] roofed and walled structure built for perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>nent use (as for a dwelling).\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993). Structure has been defined as \u201c[a]ny construction, or any production or piece of work artificially built up or composed of parts joined together in some definite manner. That which is built or constructed . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). A structure has also been defined as \u201csomething (as a building) that is constructed.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In this case, the defendant is charged with burning an abandoned three-story dwelling. Neither common sense, nor the previous definitions, suggests that current use of a structure is necessary to make a structure fit within the ordinary meaning of building. Nor do these definitions suggest that once a fire has taken place in a building it ceases to be a building, or that once scheduled for demolition a building is no longer a building. We conclude that the ordinary meaning of building clearly includes the structure that the defendant pleaded guilty to burning, even though it was the previous target of arson and was scheduled for demolition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">In addition, we construe statutes with the assumption that the legislature is presumed to be cognizant of existing statutes, and to enact new statutes in an attempt to create a consistent body of law. <em>Zachs </em>v. Groppo, 207 Conn. 683, 696, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988). We should \u201cpresume that the legislature had a purpose for each sentence, clause, or phrase in a legislative enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ment, and that it did not intend to enact meaningless provisions.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 713, 595 A.2d 297 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The definition of building in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100 also applies to the burglary and criminal trespass statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7.53a-101 through 53a-110. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-104 provides: \u201cIt shall be an affirmative defense to prosecution for burglary that the building was abandoned.\u201d Section 53a-110 provides in part: \u201cIt shall be an affirmative defense to prosecution for criminal trespass that . . . the building involved in the offense was abandoned . . . .\u201d If we accept the defendant\u2019s argument that an abandoned building is not a building, these affirmative defenses to burglary and criminal trespass would be rendered meaningless and unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Because the defendant\u2019s argument that an abandoned building is not a building is unpersuasive, we conclude that it was not factually impossible for the defendant to commit arson in the first degree. Therefore, the alleged constitutional violation does not clearly exist, and this claim cannot lead to reversal under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The defendant also claims on appeal that the trial court improperly conducted its canvass of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea in violation of constitutional requirements and the rules of practice by (1) failing to inform the defendant of the mandatory minimum sentence for arson in the first degree, and (2) not establishing a factual basis for the guilty plea to arson. The defendant also raises, as an independent issue, the claim that it was factually impossible to find him guilty of arson in the first degree. The defendant concedes that these claims were not properly preserved at trial, but requests review of these claims as plain error or under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>the <em>Evans-Golding </em>constitutional bypass doctrine. Our conclusion that the defendant\u2019s plea was knowingly and voluntarily made is dispositive of both of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that these errors are entitled to review as plain error. Plain error review \u201cis reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 288-89. \u201cWhere a trial court\u2019s action does not result in any manifest injustice, a defendant\u2019s claim under the plain error doctrine does not warrant review.\u201d Id., 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">In reviewing the claim that the defendant\u2019s plea was not entered knowingly and voluntarily we have concluded that (1) the defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct him of the mandatory minimum sentence for arson in the first degree, and (2) there was a factual basis for the defendant\u2019s guilty plea to arson in the first degree. In light of these conclusions that there has been no manifest injustice or obvious error, plain error review is inappropriate. See Practice Book \u00a7 4185.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">These conclusions, which we reached pursuant to our analysis under <em>Evans-Golding, </em>also preclude any need for further consideration of the defendant\u2019s claims under the constitutional bypass doctrine. The defendant failed to show that he was clearly deprived of a fair trial by the failure of the trial court to inform him of the mandatory minimum sentence for arson in the first degree. It does not matter, therefore, whether the defendant is claiming a violation of due process or a violation of Practice Book \u00a7 711.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Whatever the source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s claim, because he was not prejudiced, he is not entitled to reversal under <em>Evans-Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Because we found unpersuasive the defendant\u2019s argument that an abandoned building is not a building, we similarly find that the defendant has failed, not only to establish a constitutional violation, but also to establish a violation of Practice Book \u00a7 713.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Without establishing that any violation \u201cactually exists,\u201d the defendant is not entitled to reversal under <em>Evans-Golding, </em>no matter how many ways the claim is raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-9\"> <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.

Id., 596. Relying on <em>Collins </em>we have held that when a criminal defendant \u201creceived the sentence he bargained for\u201d the failure of the trial court to inform the defendant of the mandatory minimum \u201cdoes not affect a determination that the plea was knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>19 Conn.
