The defendant claims that the trial court (1) improperly refused to grant a motion to dismiss the case for improper venue or transfer it to another judicial district, (2) improperly applied the wrong standard of proof to find that the 1979 stock issue was fraudulent, (3) made a clearly erroneous finding of fraud even as measured by the proper standard of proof, (4) improperly voided the 1979 stock issue due to the board of directors\u2019 failure to comply with the formal notice requirements set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 33-316 (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the corporation\u2019s bylaws,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (5) improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>voided the entire 1979 stock issue for a violation of the preemptive stock rights of minority shareholders pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-343 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. The plaintiff Alan Neri<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the defendant Carl Neri are brothers. They formed Neri Brothers in 1967. At that time, Alan was designated president and director, and Carl was designated vice-president, secretary and director of the corporation. Another brother, John Neri, was named as treasurer and director.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">On March 17,1967, the initial issue of corporate stock was allocated. Alan received sixty-six shares and Carl received seven shares. The distribution was based on the value of the assets each brother had contributed to the corporation. On February 29, 1968, a second issue of stock was allocated whereby Alan received two additional shares and Carl received an additional five shares. At this time, John and their mother, Anna Neri, each received five shares.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>A third issue of stock was allocated on February 28, 1970. Alan received an additional nine shares and Carl received an additional eight shares. At this time, there were 107 outstanding shares of stock: Alan owned seventy-seven shares (71.96 percent); Carl owned twenty shares (18.7 percent); John owned five shares (4.67 percent); and the estate of Anna Neri owned 5 shares (4.67 percent). In 1979, a fourth issue of stock was allocated and Alan and Carl each received 300 shares. Alan and Carl each conceded that neither John nor Anna was notified or informed of the additional issue of stock. The fourth stock issue substantially altered the interests of all the shareholders. Alan\u2019s interest was reduced from 71.96 percent to 53.2 percent, Carl\u2019s interest grew from 18.7 percent to 45 percent, and John and Anna\u2019s interests decreased respectively from 4.67 percent to 0.7 percent. The validity of the 1979 stock issue is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Carl destroyed all stock certificates issued prior to 1979. He also altered the minutes of a 1986 meeting by inserting a notation that stated that John had been eliminated as a director. Moreover, there were no entries in the minute book for corporate meetings between February 3, 1968, and March 17, 1983. The trial court considered these actions, among others, in finding fraud on the part of Carl.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Alan signed the 1979 stock certificates because Carl had incorrectly informed him that the stock was issued for the sole purpose of providing documentation for the avoidance of corporate tax liability and that the additional shares would have no bearing on the proportional interests of any of the shareholders. The trial court found that Carl admitted that he had changed the amount of the stock issue <em>after </em>speaking to Alan, an action that was indicative of Carl\u2019s intent to obtain what he felt he was due him despite his representations to Alan.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>The plaintiffs sought (1) an injunction prohibiting Carl from engaging in or interfering with the operation of Neri Brothers, (2) a declaratory judgment regarding the rights of the parties as to stock ownership, (3) an accounting, and (4) damages. The trial court bifurcated the proceedings and rendered a decision regarding only the percentage of stock owned by each family member.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court found that Alan owned seventy-seven shares (71.96 percent), Carl owned twenty shares (18.8 percent), John owned five shares (4.67 percent) and the estate of Anna Neri owned five shares (4.67 percent). The trial court also found that John was and remains a director of the corporation and that the stock issues of 1979 and 1986 were invalid.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly refused to grant his motion to dismiss the action for improper venue, or alternatively, to transfer the case to the Middlesex judicial district. We need not review this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, he did not file a motion to dismiss <em>the action </em>for improper venue. Rather, he filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201capplication for a prejudgment remedy,\u201d alleging that the New Haven judicial district was an improper venue. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss the application, and, with the agreement of the parties, granted a temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>restraining order. The defendant made no further objection to the venue and thereafter filed no other motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">A claim of improper venue may be waived by the parties, unlike subject matter jurisdiction, which cannot be conferred on the court by consent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Orsini, </em>187 Conn. 264, 269, 445 A.2d 887 (1982). Here, the defendant does not contest the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but challenges only the propriety of the New Haven judicial district as the proper forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Appellate review of the venue issue that the defendant raised by the filing of the motion to dismiss the application for a prejudgment remedy is precluded by his inaction after the parties agreed to a partial granting of the relief sought by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly found fraud in the 1979 stock issue pursuant to the application of an improper standard of proof. He claims alternatively that even under the proper standard, the finding of fraud would be clearly erroneous. These claims were raised prior to the trial court\u2019s articulation that it had applied the clear and convincing standard of proof to its finding of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>The defendant\u2019s motion to strike the trial court\u2019s articulation was denied by this court. \u201cAn articulation is not an opportunity for a trial court to substitute a new decision nor to change the reasoning or basis of a prior decision.\u201d <em>Koper </em>v. <em>Koper, </em>17 Conn. App. 480, 484, 553 A.2d 1162 (1989). Rather, an articulation relates back to the original decision and explains the basis for that decision. Therefore, the articulation is considered part of the trial court's original decision. The standard of proof articulated, \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d is the correct standard. See <em>Kilduff </em>v. <em>Adams, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 314, 326-27, 593 A.2d 478 (1991); <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>15 Conn. App. 496, 499, 545 A.2d 575 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The defendant also asserts that even under the proper standard of proof, the trial court\u2019s finding of fraud was clearly erroneous. The defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s finding of fraud was not supported by the evidence and was in conflict with the evidence introduced by him. Essentially the defendant is asking this court to retry the facts determined by the trial court. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">\u201cOn appeal, the function of this court is limited solely to the determination of whether the factual findings of the trial court are clearly erroneous . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019 Public Works Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Eveready Machinery Co., </em>11 Conn. App. 79, 525 A.2d 988 (1987). \u201cThe sifting and weighing of evidence is peculiarly the function of the trier. [N]othing in our law is more elementary than that the trier is the final judge of the credibility of witnesses and of the weight to be accorded their testimony. . . . The trier has the witnesses before it and is in the position to analyze all the evidence. The trier is free to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony offered by either party.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bieluch, </em>32 Conn. App. 537, 549-50, 629 A.2d 1175 (1993). \u201c \u2018[WJhere the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged, we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>31 Conn. App. 331, 336, 625 A.2d 828 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court set forth the facts that it found to support its conclusion of fraud, noting that the defendant\u2019s testimony was not credible. The trial court relied on the defendant\u2019s admitted destruction of the stock certificates, the alteration of corporate minutes, the absence of records under his control as secretary of the corporation covering a period of fifteen years and his refusal to hand over documents as evidence of fraud. A review of the entire record convinces us that the factual findings made by the trial court were supported by evidence that the court found credible. Our conclusion that the trial court properly found that the 1979 stock issue was invalid due to the defendant\u2019s fraud is dispositive of this appeal and, therefore, we need not address the defendant\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-6\"> In the trial court, the defendants were Carl Neri, John Neri, individually and as executor of the estate of Anna Neri, and Fleet Bank. Carl Neri is the only defendant who appealed. We refer to him as the defendant in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 33-316 (a) provides: \u201cMeetings of the board of directors, regular or special, may be held either within or without this state.

See <em>Geib </em>v. <em>McKinney, </em>224 Conn. 219, 617 A.2d 1377 (1992). In <em>Geib, </em>our Supreme Court ruled on an appeal from a judgment rendered on the report of a trial referee who ordered the issue of partition of the property to be tried separately from the issue of how the proceeds of any sale, if ordered, should be distributed. Id., 227.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b834-9\"> In this appeal Carl does not contest the court\u2019s finding regarding the stock issued in 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b835-9\"> This case is distinguishable from <em>Farricielli </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>186 Conn. 198, 207, 440 A.2d 286 (1982), which held that the venue provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b) implicated the subject matter jurisdiction of the court. In <em>Farricielli, </em>the plaintiff attempted to appeal from the decision of an administrative agency, which right to appeal existed only under the statutory provisions that created it. Because the venue provision was a part of that statutory requirement, our Supreme Court held that the failure to comply with the venue provision resulted in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction in the trial court. Id., 204. Here, in contrast, the defendant\u2019s right to bring suit was grounded in common law rather than on the basis of a statute. Thus, <em>Farricielli </em>is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
