The plaintiff claims that the trial court (1) incorrectly applied New York law to the case and (2) abused its discretion by granting the motion for modification and attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The parties married in 1974 and lived in New York until they divorced in 1987. Two boys were born to the parties during the marriage; they are both under the age of eighteen. The parties signed a separation agreement in New York that required the plaintiff to pay unallocated alimony and child support of $35,000 per year until the end of 1991. The agreement further provided that he would pay $5500 per year, per child, from 1992 until the children reached majority. The separation agreement explicitly stated that this support provision would be incorporated and merged into the court\u2019s judgment of dissolution and would thereby be subject to the court\u2019s on-going jurisdiction to modify the support provisions. The judgment of the New York Supreme Court dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage, rendered June 23, 1987, specifically merged the support payment provision of the separation agreement into the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In 1992, after the New York judgment was made a judgment of Connecticut pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-71, the defendant moved to increase the plaintiff\u2019s child support payments. The defendant asserted that the support payments were insufficient to support the children, that the payments were not in accord with the child support guidelines and that the plaintiff\u2019s salary had increased substantially. The defendant subsequently amended her motion to include an assertion that there had been a substantial change in circumstances to warrant modification of the child support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>After extensive discovery, the defendant moved for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62. At the hearing on the motions, evidence established that the plaintiff\u2019s salary had increased from $115,419 to $320,000 since the divorce. On the basis of the parties\u2019 testimony and financial affidavits, the trial court ordered the plaintiff to pay $900 per week in child support and awarded the defendant $10,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The dissolution judgment modified in this appeal was made a judgment of this state pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-71. Foreign judgments that become judgments of this state \u201cshall be enforced and otherwise treated in the same manner as a judgment of a court in this state provided ... in modifying . . . any such foreign matrimonial judgment in this state the substantive law of the foreign jurisdiction shall be controlling.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-71 (b). Thus, the controlling substantive law in this case is the New York law of domestic relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s first claim, although framed in several different ways, essentially asserts that the trial court improperly applied New York law. He claims that New York law required the defendant to show that the changes in circumstances giving rise to the motion for modification were both unanticipated and unreasonable at the time of dissolution. The plaintiff\u2019s specific assertions flow from his reading of New York law, namely: (1) the motion for modification was not properly before the court because the defendant had not alleged that the changes in circumstances were unanticipated and unreasonable; (2) neither the increase in the plaintiff\u2019s salary nor an increase in the needs of the children is sufficient change in circumstances to justify a modification of child support unless the increases were unanticipated and unreasonable; (3) there was no unanticipated change in circumstances. Because we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>that the plaintiff incorrectly interprets New York law, the plaintiffs assertions must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Under New York law, a court may modify the child support provisions of a separation agreement only if the movant shows an unanticipated and unreasonable change in circumstances. <em>Boden </em>v. Boden, 42 N.Y.2d 210, 212-13, 366 N.E.2d 791, 397 N.Y.S.2d 701 (1977). Because the child support obligations result from contractual agreement of the parties, the court should not freely disregard the provision. Id.; <em>Minarovich </em>v. <em>Sobala, </em>121 App. Div. 2d 701, 702, 504 N.Y.S.2d 143 (1986). Where, however, the child support provisions established by agreement are merged with the judgment, the agreement retains no contractual significance. <em>Minarovich </em>v. <em>Sobala, </em>supra, 702. Therefore, where child support provisions are merged with the judgment, the court retains jurisdiction to modify the child support obligations in light of changed circumstances. Id.; <em>Wlodarek </em>v. <em>Wlodarek, </em>78 App. Div. 2d 981, 433 N.Y.S.2d 673 (1980). The movant is not required to comply with <em>Boden </em>and, thus, need not demonstrate unanticipated and unreasonable changes in circumstance. <em>Minarovich </em>v. <em>Sobala, </em>supra, 702; <em>Wlodarek </em>v. <em>Wlodarek, </em>supra, 981; <em>Gotthainer </em>v. <em>Gotthainer, </em>107 Misc. 2d 221, 225, 435 N.Y.S.2d 444 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Thus, the defendant was not required to allege or prove that the changes in circumstance giving rise to her motion were unanticipated and unreasonable at the time of the dissolution. The defendant was required only to demonstrate changes in circumstance sufficient to warrant modification. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Bittner, </em>181 App. Div. 2d 990, 991, 581 N.Y.S.2d 945 (1992); <em>Minarovich </em>v. <em>Sobala, </em>supra, 121 App. Div. 2d 702; <em>Wlodarek </em>v. <em>Wlodarek, </em>supra, 78 App. Div. 2d 981; <em>Gotthainer </em>v. <em>Gotthainer, </em>supra, 107 Misc. 2d 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The trial court had before it financial affidavits and the testimony of both parties. On the basis of the totality of that evidence, the court found that the defendant had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiffs salary had increased from $115,419 to $320,000 and that the financial needs of the children had also increased. The trial court also found that the best interests of the children were not being served by the present level of child support. Although the court noted that it was not bound by the New York child support guidelines, it did consider them in evaluating the needs of the children and the ability of the parties to provide financial support. The court also considered the criteria set forth in \u00a7 240 (f) of the New York Domestic Relations Law, specifically the admonition that the court consider \u201c[t]he standard of living the child would have enjoyed had the marriage or household not been dissolved.\u201d In short, the court concluded from the evidence that the defendant had proven changed circumstances warranting additional child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u201cOur standard of review in a domestic relations case is well settled. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court and will not disturb an order of the trial court absent an abuse of discretion or findings lacking a reasonable basis in the facts.\u201d <em>Michel </em>v. <em>Michel, </em>31 Conn. App. 338, 340, 624 A.2d 914 (1993); <em>Siracusa </em>v. <em>Siracusa, </em>30 Conn. App. 560, 567, 621 A.2d 309 (1993); <em>Brash </em>v. <em>Brash, </em>20 Conn. App. 609, 612, 569 A.2d 44 (1990). The orders here were reasonably based on the facts; we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The plaintiffs second group of claims relates to the trial court\u2019s application of New York law. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that the trial court (1) blindly applied the New York child support guidelines, (2) failed to consider the factors enumerated in New York Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 240 (f) in reaching its deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>sion, and (3) ignored the plaintiffs other financial contributions to the children\u2019s support. The plaintiff concludes by claiming that the child support modification is merely a \u201cmask\u201d for alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">We only need read the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision to resolve these claims. As noted above, the court observed that it was not bound by the New York child support guidelines. The trial court stated that it considered the guidelines as a manifestation of New York\u2019s public policy regarding the appropriate level of child support. Thus, the trial court did not \u201cblindly\u201d apply these guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The trial court also explained that in reaching its conclusion it had reviewed and considered all of the factors enumerated in New York Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 240 (f). Therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s claim to the contrary is wholly without basis in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim that the trial court ignored the plaintiffs other financial contributions to the children\u2019s support is meritless. The plaintiff asserts that the trial court failed to consider his expenditures on the children during their visits with him, such as the cost of food for them. The trial court had before it the judgment of dissolution and separation agreement, which detailed the custody arrangements for the children. Thus, the court was aware that the children visited the plaintiff approximately seventy-seven days per year, and that the plaintiff would incur related expenses. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not ignore the plaintiff\u2019s other financial contributions to the children\u2019s support in modifying the child support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Finally, the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the child support order is merely a mask for alimony is without basis in fact or law. The plaintiff presents no evidence that the trial court\u2019s modification was not based on the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>before it. As we noted previously, the conclusion the trial court reached was rationally based on the evidence and was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Further, the plaintiff cites <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>190 Conn. 345, 460 A.2d 1287 (1983), in which our Supreme Court held that the trial court had abused its discretion by awarding child support in an amount grossly disproportionate to the needs of the child. Id., 349. In <em>Brown, </em>the amount of child support was only $15 less than the total weekly expenses of the entire household, which included the custodial parent and an emancipated daughter. Id., 348. Our Supreme Court ruled that the support award was so disproportionate as to be disguised alimony. Id., 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In this case, however, the trial court had before it evidence that the defendant\u2019s total weekly household expenses were $1825.23. The child support order was $925.23 less than the total weekly expenses of the entire household. Thus, <em>Brown </em>is inapposite. In short, the trial court did not abuse its discretion and correctly applied the appropriate law in modifying the plaintiff\u2019s child support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s third claim relates to the trial court\u2019s award of $10,000 in attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant. During discovery, the defendant moved for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62. That section provides the trial court with the discretion to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to a spouse in accordance with the parties\u2019 respective financial abilities and the criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82. <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>13 Conn. App. 300, 305, 536 A.2d 978, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 806, 540 A.2d 374 (1988). The plaintiff claims that the award was not based on sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The trial court had before it the defendant\u2019s sworn financial affidavit that listed outstanding attorney\u2019s fees of $2334.35. Further, the trial court was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>aware of the extensive nature of discovery and observed two days of trial. Thus, the trial court had evidence before it from which it could reasonably conclude that the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees related to this proceeding would be at least $10,000. Further, the trial court stated in its memorandum of decision that it had considered both of the parties\u2019 abilities to pay and the criteria enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
