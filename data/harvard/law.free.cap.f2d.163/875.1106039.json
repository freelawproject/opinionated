United States, 320 U.S. 549, 64 S.Ct. 346, 88 L.Ed. 305. United States v. Balogh, 2 Cir., 160 F.2d 999, is a case directly in point. In addition, if we should hold that he had put himself in a position to make the defense, it is quite plain, under Lemien v. United States, 5 Cir., 158 F.2d 550, and Wells v. United States, 5 Cir., 158 F.2d 932, that none of his points are well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
