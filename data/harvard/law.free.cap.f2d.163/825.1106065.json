Appellant properly concedes that its burden is to show such insufficiency of that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-24\">We are of the opinion that there was such sufficiency to support the findings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>The libel was prosecuted under the Act of March 24, 1943, 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 1291, providing that it be enforced pursuant to the Suits in Admiralty Act and, since that Act provides that the government is liable for costs (46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 743) our rule 27 (4) exempting the United States from costs is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The decree is affirmed with costs,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
