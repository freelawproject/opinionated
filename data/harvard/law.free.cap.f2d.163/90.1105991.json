A. Lenahan\u201d on her port, and the barge \u201cA. J. Ruddy\u201d on her starboard, side. The collision occurred at about 7:20 a. m. on April 23,1945, in the East River just east of North Brother Island. The District Court found that previous to the accident the \u201cBrimstone\u201d was proceeding in a general easterly direction on the starboard side of the channel between North Brother Island and South Brother Island. Approaching the \u201cBrimstone\u201d from the opposite direction were the steamship \u201cFern-cliffe,\u201d with the escorting tug \u201cW.S.A. No. 10\u201d on her portside, and the steamship \u201cFort Ash,\u201d which was behind these two. The District Court found that the \u201cBrimstone\u201d sighted the \u201cFort Ash\u201d about a mile away in the channel north of North Brother Island. About that time the \u201cFort Ash\u201d left the northerly channel and headed toward the channel between the two islands. The \u201cBrimstone,\u201d then entering the channel, signalled for a port-to-port passage by blowing one whistle. Hearing no answer from the \u201cFort Ash,\u201d the \u201cBrimstone\u201d later blew another one whistle, and finally an alarm, and commenced backing. Nevertheless the bow of the \u201cRuddy\" came into contact with the starboard bow of the \u201cFort Ash.\u201d As a result of the collision the \u201cRuddy\u201d sank in her own fairway within a few minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">There was testimony from the \u201cFort Ash\u201d that she had four times blown the two-whistle signal for a starboard-to-starboard passage and that just previous to the accident the \u201cBrimstone\u201d had swerved to starboard into the fairway of the \u201cFort Ash.\u201d The District Court rejected this testimony, however, relying heavily on the testimony of the disinterested witness So-derberg, master of the tug \u201cW.S.A. No. 10.\u201d The court specifically found that the \u201cBrimstone\u201d had not changed her course prior to backing. On the question of the exchange of signals it said that it accepted the version of the, \u201cBrimstone\u201d ; in addition, it found that the \u201cFort Ash\u2019s\u201d starboard whistle cord was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">The owner of the \u201cBrimstone\u201d and her tow filed a libel against the master of the \u201cFort Ash\u201d for damages to its vessels, and the master of the \u201cFort Ash\u201d filed a cross libel in rem against the \u201cBrimstone.\u201d The District Court entered an interlocutory decree in the libel finding the \u201cFort Ash\u201d solely at fault and it dismissed the cross libel. The A. J. Ruddy, D.C.E.D.N.Y., 69 F.Supp. 268. From this decree the respondent-cross-libellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">The facts found by the District Court are amply supported by the evidence, and on those facts the court\u2019s conclusion properly followed. The \u201cBrimstone\u2019s\u201d signals and movements upon sighting the \u201cFort Ash\u201d were entirely correct. Having signalled for a proper port-to-port passage, she thereafter kept to the starboard side of the channel. Being the privileged vessel, she was <em>not </em>obliged to change her course. Actually it would have been improper for her to change before she backed, for such action would have been inconsistent with her signals at a time when she had no reason to suppose the \u201cFort Ash\u201d would not assent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>them. The \u201cBrimstone\u2019s\u201d failure to have a lookout did not contribute to the accident, for those in charge of her navigation saw the \u201cFort Ash\u201d about a mile away; and since no whistles were sounded by the \u201cFort Ash,\u201d a lookout would have heard none.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">On the other hand, the \u201cFort Ash,\u201d having heard the \u201cBrimstone\u2019s\u201d signals, maneuvered inconsistently with them, without informing the \u201cBrimstone\u201d of her intentions. By failing to keep to starboard moreover, the \u201cFort Ash\u201d violated the Narrow Channel Rule, art. 25 of the Inland Rules, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 210. The width of the channel at the point of collision was about 750 feet, and navigation in it was therefore governed by the Narrow Channel Rule. The Portchester, 2 Cir., 94 F.2d 644, 645; The Trim, D.C.Mass., 30 F.Supp. 283, 285, affirmed General Seafoods Corp. v. J. S. Packard Dredging Co., 1 Cir., 120 F.2d 117.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally the \u201cFort Ash,\u201d although the burdened vessel, sought to enter the channel between the Brother Islands at too great a rate of speed. Gatewood v. Sanders, 4 Cir., 152 F.2d 379. The court found that when she left the northerly channel she had a speed of about nine knots an hour. For a minute and a half before the collision her engines had been going astern, but she was making no sternway. On the contrary\u00bb, she was still making about five knots headway at the time of the collision. Informed of the \u201cBrimstone\u2019s\u201d intentions, having the choice of two channels, and being the more maneuverable vessel, the \u201cFort Ash\u201d had the last opportunity to avoid the accident. But as the pilot of the \u201cFort Ash\u201d testified, he wished to pass the ammunition ship \u201cFerncliffe,\u201d without going too close to her. Therefore, although it was customary for vessels of the \u201cFort Ash\u2019s\u201d tonnage to take the northerly channel, especially when the southerly channel was being used, he turned into his portside of the southerly channel at a high rate of speed and made the collision inevitable. Then, after the collision, he continued on with enough speed to succeed in his maneuver and cut in ahead of the \u201cFerncliffe\u201d on emerging from the southerly channel.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-5\"> The Hygrade No. 12 v. The Talisman, 2 Cir., 153 F.2d 52, City of New York v. American Export Lines, 2 Cir., 131 F.2d 902, and The Wrestler, 2 Cir., 232 F. 448, which declare the East River not to be a narrow channel, are not in point here, for the collisions there involved occurred in the lower part of the East River, where it is not divided by islands and hence is much wider than the channel in' which the collision here involved occurred. Indeed in The Wrestler, supra, 232 F. at 450, it is intimated that navigation around Blackwell\u2019s Island, the point nearest the mouth of the River at which a narrowing of the channel occurs, may be governed by the Narrow Channel Rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
