Int. Rev.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 713(e) (1), 722, in force in 1942, may both be used to determine the excess profits credit of a taxpayer for the year 1942, or whether the two sections are mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-19\">We will refer herein to petitioner as taxpayer, and to respondent as the Government. The facts and the statutory provisions are both lengthy and complex. We therefore set them forth in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-20\">The statutory scheme of the now-repealed excess profits tax was to separate corporate profits earned during the war years into two classes, normal and excess, and to tax each class of profits at different rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-21\">Under the 1942 law, applicable here, a corporate taxpayer first determined its ordinary net income, or \u201cnormal tax income\u201d, and then, by additions and subtractions to that figure, not material here, determined its \u201cexcess profits net income\u201d. From this last item, certain deductions are made, the most important of which is the \u201cexcess profits credit\u201d. This credit represents the statutory standard of normal earnings. Once this \u201cexcess profits credit\u201d is determined it represents the profits (for 1942 in this case) which are subject to the normal tax, imposed at the rate of 40% of such profits. All of taxpayer\u2019s earnings above the \u201cexcess profits credit\u201d (with exceptions not material here) are subject to the excess profits tax imposed at the rate of 90% of such profits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-22\">In the computation of a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cexcess profits credit\u201d we have at least one instance in tax law where a taxpayer desires to have his normal profits as high as possible. For the higher the normal profits the greater the amount of taxpayer\u2019s earnings that will be taxed at the 40% rate rather than the 90% rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-23\">All but a small fraction of the \u201cexcess profits credit\u201d is made up in this case hy first taking taxpayer\u2019s actual earnings for the four years 1936 to 1939, inclusive. \u00a7 713(b), I.R.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">For those four years taxpayer earned the following amounts:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">1936 $ 89,422.67</p>\n<p id=\"A77\">193763,705.57</p>\n<p id=\"Ai\">193838,127.75</p>\n<p id=\"Agp\">1939111,839.77</p>\n<p id=\"AOH\">Total,$303,096.76</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">the earnings in the are automatically Under \u00a7 713(e) (1), lowest year (1938) raised by the \u201c75% rule\u201d to an amount equal to 75% of the average earnings of the other three years. This sum, ($66 242.25 in this case) is required to be substituted for the actual 1938 earnings. Considering this new figure for 1938, taxpayer\u2019s total for the four year base period is increased to $331,-211.26, and the \u201caverage base period net income\u201d is thus $82,802.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">And when we take 95% of this \u201caverage base period net income\u201d, or the sum of $78,662.68, we have computed the excess profits credit. \u00a7 713(a) (1) (A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">Therefore, in the absence of any further facts, $78,662.68 of taxpayer\u2019s 1942 earnings would be subject to the norma] tax and all of its earnings over that amount would be taxed as excess profits at the rate of 90%.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">In the instant case additional facts are present: Taxpayer claims relief under \u00a7 722 and in pursuance of that claim it is stipulated that taxpayer has established that its <em>normal </em>output was interrupted in 1937 by strikes \u201c* * * events peculiar in its experience, as provided by \u00a7 722(b)(1), I.R.C.\u201d. The Government has further stipulated that taxpayer has established that its actual 1937 earnings ($63,706.57) were abnormally low, and that \u201cthe fair and just amount representing normal earnings which would be used by [taxpayer] as its constructive average base period net income under the provisions of \u00a7 722 (exclusive of \u00a7 713), for the year 1942 would be determined after reconstructing earnings for the \u201e year 1937 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>* * * from the actual amount * * * to the reconstructed amount of $85,263.34.\u201d Section 722 provides that when a taxpayer establishes (as taxpayer here has done by stipulation) that \u201cthe tax computed under this subchapter (without the benefit of this section) results in an excessive and discriminatory tax and establishes what would be a fair and just amount representing normal earnings to be used as a .constructive average base period net income * * * <em>the tax shall be determined by using such constructive average base period net income in lieu of the average base period net income otherwise determined under this subchapter\" </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">It is also stipulated that taxpayer is not entitled to any other constructive adjustments to actual earnings under \u00a7 722 in the other three base period years.</p>\n<p

Government\u2019s method.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-33\">It is apparent that taxpayer\u2019s method requires <em>first, </em>the use of \u00a7 722 to raise the 1937 figures, and, <em>second, </em>the use of \u00a7 713 (e)(1) to raise the 1938 figures, since one of the three years used to obtain the new 1938 figure is the reconstructed (not the actual) figure for 1937 obtained by the use of \u00a7 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-36\">The solution of this case resolves itself into a problem of statutory construction, the key to which lies in determining whether, in computing the \u201cconstructive average base period net income\u201d under \u00a7 722, the 75% rule of the \u201caverage base period net income\u201d of \u00a7 713(e)(1) may also be used, or whether the two are mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The Government determined a deficiency of $2,106.08 in taxpayer\u2019s excess profits tax liability for the year 1942 as a result of denying taxpayer\u2019s claimed relief under \u00a7 722. Resort was had to the Tax Court. In sustaining the Government\u2019s contention that court placed its decision on two grounds: First, that \u00a7 713(e)(1) does not permit the use of earnings constructed under \u00a7 722 for any of the three years of the base period used in raising the lowest year; and, second, that \u00a7 722 provides that the \u201cconstructive average base period net income\u201d, computed under that section shall be used \u201cin lieu of\u201d the \u201caverage base period net income\u201d, computed under \u00a7 713(e) (D-</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The Tax Court concluded that petitioner had failed to establish that relief afforded by the use of \u00a7 713(e)(1) alone, and allowed by the Government, was less than a \u201cfair and just amount representing normal earnings * * and therefore held that the Government had correctly determined taxpayer\u2019s excess profits tax liability for 1942.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">At the outset of our consideration of this case we are met by the Government\u2019s argument that \u00a7 732(c) deprives us of jurisdiction to review the determination of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Section 732(c) provides: \u201cIf in the determination of the tax liability under this subchapter the determination of any question is necessary solely by reason of section 711(b)(1) (H), (I), (J) or (K), section 721, or section 722, the determination of such questions shall not be reviewed or redetermined by any court or agency except the [Tax Court].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">In James F. Waters Inc., v. C.I.R., 160 F. 2d 596, we held that \u00a7 732(c) is valid, and that Congress may preclude judicial review of the determinations of the Tax Court in respect to statutes such as \u00a7 722 which create special relief provisions \u201creminiscent of sovereign gracious clemency\u201d Pohatcong Hosiery Mills, Inc., v. C.I.R., 3, Cir., 162 F.2d 146, 149. We think the determination of me question before the Tax Court involved both \u00a7 722 and \u00a7 713(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">It is of course possible to cast the problem, as the Government has done, solely in terms of \u00a7 722 by stating that taxpayer was allowed the benefits of \u00a7 713(e) (1) and that the only question is whether he is entitled to \u00a7 722 relief. But the nature of the \u00a7 722 relief sought by taxpayer should not be overlooked. Taxpayer concededly has established, under \u00a7 722, that its earnings for the year 1937 should be raised. Averaging said constructive 1937 earnings with taxpayer\u2019s actual earnings for the other three years of the base period (since taxpayer is not entitled to raise constructively its earnings for those other three years) would result in its excess profits credit being less than if its 1938 earnings are raised under \u00a7 713(e)(1) and its 1937 earnings are left unaffected by \u00a7 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Taxpayer asks to raise both 1937 and 1938 earnings by the use of both sections. It was this double relief that the Government refused to allow, and the determination of that question clearly was necessary by reason of both sections. For were it not for \u00a7 713(e)(1) taxpayer could have no question as to his tax liability to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">By stipulation he established the right to raise the 1937 figures under \u00a7 722, and by stipulation he was not entitled to raise other years under that section. The determination of his tax liability can be resolved only by the determination of a question arising under both sections, namely, whether taxpayer may raise his 1938 earnings under \u00a7 713(e)(1) by using the constructive earnings of one year computed under \u00a7 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">The Government concedes that \u201cthere is here involved only the question whether the \u00a7 722 construction should reflect the \u00a7 713(e)(1) adjustment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">It is true that \u00a7 722(d) requires a taxpayer to compute his tax without applying \u00a7 722, but while this may be an argument in favor of the Tax Court\u2019s decision, since taxpayer\u2019s method requires him to use \u00a7 7?2 before using \u00a7 713(e)(1), it is not an argument that the determination of the question is solely necessary by reason of \u00a7 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-16\">As indicated in Waters v. C.I.R., supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>[160 F.2d 598] we think that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 732(c), was \u201cmotivated by practical considerations in limiting review of issues * * raised under the sections set out in \u00a7 732(c), and that the principal concern of Congress was that the ab-normalties and unusual factual circumstances which give rise to relief under those sections should all \u201cbe decided by one group familiar with the problems involved.\u201d House Report 2333, 77th Congress, 2nd Session, quoted in Waters v. C.I.R., supra, footnote 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">As to the scope of our review aside fom \u00a7 732(c), we think we have here a pure question of law, and while we \u201cattach weight to the decision of points of law by an administrative body having special competence to deal with the subject matter\u201d (Dobson v. C.I.R., 320 U.S. 489, 502, 64 S.Ct. 239, 247, 88 L.Ed. 248), we nevertheless have jurisdiction to review \u201crules of general applicability [announced by the Tax Court] on clear-cut questions of law.\u201d Crane v. C.I.R., 67 S.Ct. 1047, 1055; Pohatcong Hosiery Mills v. C.I.R., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Turning to a consideration of the merits of this controversy, the answer to the problems lies (1) in the fact that two separate statutory concepts are involved, namely, \u201caverage base period net income\u201d set out in \u00a7 713(e)(1), and \u201cconstructive average base period net income\u201d, found in \u00a7 722; (2) that in the event conditions permitting the use of the second concept are present, it is to be used \u201cin lieu of\u201d the first; and (3) that, therefore, both concepts cannot be used together.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The difference between the two concepts is revealed more clearly when it is remembered that the \u201caverage base period net income\u201d is computed under \u00a7 713(e)(1) by automatic and inflexible methods. If certain conditions are present (as they were here) the earnings for the lowest year are raised to an amount equal to 75% of the average of the other three years. This is always done, regardless of what caused the low earnings in the one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">On the other hand \u201cconstructive average base period net income\u201d is established by the <em>discretionary </em>use of rules and methods thought to be the best way of correcting abnormal and unusual events, peculiar to the individual taxpayer\u2019s experience.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">The earnings of virtually all corporations may have been low in 1938; if so, all are raised under \u00a7 713(e)(1). But because of the flexible methods available in \u00a7 722 cases, elements personal to the taxpayer may be considered and its true normal earnings may be more accurately measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">Section 722 requires that a taxpayer not only show that the tax (computed without benefit or application of \u00a7 722) results in an excessive and discriminatory tax,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but he must also establish \u201cwhat would be a fair and just amount representing normal earnings to be used as a constructive average base period net income for the purposes of an excess profits tax based upon a comparison of normal earnings and earnings during an excess profits tax period. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZA\">When no abnormalities have occurred in the base period, or other events unusual and peculiar in the experience of the taxpayer, then the averaging methods of \u00a7 713 (e)(1) will produce a satisfactory method of determining average base period earnings. But if the taxpayer has had some abnormal events in its base period (such as the 1937 strike here), then taxpayer is required by \u00a7 722 to establish that which would be a fair and just amount representing normal earnings. That is a different concept than the automatic statutory formula of \u00a7 713(e)(1), which may or may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>represent a \u201cfair and just amount\u201d', since it requires an inflexible raising of the lowest year.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Taxpayer argues that there is no evidence that an average computed under \u00a7 713(e)(1) is <em>not </em>a fair and just amount. Conceding this to be true and that it is theoretically possible to use both sections, the fact remains that Congress has clearly provided in \u00a7 <em>722 </em>that a taxpayer must establish what <em>is </em>a fair and just amount representing normal earnings which he must then use as a \u201cconstructive average base period net income in lieu of the average base period net income otherwise determined under this subchapter.\u201d The only place the \u201caverage base period net income\u201d is \u201cotherwise determined [in the] subchapter\u201d is \u00a7 713(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">There is no statutory authorization for using the 75% rule of \u00a7 713(e)(1) in computing the constructive average of \u00a7 722. On the other hand, we think there is a statutory prohibition against using both sections in that \u00a7 722 requires the constructive average to be used in lieu of the \u00a7 713 average.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Here taxpayer has established what would be a fair and just amount representing normal earnings <em>for the year </em>1937. He <em>contends he may also </em>raise his 1938 earnings by \u00a7 713(e) (1), but that which is automatically raised may not be a fair and just amount, and one must be used in lieu of the other. Our remaining inquiry is, what constitutes the \u201cfair and just amount representing normal earnings\u201d which is to be used in lieu of the \u00a7 713(e)(1) average?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">It seems clear that it means the <em>actual </em>earnings for each year in which no abnormality occurs, <em>and </em>the constructive earnings for years in which abnormalities, etc., within \u00a7 732 do occur, averaged together. This is the <em>constructive </em>average base period net income, and it is to be used in lieu of the \u00a7 713(e)(1) average which is designed to relieve automatically taxpayers who have no abnormalities or other events within \u00a7 732, but who do have a year of low earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The regulations covering this subject (S 35.722-2(b) (1) of Regulations 112) provide: \u201c\u00a7 722(a) provides for the determination of a constructive average base period net income * * *. Therefore, in computing such amount a taxpayer is not entitled to use the rules provided by \u00a7 713(e) (1). * * * Since the constructive average base period net income is the fair and just amount representing normal earnings and will reflect adjustments for abnormally low base period years, a taxpayer having computed such amount is not entitled in addition to apply the rules provided by \u00a7 713 (e)(1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">These Regulations set forth a reasonable and correct interpretation of the law and taxpayer\u2019s contention that the Regulations are invalid cannot be sustained on any of the grounds urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">Taxpayer assails the decision of the Tax Court on several additional grounds, which, insofar as it is necessary to consider them, may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">1. \u00a7 722(b) \u201centitles\u201d a taxpayer to use \u00a7 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">2. By the 1942 amendments to \u00a7 722 Congress did not intend to deprive a taxpayer of his right, which existed under the 1941 Act, to use both \u00a7 713 and \u00a7 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">3. The two sections are in pari materia, and must be construed together so as to give full effect to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-17\">4. The constructive average must be used since taxpayer has established the two conditions precedent to the use of \u00a7 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-18\">First: Taxpayer\u2019s contention is that . \u00a7 722 (b) by providing that \u201cThe tax computed under this subchapter * * * shall be considered to be excessive * * * in the case of a taxpayer entitled to use the excess profits credit based on income pursuant to section 713 * * * \u201d, entitled it to use \u00a7 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-19\">We do not so read \u00a7 722 (b). It merely provides that it applies to a taxpayer who is entitled to use the excess profits credit based on income, pursuant to \u00a7 713. There are two methods of computing excess profits credit: the income method, and the invested capital method (\u00a7 714 et seq.). Not all taxpayers are <em>entitled </em>to use the \u201cexcess profits credit based on income\u201d, i.e., the income method. Under \u00a7 712, only domestic corporations in existence prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>January 1, 1940, are \u201centitled to use\u201d both the income method of \u00a7 713 and the invested capital method. Other domestic corporations, and all foreign corporations must use the invested capital method.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Section 722 (b) is not authority for the proposition that a taxpayer is entitled to use both \u00a7 713 (e) (1) and \u00a7 722; it merely refers to those corporations which are entitled to use the income method of \u00a7 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Second: It is true that \u00a7 722 in the 1941 Act did provide that the average base period net income, then to be determined under \u00a7 722 should be computed as in \u00a7 713. It is also true that the 1942 version of \u00a7 722 entirely omitted this provision and instead required a \u201cconstructive average\u201d to be used \u201cin lieu of\u201d the \u00a7 713 average.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Under these circumstances, and with such a drastic alteration of the law, a comparison of the two acts warrants the conclusion that Congress which, in 1941, had permitted the two sections to be used together, declared in 1942 that the sections were mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Taxpayer cites committee reports to show that the 1942 amendments were designed to broaden the relief granted under \u00a7 722; and cases holding that the repeal and simultaneous reenactment of substantially the same statutory provisions are to be construed as a continuation of the- old statute. The statute being clear resort to extrinsic aids to construction is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">It is contended that the \u201cin lieu of\u201d clause of \u00a7 722 leaves unanswered the question of whether the constructive average is an ordinary arithmetical average or an average computed under \u00a7 713 (e) (1). We do not agree. The constructive average of \u00a7 722 is to be used in lieu of the \u00a7 713 (e) (1) average; hence it cannot be the same average as that called for in \u00a7 713 (e) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">Taxpayer also contends that the \u201cin lieu of\u201d clause means that constructive \u201cearnings\u201d are to be used in lieu of the actual earnings of \u00a7 713. But \u00a7 722 does not so read. To adopt taxpayer\u2019s argument would do violence to the statutory language found therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">Third: Having held that \u00a7 713 (e) (1) and \u00a7 722 refer to entirely different and mutually exclusive statutory concepts, it follows that rules relating to statutes in pari materia are not material. We repeat that the construction we adopt gives effect to \u00a7 722 when a constructive average is to be used, and to \u00a7 713 (e) (1) when an average is to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">Fourth: Taxpayer argues that since it has established both conditions precedent for the use of \u00a7 722, the tax must be determined by the constructive average. With this we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-16\">But taxpayer goes further and contends that the constructive average must be computed in accordance with \u00a7 713 (e) (1) because taxpayer will otherwise be left with a tax which the statute declares to be excessive and discriminatory. With this we do not agree. The fact that taxpayer has shown the abnormality for 1937 entitles it to correct its 1937 figures under \u00a7 722. If it does this the excess profits credit, computed without use of \u00a7 713 (e) (1) turns out to be a lower figure in this case than if the \u00a7 713 (e) (1) average is used without reference to \u00a7 722. But because that is the result of using \u00a7 722 alone here, it does not follow that such use of \u00a7 722 alone nullifies \u00a7 713 (e) (1) in all cases, since in other instances where different. earnings are involved, the use of \u00a7 722 alone would result in a higher excess profits credit than if \u00a7 713 (e) (1) alone were used.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Although taxpayer has established an abnormality for 1937 and so should use \u00a7 722 in lieu of \u00a7 713 (e) (1), which is for taxpayers who suffered no abnormalities during the base period, the -Government has permitted taxpayer to use \u00a7 713 (ej (1) instead of \u00a7 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Other contentions have been made. We have considered them and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-24\"> Cf. \u00a7\u00a7 710, 711, 713, I.R.C., 26 U.S. C.A.
