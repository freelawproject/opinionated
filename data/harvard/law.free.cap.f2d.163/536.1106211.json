Six of the eleven counts alleged the unlawful and willful acquisition, possession and control of \u201ccounterfeit and forged ration coupons, purporting to represent * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b590-25\">ration points of the type used for meats, fats, fish and cheese, and purporting to be valid for the month of May, 1945\u201d. Four counts charged illegal use of such coupons, and the eleventh count set forth that the appellants had unlawfully acquired, possessed, and controlled counterfeit and forged ration coupons purporting to represent Stamp No. 36 of War Ration Book No. 4, \u201ceach purporting to be valid for five pounds of sugar for the month of May, 1945\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-26\">The appellants filed a demurrer, a motion to quash, and a motion for a bill of particulars, each of which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-27\">After presenting its evidence, the ap-pellee moved to amend the information so as to substitute the words \u201cration documents\u201d for the words \u201cration coupons\u201d wherever the latter appeared in the infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>mation. Claiming surprise, the appellants objected, but the court below permitted the appellee to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">\u201cIn the interest of expediency\u201d, the appellee voluntarily dismissed four counts. After the court had expressed the view that \u201cthe evidence is insufficient to tie these defendants into the depositing of any of the ration coupons\u201d, the appellee dismissed four more counts. This left only Counts 9, 10, and 11 to be considered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">After setting forth the jurisdictional basis for the prosecution and the various provisions of General Ration Order No. 8 that the appellants are alleged to have violated, the three counts are in substance as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">9. On or about May 1, 1945, in Los Angeles, the appellants willfully and unlawfully acquired, possessed, and controlled 6,000 counterfeit and forged ration documents, purporting to represent approximately 60,000 ration points of the type used for meats, etc., and purporting to be valid during May, 1945, which were not acquired, etc., by the appellants personally or as agents for another, in accordance with Revised Ration Order No. 16, or any other ration order, for the reason that said documents were not issued to them, but were acquired by the appellants without the transfer therefor at any time of foods covered by said Order No. 16, and had been purchased by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">10. On or about May 20, 1945, the appellants acquired, etc., approximately 20,000 counterfeit and forged ration documents, purporting to represent about 200,-000 ration points of the type used for meats, etc., and purporting to be valid for May, which were not acquired, etc., by appellants personally, etc., in accordance with Order No. 16, etc., for the reason that the documents were not issued to the appellants, etc., but were acquired by them without the transfer therefor at any time of foods, etc., and had been purchased by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">11. On or about May 28, 1945, the appellants acquired, etc., about 3503 counterfeit and forged ration documents, purporting to represent Stamp No. 36, etc., and each purporting to be valid for five pounds of sugar during May, which documents were not acquired by the appellants personally, etc., in accordance with Second Revised Ration Order No. 3, or any other ration order, since the documents were not issued to the appellants, etc., but were acquired by the appellants without the delivery and transfer of any sugar therefor, and were purchased by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">At the close of the appellee\u2019s case, counsel for the appellants moved that these three counts be dismissed as to the appellant Gilbert. In their brief, counsel refer to that motion as being also one for a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d. Technically, the assumption is not accurate, but we do not make a point of <em>it</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">The appellants at the same time moved to strike the same three counts, presumably as to both Fredrick and Gilbert.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">Both motions were denied. It is to be observed that they were not made at the close of all the evidence. In so far as the motions are to be construed as being for a directed verdict, they should have been thus made. Hansen v. Boyd, 161 U.S. 397, 402, 403, 16 S.Ct. 571, 40 L.Ed. 746; Bank of Italy v. F. Romeo &amp; Co., 9 Cir., 287 F. 5, 7; Milleson v. United States, 8 Cir., 78 F.2d 60; Nailling v. United States, 6 Cir., 124 F.2d 431, certiorari denied, 316 U.S. 675, 62 S.Ct. 1043, 86 L.Ed. 1749, petitions for rehearing denied, 316 U.S. 710, 711, 62 S.Ct. 1267, 86 L.Ed. 1776, petition for rehearing denied, 6 Cir., 142 F.2d 551; Minnehaha County, S. D. v. Kelley, 8 Cir., 150 F.2d 356, 359, 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">Despite this defect in the appellants\u2019 presentation of their contention that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict, in the interest of complete fairness we will hereinafter consider that question. In view of that same objection of the appellants\u2019, we will limit our statement of facts to a summary of the appellee\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">Theodore Freeman, the appellants\u2019 office manager, testified that they operate two markets, the Hollywood Ranch Market and Bill\u2019s Ranch Market. Each market maintains a meat department and. a grocery department, which the appellants themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>operate. The witness had charge of depositing the ration coupons, writing the checks, and balancing the accounts. Gilbert was \u201cprimarily\u201d the grocery manager and buyer, and Frederick was \u201cprimarily\u201d meat buyer for the partnership. The ration coupons or stamps were deposited in the Hollywood State Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Alma E. Keevy, who had supervision over ten girls at the Verification Center of the Office of Price Administration at San Francisco, said that the Center \u201cis a place where all of the used ration currency comes back to and is checked for all irregularities\u201d. It checks coupons coming out of all the Western States, including California, which are sent in by registered mail from the various banks. She explained and demonstrated the use of a fluorescent lamp in detecting counterfeit stamps. She testified that she had so tested all the stamps in certain envelopes in evidence in this case, and could tell by notations on the envelopes containing them how many she had found to be genuine and how many were counterfeit. According to her testimony, an overwhelming majority of the stamps in those envelopes were counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">On cross-examination, Miss Keevy was asked by appellants\u2019 counsel whether she had not discussed the validity of the coupons in this case, before coming into court. She made the following damaging reply: \u201cNo, I did not discuss it with anyone other than my boss. When we find a terrific amount of bad stamps, as this market produced, up there, well then, I naturally would take anything quite as large to my boss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Harriet Welling, ration teller of the Hollywood State Bank, said on the stand that in 1945, probably in May, she turned over to Thaddeus R. Loud, special agent of the Currency Protection Branch of the Office of Price Administration, a group of deposit envelopes that were in the bank at that time, all of which envelopes came from the Hollywood Ranch Market. She took the envelopes to the directors\u2019 room and she and Loud examined them. Loud explained \u201cwith the lamp\u201d \u201chow the good ones looked and how the bad ones looked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Later, Loud himself testified that he had examined \u201cevery one\u201d of the stamps in every envelope in Government\u2019s Exhibit 34 \u2014 which Miss Welling had identified as being made up of envelopes that had come from the Hollywood Ranch Market. Loud said that of the 210,000 \u201cpoints\u201d contained in the envelopes endorsed by the bank with the date of May 24, 138,450 were counterfeits; and that \u201cthere were 200,000 points bearing * <em>* * </em>the bank endorsement dated May 18th, and of those 200,000 points contained in those envelopes, 110,170 are counterfeits\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Max Jones, one of the principle witnesses for the appellee, was also referred to by witnesses and by counsel as \u201cDick\u201d Jones. Twice in their brief, the appellants seek to make a point of this variance in name, characterizing it as \u201cnoteworthy\u201d. Whether the appellants seek to cast a doubt on the identity of Jones, is not clear. At any rate, the point was not raised at the trial, when it could easily have been cleared up, and our own careful study of the record convinces us that counsel for both sides and all the witnesses who referred to Jones knew that Max Jones and \u201cDick\u201d Jones are one and the same man. In examining his own witnesses, counsel for the appellants himself referred to Max Jones as \u201cDick\u201d Jones, while in the appellants\u2019 brief the preferred designation is Max Jones. It is clear that for the purposes of this case, the two names are interchangeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Jones gave his residence as the Los Angeles County Jail, and said that he was incarcerated there following a conviction for felony in connection with gasoline rationing stamps. He testified that in 1945, probably during the first week in April, he had had a conversation with the appellant Gilbert at the Bill\u2019s Ranch Market in Burbank; that Gilbert asked him whether he \u201cknew where they could get meat stamps\u201d; that the witness told Gilbert that he didn\u2019t know but would find out; and that Gilbert said \u201che could use some\u201d if the witness \u201ccould get some\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">A few days later, Jones said, he and Gilbert met again. Jones introduced him to A1 Becker and Mert Powell, told him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>that they had some stamps, and then departed, according to the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">A third conversation between Gilbert and Jones was held about a month or six weeks later, Jones testified, giving the substance of that conversation as follows: \u201cThey had been questioned about the stamps, their stamps or their rationing account, and the complaint was that the stamps that they had gotten from Becker were supposedly all right and had turned out to be counterfeits or invalid stamps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Jones said that Gilbert told him \u201cthat his partner, Fredrick, knew more about it\u201d, and that, accordingly, Jones went to see Fredrick. The witness was not sure whether the Fredrick that he talked to was the appellant Fredrick or the latter\u2019s brother, but he believed that it was the appellant Fredrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Allen Becker testified that he had a conversation with Gilbert \u201caround the end of March\u201d, 1945, in the presence of \u201cDick\u201d Jones and Powell. Jones told Gilbert that Becker \u201cmight be able to locate some ration points for him\u201d, and asked him how many he needed, according to Becker, who quoted Gilbert as replying, \u201cApproximately 100,000\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">About two weeks later, Becker went to Gilbert with \u201cA package of points\u201d, \u201cand he said I had better contact Fredrick at the Hollywood Ranch Market,\u201d according to Becker\u2019s testimony. Becker also testified that he went to see Fredrick and told him that those were the points he wanted, and that \u201che checked them\u201d. Becker continued: \u201cHe took some of them out and looked at them and he said he didn\u2019t know what they were, whether they were good or bad or what they were, and I said, \u2018Well, if they are,\u2019 I said, \u2018you will have to find out \u2014 if they are not genuine. I don\u2019t want anything to do with it and neither do you,\u2019 and he said he would check, so I left some of the stamps there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">There were 100,000 points in the \u201cpackage\u201d that Becker had with him, he testified. The stamps were in envelopes, and Fredrick opened two or three of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Several days later, Becker telephoned to Fredrick to inquire whether the latter had found anything about the stamps, and Fredrick answered, \u201cNo, not yet\u201d, according to Becker.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">\u201cA couple of weeks\u201d after leaving the stamps with Fredrick, or \u201cin the early part of April\u201d, Becker, according to his testimony, left some envelopes \u2014 he said he believed there were eleven of them \u2014 with Fredrick, who \u201cjust counted the envelopes and paid for them.\u201d There were \u201csupposed to be\u201d 500 stamps in each envelope, or 55,000 points in all, Becker said, each stamp purporting to be worth 10 points. Becker added that there might have been 60,000 points in the envelopes, since he thought he received $600 for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">Several weeks later, in another conversation, probably by telephone, Fredrick informed Becker that \u201cThey wanted more stamps\u201d, Becker testified. Becker took the stamps to Fredrick, in probably 40 envelopes, each containing 5,000 points, for which Becker testified that he was paid \u201caround $2,000.00\u201d in currency by Fredrick. All the stamps left with Fredrick by Becker were red stamps, Becker said, except that the last time there was also one envelope of sugar stamps, which Fredrick said \u201cthey could use\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">Several weeks later, according to Becker\u2019s testimony, he went to the store and Fredrick told him that he had found out that \u201cthe stamps weren\u2019t any good\u201d and \u201che said something about getting his money back\u201d. \u201cI asked him where he thought I would get it when I didn\u2019t even know who it was who brought them. * * * I told him if the party contacted me that contacted me before I would tell him about it \u2014 that that was all I could do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to both appellants on all three counts, with a recommendation for leniency in favor of the appellant Gilbert. From judgments based upon that verdict, the present appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-16\">The applicable paragraph of 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 633, supra, reads as follows: \"(a) * * * (5) Any person who willfully performs any act prohibited, or willfully fails to perform any act required by, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>any provision of this subsection (a) or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, whether heretofore or hereafter issued, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The pertinent sections of the applicable ration orders as they stood at the time the offenses were committed are copied below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The fourteen specifications of error urged by the appellants will be considered seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">1. <em>\u201cThe information should have been dismissed since it was filed after Revised Ration Order No. 16 was revoked.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The appellants point out that the order in question was revoked on November 23, 1945, effective the next day (10 F.R. 14436). The information was filed on January 22, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">There is no merit in this contention. In United States v. Hark, 320 U.S. 531, 536, 64 S.Ct. 359, 362, 88 L.Ed. 290, the court said: <em>\u201cThird. </em>We hold that the revocation of the regulation did not prevent indictment and conviction for violation of its provisions at a time when it remained in force. The reason for the common law rule that the repeal of a statute ends the power to prosecute for prior violations is absent in the case of a prosecution for violation of a regulation issued pursuant to an existing statute which expresses a continuing policy,'to enforce which the regulation was authorized. Revocation of the regulation does not repeal the statute; and though the regulation calls the statutory penalties into play, the statute, not the regulation, creates the offense and imposes punishment for its violation.\u201d See also United States v. Trilling, DC Pa., 51 F. Supp. 843, 845; United States v. Delfrate, DC Pa., 54 F.Supp. 565; United States v. Philipp, DC Pa., 63 F.Supp. 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">2. <em>\u201cThe court erred in overruling defendants\u2019 demurrer and motion to quash.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Several objections are urged by the appellants under this general heading.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">First, it is contended that \u201cthe information did not state facts sufficient to-constitute a crime against the United States.\u201d The chief ground for this objection seems to be that \u201cthe appellants were not charged with knowledge of the counterfeit and forged character of the ration currency involved,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">Although it might be argued that the allegation that the appellants \u201cdid willfully and unlawfully use\u201d the spurious ration documents imported a knowledge of their counterfeit and forged character, we do not labor this point, since such an allegation is not necessary under \u00a7 2.5 of General Ration Order No. 8, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">It should be observed that the appellants\u2019 criticism of the lack of scienter in the information refers only to certain counts that were dismissed \u2014 the so-called \u201cuse\u201d counts \u2014 on the ground that \u201cthe demurrer should have been sustained as to those counts, in which event none of the testimony [relating to the deposits] (now urged as prejudicial by Appellants * * *) could have been admitted\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">Even as to the dismissed counts, however, an allegation of scienter was not necessary. In support of their position, the appellants cite United States v. Tobin, 7 Cir., 149 F.2d 534, certiorari denied, 326 U.S. 737, 66 SfCt. 46, 90 L.Ed. 439. That case holds precisely to the contrary, however, as we pointed out in Ruggiero v. United States, 9 Cir., 156 F.2d 976, 977,, which was a \u201cuse\u201d case. Citing the Tobin decision, we there said: \u201cKnowledge on the part of the appellants that the stamps were counterfeit is not a necessary part of the crime and is, therefore, immaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">Again, the appellants object that \u201cthe information failed to state the essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>tial facts of an offense with sufficient particularity,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">We have already summarized the three counts upon which the verdict of guilty was returned. We believe that they charged the offenses with sufficient particularity. The appellants\u2019 criticism of these three counts is either microscopic or refers to evidentiary matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The appellants also maintain that the information failed to inform them as to the law they were alleged to have violated. A reading of the entire information shows that all the necessary applicable statutes and regulations are fully set out; nor do the appellants point to a single provision that has been omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">It is also urged that the information is duplicitous, in that it charges the crime of acquiring, possessing and controlling \u201ccounterfeit <em>and </em>forged\u201d ration coupons instead of using the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d. The appellants then launch into a discussion of the semantics of \u201ccounterfeit\u201d and \u201cforged\u201d that, in our view, is wholly irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">In Crain v. United States, 162 U.S. 625, 636, 16 S.Ct. 952, 955, 40 L.Ed. 1097, the court said: \u201cThe statute was directed against certain defined modes for accomplishing a general object, and declared that the doing of either one of several specified things, each having reference to that object, should be punished by imprisonment at hard labor for a period of not less than five years nor more than ten years, or by imprisonment for not more than five years and a fine of not more than one thousand dollars. We perceive no sound reason why the doing of the prohibited thing in each and all of the prohibited modes may not be charged in one count, so that there may be a verdict of guilty upon proof that the accused had done any one of the things constituting a substantive crime under the statute. And this is a view altogether favorable to an accused, who pleads' not guilty to the charge contained in a single count, for a judgment on a general verdict of guilty upon that count will be a bar to any further prosecution in respect of any of the matters embraced by it.\u201d See, also, as to the specific charges of \u201cforging <em>and </em>counterfeiting\u201d, Pines v. United States, 8 Cir., 123 F.2d 825, 828, 829. Cf. United States v. Handler, 2 Cir., 142 F.2d 351, 353, certiorari denied, 323 U.S. 741, 65 S.Ct. 40, 89 L.Ed. 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Finally, the appellants contend that \u201cthe information failed to inform the appellants of the nature and the cause of the accusations against them\u201d in that it failed to \u201cidentify\u201d the appellants as \u201cretailers\u201d, \u201cwholesalers\u201d, or \u201cprocessors\u201d in charging them with acquisition and possession of ration coupons.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">Such an allegation was unnecessary, since, under the food regulations in force at the time of the acts complained of, acquisition or possession by any one of ration documents under the circumstances set forth in the information, was contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">Moreover, it should be borne in mind that \u00a7 2.6 of General Ration Order No. 8 forbids <em>any </em>acquisition, etc., of a ration document \u201cexcept in accordance with a ration order,\u201d etc. If the appellants had acquired the ration documents in compliance with any ration order, that fact was peculiarly within their own knowledge, and it was not necessary for the appellee to negative the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">In McKelvey v. United States, 260 U.S. 353, 356, 357, 43 S.Ct. 132, 134, 67 L.Ed. 301, the court said: \u201cOne ground of objection is that the indictment contains no showing that the accused were not within the exception made in the proviso to section 3. This is not a valid ground. By repeated decisions it has come to be a settled rule in this jurisdiction that an indictment or other pleading founded on a general provision defining the elements of an offense, * * * need not negative the matter of an exception made by a proviso or other distinct clause, whether in the same section or elsewhere, and that it is incumbent on one who relies on such an exception to set it up and establish it. [Cases cited]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">In Morrison v. People of State of California, 291 U.S. 82, 88, 89, 90, 91, 54 S.Ct. 281, 284, 78 L.Ed. 664, Mr. Justice Cardozo said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-15\">\u201cThe decisions are manifold that within limits of reason and fairness the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>proof may be lifted from the state in criminal prosecutions and cast on a defendant. The limits are in substance these, that the state shall have proved enough to make it just for the defendant to be required to repel what has been proved with excuse or explanation, or at least that upon a balancing of convenience or of the opportunities for knowledge the shifting of the burden will be found to be an aid to the accuser without subjecting the accused to hardship or oppression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">* * * $ * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201cFor a transfer of the burden, experience must teach that the evidence held to be in-culpatory has at least a sinister significance [cases cited], or if this at times be lacking, there must be in any event a manifest disparity in convenience or proof and opportunity for knowledge, as, for instance, where a general prohibition is applicable to every one who is unable to bring himself within the range of an exception. [Authority cited.] The list is not exhaustive. Other instances may have arisen or may develop in the future where the balance of convenience can be redressed without oppression to the defendant through the same procedural expedient. The decisive considerations are too variable, too much distinctions of degree, too dependent in last analysis upon a common sense estimate of fairness or of facilities of proof, to be crowded into a formula.

This motion \u2014 which in effect sought a complete discovery of the Government\u2019s case in reference to the overt acts \u2014 was denied on the ground that the indictment was sufficiently definite in view of the unknown matters involved and the motion called for \u2018too much details of evidence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-16\">\u201cThe application for the bill of particulars was one addressed to the sound discretion of the court, and there being no abuse of this discretion, its action thereon should not be disturbed.

In Dealy v. United States, 152 U.S. 539, 542, 14 S.Ct. 680, 681, 38 L.Ed. 545, the court used the following language: \u201cIt is familiar law that separate counts are united in one indictment, either because -entirely separate and distinct offenses are intended to be charged, or because the pleader, having in mind but a single offense, varies the statement in the several counts as to the manner or means of its commission in order to avoid at the trial an acquittal by reason of any unforeseen lack of harmony between the allegations and the proofs. [Authority cited.] Yet, whatever the purpose may be, each count is in form a distinct charge of a separate offense, and hence a verdict of guilty or not guilty as to it is not responsive to the charge in any other count.\u201d See also Thomas v. Hudspeth, 10 Cir., 127 F.2d 976, 978; Randall v. United States, 5 Cir., 148 F.2d 234, 235, certiorari denied, 325 U.S. 885, 65 S.Ct. 1579, 89 L.Ed. 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Before leaving the subject of the sufficiency of the information, we might do well to advert to the oft-quoted but oft-ignored statutory admonition \u2014 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 556: \u201cNo indictment found and presented by a grand jury in any district or other court of the United States shall be deemed insufficient, nor shall the trial, judgment, or other proceeding thereon be affected by reason of any defect or .imperfection in matter of form only, which shall not tend to the prejudice of the defendant * *</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">While the foregoing section refers specifically to an indictment, the salutary principle underlying it has been extended to criminal pleadings generally. In Hagner v. United States, 285 U.S. 427, 431, 52 S. Ct. 417, 419, 76 L.Ed. 861, the court observed: \u201cThe rigor of old common-law rules of criminal pleading has yielded, in modern practice, to the general principle that formal defects, not prejudicial, will be disregarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">Indeed, the principle has been specifically applied in information cases. Simpson v. United States, 6 Cir., 241 F. 841, 843, 844, certiorari denied, 245 U.S. 664, 38 S.Ct. 62, 62 L.Ed. 537, and the many cases there cited; United States v. Henderson, 73 App.D.C. 369, 121 F.2d 75, 79, and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">5. <em>\"The trial judge erred in denying the </em>appellants\u2019 <em>motion to strike the testimony of witnesses Keevy, Welling, and Loud, and the Governments Exhibits 1 to 34, inclusive.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">We have already given an abstract of the testimony of these three witnesses. That testimony, as well as the appellee\u2019s exhibits, all related to ration stamps that had been discovered in the deposits of the Hollywood Ranch Market in the Hollywood State Bank. Of these stamps, a \u201cterrific\u201d number, as we have seen, were counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">The appellants insist that \u201cit is obvious that the presence of said stamps in the bank deposits cannot in any way be linked with the activities of the Appellants\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">We do not agree. The presence of these deposits in the name of the market owned and controlled by the appellants was evidence that might well be taken into consideration by the jury, in connection with the testimony of Jones and Becker that the appellants sought to purchase and did purchase ration stamps. The jury had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>only the right but the duty to consider the entire evidence as a whole. There is no merit in the appellants\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">6. <em>\u201cThe court erred in permitting the Amendment of Counts Nine, Ten and Eleven by permitting the words \u2018ration documents\u2019 to be substituted for \u2018ration coupons\u2019 after the Government had virtually completed its case.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In support of this argument, the appellants assert that \u201cthey were caught by surprise\u201d, that \u201cthe amendment constituted a charge of totally new and distinct offenses,\u201d that \u201cthe amended language made the information vague, uncertain and ambiguous\u201d, and that \u201cthe term \u2018document\u2019 is nowhere defined in any of the ration orders\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">In this last statement, the appellants are demonstrably in error. In \u00a7 1.2 of General Ration Order No. 8, supra, we find, under the caption \u201cDefinitions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">\u201cWhen used in this order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">\u201c \u2018Ration document\u2019 means * * * stamp, * * * coupon, * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">This very definition negatives the contention that \u201cthe amendment constituted a charge of totally new and distinct offenses\u201d. \u201cRation documents\u201d is the generic term that embraces both \u201ccoupons\u201d, the word originally used in the information, and \u201cstamps\u201d, which were shown by the evidence to have been acquired by the appellants. There is no violent change in all this.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">The mere assertion that the appellants were \u201csurprised\u201d is not proof. The court has some discretion in such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">In Muncy v. United States, 4 Cir., 289 F. 780, 781, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-14\">\u201c * * * we need only observe that it is too well settled to require citation of authority that an information, unlike an indictment, may be amended by leave of court, even after motion to quash, demurrer, or plea (22 Cyc. p. 436, and cases cited); for, as Lord Mansfield observes, in Rex v. Wilkes, 4 Burr. 3567:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-15\">\u201c \u2018There is a great difference between amending indictments and amending infor-mations. Indictments are found upon the oath of a jury, and ought only to be amended by themselves; but informations are as declarations in the king\u2019s suit. An officer of the crown has the right of framing them originally, and may, with leave, amend in like manner as any plaintiff may do.\u2019 \u201d See also Coates v. United States, 4 Cir., 290 F. 134, 135.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-17\">Rule 7(e) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A. following section 687, provides: <em>\"Amendment of Information. </em>The court may permit an information to be amended at any time before verdict or finding if no additional or different offense is charged and if substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-19\">The Rules of Criminal Procedure went into effect on March 21, 1946, after the trial in the instant case was had. In its Notes to Rules of Criminal Procedure, 4 F.R.D. 405, 412, however, the Advisory Committee on Rules of Criminal Procedure observed, citing the Muncy case, supra: \u201cNote to Subdivision (e) [of Rule 7]. <em>This rule continues the existing law that, </em>unlike an indictment, an information may be amended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-20\">A careful study of the entire record has convinced us that the substantial rights of the appellants were not prejudiced by the amendment in question, and that the court below did not abuse its discretion in permitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-21\">7. <em>\u201cThe court\u2019s statements to the jury, both during the trial and in the course of the instructions, were highly prejudicial\".</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-22\">One of the \u201cstatements\u201d objected to by the appellants was the opinion expressed by the court below that the Government perhaps might have brought in \u201ca conspiracy count against these people so if they were convicted the court could send them to the penitentiary.\u201d In presenting this objection to this Court, however, the appellants failed to point out that the court made the observation \u201cwithout the hearing of the jury\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-23\">We will not burden an already over-long opinion with setting forth in ex-tenso the remarks of the judge below that it is contended were prejudicial to the appellants. Suffice it to say that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>made in connection with rulings on the evidence, and were part of the familiar give- and-take of a criminal trial. It is elementary that a Federal judge has the right to comment on the evidence, and that it is not only his right but his duty to admonish counsel when necessary, provided he does so in temperate language. At no time did the court below prejudicially overstep the proprieties in .the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Appropriate in this connection are the observations of Mr. Justice Harlan in Rucker v. Wheeler, 127 U.S. 85, 93, 8 S.Ct. 1142, 1146, 32 L.Ed. 102:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">\u201cIt is insisted by the plaintiff that the court went too far in its expressions of opinion upon the evidence bearing upon this issue, and that what was said had practically the effect of taking the case from the jury. It is no longer an open question that a judge of a court of the United States, in submitting a case to the jury, may, in his discretion, express his opinion upon the facts; and that \u2018when no rule of law is incorrectly stated, and all matters of fact are ultimately submitted to the determination of the jury,' such expressions of opinion are not reviewable on writ of error. [Cases cited]\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Similarly apposite is the language used in Goldstein v. United States, 8 Cir., 63 F.2d 609, 613: \u201cIt is not always possible during the trial of a hotly contested case for a judge, however impartial he may be, to maintain in the courtroom that atmosphere of complete judicial calm which is so much to be desired. We must not overlook the fact that the human element cannot be entirely eliminated from the trial of lawsuits. While counsel owe to the court, because of the position which he occupies, the utmost deference and respect, and while the court owes to them an equal obligation of courtesy and patience and consideration, nevertheless sharp differences of opinion do arise in the heat of trial and things are said which were better left unsaid. Such incidents are often regarded as trivial during the trial of a case and are quickly lost sight of, but, when set forth in the record and emphasized by counsel on appeal, they take on an importance which they never actually possessed. It is impossible to gather from the cold record, particularly when it is in narrative form, the atmosphere of the trial itself, the manner in which the words were spoken, or the probable effect, if any, which they had upon the merits of the controversy. Critical remarks of the court frequently cut both ways, if they cut at all. Colloquies between counsel and colloquies between the court and counsel as to the rules of evidence are not ordinarily regarded by a jury as serious matters or of much concern to them. An appellate court should be slow to reverse a case for the alleged misconduct of the trial court, unless it appears that the conduct comp[ained of was intended or calculated to disparage the defendant in the eyes of the jury and to prevent the jury from exercising an impartial judgment upon the merits.\u201d See also Ford v. United States, 9 Cir., 10 F.2d 339, 347, affirmed, 273 U.S. 593, 47 S.Ct. 531, 71 L.Ed. 793; United States v. Bob, 2 Cir., 106 F.2d 37, 40, 41, certiorari denied, 308 U.S. 589, 60 S.Ct. 115, 84 L.Ed. 493; United States v. Warren, 2 Cir., 120 F.2d 211, 212; United States v. Goldstein, 2 Cir., 120 F.2d 485, 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">8. <em>\u201cThe court erred in its instructions to the jury.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The only instruction to which exception was taken by the appellants in the court below and which is now being pressed before us, was the following: \u201cWhile I have not commented on the evidence, there is just one question before the jury as I said, a question of fact \u2014 the approximately 260,000 points, did they come from an unlawful acquisition or did they receive them in accordance with, you might say, the testimony of the defendants, or was there an unlawful acquisition ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">The appellants maintain that this instruction \u201cin view of the evidence, prejudiced the jury in that the Government had totally failed to prove that the defendants or either of them had anything to do with the bank deposits, but on the contrary had proven affirmatively that neither of them had anything to do with the bank deposits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">As we have heretofore endeavored to show, the presence of a \u201cterrific\u201d number of counterfeit ration stamps in the bank deposits of the Hollywood Ranch Market, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>owned and controlled by the appellants, taken in connection with the testimony of Jones and Becker that the appellants purchased those stamps, was a circumstance that could be taken into consideration by the jury. There was no error in the instruction of which the appellants complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The appellants in their main brief urge several objections to the court\u2019s instructions, although no exceptions to such instructions were saved in the court below. Furthermore, in their reply brief, they object to several additional instructions, as to which they admit that no exceptions were taken. They insist, however, that this court should on its \u201cown motion notice instructions which are so erroneous as to constitute a denial of justice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In our view, the court gave no instructions, whether excepted to or not, that were \u201cso erroneous\u201d as to afford grounds for reversal. While in some instances the court, in an endeavor to meet counsel\u2019s captious criticisms, restated with less clarity certain propositions of law that had previously been unexceptionably expounded, we believe that the jury understood the court\u2019s meaning and were in no way misled by any imperfections of phraseology.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">It has long been the settled rule in Federal courts that an instruction by the court must be excepted to before the case is submitted to the jury in order to be availed of on appeal. This is no merely technical requirement, but is founded upon reason, justice and expediency. If the error is seasonably called to the court\u2019s attention, the court can correct it forthwith and thus obviate the necessity of a new trial. Tucker v. United States, 151 U.S. 164, 170, 14 S.Ct 299, 38 L.Ed. 112; St. Clair v. United States, 154 U.S. 134, 153, 14 S.Ct. 1002, 38 L.Ed. 936; Lindsay v. Burgess, 156 U.S. 208, 210, 15 S.Ct. 355, 39 L.Ed. 399; Howland v. Beck, 9 Cir., 56 F.2d 35, 37; Brevard Tannin Co. v. J. F. Mosser Co., 4 Cir., 288 F. 725, 730; Meadows v. United States, 4 Cir., 144 F.2d 751, 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">We have carefully examined the judge\u2019s charge in its entirety, and have found in it no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">In this connection, it should be noted that more than one-half of the appellants\u2019 reply brief is taken up with a criticism of the court\u2019s instructions that were not referred to in its opening brief or in the ap-pellee\u2019s brief. The pretext for this departure from the standards of good brief-writing is that \u201cthe appellee\u2019s contention that appellants have not sufficiently specified the erroneous instructions is without merit\u201d. Though no page reference to the appellee\u2019s brief is given, we assume that the appellants refer to the appellee\u2019s discussion of a <em>single </em>instruction dealing with the necessity of a transfer of food for the acquisition of ration stamps. That instruction in reality was part of the instruction already considered hereinabove, being given during a colloquy with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Such discussion by the appellee did not open the door to the criticisms of other instructions. New material does not belong in a reply brief. Its introduction violates the spirit if not the letter of our Rule 22, which provides that, in oral arguments, \u201ca fair opening of the case shall be made by the party having the opening and closing argument\u201d. Certainly the use of new material in a reply brief transgresses against the canons of fair forensics.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">9. <em>\u201cThe evidence is insufficient to sustain every material element of the offenses for which the appellants were convicted and therefore the verdict was contrary to law and the facts.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">10. <em>\u201cThe evidence is insufficient to justify the verdict of gttiliy against Nathan Gilbert on Counts Nine, Ten and Eleven, or on any of said counts.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">11. <em>\u201cThe evidence is insufficient to justify the verdict against William Fredrick on Counts Nine, Ten and Eleven, or on any of said counts.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-16\">These three \u201cfactual\u201d counts can be considered jointly \u2014 and briefly. We have already given a careful summary of all the salient evidence adduced by the appellee. We need not rehearse it again.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-17\">An examination of our summary will show that each of the appellants either personally committed acts that culminated in the purchase of stamps from Becker, or aided his partner in doing so. Many of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the stamps thus purchased were counterfeit. A large number of counterfeit stamps found their way into the appellants\u2019 bank deposits. There was enough evidence to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">12. <em>\u201cThe court erred in denying appellants\u2019 motion to require the Government to elect which of the counts it would rely on at the outset of the trial.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">This objection is cognate to Specification No. 4, in which it is asserted that <em>the </em>court erred in permitting the same offense to be charged in more than one count. We have already fully discussed that entire question in connection with the latter specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">13. <em>\u201cThe court erred in denying appellants\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The points urged in the motion that is the subject of this specification are substantially the same as those upon which the other thirteen specifications of error are predicated. Accordingly, it is not necessary for us to give this specification separate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">14. <em>\u201cThe court erred in refusing to put the questions to the jury as asked for by appellants\u2019 counsel, said counsel to determine the prejudices of the jury.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">Counsel calls attention to the following excerpts from the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">\u201cMr. Gottfried: Would your honor ask the members of the jury whether or not they would give the testimony of the defendants the same credence and weight they would give the testimony of a Government investigator or employee of the Government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-14\">\u201cThe Court. Well, I will answer that request the same as I answered Mr. Binns' request. The jury is the sole judge of the weight of the testimony of the witnesses. The witnesses will appear before them and the jury can judge for themselves. That is their province.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-15\">In the first place, it is not only the jury\u2019s right but its duty, in weighing the testimony of a defendant, to consider his interest in the outcome of the case. In Reagan v. United States, 157 U.S. 301, 311, 15 S.Ct. 610, 613, 39 L.Ed. 709, the leading case on the subject, the court said: \u201cTested by these rules, we see in the instruction objected to nothing of which complaint can reasonably be made. In the first place it lays down a general rule applicable to all circumstances, and then, in the latter part, simply calls attention to the fact that the defendant has a deep personal interest in the result of the suit, and that that should be. considered by the jury. There is no declaration nor intimation that the defendant has been untruthful in his testimony. There is only a reference to the jury of the matter of credibility coupled with the declaration that interest in the result is a circumstance to be weighed in its determination. This, clearly, is unobjectionable.\u201d See also Schulze v. United States, 9 Cir., 259 F. 189, 191, 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-17\">Therefore it clearly is not reversible error for a trial court, on the voir dire, to decline to ask members of the jury <em>in advance of the testimony </em>whether, in <em>effect, </em>they will ignore the fact that the defendant has an interest in the outcome of the trial, and will give his testimony \u201cthe same credence and weight they would give the testimony of a Government Investigator or employee of the Government\u201d, who may or may not have a comparable interest in an opposite outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-18\">Furthermore, considerable discretion is lodged in the court as to the questions that are to be asked on voir dire. In Connors v. United States, 158 U.S. 408, 413, 15 S.Ct. 951, 953, 39 L.Ed. 1033, the court used the following language: \u201cIt is quite true, as suggested by the accused, that he was entitled to be tried by an impartial jury; that is, by jurors who had no bias or prejudice that would prevent them from returning a verdict according to \u2022dhe law and evidence. It is equally true that a suitable inquiry is permissible in order to ascertain whether the juror has any bias, opinion, or prejudice that would affect or control the fair determination by him of the issues to be tried. That inquiry is conducted under the supervision of the court, and a great deal must, of necessity, be left to its sound discretion. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the rule in civil cases, and the same rule must be applied in criminal cases.\u201d See also Brady v. United States, 9 Cir., 26 F.2d 400, 403, certiorari denied, 278 U.S. 621, 49 S.Ct. 24, 73 L.Ed. 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We do not believe that the court below abused its discretion in refusing to ask the jury the question requested by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In an effort to spell out reversible error, the appellants have indulged in microscopic criticisms of the record below. Such tactics call to mind the language used in Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 83, 62 S.Ct. 457, 470, 86 L.Ed. 680: \u201cPerhaps the court did not attain at all times that thoroughgoing impartiality which is the ideal, but our examination of the record as a whole leads to the conclusion that the substantial rights of the petitioners were not affected. The trial was long and the incidents relied on by petitioners few. We must guard against the magnification on appeal of instances which were of little importance in their setting. [Cases cited]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Again, in United States v. Breen, 2 Cir., 96 F.2d 782, 784, certiorari denied, 304 U.S. 585, 58 S.Ct. 1061, 82 L.Ed. 1546, it was said: \u201cAll too often, it seems, appellants like these become overcritical of a trial judge after conviction and on appeal seek to try him instead of the merits or demerits of their cause.\u201d See also Garland v. State of Washington, 232 U.S. 642, 646, 34 S.Ct. 456, 58 L.Ed. 772; Garber v. United States, 6 Cir., 145 F.2d 966, 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">We have carefully examined the entire record, and find no reversible error.
