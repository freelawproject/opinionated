In 1937 appellant received concurrent sentences for uttering and false pretenses, and began serving them at the District of Columbia Reformatory at Lorton, Virginia. He was released on parole on December 23, 1938. On June 22, 1939 a warrant was issued for his arrest for violation of parole but was not served because he could not be found. August 4, 1943 he was committed to jail on new charges of forgery and uttering. He was afterwards convicted, and on October 15, 1943 received new concurrent sentences. He was returned to the reformatory at Lor-ton to serve these new sentences. On February 4, 1946 he had served out the new sentences, less commutation for good behavior, and was \u201cconditionally released.\u201d February 5, 1946 he was arrested under the 1939 warrant as a violator of parole trader <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>his original sentences. February 19, 1946 that parole was revoked, and he was recommitted to serve the remainder of his original sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">His principal contentions are (1) that since he complied with the terms of parole for six months, so much should be credited on the remainder of his original sentences, and (2) that since the statute, D. C.Code (1940) \u00a7 24 \u2014 206, provided that the unexpired term of a parole violator shall \u201cbegin to run from the date he is returned to the institution,\u201d his original sentences ran concurrently with his later sentences and therefore have been fully served.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first contention is answered by statutory language in effect when appellant was first sentenced and substantially unchanged. It provides that \u201cthe time the prisoner was out on parole shall not be taken into account to diminish the time for which he was sentenced.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Applying identical language in the Federal Parole Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 719, the Supreme Court has held that a parole violator may be required \u201cto serve the remainder of the sentence originally imposed without any allowance for the time he was out on parole.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s second contention is answered by Zerbst, Warden v. Kidwell, 304 U.S. 359, 362, 58 S.Ct. 872, 82 L.Ed. 1399, 116 A.L.R. 808. Construing language of the Federal Parole Act substantially the same as that on which appellant relies, the Court said: \u201cObviously, this' provision does not require that a parole violator\u2019s original, unexpired sentence shall begin to run from the date he is imprisoned for a new and separate offense. It can only refer to reimprisonment on the original sentence under order of the Parole Board.\u201d It is immaterial that the Parole Board did not serve the warrant as soon as it might, and did not give appellant a hearing at its next meeting after the warrant had been issued and appellant had been arrested on new charges, but did these things only on the expiration of his new sentences.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">Appellant contends that by virtue of statutory language in effect when he was sentenced,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and afterwards modified,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> he earned commutation of his sentences by good conduct during as well as before the first six months of his parole. We need not pass upon this contention. It is immaterial, because any right to commutation which appellant may have earned at any time before he was recommitted to the reformatory was conditional and was forfeited by his violation of parole.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-16\">There is no error. But \u201cwe have power not only to correct error in the judgment under review but to make such disposition of the case as justice requires. And in determining what justice does require, the Court is bound to consider any change, either in fact or in law, which has supervened since the judgment was entered. We may recognize such a change, which may affect the result, by setting aside the judgment and remanding the case so that the [District] court may be free to act.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-17\">Appellant is not represented by counsel. At the request and to the great assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>of this court, Mr. Roger Robb has acted as <em>amicus curiae. </em>He calls our attention to the fact that after this appeal had been heard, and on July 17, 1947 Congress passed \u201cAn Act to reorganize the system of parole of prisoners convicted in the District of Columbia.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 5 of this Act amends D.C.Code (1940) \u00a7 24 \u2014 206 to read as follows: \u201cWhen a prisoner has been retaken upon a warrant issued by the Board of Parole, he shall be given an opportunity to appear before the Board, a member thereof, or an examiner designated by the Board. At such hearing he may be represented by counsel. The Board may then, or at any time in its discretion, terminate the parole or modify the terms and conditions thereof. <em>If the order of parole shall be revoked, the prisoner, unless subsequently reparoled, shall serve the remainder of the sentence originally imposed less any commutation for good conduct which may be earned by him after his return to custody. For the purpose of computing commutation for good conduct, the remainder of the sentence originally imposed shall be considered as a new sentence. </em>The time a prisoner was on parole shall not be taken into account to diminish the time for which he was sentenced.\u201d (Italics supplied.) Until this amendment, the law did not permit a prisoner whose parole had been revoked to earn any commutation of the remainder of his sentence. By the amendment, as the House Committee on the District of Columbia said in its Report on the bill, \u201cProvision is * * * made for a more just and orderly method of applying good-time credits when parole has been revoked.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A letter of approval from the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, made a part of the Report, states: \u201cThe third important change [made by the bill] is that a prisoner whose parole is revoked may earn good time upon the balance of his sentence. Under present law, no good-time deduction is allowed such a prisoner, and, therefore, he has no incentive to obey the rules and regulations of the institution in which he is-confined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\"> We do not think Congress intended to deal more justly only with prisoners-whose parole might afterwards be revoked- and to discriminate against those whose parole had already been revoked. The amendment is remedial and should be construed: liberally. So construed it applies to \u201cthe-remainder of the sentence[s] originally imposed\u201d upon appellant which was still to be served when he was returned to custody under those sentences. It is grammatically capable of this application.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The correctness of this construction of the amendment is fairly apparent when the amendment is-read in the light of the basic good-conduct legislation which it modifies and extends. This basic legislation provides that: <em>\"Each prisoner who has been or shall hereafter be convicted </em>of any offense against the laws of the United States, <em>and is confined, in execution of the judgment or sentence </em>* * * whose record of conduct shows that he has faithfully observed all the rules and has not been subjected to punishment, <em>shall be entitled to a deduction from the term of his-sentence to be estimated as follows, commencing on the first day of his arrival at the penitentiary, </em>prison, or jail: Upon a-sentence of not less than six months nor more than one year, five days for each month,\u201d etc.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This basic legislation plainly conferred retrospectively upon prisoners, whose \u201carrival at the penitentiary\u201d had al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>ready occurred the same benefit which it conferred prospectively upon other prisoners. It made commutation not only an incentive to future good conduct but also a reward for past good conduct. We find no sufficient evidence that Congress changed its position in this respect and intended the recent amendment to furnish only an incentive. \u201cIt is clear that 'all acts <em>in pari materia </em>are to be taken together, as if they were one law.' \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Our conclusion that the amendment has full retrospective as well as prospective effect is confirmed by the fact that both the United States Attorney and the <em>amicus curiae </em>agree with it. Moreover the only possible alternative conclusion would be that the amendment did not apply at all, either as reward or as incentive, to prisoners whose parole had already been revoked. The statutory words \u201cIf the order of parole shall be revoked,\u201d etc., either include or exclude past revocations: we cannot have it both ways, either in this case alone or in \u25a0this case and a future one. Whether or not the facts of this case excuse us from presently ruling on the point, it is too clear for argument that either (1) a prisoner whose parole has already been revoked is \u25a0entitled to commutation for good conduct from the beginning of his reimprisonment, or else (2) such a prisoner cannot earn \u2022commutation by future good conduct. The second alternative would make the new law less just than the old, in disregard of the \u2022plain intention of Congress to make it more \u2022just. The old law discriminated between men who had violated parole and men who '\u2022had not. That discrimination had at least \u25a0some appearance of fairness. But if the amendment were interpreted as not applying to men whose parole had already been revoked, it would be made to discriminate between some parole violators \u2022 and other parole violators, allowing some to earn commutation by good conduct and others not, on the purely arbitrary basis of the time when revocation of their parole had happened to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The case is therefore remanded to the Distiict Court for further proceedings. If \u2022computations which have been made are correct, and if appellant\u2019s conduct since he was recommitted to serve the remainder of his sentences has been good, he is now entitled to be discharged from the reformatory.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-5\"> He also infers from 47 Stat. 698, \u00a7 5, amended 54 Stat. 243, \u00a7 4, and D.C.Code (1940) \u00a7 24\u2014205, time the warrant for his arrest as a parole violator should have been served as soon as he was re-arrested and committed to jail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-6\"> 47 Stat. 698, \u00a7 6, 54 Stat. 243, \u00a7 5, D.C.Code (1940) \u00a7 24\u2014206.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b905-7\"> Anderson v.

No. 198, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., \u201cTo reorganize the system of parole of prisoners convicted in the District of Columbia,\u201d effective July 17, 1947, hereafter sometimes referred to as the 1947 D.C. Parole Act. Roger Robb, Esq., as <em>amicus curiae, </em>has called the court's attention to this Act. He refers particularly to Section 5 thereof reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-9\">See. 5. Section 6 of the Act of July 15, 1932 (eh. 492, 47 Stat. 698; title 24, D.C.Code, sec. 206), as amended by the Act of June 6, 1940 (ch. 254, 54 Stat. 242), is amended as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-10\">\u201cSec. 6. When a prisoner has been retaken upon a warrant issued by the Board of Parole, ho shall be given an opportunity to appear before the Board, a member thereof, or an examiner designated by the Board. At such hearing he may be represented by counsel. The Board may then, or at any time in its discretion, terminate the parole or modify the terms and conditions thereof. <em>If the order of parole shall he revoked, the prisoner, unless subsequently reparoled, shall serve the remainder of the sentence originally imposed less any commutation for good conduct which may he earned hy him after his return to custody. </em>For the purpose of computing commutation for good conduct, the remainder of the sentence originally imposed shall be considered as a new sentence. The time a prisoner was on parole shall not be taken into account to diminish the time for which he was sentenced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-11\">\u201cIn the event a prisoner is confined in, or as a parolee is returned to a penal or correctional institution other than a penal or correctional institution of the District of Columbia, the Board of Parole created by the Act of May 13, 1930 (ch. 255, 46 Stat. 272, 18 U.S.C. 723a), shall have and exercise the same power and authority as the Board of Parole of the District of Columbia had the prisoner been confined in or returned to a penal or correctional institution of the District of Columbia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Mr. Robb suggests that the first paragraph of this amendment is remedial, the antecedent 1940 D.C.Parole Act containing no provision for commutation for good conduct earned after return of a paroled prisoner to custody, and that it should therefore be retrospectively applied, and that as a result, assuming good conduct on his part prior to the effective date of the Act, the appellant became entitled to discharge from the penitentiary on August 11, 1947.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under settled authority the court must determine this case under this statute if applicable. American Steel Foundries v. TriCity Central Trades Council, 1921, 257 U.S. 184, 42 S.Ct. 72, 66 L.Ed. 189, 27 A.L.R. 360. The District Attorney, with commendable frankness, expresses himself as likewise in favor of retrospective application of Section 5 of the 1947 D.C.Parole Act. Conceding that it is literally prospective, he suggests that it is <em>in pari materia </em>with the Federal commutation statute, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 710-712 (applicable to prisoners convicted in the District of Columbia of crimes against the United States, Story v. Rives, 1938, 68 App.D.C. 325, 97 F.2d 182, certiorari denied 1938, 305 U.S. 595, 59 S.Ct. 71, 83 L.Ed. 377), and should therefore be construed as itself retroactive and hence applicable to the appellant, notwithstanding that his parole was revoked prior to its effective date. The District Attorney cites United States v. Stewart, 1940, 311 U.S. 60, 61 S.Ct. 102, 85 L.Ed. 40, to the effect that statutes <em>in pari materia </em>are to be construed as one law.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">I give great weight to the views of Mr. Robb as amicus curiae,-and of the District Attorney. But upon questions of law in a case involving the administration of the statutes relating to punishment and rehabilitation, a matter of public interest, the court must reach it own conclusion. Cf. Young v. United States, 1942, 315 U.S. 257, 62 S.Ct. 510, 86 L.Ed. 832; Parlton v. United States, 1935, 64 App.D.C. 169, 75 F.2d 772. And I am of the view that Section 5 of the 1947 D.C.Parole Act cannot, under the facts now before the court, be applied to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The 1947 D.C.Parole Act, of which the quoted provision is a part, is, as its title states, a reorganization of the system of parole of prisoners convicted in the District of Columbia. Section 1 creates a Board of Parole. Section 2 transfers to that Board the powers, the various officers and employees except the members, the official records, and the unexpended appropriations, of a previously existing, (by virtue of the 1932 and 1940 D.C.Parole Acts) \"Board of Indeterminate Sentence and Parole.\u201d Section 2 also defines the duties of a \u201cparole executive\u201d which are to include the preparation for consideration by the Board of all applications of prisoners for parole. Section 3 provides for the release of a prisoner upon parole, if he has served the minimum sentence imposed upon him or the prescribed portion of his sentence, upon such terms and conditions as the Board shall \u2022 from time to time prescribe*. Section 4 authorizes the Board under named conditions to apply to the court which imposed sentence upon a prisoner for a reduction - of his minimum sentence and authorizes the court to act upon such an application at any time prior to the expiration of the minimum-sentence. Section 5 has been set forth above. Section 6 extends the power of the Board of Parole to all prisoners whose sentences exceed 180 days, and provides that &amp; prisoner convicted of an offense other than a felony may not be paroled until he has served one-third of the' sentence imposed or one-third of the aggregate sentences imposed.if there are two or more. Section <em>7 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>repeals D.C.Code (1940) \u00a7\u00a7 <em>24 </em>\u2014 201 and <em>202 </em>which created the previous Board of Indeterminate Sentence and Parole and provided for an executive secretary and other employees. Providing thus in both title and body for the administration of a system of parole of prisoners convicted in the District of Columbia, the 1947 Act looks to the future. This is as true of Section 5 as it is of any of the other parts cf the Act. The first three sentences of Section 5 give general directions as to the manner of dealing with a prisoner who has been retaken upon a Board of Parole warrant. They afford him an opportunity to be heard and right of representation by counsel and permit the Board to terminate the parole or modify its terms and conditions. These provisions look to the future.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The italicized portion quoted above, which is of particular pertinence in the instant case, is in unequivocally future terms: \u201cIf the order of parole <em>shall be revoked, </em>the prisoner, unless subsequently reparoled, <em>shall serve </em>the remainder of the sentence originally imposed less any commutation for good conduct which <em>may be earned </em>by him after his return to custody.\u201d (Italics supplied) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The first sentence following this provision is a direction with reference to computation of commutation necessitated by the fact that under the commutation provision, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 710, the amount of commutation allowed per month increases with the length of the sentence imposed. The last sentence in the paragraph is but a re-enactment of a similar provision in the 1932 D.C. Parole Act. These two sentences are equivocal as to the prospective or retrospective operation of Section 5 of which they are a part. On the face of the 1947 D.C.Parole Act there is no ambiguity, and hence nothing to construe. The rule that a remedial act may be construed to apply retrospectively (Crawford, <em>Statutory Construction </em>(1940) \u00a7 282) is, therefore, not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Assuming a latent ambiguity and consulting legislative <em>history, it </em>appears again that Congress did not intend to confer the benefit of the good conduct commutation provision of Section 5 of the 1947 Act upon a prisoner in the situation of the appellant The House Report (H.R.Rep.No.451, to accompany H.R.494, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.), among other things states that \u201cThe third important change [made-by the bill] is that a prisoner whose parole is revoked may earn good time upon the balance of his sentence. Under present law, no good-time deduction is allowed such a prisoner, and, therefore, he has no incentive to obey the rules and regulations of the institution in which he is confined.\u201d As to the appellant Section 5, if retrospectively applied, would operate not to furnish an incentive to good conduct but to confer a reward in the form of a diminution of his sentence on account of good conduct rendered prior to passage of the Act. As above stated, if the 1947 Act applies retrospectively to the appellant, he was entitled to release on August 11, 1947. The effective date of the Act, July 17, 1947, was less than one month prior thereto. Therefore not even for the period between July 17 and August 11 would the Act operate as an incentive for the appellant, for, under Section 710 of the commutation statute referred to above, deductions are counted at a given number of days for <em>each month, </em>varying according to the length of the sentence. In the absence of clear words expressing such an intent I think a purpose should not be attributed to Congress to diminish, by way of reward for good conduct rendered by a prisoner prior to the passage of the Act, a sentence lawfully imposed upon him. Had Congress had such a purpose in mind it could easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>have said so, as it did in the commutation statute itself in Section 710 above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">As to the <em>in pari materia </em>argument suggested by the District Attorney: It can hardly be claimed that the 1947 D.C.Parole Act as a whole and the commutation statute, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 710-712, are <em>in pari materia. </em>The latter sections, a part of the Federal Criminal Code relating to Federal prisoners and their treatment, deal only with commutation for good conduct, whereas the 1947 D.C.Parole Act is a general revision of the parole statutes for the District of Columbia. Assuming, however, that because of the reference in Section 5 of the 1947 Act to commutation for good conduct that section is <em>in pari materia </em>with the Federal commutation statute just mentioned, still I find no basis for a conclusion that the language of Section S must therefore be given a retrospective application. As said above, the argument is that statutes <em>in pari materia </em>are to be taken together as if they were one law, and from this as a predicate it is urged that if Sections 710-712 of the commutation statute and Section S of the 1947 D.C.Parole Act are \u201cone law,\u201d the retroactive provisions in the commutation statute operate to make Section 5, as a part of the same \u201cone law,\u201d also retroactive. But this does not necessarily follow. It is within the competency of Congress, if it sees fit to do so, to make one part of a \u201cone law\u201d dealing with a given subject expressly retroactive and another part of the same \u201cone law\u201d dealing with a different, although related subject, not so; and this is what Congress has done if Sections 710-712 of the commutation statute and Section 5 of the 1947 D.C.Parole Act \u00bfre treated as \u201cone law.\u201d The introductory sentence of Section 710 provides that <em>\u201cEach prisoner who has been or shall hereafter be convicted </em>of any offense against the laws of the United States, and is confined . . . for a</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">definite term, other than for life, whose record of conduct shows that he has faithfully observed all the rules and has not been subjected to punishment, shall be entitled to a deduction . . . \u201d (computed in a manner then specifically set forth). Section 711 authorizes the Attorney General upon recommendations on evidence submitted to him by the warden of a Federal penitentiary to restore to a prisoner forfeited good time. And Section 712 expressly makes Sections 710 and 711 apply to all sentences imposed subsequent to July 21, 1902, and to the sentences imposed prior to that date, the commutation upon which is less than that provided in Sections 710 and 711. But treating the words of Section 5 of the 1947 D.C. Parole Act \u2014 \u201cIf the order of parole <em>shall be revoked, </em>the prisoner, unless subsequently reparoled, <em>shall serve </em>the remainder of the sentence originally imposed less any commutation for good conduct which <em>may be earned </em>by him after his return to custody.\u201d (Italics supplied) \u2014 as a part of the \u201cone law,\u201d they create, notwithstanding the expressly retroactive provisions of Sections 710-712, no ambiguity requiring retrospective construction of the entire \u201cone law.\u201d They merely, by the use of clear terms of futurity, apply the commutation provision of the \u201cone law\u201d prospectively to a given class of prisoners, to wit, those whose parole \u201cshall be revoked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">It is urged that Section 5 of the 1947 Act should be given both full retrospective and full prospective application because otherwise, so it is asserted, it will not apply at all to a prisoner in appellant\u2019s situation either as a reward or as an incentive, <em>i. e., </em>will not apply to a prisoner whose parole has been revoked prior to July 17, the effective date of the Act, even though he may thereafter conduct himself in a manner which would otherwise entitle him to commutation. But this contention assumes that the court must now rule upon the applicability of the Act to such a prisoner. This assumption is in my view not warranted. I think the court should now rule only upon the question immediately before it, <em>i. e., </em>as to the applicability of Section 5 of the 1947 Act to a prisoner whose parole was revoked prior to July 17 and whose good conduct was also rendered prior to that date. No claim and no showing have been made in the instant case that the appellant is entitled to release by virtue of good conduct rendered subsequent to July 17 if the Act is applicable to him notwithstanding that his parole was revoked prior to that date. I think the ruling of the court should be confined strictly to the state of facts made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>appear in the instant case, <em>i. e., </em>whereunder both revocation of parole and the rendering \u25a0of good conduct occurred prior to July 17\u2014 so that if Section 5 were to be applied it would operate not as an incentive to good conduct but as a reward therefor. I think that as to such a prisoner the Act does not apply. Conceivably a case may arise in which, under the facts shown therein, it will be proper to raise the question whether Section 5 of the 1947 Act is latently ambiguous in respect of its applicability to a prisoner who renders good conduct after July 17 but whose parole Was revoked before that date, and in which it will therefore be proper to urge a construction of the Act which will make it non-discriminatory as between such a prisoner and one who likewise has rendered good conduct after July 17 but whose revocation of parole has also occurred after that date. Such a case should be dealt with if and when it arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">I think, therefore, that the judgment of the District Court dismissing the appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\"> It is agreed by the District Attorney on the faith of a computation made by Mr. Robb-and not disputed by the appellant that, apart from the operation of the 1947 D.O. Parole Act if applicable to the appellant, the date for the completion of service of his first sentences is December 27, 1947, to wit, 689 days from February 5, 1946, when he was taken into custody under the warrant of June 22, 1939; and that if Section 5 of the 1947 Act is applicable, the appellant is entitled to good conduct allowance earned by him after being taken on the warrant of 6 days per month, making a total good conduct credit of 138 days against the balance of 689 days; and that with this deduction, the unexpired portion of the appellant\u2019s first sentences which he began to serve on February 5, 1946, expired August 11\u00bb 1947.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b909-7\"> So much is frankly conceded by the District Attorney who says in his brief: \u201cThe procedures set down in the statute for hearing, representation by couusel, etc., obviously apply only to prisoners newly retaken whose parole has not yet been revoked.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b909-8\"> In respect of this provision the District Attorney\u2019s brief states: \u201cThe language of the section would seem to indicate a contrary intention [contrary to the District Attorney\u2019s suggestion theretofore set out in his brief that a retroactive application \u201cwould seem to be in order\u201d] as it is in the future tense. The section states, <em>inter alia, </em>that after revocation of parole a prisoner \u2018shall serve the remainder of the sentence originally imposed less any commutation for good conduct which <em>may be earned </em>by him after his return to custody.\u2019 (Underlining supplied).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
