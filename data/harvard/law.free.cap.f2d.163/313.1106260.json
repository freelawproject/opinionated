Grounds of the motion were that the court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action, and that the amended complaint, hereafter called the complaint, did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">The action was one of a civil nature, at law. The matter in controversy exceeded, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000. The matter in controversy and the action itself arose under a law of the United States, namely, the Federal Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 151-609. The Court, therefore, had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">The Federal Communications Act of 1934 is a law regulating commerce.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore the Court would have had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action even if the matter in controversy had not exceeded, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-16\">The second question presented by this appeal \u2014 whether the complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted \u2014is not disposed of by our holding that the court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action; for a court may have jurisdiction over the subject matter of an action though the complaint therein does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whether the complaint in this action stated such a claim must therefore be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-17\">The complaint stated, in substance and effect, that on May 14, 1945, <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appellee Los Angeles Broadcasting Company held a license granted by the Federal Communications Commission to own and operate a radio broadcasting station, known as KFAC, at Los Angeles, California; that ap-pellee Smith was the Company\u2019s agent and manager; that appellee Blake was its agent and employee; that during the period from February 20, 1945, to April 3, 1945, appellant was a legally qualified candidate for the office of mayor of the City of Los An-geles; that four other persons (Fletcher Bowron, Clifford Clinton, Ira McDonald and Anthony Entenza) were candidates for that office; that in March, 1945, appellant made an oral contract with appellees whereby, to further her candidacy, she purchased from the Company radio time for broadcasting, by means of station KFAC, four speeches of 15 minutes each on March 11, 1945, March 18, 1945, March 25, 1945, and April 1, 1945, respectively; that, for the time so purchased, she paid the Company $108; that the first three speeches were broadcast as scheduled; that on March 31,. 1945, appellees censored the speech scheduled for April 1, 1945, deleted therefrom certain portions thereof,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> refused to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>mit appellant to broadcast the deleted portions and prevented her from doing so; and that appellees thereby violated \u00a7 315 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 315, and damaged appellant in the sum of $4,000. Judgment was prayed for $4,000 as actual damages and $1,000 as punitive or exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The statement that appellees violated \u00a7 315 was a mere statement of a conclusion. To determine whether the stated facts warranted the conclusion, we examine \u00a7 315. It reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u201cIf any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station, and the Commission shall make rules and regulations to carry this provision into effect:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Provided, That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provisions of this section. No obligation is hereby imposed upon any licensee to allow the use of its station by any such candidate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Appellant contends that appellees, if they did the acts which the complaint said they did on March 31, 1945, violated two provisions of \u00a7 315 \u2014 the provision that \u201cIf any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station,\u201d and the provision that \u201csuch licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provisions of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">These provisions are aimed at licensees only and can be violated only by licensees. It appeared from the complaint that the Company was a licensee on May 14, 1945, but it did not appear that the Company was a licensee on March 31, 1945, when the acts complained of were said to have been done, or at any time prior to May 14, 1945. It did not appear that Smith or Blake was ever a licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">These provisions are applicable when, and only when, there are two or more legally qualified candidates for the same public office, and a licensee has permitted one such candidate for that office to use a broadcasting station, and another such candidate for that office seeks equal opportunities in the use of such station. It appeared from the complaint that during the period from February 20, 1945, to April 3, 1945, appellant was a legally qualified candidate for the office of mayor of the City of Los Angeles, but it did not appear that there was any other legally qualified candidate for that office. It appeared that Bowron, Clinton, McDonald and Entenza were candidates for that office, but it did not appear that any of them was a legally qualified candidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">It appeared from the complaint that the Company permitted appellant to use a broadcasting station, namely, station KFA C, but it did not appear that the Company permitted Bowron, Clinton, McDonald or Entenza to use the station. It appeared that the Company permitted Bowron, Clinton and McDonald or their \u201csponsors\u201d to use the \u201cfacilities\u201d of the station,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but \u00a7 315 says nothing about \u201csponsors\u201d or \u201cfacilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">It appeared from the complaint that opportunities in the use of station KFAC were afforded to appellant, but it did not appear that any opportunity in the use of the station was afforded to Bowron, Clinton, McDonald or Entenza. It therefore did not and could not appear that appellant sought, or was denied, opportunities in the use of the station equal to those afforded to Bowron, Clinton, McDonald or Entenza.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">The provision of \u00a7 315 relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>censorship applies only to \u201cmaterial broadcast under the provisions of this section.\u201d It appeared from the complaint that, after being censored on March 31, 1945, the speech scheduled for April 1, 1945, was broadcast as scheduled, deleted portions being omitted, but it did not appear that the speech was broadcast under the provisions of \u00a7 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">For all these reasons, we hold that the complaint did not state facts warranting the conclusion that \u00a7 315 was violated by ap-pellees or any of them, and did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Other reasons for so holding have been suggested \u2014 that one of the deleted portions of the censored speech was libelous, and that the others related, not to the candidacy of appellant or any other person for the office of mayor of the City of Los Angeles, but to the candidacy of Charlotta Bass for another office. In view of the conclusions reached by us, these matters need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The court below correctly held that the complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted. It incorrectly held, and stated in the judgment, that \u201cit affirmatively appears from the face of [the complaint] that this court does not have any jurisdiction over the subject matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The judgment is modified by striking out this statement and, as thus modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-12\"> See \u00a7 24(1) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b366-13\"> See \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 and 301 of the Act, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 151, 152, 301; National Broadcasting Co. v.
