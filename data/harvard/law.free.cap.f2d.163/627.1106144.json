Count 1 was based on 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2550(a), 2553-(a) and 2557(b)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It alleged that appellant, \u201con or about the 16th day of August, 1945, in the City and County of San Francisco, State of California, unlawfully did sell, dispense and distribute not in or from the original stamped package, a lot of smoking opium, in quantity particularly described as one 5-tael can of smoking opium.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-26\">Count 2 was based on 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7. 174.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It alleged that, \u201cat the time and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>place mentioned in the first count of this indictment, said defendant [appellant] fraudulently and knowingly did conceal and facilitate the concealment of said lot of smoking opium, in quantity particularly described as one 5-tael can of smoking opium,\u201d and that \u201cthe said smoking opium had been imported into the United States of America contrary to law as said defendant then and there knew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Appellant was arraigned, pleaded not guilty and was tried. William H. Grady, Jacob Lieberman and others testified as witnesses for' appellee, the United States. Appellant was convicted and sentenced on both counts and has appealed. He contends that the trial court erred (1) in sustaining objections to questions propounded to Grady and Lieberman on cross-examination and (2) in sentencing him on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">First. Grady testified on direct examination that he was and had been for 4% years an agent of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics; that on August 15, 1945, in the basement of the Uptown Hotel in San Francisco, California, he saw appellant and a Government \u201cinformer\u201d and overheard a conversation between them;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that in this conversation the \u201cinformer\u201d asked appellant, \u201cDid you bring the can of mud?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and appellant said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t bring it; I will later on tonight or tomorrow;\u201d that the \u201cinformer\u201d thereupon removed a roll of currency from his pocket and asked appellant if he wanted the money then; and that appellant said, \u201cNo, you can pay me at the time I deliver the stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Grady further testified on direct examination that on August 16, 1945, he met Lieberman and the \u201cinformer\u201d at Fortieth Avenue and Irving Street in San Francisco, gave the \u201cinformer\u201d $375 and searched him to see that he <em>did </em>not have any narcotics on his person; that Lieberman and the \u201cinformer\u201d then proceeded to a house at 1678 Forty-fifth Avenue in San Francisco; that Grady saw Lieberman and the \u201cinformer\u201d enter the house and, shortly thereafter, saw appellant enter and, 15 minutes later, saw him leave the house; that five minutes after appellant left, Lieberman and the \u201cinformer\u201d left the house, went to Forty-seventh Avenue and Moraga Street in San Francisco and there met Grady; and that the \u201cinformer\u201d thereupon handed Grady \u201ca can that appeared to contain smoking opium.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">On Grady\u2019s cross-examination, an objection was sustained to each of the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">\u201cWho is the Government informer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-10\">\u201cTell me, is it your own Jerome Berry, also known as Jimmy Berry?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-11\">\u201cWas he residing in that hotel, the Uptown Hotel, on the 15th day of August, 1945 ?\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-12\">\u201cWas there a man by the name of Jerome Berry, an employee of that hotel?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-13\">\u201cAnd [the person who occupied the house at 1678 Forty-fifth Avenue on August 16, 1945] was this informer that you speak of?\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">The objection was that the questions were improper because they sought disclosure of the identity of the person whom Grady called an informer. We agree with appellant that this was not a valid objection. If the person whom Grady called an informer had been an informer and nothing more, appellant would not have been entitled to have his identity disclosed;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but the person whom Grady <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>called an informer was something more. He was the person to whom appellant was said to have sold and dispensed the opium described in the indictment. Information as to this person\u2019s identity was therefore material to appellant\u2019s defense, and appellant was entitled to a disclosure thereof.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Hence the court erred in sustaining the objection. However, we hold that- the error was harmless, for the following reasons :</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Although the identity of the person whom Grady called an informer was not disclosed by Grady\u2019s testimony, it was disclosed by Lieberman\u2019s testimony. Lieberman\u2019s testimony showed that Berry was the person whom Grady called an informer; that Berry had a room at the Uptown Hotel on August 15, 1945, and was an employee of that hotel; and that Berry occupied the house at 1678 Forty-fifth Avenue on August 16, 1945.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Hence appellant was not prejudiced by the court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Lieberman testified on direct examination that he was and had been for almost seven years a special employee of the Bureau of Narcotics; that on August 15, 1945, he met appellant in the lobby of the Uptown Hotel; that appellant asked him where the \u201cinformer\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was; that he told appellant, \u201cI will call him; he is upstairs in his room;\u201d that he (Lieberman) telephoned the \u201cinformer\u201d and told him, \u201cSteve [appellant] is downstairs;\u201d that the \u201cinformer\u201d came down in a few minutes; and that appellant and t.he \u201cinformer\u201d went to the rear of the lobby and thence to the basement of the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Lieberman further testified on direct examination that on August 16, 1945, he and the \u201cinformer\u201d met Grady at Fortieth Avenue and Irving Street; that Grady searched him and the \u201cinformer\u201d and gave the \u201cinformer\u201d a bundle of money; that 15 minutes later he (Lieberman) and the \u201cinformer\u201d were in the house at 1678 Forty-fifth Avenue, when somebody knocked on the door and said, \u201cMilkman;\u201d that Lieberman and the \u201cinformer\u201d opened the door; that appellant came in with two bottles of milk, gave them to the \u201cinformer\u201d and, at the same time, pulled out a package and said to the \u201cinformer,\u201d \u201cHere is the can of opium;\u201d that the \"informer\u201d gave Lieberman the can of opium and gave appellant the money; that appellant counted the money; that Lieberman asked appellant, \u201cIs all the money there?\u201d and appellant said, \u201cEverything is here;\u201d that appellant left the house; that a few minutes later Lieberman and the \u201cinformer\u201d left, went to Forty-seventh Avenue and Moraga Street and there met Grady; and that the \u201cinformer\u201d gave Grady the can of opium.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">On Lieberman\u2019s cross-examination, an objection was sustained to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-13\">\u201c[The house at 1678 Forty-fifth Avenue] was [the informer\u2019s] home, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">The objection was that the question was improper because it sought disclosure of the identity of the person whom Lieberman called an \u201cinformer.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For reasons previously indicated, we hold that the court erred in sustaining the objection. However, the error was a harmless one; for the fact which the question sought to establish \u2014 that the house at 1678 Forty-fifth Avenue was the home of Berry, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>so-called informer \u2014 was clearly established by other testimony, including that of appellant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Second. . Asserting that \u201cThe proof at the trial below established only one offense, if any,\u201d appellant contends that the court erred in sentencing him on both counts of the indictment. There is no merit in this contention. The two counts charged two distinct offenses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Both were amply proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-14\"> Section 2550(a) mentions opium and other drugs.
