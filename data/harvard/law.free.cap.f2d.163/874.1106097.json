Pointing out that the evidence was wholly circumstantial and insisting that it was not sufficiently cogent to convict him, he is here urging upon us that the court erred in not directing a verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-25\">A careful examination of the record convinces us that appellant\u2019s point is well taken. We think it clear that it cannot be said of the evidence that it pointed unerringly to appellant\u2019s guilt and that it was inconsistent with any other hypothesis. The most that can be said of the evidence in the Government\u2019s favor is that some of the circumstances were sufficient to raise a suspicion of appellant\u2019s guilt, and this, according to settled rules, is not sufficient. It will serve no useful purpose to consider or discuss circumstantial evidence cases. The principle governing them is well settled, and each case rests upon, and must be determined by, its own facts. If the defendant was guilty as charged, it was the Government\u2019s duty to prove that he was. Verdicts may not be based upon surmise and suspicion. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
