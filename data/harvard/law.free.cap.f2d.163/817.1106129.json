It contended that he purchased, in the District of Columbia, the morphine tartrate described in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Appellant was arrested in the District. He then had in his possession a number of one-half grain syrettes of morphine tar-trate. They were not in or from any stamped package. They had been lawfully manufactured for tax-free distribution in the army and were in boxes labelled: \u201cProduced by E. R. Squibb &amp; Sons for U. S. Army Medical Department. Morphine used was property of U. S. Government . . . Control 3D41007.\u201d Appellant testified that the boxes were handed to him in Maryland by a soldier whom he did not know, and who asked him to keep them until the soldier came to town. Appellant knew that the boxes contained narcotics, and tried to get rid of them when he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-17\">Appellant contends there was no evidence that he <em>purchased </em>the drugs, or that he acquired them in \u00a1the District. There was no direct testimony on either point but none was necessary. The statutory \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d clause, quoted above, covers both the fact of purchase and the place of purchase. \u201cThe statute here talks of prima facie evidence, but it means only that the burden shall be upon the party found in possession to explain and justify it when accused of the crime that the statute creates.\u201d .Casey v. United States, 276 U.S. 413, 418, 48 S.Ct. 373, 374, 72 L.Ed. 632. The jury were under no obligation to believe appellant\u2019s own interested and improbable testimony,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and there was no other testimony that tended substantially to explain and justify his possession of the drug. i \u2022 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b870-18\">Since \u201cstamped package\u201d plainly means a package which has. \u201cappropriate tax-paid stamps,\u201d it is no defence that the morphine tartrate in appellant's, possession had been lawfully manufactured and delivered to the army without stamps and was labelled accordingly. - It has been suggested that because the drug had never been in a stamped package, it was not covered by the statutory words \u201cdrugs * * * except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package.\u201d This suggestion involves reading into the statute, after the words just quoted, the words \u201cwhich formexdy contained the drags.\u201d It would follow that any narcotics which had, either lawfully or unlawfully, escaped taxation and stamping might be pxxrchased and sold with impxxnity. The statute has of course no such pui'posc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>or effect. \u201cThe\u201d stamped package to which it refers is the stamped package in which narcotics must be placed before they can lawfully be sold to the public or purchased by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The prosecutor told the jury that the government was \u201cabandoning\u201d the part of the indictment relating to codeine. But, as he made clear, he meant only that he would not attempt to prove that part. He had only to prove some facts which were charged and were criminal, not all the facts charged in the indictment. His abandonment of the codeine charge is as immaterial as the fact that he made no attempt to prove that appellant did \u201csell, dispense, and distribute\u201d anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Appellant objects to the jury, on the grounds that (1) persons who did not wish to serve had been excused from the panel; (2) all the jurors were government employees; (3) one juror was a messenger in the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury; and (4) one was the husband of a Treasury employee. Willingness to serve does not disqualify a juror. Neither does government employment. United States v. Wood, 299 U.S. 123, 57 S.Ct. 177, 81 L.Ed. 78. In Higgins v. United States, 81 U.S. App.D.C. 371, 160 F.2d 222, a narcotics case, we affirmed a conviction by a jury nine members of which were government employees. No juror in the present case was asked whether he was employed in the\u2019 Treasury Department, and the fact that one was so employed was not discovered until after the trial. He, like the others, had answered satisfactorily many questions intended to guard against bias. He had no connection with the Department\u2019s Bureau of Narcotics, \u201cthe particular branch of the Government charged with the administration of the narcotic laws.\u201d Appellant\u2019s peremptory challenges had not been exhausted when it developed that a prospective juror was married to a Treasury employee. Appellant never specifically challenged this juror, but merely included him in a general challenge of the entire jury. We find no error or abuse of discretion and no evidence that any member of the jury was unqualified or biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Appellant\u2019s other contentions are likewise without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-11\"> Changed to \u201cfrom\u201d by Act of July 1, 1944, 58 Stat. 721, U.S.C.A.
