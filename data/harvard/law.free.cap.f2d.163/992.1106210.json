The requested charge, that appellant\u2019s wife was an accomplice and her evidence must be considered in the light of that fact, was properly refused.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As to the requested charge defining the elements of the offense, there was no error in declining to give it both because the general charge was sufficient and because it was in substance given on defendant\u2019s request made at the conclusion of the general charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-24\">No reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1044-25\"> Denning v.
