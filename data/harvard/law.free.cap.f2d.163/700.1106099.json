Appellant was brought here to stand trial in the well-known and so-called \u201cMass Sedition Case.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While in this jurisdiction, he filed with the court below his petition for a writ of habeas corpus attacking the jurisdiction of the court sitting in Indiana in the trial resulting in his conviction there. The petition was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-21\">In view of this court\u2019s decisions in Downey v. United States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Noble v. Botkin <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court was correct in dismissing the petition. The effect of these decisions is that the District Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a petition for a. writ of habeas corpus attacking the petitioner\u2019s original conviction when the petitioner is held in this jurisdiction solely by reason of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum. We see no reason to depart from this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-23\"> Now on appeal to this court, United States v.
