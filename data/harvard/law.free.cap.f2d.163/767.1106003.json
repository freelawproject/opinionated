There was evidence that appellant drove his car on the wrong side of the street, went through a stop sign at an intersection, and collided with appellee\u2019s car which had properly entered the intersection. Appellant testified that his brakes suddenly failed to work and had previously worked properly. Therefore, he contends, he was not negligent in failing to stop. But a garage operator who examined his car after the accident \u201cguessed\u201d that the brake hose, which he found to be broken, had been broken by the accident. The evidence fully supports the jury\u2019s inference that the collision was due to appellant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-20\">Appellee carried \u201c$50 deductible\u201d insurance against damage to his car. He testified that he \u201conly signed for the $50, and the insurance company, itself, signed for the rest of the [repair] bill.\u201d We assume that \u201csigned for\u201d means \u201cpromised to pay.\u201d Appellant contends that appellee should not have been allowed to recover in the present suit the full amount of the damage to his car, because the insurance company was not a party to the suit. But counsel who represented appellee at the trial happened to be counsel for the insurance company also, and stipulated that the insurance company would give appellant a full release. If there was any theoretical error in permitting full recovery, a question on which we express no opinion, it was made harmless by the stipulation. Appellant\u2019s other contentions are likewise without merit</p>\n<p id=\"b819-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
