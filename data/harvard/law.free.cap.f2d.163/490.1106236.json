The judgment of conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii. 37 Haw. 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-33\">A careful reading of the 1,000-page printed record convinces us that the appel-lee adduced ample evidence to sustain the conviction. Summarized, the evidence was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-34\">The appellant Young was a licensed physician of the Territory, and also of the British Empire. The appellant Nozawa described herself as a \u201cnurse\u201d employed in the appellant Young\u2019s office, but Dr. Young testified that it would be \u201cmore appropriate\u201d to describe her as his \u201coffice girl\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-35\">On September 19, 1942, Mrs. Gladys Tai Yee, twenty years old, the mother of two children, called at the office of Dr. Ho Quong Pang, her family physician, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>purpose of ascertaining whether she was pregnant. Judging from the history of her case and relying also upon his own findings, Dr. Pang believed that she was about four weeks pregnant, and he so informed her. She wanted the doctor \u201cto do something to bring on menstruation\u201d, but he told her that he \u201cwould not perform an abortion on her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">On Friday, September 25, 1942, Mrs. Yee walked out of her home on her way to call at the office of Dr. Young. The appellee produced a parade of relatives and neighbors to prove that she seemed to be in good health when she left her house, and that she had not been sick before consulting Dr. Young. She was not coughing or spitting blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Mrs Yee left her home at about 10 or 11 o\u2019clock in the forenoon. Before leaving, she showed her mother $150. Mrs. Yee\u2019s husband testified that he had kept about $170 in a peanut can, stowed away in a trunk, and that after her death he found only $20 of that money left. In a statement made at the police station and read at the trial, the husband said that on that day or on the previous day she had told him she \u201cwas going to take $150 to pay Dr. Young\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">At this point, the narrative of Mrs. Yee\u2019s ill-fated visit to Dr. Young\u2019s office is taken up in two statements made to detectives by the appellant Nozawa at the Honolulu police station on Tuesday, September 29, 1942. One statement was taken down in shorthand in the morning of that day, and the other, covering much the same ground, was taken in the afternoon. Dr. Young was present when each statement was taken. Miss Nozawa refused to sign either statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The first specification of error in the present appeal sets forth that the Supreme Court of the Territory erred in holding that the trial court did not err in admitting these two statements in evidence. The grounds upon which this specification is based will be considered hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Dr. Young, Miss Nozawa and other defense witnesses fixed the date of Mrs. Yee\u2019s visit as Thursday, September 24, instead of Friday, September 25, although Miss Nozawa added that she was \u201cnot quite sure\u201d. The latter date, however, was unanimously agreed upon as the correct one by the Territory\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">In her statements, Miss Nozawa said that Mrs. Yee came to Dr. Young\u2019s office \u201cfor delayed menses\u201d. Dr. Young examined Mrs. Yee \u201cthrough the breast\u201d and in the vagina. He consented to relieve her condition relative to the menses. He asked her to lie on the operating table and to remove part of her under-clothing, which she did, placing the removed portion on a chair. Dr. Young then opened her womb with an instrument that looked \u201clike a spoon split in half\u201d \u2014 later identified as a speculum \u2014 while Miss Nozawa \u201csterilized the inside [of the womb]\u201d with a substance that she called \u201cmercursen\u201d, applied with cotton.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">Continuing her statement, Miss Nozawa said that Dr. Young \u201cput jello in\u201d Mrs. Yee\u2019s womb. To do this, he used a glass tube with \u201ca silver thing at the point,\u201d the glass tube and a silver-colored tube containing the \u201cjello\u201d both being \u201cclinked together\u201d, or attached. Probably because of language difficulties, the Japanese girl\u2019s testimony at this point was not altogether clear, but evidently she was trying to say that the doctor inserted the glass tube into Mrs. Yee\u2019s womb and squeezed the jelly from the container tube, which resembled a toothpaste tube, through the glass tube into the patient\u2019s womb.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">Dr. Young then gave Mrs. Yee \u201ctwo codein pills to stop the pains,\u201d Miss Noza-wa assisted her in putting on her undergarment, and, after resting for about half an hour, the patient left the office in a taxicab called by Miss Nozawa.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">While she was giving her first statement, Miss Nozawa was asked by one of the detectives, whether she remembered a girl named Rose Dolim. She replied in the affirmative, and stated that the girl had come into the office for \u201cdelayed menses\u201d and that Dr. Young had done \u201cthe same to Rose Dolim as he did to Gladys Yee\u201d, including the insertion of \u201cthe same kind of paste\u201d. She also told the detectives that still another girl, a Japanese whose name may or may not have been Kane-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>shiro, was put through \u201cthe same operation and treatment\" in Dr. Young\u2019s office as had been performed on Gladys Yee.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Miss Nozawa also stated that \u201cpatients that have abortion performed on them pay in cash\u201d, and that \u201cno bills are sent to them.\u201d She said she knew that it was illegal to perform abortions, but nevertheless she assisted in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">What happened to Mrs. Yee after she left Dr. Young\u2019s office was graphically told by Jack Ho King Yee, the girl\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">On Friday, September 25, Yee\u2019s mother-in-law called him up while he was at work, and he went home at 1:30 or 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. He found his wife lying on the floor, coughing blood, and complaining that she was dizzy. During the whole time that they had been married, she had never coughed blood before. He called up Dr. Young at about 6 P. M. The doctor came over, examined Mrs. Yee, told the family not to get excited, that she was coughing blood because she was excited, and that \u201cthe baby could come at night, at 8 o\u2019clock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Mrs. Yee\u2019s condition grew worse as the night wore on. Shortly after midnight, she was unable to talk or to open her eyes. At about 2 o\u2019clock Saturday morning, Yee called up Dr. Young again, and said to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">\u201cDr. Young, no matter, I have to take my wife to the hospital to save her life; and her hands all blue already.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Once again Dr. Young came to the house, and once again he attributed Mrs. Yee\u2019s condition to her being \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cnervous\u201d. This time, however, he left two yellow pills and two white pills to be administered to the patient to relieve her pain and to enable her to sleep better.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">During this early morning visit, according to Yee, Dr. Young told him that \u201cthe medicine\u201d that was working \u201cinside the stomach\u201d would \u201ckill the baby and pull [it] out\u201d. When Yee again insisted that he wanted to take his wife to the hospital, Dr. Young told him not to be worried or excited, and that \u201cthe baby may come [at] six o\u2019clock Saturday morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Mrs. Yee continued to be unable to talk and \u201crolled around\u201d in her bed. At 9:30 Saturday morning, Yee went to Dr. Young\u2019s office, and repeated his statement that \u201cI must take my wife to the hospital\u201d. And once again the doctor tried to reassure Yee, adding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-12\">\u201cIf you send her to the hospital it is going to be all jammed up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">At 2:30 or 3 o\u2019clock Saturday afternoon, Yee again telephoned to Dr. Young, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-14\">\u201cDr. Young, I must, in my heart, send my wife to the hospital to save her life, she is almost dying.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">Dr. Young once again came to the Yee home, once again asked the family why they were \u201cexcited\u201d, and told them that \u201cThis is going to be all right\u201d. Yee also quoted the physician as saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-16\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to send her to the hospital, the baby [is] going to * * * come out along at 8 o\u2019clock.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-17\">Dr. Young gave Mrs. Yee two injections \u201cto make her sleep for 12 hours\u201d, and left directions that she should be given two more pills at eight o\u2019clock. Yee identified two empty containers of pituitary extract and ergonovine as having contained the material that Dr. Young injected into Mrs. Yee. Dr. Young promised to return to see her at 8 o\u2019clock the following morning, and departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-18\">About 15 or 20 minutes after Dr. Young left the Yee home, Mrs. Yee died.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-19\">Five times within as many minutes, the bereaved husband, who stated on cross-examination that he intended to bring a damage suit against Dr. Young, charged that the latter had killed Mrs. Yee. Obviously referring to the attending physician \u2014 and so understood by defense counsel \u2014 Yee hurled his accusations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-20\">\u201c * * * he kills my wife. * * * Why he kills my wife; he killed my wife, see. * * * he kills my wife. * * * He kills my wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-21\">On Sunday morning, September 27, 1942, Dr. Young signed a death certificate for Mrs. Yee giving -as the \u201cimmediate cause of death\u201d the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\u201cPulmonary congestion and haemoptysis Due to Mitral Stenosis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Translated into layman\u2019s language, this would mean a congestion of the lungs and a spitting of blood, due to the narrowing of the mitral valve of the heart; i.e., the valve that prevents the blood in the left ventricle from returning into the left atrium, or auricle. In still less technical language, \u201cmitral stenosis\u201d could be defined as the leakage of a valve of the heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">On Monday, September 28, 1942, Dr. Richard K. Chun, assistant city and county physician of Honolulu, performed an autopsy on the body of Mrs. Yee. He found \u201cthe valves of the heart to be clear and competent.\u201d \u201cIn other words\u201d, Dr. Chun testified, \u201cthey closed tightly, which is the normal function of the valves of the heart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Dr. Chun signed a death certificate of his own \u2014 far different from that filled out by Dr. Young. Dr. Chun\u2019s certificate gave the \u201cimmediate cause of death\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201cToxemia, due to extensive gangrenous myometritis of uterus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">On the witness stand, Dr. \u2018Chun explained the above to mean that there was an absorption of \u201ca large amount of poison in the body, * * * overwhelming\u201d the vital organs, and causing death. The focus of the poisoning was \u201cfound in the uterus where there was extensive destruction of tissue; extensive injury, and destruction of the uterine tissue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">In his certificate, Dr. Chun filled out the blank captioned \u201cMeans of injury\u201d as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">\u201cAn object or agent introduced into the uterine cavity from without.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Dr. Chun testified that both ergonovine and pituitary extract \u2014 which Dr. Young admitted having administered to Mrs. Yee \u2014tend \u201cto contract the uterus and expel the fetus\u201d. In plainer English, however, the following questions were asked and the following answers were given during the direct examination of Dr. Chun:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">\u201cQ. Doctor, from your findings at the autopsy are you able to say whether or not an abortion was performed on Gladys Tai Yee, or attempted? A. Yes. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">\u201cQ. Will you tell us your opinion in that respect; is it \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019? A. Yes, * * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">Dr. Pang, who was one of the appellants\u2019 witnesses in the instant case and who was called by his friend, Dr. Young, as a witness in a previous abortion case, testified that when he examined Mrs. Yee on September 19, as heretofore related, he would have known if she had been suffering from mitral stenosis so badly as to die a week later.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">Quite apart from the question of the appellants\u2019 guilt or innocence, Dr. Young\u2019s diagnosis of \u201cmitral stenosis\u201d has been thoroughly discredited by the results of the autopsy and by the unbiased medical testimony in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">On cross-examination, Dr. Young was confronted with his own testimony in the Rose Dolim case. While on the witness stand in the instant case, he admitted that he \u201cdid perform an abortion\u201d on Rose Dolim, but contended that it was \u201ca therapeutic one\u201d. In the Rose Dolim case, Dr. Young testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-17\">\u201cQ. Did you ever give any one else this same type of treatment you gave Rose Dil-in? <em>A: </em>Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-18\">\u201cQ. That is, the packing and the putting in of medicine? A. Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-19\">\u201cQ. Given it on many occasions? A. Many, many occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-20\">\u201cQ. Many, many occasions? A. Even when I was in London I used to give that, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-21\">\u201cQ. Did you give it to a girl named Yee? That name is familiar to you, isn\u2019t it, Doctor? Gladys Yee? A. I gave her, \u2014yes, I gave her ergot-novine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-22\">\u201cQ. The same type of treatment? A. A similar treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-23\">\u201cQ. The same? Did I hear \u2018similar\u2019 or \u2018same\u2019? A. Similar. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-24\">\u201cQ. You say it differed in some respects, the treatment you gave Gladys Yee? A. It differed in some respects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-25\">\u201cQ. What respects? A. I added some added treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-26\">It is unnecessary to labor the point further. The entire record clearly establishes the appellants\u2019 guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The specifications of error, however, contain two technical attacks upon the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">1. The first specification asserts that the Supreme Court of the Territory erred in holding that the trial court did not err in admitting in evidence the two statements, already referred to, made by the appellant Nozawa to the detectives. These statements were inadmissible, the appellants contend, because they were made by Miss Nozawa \u201cwhile she was in illegal custody and restraint, plaintiffs in error having objected to the admission of said exhibits seasonably and produced evidence to show that they were involuntarily made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Early in the evening of Monday, September 28, 1942, Detectives Albert M. Felix and William Kaina, of the Honolulu police department, went to Miss Nozawa\u2019s home and brought her to the police station under arrest. We cannot agree with the holding of the territorial Supreme Court that Miss Nozawa came to the police station voluntarily. 37 Haw. at page 198. Not only is the testimony of the arresting officers clear on that subject, but in their briefs before this court opposing counsel not only agree but insist that Miss Nozawa was under arrest from the time that she was picked up at her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The appellants insist, however, that though Miss Nozawa had already been \u201carrested\u201d when she was brought to the police station, \u201cshe was not \u2018arrested for investigation\u2019 under color of section 5404 of the Revised Statutes [Laws] of Hawaii, 1935, [infra] * * * until after she had reached the police station and had denied that she was implicated in the case of Mrs. Yee.\u201d The record seems to bear out the appellants\u2019 contention, but in our view the point is not important.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">On the ride down to the police station, Detective Felix asked Miss Nozawa whether \u201cshe knew any facts concerning the treating of Gladys Yee, and she said she didn\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d He repeated his questioning after they reached the station, and she repeated her reply. She was then \u201cbooked * * * for investigation and sent * * * upstairs.\u201d On the stand, Felix explained that \u201cwe had many statements to take that night\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Miss Nozawa was locked up in a cell in the women\u2019s block, where she spent the night. She was returned to her home at 11 o\u2019clock the following night. It is upon her alleged experiences in this cell that are bottomed the appellants\u2019 objections to the admission of her statements to the detectives. It is argued that because of the conditions in the cell, Miss Nozawa\u2019s subsequent statements could not \u201cpossibly be dignified as voluntary\u201d. The appellant\u2019s argument on this point runs this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">\u201cThe exerting upon Miss Nozawa of the influences of fear and hope are [sic] unmistakable \u2014 fear that she would again be subjected to the physical and psychological torture of revolting imprisonment if she did not make a statement \u2014 hope that she would be released and allowed to go home as promised if she did make a statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">As to the \u201chope\u201d that was held out to Miss'Nozawa \u201cthat she would be released and allowed to go home as promised if she did make a statement\u201d, there is some conflict in the evidence. Both before the trial judge alone, in the absence of the jury, and later also before the jury, Miss Noza-wa testified that Detective Felix had promised her that \u201che would not charge me if I would say like that\u201d, and that she would be allowed to go home. She further told the jury that she lied in her statements to the police \u201cbecause I wanted to go home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">On cross-examination by dpfense counsel, Felix at first flatly denied that he had promised Miss Nozawa that she could go home as soon as she made a formal statement, then qualified his denial by saying that he could not recall and finally returned to his flat denial that he had made such a promise: \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t promise anything of the kind.\u201d As we shall see hereafter, the voluntary nature of Miss Nozawa\u2019s statements was a matter to be determined preliminarily by the trial judge, and ultimately by the trial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">We advert now to Miss Nozawa\u2019s account of conditions in the cell that she occupied during the night of September 28-29. Her statement before the trial judge, in the absence of the jury, was in part as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>and I saw a Portuguese girl was laying there. So she saw me, and she said, \u2018Hello !\u2019 I said, \u2018Hello!\u2019 So she said \u2018What is the idea of the matron locking you in this cell here ?\u2019 \u2018Do you know that place is filthy,\u2019 she said. I said \u2018Why ?\u2019 She said, \u2018Why don't you come outside ?\u2019 I could not because the matron locked me in here. She had a key, and she locked me in there and I had to stay in. There was no mattress; no bed; no pillow. There was dirty blanket. And the toilet was filthy with smell, a terrible smell. I had to stay in there the whole night. I had a pain in my stomach. I had menses then. I just sat there and cried the whole night. So the Portuguese girl asked me, \u2018Hilda, why don\u2019t you go to sleep?\u2019 I said I couldn\u2019t sleep with all the mosquitoes, and bed bugs, and I have a pain down here. I have to scratch all the time. The bugs bit me. I couldn\u2019t stand it. So I cried all night long. They took my jacket. They took my belt away from me. I had just my dress. The blanket was dirty. The smell was terrible, I could not put the blanket on me, and I had to stay on the cement, sit on the cement until they called me again.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>\u201cWell, when I went in it was all-blacked out. Had no light in there. I walked in,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Miss Nozawa told substantially the same story in the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Felix testified that the cells in the women\u2019s block were provided with toilets, that he had never heard that they \u201csmell\u201d, but that he had heard the mattresses and beds contain bedbugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">On the other hand, Miss Nozawa admitted that Detective Felix \u201cwas quite nice\u201d to her throughout his dealings with her. Moreover, her repeated statements that she \u201cmade up\u201d one of her answers to the police \u201cof her own accord\u201d, and that she answered his question as she did, not because Felix told her to, but because \u201cthat thing just came into my mind\u201d, might well have led the jury to disbelieve her altogether when she gave her harrowing description of conditions in her cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Miss Nozawa\u2019s two statements to the detectives bear internal evidence of not having been forced from her. In several instances she declined to answer questions, by remaining mute. Usually, on such occasions, Detective Felix would merely repeat the question, and if Miss Nozawa persisted in her silence, he would drop the matter. At other times, he would not even repeat the question, but would pass on to something else. In no instance did he threaten, cajole or even try to persuade her to answer. Indeed, Felix asked whether she wished \u201cto continue in this statement\u201d, whether she cared to answer a particular question, and whether she was \u201cready to continue with this statement\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Furthermore, from Miss Nozawa\u2019s own testimony, the jury could have refused to believe that it was the conditions in her cell that affected her veracity in her statements to the detectives. She declared that in her answers to Felix she \u201cwas mixed up with the Dolim case\u201d and didn\u2019t know what she was saying. On the other hand, she blamed Felix as \u201chaving told me to say that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">In the final analysis, the jury was the ultimate judge of the truth of Miss Noza-wa\u2019s statements, both as to the conditions in her cell and as to the effect that such conditions had upon her veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">As was said by the Supreme Court of Hawaii in Territory v. Pong Chong, 20 Haw. 229, 233\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-13\">\u201cIt must be conceded that the jurors who tried the case, heard the witnesses testify, observed their demeanor, their intelligence, their appearance, their bias or prejudice, if any, and many other indicia, were in a better position to determine the truth than we are with only the cold record before us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">See also Territory v. Truslow, 27 Haw. 109, 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">Referring particularly to the determination of whether or not a confession is voluntary, the Supreme Court, in Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U.S. 596, 602, 64 S.Ct. 1208, 1212, 88 L.Ed. 1481, used the following language: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>regardless of the contrary conclusions of the triers of fact, whether judge or jury, this Court cannot avoid responsibility for such injustice by leaving the burden of adjudication solely in other hands. But when there is a dispute as to whether the acts which are charged to be coercive actually occurred, or where different inferences may fairly be drawn from admitted facts, the trial judge and the jury are not only in a better position to appraise the truth or falsity of the defendant\u2019s assertions from the demeanor of the witnesses but the legal duty is upon them to make the decision. [Case cited.]\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>\u201cThe voluntary or involuntary character of a confession is determined by a conclusion as to whether the accused, at the time he confesses, is in possession of \u2018mental freedom\u2019 to confess to or deny a suspected participation in a crime. [Cases cited.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-17\">\u201cWhen conceded facts exist which are irreconcilable with such mental freedom,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Again, in United States v. Mitchell, 322 U.S. 65,. 69, 70, 64 S.Ct. 896, 898, 88 L.Ed. 1140, footnote 2, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201cIn both cases Mitchell denied the testimony of the officers that he had in fact made prompt and spontaneous confession and consent to the search of his home, and on the basis of such denial motions were made to exclude the evidence. The trial judges ruled that whether these statements were in fact made in the circumstances narrated were questions of fact for the juries. As such they were left to the juries, and we here accept their verdict as did the court below.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The questioning of a suspect while in the custody of police officers is permissible. United States v. Mitchell, supra, 322 U.S. at page 69, 64 S.Ct. 896, 88 L.Ed. 1140; Lyons v. Oklahoma, supra, 322 U.S. at page 601, 64 S.Ct. 1208, 88 L.Ed. 1481; Ziang Sung Wan v. United States, 266 U.S, 1, 14, 45 S.Ct. 1, 69 L.Ed. 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The arrest of Miss Nozawa was lawful, for it was based upon probable cause. The police had been investigating the case since the morning of the previous day, and had interviewed Yee, Dr. Pang, and David Akana, the undertaker, as well as Dr. Young, who had admitted to them that he had attended Mrs. Yee for three days and that she had died.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">In Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 156, 161, 45 S.Ct. 280, 286, 69 L.Ed. 543, 39 A.L.R. 790, Mr. Chief Justice Taft said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">\u201cThe usual rule is that a police officer may arrest without warrant one believed by the officer upon reasonable cause to have been guilty of a felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">See also 6 C.J.S., Arrest, \u00a7 6, subsec. b. (2), page 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">The statute of the Territory on this subject accords with the general law. Section 5404 of the Revised Laws of Hawaii, 1935, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-13\">\u201cSec. 5404. By policeman without warrant. Policemen, or other officers of justice, in any seaport or town, even in cases where it is not certain that an offense has been committed, may, without warrant, arrest and detain for examination such persons as may be found under such circumstances as justify a reasonable suspicion that they have committed or intend to commit an offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">Cf. Young v. Hawaii, 9 Cir., 160 F.2d 289, 290, certiorari denied, 67 S.Ct 1736.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-15\">This section has been repeatedly upheld by the territorial Supreme Court. Provisional Government v. Caecires, 9 Haw. 522, 528; Territory v. Sing Kee, 14 Haw. 586, 587; Territory v. Hoo Koon, 22 Haw. 597, 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-16\">Not only Miss Nozawa\u2019s arrest but also her detention was lawful. Such detention was specifically authorized by territorial law. Section 5408 of the Revised Laws, supra, reads thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-17\">\u201cSec. 5408. Examination after arrest. It shall be unlawful in all cases of arrest for examination to deny to the person so arrested the right of seeing counsel or a member of his family; or to deny to counsel, or a member of his family, the right to see such person so arrested at any time; or to fail to release or charge such person with a crime within forty-eight hours of his arrest in all cases in which such person is arrested on suspicion of having committed a crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-18\">As we have seen, Miss Nozawa was released well within the statutory period of forty-eight hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-19\">The fact that the plumbing in Miss Nozawa\u2019s cell was drawn into question by her or that she complained of the presence of insect life in her jail quarters was not of itself sufficient to make her statements involuntary. In the first place, the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>in view of her admitted lack of veracity, may have disbelieved her statements regarding conditions in her cell or the promises alleged to have been made by Detective Felix. In the second place, mere discomfort in sleeping accommodations does not of itself make a statement involuntary. The Supreme Court has upheld a confession made by a defendant while he was confined and in irons, under an accusation of having committed a capital offense. Sparf and Hansen v. United States, 156 U.S, 51, 52-53, 55, 15 S.Ct. 273, 715, 39 L.Ed. 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">After a careful scrutiny of the entire record, we are of the opinion that there was evidence to support the implied findings of the lower court and of the jury that Miss Nozawa\u2019s statements to the detectives were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">2. The second specification of error sets forth that \u201cthe Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii erred in holding and finding that the trial court did not err in denying the motion of Peter L. Young for the suppression of evidence (Exhibits 11 and 12 for prosecution) obtained by the police as a result of the search of his premises without a warrant on September 28, 1942; it affirmatively appearing that at the time of said search the said Peter L. Young was in custody, held by the police without warrant or process of any kind, and that he did not waive the requirement of a search warrant for the police to make said search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">We may observe in passing that the above specification is in error as to the date of the seizure. The record shows and in their brief the appellants state that the visit to Dr. Young\u2019s office occurred between the statements of Miss Nozawa, which were undoubtedly made on September 29, 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Exhibit 11 was a speculum, which, according to the testimony of Felix, Miss Nozawa turned over to the detectives, and which she told them \u201cwas the thing that Doctor Young used to open up Gladys Yee\u2019s vagina.\u201d \u201cShe showed us how to manipulate it,\u201d Felix testified. Exhibit 12 was the forceps that she told the officers \u201cwas used to swab out Gladys Yee\u2019s vagina and womb,\u201d according to the detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Detective Kaina corroborated the testimony of Felix.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">The appellant Young moved to suppress these exhibits on the morning of the day set for the opening of the trial, April 26, 1943, but a day before the jury was called, impaneled and sworn. Counsel for the appellee correctly states that the appellants knew that the detectives had this evidence, and had from September, 1942, to April, 1943, within which to file a motion to suppress the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">The rule is well settled that a motion to suppress should be \u201ctimely\u201d (23 C.J.S., Criminal Law, \u00a7 1060, subsec. b., page 476) and \u201cseasonable\u201d (Territory v. Young, 32 Haw. 628, 648). A mere last-minute change of counsel, which was shown in this case, cannot excuse so long a delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">Nevertheless, because of the grave consequences involved for the appellants in this case, we will consider the motion on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Briefly, the circumstances attending the seizure, as set forth by the appellee\u2019s evidence, are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">After 11 a. m., on September 29, 1942, when the taking of Miss Nozawa\u2019s first statement was completed, Detectives Kaina and Felix, Dr. Young, Miss Nozawa, a police photographer and the police matron drove out to Dr. Young\u2019s office. Dr. Young \u201cwent around and opened the place up.\u201d There Miss Nozawa \u201cpicked out\u201d and identified the two instruments, as stated.</p>\n<p id=\"avy-dedup-0\">Detective Felix testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-16\">\u201cI told Dr. Young, \u2018These were the two instruments?\u2019 and he said, \u2018No.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, would it be all right if we have those?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yes, go ahead, we can buy plenty more; anybody can buy them.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-17\">In his cross-examination of Felix, even counsel for the appellants seemed to strive to emphasize Dr. Young\u2019s willingness to let the detectives have the instruments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-18\">\u201cQ. Now, when you were there on the 29th, Doctor Young was ready, <em>willing to give you these </em>instruments, and 'to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>you all the facilities that he could? A. Yes. He was very\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">\u201cQ. Very cooperative? A. Very cooperative.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">On the witness stand, however, Dr. Young himself denied that he had given the detectives permission to take the instruments for the purpose of evidence in this case against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The appellants concede that \u201cthe determinative question before the court on this aspect of the appeal is whether Dr. Young waived his constitutional rights.\u201d Cf. United States v. Mitchell, supra, 322 U.S. at pages 69, 70, 64 S.Ct. at pages 897, 898, 88 L.Ed. 1140. From a study of all the testimony on this subject, we think that the trial court was justified in believing that he had done so, and accordingly was correct in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">To recapitulate, we hold that, since the appellant Nozawa\u2019s statements to the detectives, and the appellant Young\u2019s surrender of the two instruments into their hands, were all voluntary, the exhibits complained of were properly admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Accordingly, there being no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
