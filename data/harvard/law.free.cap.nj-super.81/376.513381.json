J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aho4\">Plaintiffs appeal from a Law Division summary judgment in defendant\u2019s favor. The court determined that plaintiff Josephine Konitch\u2019s common law negligence action against defendant, her fellow employee, was barred as a matter of law under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:15-8 by reason of both parties being \u201cin the same employ,\u201d and that her exclusive remedy was under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Nenad Konitch, her husband, suing <em>per quod, </em>was adjudged to have no cause of action inasmuch as his action depended upon and was incidental to his wife\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">The sole issue here is whether the trial court correctly construed <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:15\u20148 in holding that defendant was \u201cin the same employ\u201d as the injured plaintiff and therefore immune from suit under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">The facts are not disputed. Plaintiff' was a secretary, and defendant a technical director in the employ of Flood &amp; Conk<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>lin Mfg. Co. Both were allowed to park their automobiles in a parking lot made available to that company and which it permitted certain of its employees to use. At about 8 a. m. on October 2'7,1961 plaintiff drove her car into the lot, parked it, and started to walk toward the exit in order to get to the office where she worked. While she was still inside the parking lot she was struck and injured by an automobile operated by defendant, who was driving to work and was about to park the car. The vehicle was owned by the employer, who provided it for defendant\u2019s business and pleasure use.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Plaintiff brought an action in negligence against both defendant and the company, and her husband sued <em>per quod. </em>This action against the employer was dismissed, all parties agreeing that recovery against the company lies within the exclusive area of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:15-8 (first paragraph).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Defendant moved for summary judgment, contending that Mrs. Konitch\u2019s exclusive remedy is under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act in view of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:15-8 (second paragraph), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201cIf an injury or death is compensable under this article, a person shall not be liable to anyone at common law or otherwise on account of such injury or death for any act or omission occurring while such person was <em>in the same employ </em>as the person injured or killed, except for intentional wrong.\u201d (Italics ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">This language was added to <em>R. 8. </em>34:15-8 <em>(L. </em>1911, <em>c. </em>95, \u00a7 8) by <em>L. </em>1961, c. 2, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">We have here a case where the injured plaintiff and defendant are employed by the same employer. Both were at the parking lot for the purpose of beginning their workday. Although defendant had the use of the company\u2019s motor vehicle for pleasure as well as business, at the time of the accident his sole reason for operating the vehicle was to get to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The trial court established a three-pronged test for the application of <em>N. J. 8. </em>A. 34:15-8: it must appear that (1) plaintiff suffered a compensable injury; <em>(2) </em>plaintiff and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>defendant were co-employees; and (3) defendant was acting in the course of his employment. The statutory language, \u201cin the same employ,\u201d was construed to mean that the accident must arise out of and in the course of employment. Defendant need not be performing a duty connected with his employment. The trial judge was of the opinion that the clear intention of the statute\u2014all of the three elements just mentioned being present\u2014was to limit recovery to compensation benefits and to exclude any other liability, except for an intentional injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Here, as in the trial court, plaintiffs argue that not only must the parties be employed by the same employer, but that the co-employee must commit the tort while performing a duty and function of his employment. Defendant\u2019s position, on the other hand, is that the statute means exactly what it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The plain language of the statute stands in direct opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 position. Nowhere may there be found a reference, express or implied, to the duty restriction which plaintiffs would place on the immunity granted a co-employee. They argue, however, that a literal reading of the statute could lead to absurd results. They pose the hypothetical situation where a traveling salesman, driving a car on company business, becomes involved in an accident brought about by a person employed by the same company while on vacation or doing something not connected with a duty of his employment. To hold the vacationing employee immune from liability for injuries suffered by the salesman would, they say, reach a result not intended by the Legislature. But as we read the statute, immunity would not result, for the vacationing employee could not be said to have been acting within the course of Ms employment. It is not necessary to impose a duty limitation in order to avoid the consequence which plaintiffs project. On the other hand, were the situation reversed and the salesman the defendant, there still would be no immunity, for the vacationing employee would not have received a compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>The \u201cin the same employ\u201d provision of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-8 has not been construed by our courts. Plaintiffs rely on <em>Stacy v. Greenberg, </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>390 (1952) and 14 <em>N. J. </em>262 (1954). Our Supreme Court there construed a provision of the New York Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, <em>section </em>29, <em>subdivision </em>6, <em>McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. </em>67, which closely resembles the 1961 amendment to the New Jersey act here in question. Plaintiffs quote from 14 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pages </em>265-6, where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">\u201c* * * In our earlier decision, after examining pertinent New York authorities pursuant to a stipulation of counsel that \u2018all decisions of the New York courts which may be cited by counsel shall be deemed to be in evidence for the purpose of the determination by the court as to the State of New York law,\u2019 we concluded that, though Greenberg [defendant] and plaintiffs [Stacy and Wolff] might be entitled to compensation benefits under the New York act for their hurts, Stacy and Wolff were barred by the statute from maintaining common law actions against Greenberg only if Greenberg\u2019s act of driving was in the authorized performance of a job for his employer. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Reference is also made to the language at <em>page </em>267 of that case, where the court said that it read the New York statute as \u201cintended to bar common law actions against the employee whose wrong injures his fellow employee if the driving is part of his job in the employer\u2019s service * * and <em>page </em>268, .where the court said that the implication to be drawn from the New York decisions was that \u201cif the purposes of the driving include the performance of an assigned duty of the employment the immunity follows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">However, the true meaning assigned by our Supreme Court to the New York statute may be found in its earlier opinion, 9 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pages </em>399-400, where it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">\u201c* * * Plaintiffs and Greenberg were not \u2018in the same employ\u2019 within the meaning of section 29, subsection 6, merely because they had a common employer. \u2018To make section 29 applicable at all, plaintiff must have sustained an injury in the course of employment, and to be immune from suit a co-employee causing the injuries must be \u201cin the same employ,\u201d namely in the course of employment by the same employer,\u2019 [citing New York cases]. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>In <em>Roberts v. </em>Gagnon, 1 <em>A. D. 2d </em>297, 149 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>743 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956), the Hew York court was presented with a situation strikingly similar to the one with which we deal. There plaintiff was struck down in his employer\u2019s parking lot by an automobile driven by a fellow employee. The accident took place about 40 minutes after working hours. The court held that a common law action against the fellow employee was precluded by reason of <em>section </em>29, <em>subdivision </em>6 of the Hew York Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The problem, of course, is one of determining the legislative intent in adopting <em>L. </em>1961, <em>c. </em>2, amending <em>R. 8. </em>34:15-8. Our highest court has indicated what it considers to have been the legislative intent. Thus, in <em>Eule v. Eule Motor Sales, </em>34 N. <em>J. </em>537, 541 (1961), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201c* s= * Reflecting the commonly-held view that the enterprise should be the final repository of the inevitable risk of loss, the Legislature recently provided that an employee shall not be liable for negligent injury of a co-employee entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, <em>L. </em>1961, e. 2, amending <em>Ji. S. </em>34:15-8. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">It is to be noted that the court in no way suggested that for there to be immunity, the negligent co-employee must have been engaged in the performance of a duty of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Again, in <em>Miller v. Muscarelle, </em>67 <em>N. J. Super. </em>305, 321 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), certification denied 36 <em>N. J. </em>140 (1961), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">\u201cThe continued subsistence of a cause of action in tort against a fellow-employee has come under considerable public criticism in recent years. It has frequently resulted in burdening the employer indirectly with common-law damages superimposed upon his workmen\u2019s compensation liability by reason of either a legal, moral or practical obligation to indemnify the sued director, officer or supervisory employee, or with the expense of carrying insurance to cover the personal liability of such supervisory personnel. See statement appended to <em>Assembly Bill No. </em>117 (1960) ; see also <em>Hagen v. Koerner, </em>64 <em>N. J. Super. </em>580 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960). Recognizing that such consequences conflict with the general scheme of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the Legislature this year amended the act <em>(R. S. </em>34:15-8) expressly to preclude a right of recovery on account of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>compensable injury or death, at common. law or otherwise against a fellow-employee except in cases of intentional wrong. <em>L. </em>1961, o. 2. * * #\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">(The 1961 act was held not to affect the <em>Miller </em>appeal because it operated only prospectively.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Erom this it seems clear that the legislation was intended to safeguard the general scheme of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act by banning those suits in which the employer might be put in the position of an indemnitor. We agree with the trial judge that the adding of a paragraph to the statute by the amendment of 1961\u2014an amendment having the contextual setting, the same objective, and relating to the same subject matter\u2014naturally carries with it an irresistible implication that it was intended to accomplish the same purpose as regards the liability of a co-employee as it did for the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Plaintiffs are correct when they insist that there must be another element in addition to a common employer and an injury compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. However, their conception that that element is the performance by the co-employee of a duty and function of his employment is a faulty one. The implied element in the statute under consideration is the one stated by the trial judge, and clearly set out in 2 <em>Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 12.20, <em>p. </em>114 (1961)\u2014that \u201cthe immunity attaches to the co-employee only when the co-employee is acting <em>in the course of his employment.\u201d </em>(Italics ours) The test, therefore, is not that the co-employee should have been acting under an employment duty, but rather in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\"> There can be no question that when defendant drove to work and entered the parking lot provided by the company, he was in the course of employment. An accident arises \u201cin the course of emplo3unent\u201d when it occurs within the period of employment and at a place where the employee may reasonably be. 1 <em>Larson, op. cit., </em>\u00a7 14, <em>p. </em>193 and \u00a7 15.14, <em>p. </em>200. Our courts have held that the employer\u2019s parking lot is part of the emplo3ment premises, and an employee entering or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>using the lot in the circumstances here present is in the course of employment. <em>McCrae v. Eastern Aircraft, </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>244 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948); <em>Buerkle v. United Parcel Service, </em>26 <em>N. J. Super. </em>404 <em>(App. Div. 1953); Lewis v. Walter Scott &amp; Co., Inc., </em>50 <em>N. J. Super. </em>283, 286 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958); <em>Rice v. Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>65 <em>N. J. Super. </em>579 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961). Plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that not only did Mrs. Nonitch have a compensable claim, but if defendant had been injured, he, too, would be entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The trial court correctly construed <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-8, and its judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
