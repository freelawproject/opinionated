J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AVr\">Plaintiff sued on a theft policy. The case was submitted to the Law Division upon a stipulation of facts. The court entered judgment for plaintiff and defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s brief sets forth the following summary of the stipulation, and defendant does not dispute its accuracy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u201cDefendant, Safeguard, issued an automobile insurance policy covering a 1960 Rambler, naming the Romar Taxi Service, Inc. (hereafter Romar) as the insured, and recognizing the plaintiff, Edgewater, as holding an encumbrance thereon, and agreeing to insure it to the extent of its interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">The policy contained the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u2018Coverage D\u2014Theft (Broad Form) :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">To pay for loss of or damage to the automobile, hereinafter called loss, caused by theft, larceny, robbery or pilferage.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">[Excluding] :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">\u2018\u00ae * * joss (jue \u00a30 conversion, embezzlement or secretion by any person in possession of the automobile under a bailment lease, conditional sale, purchase agreement, mortgage or other encumbrance.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-12\">Romar\u2019s officers and stockholders were the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-13\">President: Robert Limburg\u201449 shares;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-14\">Vice-President: Margaret M. <em>Limburg\u20142 </em>shares ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-15\">Secretary and Treasurer: Harriet Limburg\u201449 shares.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-16\">The total shares of stock issued were 100.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-17\">Upon the application of Robert and Harriet Limburg, President and Secretary and Treasurer respectively, Edgewater loaned Romar $4,756.42 on November 29, 1960 to be repaid in installments * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-18\">In consideration of the loan Romar issued its promissory note executed by Robert and Harriet Limburg, in their capacities as officers of the corporation and individually. Additionally, Romar executed [an] Agreement in consideration of the loan placing the 1960 Rambler and a 1955 Dodge as security. Robert and Harriet Limburg executed the * * * Agreement as corporate officers of Romar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-20\">Robert Limburg operated the 1960 Rambler in the business of the corporation. Romar defaulted in the loan payment in May 1961 with no payments made thereafter. During the month of June 1961 Robert Limburg took the 1960 Rambler and has not returned to New Jersey, being last seen in Texas. The Rambler at the time of taking was worth $1450.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-21\">Defendant\u2019s appeal is based upon two propositions. The first is that this was not theft, larceny or pilferage within the meaning of the policy. The second is that since Limburg was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>president and a half-owner of the corporation and personally endorsed Romar\u2019s note to plaintiff, he was a \u201cperson in possession of the automobile under a bailment lease, conditional sale, purchase agreement, mortgage or other encumbrance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument that this was not \u201ctheft\u201d within the meaning of the policy is predicated upon certain language contained in <em>Stewart v. Home Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. of </em>California, 124 <em>A. </em>773, 2 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>515 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1924). However, that case has no bearing on the case at bar, for its facts are completely different from those before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In that case Stewart was the conditional vendor and Straus the conditional vendee of a certain automobile. The policy was issued in the name of both, as their respective interests might appear, insuring them against \u201ctheft, robbery or pilferage, excepting, however, the wrongful conversion or embezzlement. by the vendee in possession under a conditional sale agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The conditional sale contract forbade Straus from selling the car without Stewart\u2019s permission. Nevertheless, Straus sold it to one Schane. When Stewart learned of this, he demanded the car of Schane, who, after some delay, delivered it to Stewart. Stewart nevertheless sued the insurance company, claiming that these facts demonstrated a theft within the terms of the policy. The court held that it did not. It said that Schane had not stolen the car but had purchased it in good faith, \u201cand, if it be assumed that the transaction involves criminality on the part of Straus, what he did amounted to an embezzlement, which is a fraudulent conversion of property by the possessor after its possession has been lawfully acquired * * excluded from coverage \u201cby the excerpt from the policy which we have above recited, namely, that the embezzlement or secretion by the vendee in possession * * * shall not render the company liable under the clause of the policy insuring against theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Defendant seizes upon the statement in <em>Stewart </em>that \u201cTheft, or larceny, involve [s] the idea of a knowingly unlawful acquisition of property; that is, a felonious taking of it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>from one who has both the actual possession and the apparent right of possession.\u201d That is generally true, but it was said with reference to the facts and issues before the court in <em>Stewart. Cf. State v. Trunfio, </em>58 <em>N. J. Super. </em>445 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959). The court did not undertake, in <em>Stewart, </em>to lay down a definition of theft intended to control future cases in which the facts were different.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Defendant argues that Limburg\u2019s taking of the car was not theft but embezzlement because Limburg had \u201crightful possession before conceiving a fraudulent intent,\u201d and the words \u201ctheft, larceny, robbery or pilferage\u201d may not be construed to include embezzlement. Defendant says that the fraudulent taking of corporate property by an officer was embezzlement at common law, and today it is punished under <em>chapter </em>102 of <em>title </em>2A of our statutes, which deals with \u201cEmbezzlement, Conversion and Misappropriation.\u201d <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:102-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The stipulation contains no facts which bring this case within the rationale of <em>Miller &amp; Dobrin Furniture Company, Inc. v. Camden Fire Insurance Company Association, </em>55 <em>N. J. Super. </em>205 <em>(Law Div. </em>1959), nor does defendant so claim. Therefore, insofar as the issues of this case are concerned, the relationship of Limburg to the insured car was the same as that of any employee who is placed in charge of a vehicle to be operated upon his employer's business.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">It has often been said that an employee has custody of his employer\u2019s property, and not possession, and therefore his felonious taking may be larceny. 32 <em>Am. Jur., Larceny </em>\u00a7 56, <em>p. </em>958; <em>Gibson v. St. Paul Marine Fire Ins. Co., </em>117 <em>W. Va. </em>156, 184 <em>S. E. </em>562 <em>(Sup. Ct. App. </em>1936); <em>Henley v. State, </em>59 <em>Ga. App. </em>595, 2 <em>S. E. 2d </em>139, 142 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1939); <em>McGraw v. State, </em>142 <em>Tex. Cr. </em>R. 432, 154 <em>S. W. 2d </em>645, 647 <em>(Crim. App. </em>1941). However, we prefer not to base our decision on any such narrow ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">To begin with, the policy does not exclude all conversions, embezzlements and secretions but only those by one \u201cin possession under a bailment lease, conditional sale, purchase agreement or other encumbrance.\u201d Under well settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>rules governing the construction of contracts generally, and insurance contracts in particular, the insurance companies, having indicated which embezzlements are excluded, may he held to have agreed that all other embezzlements come within the term \u201ctheft,\u201d and are covered. Appleman says (5 <em>Insurance Law &amp; Practice, </em>\u00a7 3212, <em>p. </em>357 (1941)) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">\u201cAnd where a policy insures against theft, excepting from its operation loss of a certain type, such as embezzlement by mortgagor or vendee in possession, losses not falling within that specifically excepted class are covered so as to render the insurer liable for embezzlement by other persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">See also 5A <em>Am. Jur., Automobile Insurance, </em>\u00a7 47, <em>p. 50 </em>(1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Limburg was not in possession under a bailment lease, conditional sale, purchase agreement or other encumbrance. Title to the car was in Romar, and the pledge of that title to plaintiff was by Romar. Limburg had no property right whatever in the car. The fact that Limburg endorsed Romans note is immaterial. If Limburg did have \u201cpossession,\u201d rather than \u201ccustody,\u201d his possession was as an officer-employee of the corporation, and not by virtue of the contract between Romar and the plaintiff. <em>Cf. General Public Loan Corp. v. Director of Division of Taxation, </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>393 (1953); <em>Hancock v. Board of Review, </em>46 <em>N. J. Super. </em>418, 424 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The cardinal rule for the construction of insurance policies is that their language shall be read as they would be understood by members of the general public who purchase them. <em>Kievit v. Loyal Protect. Life Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N. J. </em>475, 488 (1961); <em>Tomaiuoli v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co., </em>75 <em>N. J. Super. </em>192, 195 <em>(App. Div. </em>1962). This is no new doctrine. In 1840 Justice Story said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">\u201cIf there be any commercial contract wbicb, more than any other, requires the application of sound common sense and practical reasoning in the exposition of it, and in the uniformity of the application Of rules to it, it is certainly a policy of insurance; for it deals with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>the business and interests of common men, who are unused to deal with abstractions and refined distinctions.\u201d <em>Peters v. Warren Ins. Co., </em>14 <em>Pet. </em>99, 10 <em>L. Ed. </em>371, 376 (1840).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">See also <em>Champion v. Chicago Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>104 <em>N. J. L. </em>554, 556 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1928); <em>Pennsylvania Indemnity Fire Corp. v. Aldridge, </em>73 <em>App. D. C. </em>161, 117 <em>F. 2d </em>774, 133 <em>A. L. R. </em>914 (1941), and the eases cited <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In <em>Firemen\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. of San Francisco v. Boyd, </em>45 <em>So. 2d </em>499 <em>(Fla. Sup. Ct. </em>1950), a truck driver absconded with his employer\u2019s truck. The court found it was a theft within the meaning of a policy such as we have here. Since excerpts from that opinion will make it unnecessary for us to say much more upon the subject, we quote from it at some length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">\u201c* * * Some courts have stated that [theft] * * * means theft as common thought and common speech would now imagine it; that it should be given the usual meaning and understanding accorded it by persons in the ordinary walks of life. Bloom v. Ohio Farmers\u2019 Ins. Co., 255 Mass. 528, 152 N. E. 345; Granger v. New Jersey Ins. Co., 108 Cal. App. 290, 291 P. 698; Toms v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 146 Ohio St. 39, 63 N. E. 2d 909; Mello v. Hamilton Fire Ins. Co., 71 R. I. 510, 47 A. 2d 621.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdN8\">sk \u00a1i: <em>% </em>* s\u00a1\u00ed *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">As stated in Toms v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., supra [146 Ohio St. 39, 63 N. E. 2d 911], \u2018We think it may be accurately said that to \u201cthe man on the street\u201d the word \u201ctheft\u201d is of broader scope than \u201clarceny\u201d and comprehends essentially the willful taking or appropriation of one person\u2019s property by another wrongfully and without justification and with the design to hold or make use of such property in violation of the rights of the owner. In our opinion, where the word \u201ctheft\u201d is used in an insurance policy, without definition, it should be interpreted as liberally as possible to protect the insured.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">* * * And where, as here, a policy under a theft provision described as \u2018Broad Form\u2019 provides coverage for loss or damage due to \u2018theft, larceny, robbery, or pilferage,\u2019 it requires no great liberality of construction to hold that the insurer intended to provide coverage for losses in addition to those which are, by strict common-law definition, larceny.\u201d 45 <em>So. 2d, </em>at <em>pp. </em>500-501.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">See also <em>Edwards v. Bromberg, </em>232 <em>F. 2d </em>107, 110, 62 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>565 (5 <em>Cir. </em>1956); <em>Allen v. Berkshire Mutual Fire Ins.

Co., supra, </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">\u201cThe defendant argues that \u2018theft\u2019 means larceny, and that since the taking was by a bailee, there was no larceny because the bailee\u2019s possession was lawfully obtained and his felonious intent was formed after the delivery to him. But the word is to be given the meaning attributed to it in common use. Bloom v. Ohio Farmers\u2019 Ins. Co., 255 Mass. <em>528, 152 </em>N. E. <em>345; </em>Granger v. New Jersey Ins. Co., <em>108 </em>Cal. App. 290, 291 P. 698, 700. \u2018Theft\u2019 is a wider term than \u2018larceny,\u2019 including other forms of wrongful deprivation of the property of another, and acts constituting embezzlement may properly be so called. 3 Bouv. Law Dict. (Rawles\u2019 3rd revision) 3267, tit. \u2018Theft.\u2019 As Chief Judge (now Mr. Justice) Cardozo says in Van Vechten v. American Eagle Fire Ins. Co., 239 N. Y. 303, <em>146 </em>N. E. 432, 433, 38 A. L. R. 1115, 1116: \u2018We assume that larceny by a bailee or a fiduciary would be theft within the policy, though at common law it would be classified under the heading of embezzlement. * * * The distinction, now largely obsolete, did not ever correspond to any essential difference in the character of the acts or in their effect upon the victim. The crimes are one to-day in the common speech of men as they are in moral quality.\u2019 \u201d (at <em>p. </em>700)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We hold that the word \u201ctheft\u201d in the policy before us covers takings such as Limburg\u2019s, whether they be technically larceny or embezzlement. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
