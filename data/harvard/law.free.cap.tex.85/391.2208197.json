Act Creating Mills County.\u2014The act creating Mills County prescribed that it \u201cpay its pro rata of the liabilities of the four counties from which territory is taken to constitute it, in proportion to the territory taken and the territory remaining in the old county.\u201d One-fourth of the territory of Brown County was included within the limits of the new county. In suit by Brown County against Mills County for the pro rata of indebtedness paid by Brown County, it is <em>held, </em>that said act measures the liability by the territory taken, and not by its value.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b427-14\">2. Same \u2014 Measure of Liability not Constitutional. \u2014The spirit of the Constitution requires that the taxable value of the property in the territory taken off, in its relation to the taxable value of the property in the territory left in the parent county, must be the criterion by which the indebtedness between the two counties should be apportioned.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b427-15\">3. Same\u2014Constitutional Provisions\u2014Article 11, section 1, of the Constitution, provides, that \u201cwhen any part of a county is stricken off and attached to or created into another county, the part stricken off shall be holden for and obliged to pay its proportion of all liabilities then existing of the count)- from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>which it was taken, in such manner as may be prescribed by law.\"\u2019 This must be-construed in subordination to article 8, section 1, requiring uniformity and equality in taxation, and the legislation must conform to that article. The provision, therefore, in the act <em>creating </em>Mills County, fixing its liability according to the amount of territory, ignoring the taxable value of the property therein, imposes an unequal burden uijoii the citizens of such district, and is unconstitutional.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b428-3\">4. Cass in Judgment.\u2014Brown Comity sued Mills County for one-fourth of the indebtedness of Brown <em>at </em>the time Mills <em>County </em>was created, paid since it was created. The act creating Mills County cut off one-fourth of the territory of Brown Comity, and provided that the liability of the new county would be upon the proportion of the territory taken with that remaining in the county from which taken. Suit was brought under the statute <em>by </em>Brown County, and recovery had. On appeal, <em>held, </em>that the basis of liability was unconstitutional, and the suit being under it should be dismissed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b428-4\">Appeal from Mills.

Brown County was at that date indebted in the sum of $60,000 for certain expenditures previously incurred in the erection of public improvements, which remained exclusively within the limits of Brown after the creation of Mills County. When this suit was instituted, March 4, 1889, Brown County had paid $16,000 of this indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In this action appellee sued to recover one-fourth of this indebtedness, claiming that it was entitled to recover a sum bearing the same proportion to the entire indebtedness as the excised territory bears to the entire territory of Brown County before the territory of Mills County was cut off.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The court trying the case without a jury rendered judgment in favor of appellee for one-fourth of the indebtedness which had been paid by Brown County, and directed that the amount adjudged be paid out of the taxes to be collected out of a levy on all property subject to State tax in that portion of Mills County taken from Brown County. It further ordered, that the \u201c defendant and its County Commissioners Court shall at the first term of levying taxes for county purposes thereafter also levy upon all property subject to State tax in said territory, such tax, not to exceed the amount fixed by law, as will be sufficient to pay off and discharge the judgment; and if the proceeds and collections \u00e1re not sufficient to satisfy the judgment, then the same proceeding is to be kept up annually until the judgment is satisfied.\u201d The judgment further established the liability of appellant to appellee ' \u2018 for one-fourth of any amount of said indebtedness yet unpaid, which may be hereafter paid by appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Appellant complains of this judgment, and insists, in effect, that if plaintiff was entitled to any relief, that relief should have been granted upon the basis of the relative taxable value of that portion of Mills County taken from Brown, and of the territory remaining with Brown; that to fix the liability of Mills County by the standard of territorial area involves a violation of section 1, article 8, of the State Constitution, requiring that taxation must be \u201c equal and uniform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">In our opinion, the plain verbiage of section 2 of the act creating Mills County, already quoted, measures the liability of the latter by the standard of territorial area, not by that of the taxable value of the property in that territory. The language requiring payment \u2022 in proportion to the territory taken and the territory remaining to the old county \u2019 \u2019 refers to the amount of that territory, not to the taxable value of the property therein situated. In our opinion the spirit of the Constitution requires that the taxable value of the property in the territory taken off, in its relation to the taxable value of the property in the territory left in the parent county, must be the criterion by which the indebtedness of and between the two counties should be apportioned. If, therefore, the act itself in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the section referred to violates the Constitution, the judgment, in accordance with this section, should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Article 9, section 1, of our Constitution, on the subjectof the \u201c creation and organization of counties,\u201d prescribes, that \u201cwhen any part of a county is stricken off and attached to or created into another county, the part stricken off shall be holden for and obliged to pay its proportion of all the liabilities then existing of the county from which it was taken, <em>in \u25a0such manner as may be prescribed by law.\u201d </em>This provision must be construed in subordination to article 8, section 1, requiring uniformity and equality in taxation; and the legislation contemplated must conform to that article. The provision of the act creating Mills County, fixing its liability according-to the amount of territory, ignoring the taxable value of the property therein, imposed a different burden for the same purpose upon the citizen within that territory than he would have had to bear if there had been no severance of the county. The provision in question is, therefore, unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The duty is devolved upon the Legislature to provide for the apportionment of the indebtedness between the old and new county, and for the payment and enforcement thereof, but this duty must not be discharged in an arbitrary way. Regard must be had to the rule requiring the taxation to be \u201c equal and uniform.\u2019 \u2019 The propriety of general legislation on this subject is suggested. As the appellee\u2019s action is founded upon an unconstitutional provision, the judgment of the lower court should be reversed and the cause dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Adopted June 21, 1892.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Motion for rehearing was transferred to Court of Civil Appeals, Third District, and it was refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
