The certificate is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\u201c The plaintiff, Hogue, brought suit against defendant, Williamson, upon a written obligation, which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">\u201c Saltillo, January 25, 1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">\u201c On or before May 1, 1888, I promise to pay C. C. Hogue, or order, one thousand Mexican silver dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">. \u201cGeo. S. Williamson.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">\u201c $1000, Mex.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">\u201cThe petition alleges that on May 1, 1888, Mexican dollars were each worth 85 cents in \u2018American coin,\u2019 and plaintiff asks judgment for $850. He states in his petition that the not\u00e9is payable in Mexican silver dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">\u201c The defendant filed a general denial, and also averred in his answer, under oath, that the n\u00f3te sued on was given for money which the plaintiff had won from defendant in a game with cards, and was therefore illegal and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">\u201c Upon the trial in the court below, the plaintiff put in evidence the written obligation sued on, and proved that on May 1, 1888, Mexican silver dollars were worth 80 cents each. The plaintiff then rested and the defendant introduced no testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">\u201c The court instructed the jury to return a verdjet for defendant, which was done, and judgment entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">\u2018 \u2018 If the instrument sued on was a promissory note, this is error. Newton v. Newton, 77 Texas, 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">\u201c With this explanation, the Court of Civil Appeals for the Third Supreme Judicial District certifies and submits to the Supreme Court, for decision as part of the law of this case, as a new or hovel question, the following proposition:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">\u201c Was the burden of proof on the plaintiff, after the introduction of the instrument sued on, to show nonperformance of its obligations by defendant ? In other words, is the written obligation sued on a promissory note, obligating its maker to pay a certain sum of money; or is it an' ordinary contract for the delivery of a certain commodity; and must the plaintiff, by affirmative testimony, show a breach of the contract ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>We are of the opinion that the instrument in question is a promissory note. It is such in form and substance, unless the fact that the sum payable is expressed in Mexican silver dollars should make \u00e1 difference. Speaking of the sum for which a bill of exchange must be drawn, Mr. Chitty says, \u201cit may be the money of any country.\u201d Chitty on Bills, 160. Judge Story says: \u201cBut provided the note be for the payment of money only, it is wholly immaterial in the currency or money of what country it may be payable. It may be payable in the money or currency of England, or France, or Spain, or Holland, or Italy, or of' any other country. It may be payable in coins, such as in pounds sterling, livres, tomnosis, francs, florins, etc., for in all these and the like cases the sum of money to be paid is fixed by the par of exchange, or the known denomination of the currency with reference to the par.\u201d Story on Prom. Notes, sec. 17. The same rule is distinctly laid down in 1 Daniel on Negotiable Instruments, section 58, and in Tiedman on Commercial Paper, section 29b. In view of the opinion of these eminent text writers, it is remarkable that we have found but two cases in which the question is discussed or decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In Black v. Ward, 27 Michigan, 191, it is held, that a note made in Michigan payable in Canada in \u201c Canada currency,\u201d is payable in money, and is therefore negotiable. But in Thompson v. Sloan, 23 Wendell, 71, a note made in New York and payable there in \u201c Canada currency,\u201d was held not negotiable. The court, however, say: This view of the case is not incompatible with a\" bill or note payable in money of a foreign denomination, or any other denomination, being negotiable, for it can be paid in our own coin of equivalent value, to which it is always reduced by a recovery. A note payable in pounds, shillings, and pence, made in any country, is but another mode of expressing the amount in dollars and cents, and is so understood judicially. The course therefore in an action on such instrument is to aver and prove the value of the sum expressed in our own tenderable coin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">This decision was made in 1840, and it is to be inferred that at that time the dollar was not a denomination of the lawful money of Canada. We also infer, that when the Michigan case arose, this had been changed and the denomination of Canada money corresponded with that of the United States. Upon this theory, it would seem that the cases may be reconciled. The language quoted from the opinion in Thompson v. Sloan, supra, indicates clearly, that if the money named in the note had been a denomination of Canada money, the ruling would have been different, unless, perchance, the word \u201ccurrency\u201d would have affected the question. The note we have under consideration is for Mexican silver dollars\u2014coins recognized by the laws of the United States as money of the Republic of Mexico. U. S. Rev. Stats., sec. 3567.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">We conclude that the note sued upon in this case was a negotiable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>promissory note, and that when the plaintiff offered it in evidence, and proved the value of the Mexican dollar at the time of its maturity, lie had made a prima facie case, and our opinion will be certified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"A7l\">Delivered May 29, 1893.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
