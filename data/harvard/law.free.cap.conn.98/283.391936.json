The trial court, upon the introduction of Exhibit A, took the position, and ruled thereafter in accord with such position, that when Exhibit A appeared in evidence, no parol evidence could then be received tending to show that Exhibit A was not the entire agreement between the parties, and that additional terms not reduced to writing were included in an oral agreement to build a store before any part of it was reduced to writing, and that the parties did not intend to embody their entire oral agreement in the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-17\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Exhibit A.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-18\">Nov. 5,. 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-19\">I Agree To Build Store on Center Str #300 for Mr. Grossman Zize 11 x 14 Mor or Les Brickwalls Front To be with plat Glass Rof to Be 2 ply paper Flour To Goes 2 x 6 a new Step in Front and new Step in Rear Open Step Old Front Door To be ussed with New Luck 2 plat Form in The window window Slidet with Glass Furnished by Thay owner Newpar in Stour To bee Slidet 5/8 or 7/8 Sliding Amount For The Job is $650.

Reader.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Exhibit A, recited above, is not of such character, or in such terms, as by its own force to preclude the possibility that the parties did not intend to embody their entire oral agreement in it; on the contrary, its terms tend to support the opposite contention. We recently held in <em>Asbestos Products Corporation </em>v. <em>Matson, </em>97 Conn. 381, 384, 116 Atl. 680, that \u201cthe rule excluding parol evidence does not apply in cases where the original contract was verbal and entire and a part only of it is reduced to writing.\u201d \u201cWhether the parties intended the writing to embody their entire oral agreement or only a part of it, was a question for the trial court, to be determined from the conduct and language of the parties and the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Brosty </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>79 Conn. 133, 136, 64 Atl. 1, and cases cited; 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, \u00a7 284a. The court should have permitted the defendant to introduce parol evidence of the surrounding circumstances, conduct, of the parties, and their language as.to the terms of their agreement in the oral negotiations preceding the execution of Exhibit A, in order that the trial court might determine whether the parties intended Exhibit A to embody their entire oral agreement or only a part of it; and should also have permitted the cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>examination of the plaintiff as to the same matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The court erred in excluding such parol evidence and such cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">There is error and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
