(hereinafter ASP) was hired to perform carpentry work in connection with a construction project on certain property located adjacent to the plaintiffs premises which allegedly suffered property damage on or about August 31, 1994. The defendant Santo Monaco is the president of ASP. The appellants denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>by affidavit, that any carpentry work was done on the adjacent property until after the date of the loss, thereby establishing a prima facie case of entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. The burden then shifted to the plaintiff to raise a triable issue of fact (see, <em>Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., </em>68 NY2d 320). The plaintiffs contention that ASP was on the job before the date of the loss is wholly speculative, and as such, insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment (see, <em>Zuckerman v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d 557).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In addition to the loss claimed to have occurred on or about August 31, 1994, the plaintiff further alleged that on or about September 1, 1994, a vehicle struck the subject premises and caused further damage. However, the plaintiffs contention, raised for the first time on appeal, that the vehicle \u201cmay well have been owned and operated by ASP Construction\u201d is also speculative, and as such, insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact <em>(see, Zuckerman v City of New York, supra). </em>Ritter, J. P., Sullivan, S. Miller, Luciano and H. Miller, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
