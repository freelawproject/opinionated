Upon reviewing each of the documents, we conclude that the following documents do not qualify for protection from discovery under either category: item (b) in exhibit C; items (e), (g), (i) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>and (m) in exhibit D; items (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (m) in exhibit E; items (c), (g), (h) and (Z) in exhibit F; items (b), (d), (f), (g), (h) and (i) in exhibit G; item (b), the November 14, 1984 letter in item (c), and items (g) and (h) in exhibit H; exhibit Z; and the notice of loss form and McDonnell note dated July 13, 1983 and attachment in exhibit BB. Thus, we modify the order by granting defendant\u2019s motion insofar as it seeks to compel discovery of those items. (Appeal from Order of Supreme Court, Erie County, Glownia, J. \u2014 Discovery.)
