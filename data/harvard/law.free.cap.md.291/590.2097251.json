Vol.), Art. 81, \u00a7 67 (a). Three previous cases in this Court have rejected attempts to overturn \u00a7 67 (a) determinations. <em>State Dep\u2019t Of A. &amp; Tax. v. Clark, </em>281 Md. 385, 380 A.2d 28 (1977); <em>Mont. Co. Council v. Supervisor, </em>275 Md. 339, 340 A.2d 302 (1975); <em>La Belle v. State Tax Comm., </em>217 Md. 443, 142 A.2d 560, <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 889, 79 S.Ct. 135, 3 L.Ed.2d 117 (1958). The plaintiffs effort in the present case will similarly be unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">Before turning to the facts of the case, we shall briefly review the relevant statutory background. Under Art. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 2 (20), 29A (a) and 29A (c), the taxable year begins on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>July 1st in each year, and the assessment for the taxable year becomes final on the \"date of finality\u201d which is the previous January 1st. Notice of the assessment is ordinarily to be provided more than thirty days before the date of finality, and the taxpayer is given a specified period of time after receiving the notice to protest the assessment, Art. 81, \u00a7 29. If the taxpayer makes a timely protest, he is entitled to a hearing before the supervisor of assessments for the county, and he may appeal the supervisor\u2019s decision to the property tax assessment appeal board for the county, with the right to a hearing before the appeal board, Art. 81, \u00a7 255. The taxpayer then has thirty days after the board\u2019s decision to appeal to the Maryland Tax Court, Art. 81, \u00a7 255 (d) and 256. The Tax Court proceedings \"shall be de novo and shall be conducted in a manner similar to proceedings in courts of equity...,\u201d Art. 81, \u00a7 229 (c). The taxpayer is entitled to judicial review of the Tax Court\u2019s decision in the circuit court, with a right to appeal the circuit court\u2019s decision to the Court of Special Appeals, Art. 81, \u00a7 229 (1) and (p).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Consequently, the Legislature has afforded a taxpayer, as a matter of right, a comprehensive administrative remedy, with judicial review, to challenge his real estate assessment. Like most administrative remedies, there is a requirement that the taxpayer comply with reasonable time limits, beginning with a timely protest of the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In addition to the above-described administrative and judicial remedy, the Legislature has authorized certain officials to decrease an assessment in order to correct an erroneous or improper assessment and to prevent injustice, regardless of whether the taxpayer had made a timely protest of his assessment. In what is now codified as part of Art. 81, \u00a7 67 (a), the Legislature provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">\"The supervisor of assessments and the county treasurer (in Montgomery County the director of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>finance) of each county and in Baltimore City, the city solicitor and the supervisor of assessments, and in any incorporated town in Caroline County, the town boards, may by an order, decrease or abate an assessment after the date of finality for any year, whether a protest against said assessment was filed before the date of finality or not, in order to correct erroneous and improper assessments and to prevent injustice, provided, that the reasons for such decrease or abatement shall be clearly set forth in such order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The issue in the present case concerns the extent to which a court may review administrative decisions under the above-quoted statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The facts of this case are as follows: The plaintiff taxpayer owns a parcel of land in Prince George\u2019s County, containing approximately 25Vfe acres, upon which is operated a wash plant and a sand and gravel business. The assessment on this property was increased for the taxable year 1971; the taxpayer filed a timely protest of this assessment; he exhausted his administrative remedy; and he sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The circuit court decision concerning the 1971 assessment, which ordered a reduction in the assessment, was rendered on August 5, 1976. As there had been no change in the assessment for the taxable years 1972,1973 and 1974, and no notice of assessment for those years, Art. 81, \u00a7 214A, required that the reduction ordered by the circuit court be carried over to 1972, 1973 and 1974.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>While the proceedings regarding the 1971 assessment were pending, the property was reassessed for 1975 and 1976, with the assessment again being increased. The taxpayer received notices of the assessments for 1975 and 1976 but failed to file protests. In fact, the taxpayer did nothing regarding the 1975 and 1976 assessments until August 4,1977, when he filed an application under Art. 81, \u00a7 67 (a), contending that the 1975 and 1976 assessments were erroneous in light of the circuit court\u2019s decision with respect to the 1971 assessment. The \u00a7 67 (a) application was denied on September 2, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The taxpayer on December 19, 1977, instituted the present action by filing a \"petition for affirmative injunction\u201d in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against the Supervisor of Assessments of Prince George\u2019s County and the County Treasurer of Prince George\u2019s County, who were the two officials authorized to grant relief under Art. 81, \u00a7 67 (a). The taxpayer requested a mandatory injunction requiring a reduction in the assessments for 1975 and 1976. It was alleged that the assessments for these two years were \"illegal\u201d because they were \"based upon use of the property instead of cash value as provided by statute.\u201d It was further alleged that there had been \"no material change in the value of the subject property between the years 1971 and 1976\u201d and that, therefore, the assessments were \"illegal\u201d in light of the August 5,1976, circuit court decision ordering a reduction in the 1971 assessment. The taxpayer asserted that the position of the Supervisor of Assessments was \"arbitrary, illegal, capricious, discriminatory and unreasonable\u201d because of the adjudication that the 1971 assessment was illegal. There were no additional assertions or factual allegations explaining or supporting the contentions that the 1975 and 1976 assessments were arbitrary, illegal, capricious, discriminatory and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The defendants filed a motion raising preliminary objection on the ground that the circuit court had no authority to review the \u00a7 67 (a) administrative decision. The circuit court rendered an opinion and order granting the motion and dismissing the action, citing <em>La Belle v. State Tax Comm., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>supra, </em>and <em>State Dep\u2019t. of A. &amp; Tax. v. Clark, supra. </em>Thereafter, the taxpayer filed a motion for reconsideration, asserting that the assessments for 1975 and 1976 were \"void and constitutionally infirm\u201d and that, therefore, the case was distinguishable from those decisions on which the court relied. The circuit court granted the motion for reconsideration and reinstated the action, stating that judicial review would be \"narrowly restricted to whether the determination of the assessing authorities met constitutional standards.\u201d Subsequently, the circuit court denied the defendants\u2019 demurrer to the petition for injunction. The defendants then answered and filed a motion for summary judgment, attaching an affidavit of the Supervisor of Assessments for Prince George\u2019s County in which the Supervisor set forth the basis upon which he exercised his discretion in determining whether to grant relief under \u00a7 67 (a) and in which he gave the reason for denying relief to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In opposing the motion for summary judgment, the taxpayer asserted that nothing in the Supervisor\u2019s affidavit contradicted the taxpayer\u2019s allegation that the <em>original </em>assessments for 1975 and 1976 were \"illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The circuit court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, holding that the pleadings and affidavits disclosed no material issues of fact in dispute and demonstrated that the defendants were entitled to judgment. The taxpayer appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and that court reversed in an unreported opinion. The intermediate appellate court concluded that summary judgment was improper because the taxpayer had made \"a rather general allegation of discrimination\u201d and the \"affidavit of the Supervisor was merely conclusory and did not show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>facts in detail and with precision which would entitle the Supervisor to summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">This Court then granted the defendants\u2019 petition for writ of certiorari, in which it was contended that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision represented an erroneous application for our opinions dealing with Art. 81, \u00a7 67 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Art. 81, \u00a7 67 (a), was first considered by this Court in La <em>Belle v. State Tax Comm., supra, </em>217 Md. 443. The taxpayer in that case failed to make a timely protest of the assessment on her dwelling in Montgomery County. About seven months after the date of finality, she applied for a reduction under \u00a7 67 (a), which was then codified as Art. 81, \u00a7 66. Relief under the statute was denied because the Director of Finance of Montgomery County and the Supervisor of Assessments could not agree. The taxpayer then appealed to the State Tax Commission, the predecessor of the Maryland Tax Court, and the Commission held that it had no authority to review determinations under what is now \u00a7 67 (a). The circuit court affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision, and this Court upheld the affirmance. Judge Hammond for the Court pointed out that the consideration by the taxing and fiscal authorities under \u00a7 67 (a) was \"a matter of grace,\u201d and that if those authorities did not grant relief, \"the statute gives [the taxpayer] no further remedy and the assessment that has been allowed to become final remains on the books for the year in question.\u201d 217 Md. at 451-452.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The issue concerning review of \u00a7 67 (a) determinations next came before this Court in <em>Mont. Co. Council v. Supervisor, supra, </em>275 Md. 339. In that case, several owners of nineteen separate parcels of land in Montgomery County failed to file timely protests of the assessments, and the assessments became final. After the date of finality, a moratorium was imposed prohibiting further sewer connections. Alleging that the moratorium decreased the value of their land, the taxpayers sought and obtained relief under \u00a7 67 (a), with each of the assessments being reduced by twenty-five percent because of the sewer moratorium. Montgomery County then sought review in the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Tax Court, claiming that the assessments should not have been reduced, but the Tax Court dismissed the appeals for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal to this Court, Montgomery County attempted to distinguish the La <em>Belle </em>case on two grounds. First, it was contended that the result should be different where the county, instead of the taxpayer, was seeking review of the \u00a7 67 (a) determination, 275 Md. at 344. Second, it was argued that the Tax Court had a broader jurisdiction over appeals in property tax assessment cases than its predecessor agency, the State Tax Commission, <em>id. </em>at 347. We rejected both arguments, re-affirmed the continuing applicability of the La <em>Belle </em>case, and held that the Tax Court had no authority to review \u00a7 67 (a) decisions, <em>id. </em>at 344-348.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The most recent case to consider the reviewability of \u00a7 67 (a) decisions, and the case upon which the present plaintiff relies, is <em>State Dep't of A. &amp; Tax. </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>281 Md. 385. In <em>Clark, </em>the taxpayers failed to protest the re-assessment of their land for the taxable year 1972, and the assessment became final on January 1, 1972. In May 1972, a moratorium on further sewer extensions and sewer connections in the area was imposed, and the taxpayers thereafter applied under the \u00a7 67 (a) for a reduction in the assessment in light of the moratorium. The taxpayers\u2019 assessment for 1972 was reduced by twenty-five percent, in accordance with the policy of the officials exercising authority under \u00a7 67 (a) to abate the assessments on all properties affected by the sewer moratorium by twenty-five percent. The taxpayers, believing that they were entitled to a greater reduction, filed an action in the circuit court against the taxing and fiscal officials authorized to act under \u00a7 67 (a). They sought an injunction against the collection of taxes levied on their property and a declaration that \u00a7 67 (a), as applied to them, violated their right to equal protection of the laws as well as other constitutional guarantees. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court held that it had \"inherent\u201d power to correct arbitrary, illegal, capricious or unreasonable administrative acts, that, therefore, the court had authority to review the \u00a7 67 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>administrative decision, and that the administrative decision in the case before it was arbitrary. The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Clark </em>agreed that the circuit court had \"inherent\u201d jurisdiction to review the \u00a7 67 (a) administrative decision, but it concluded that the circuit court had erred in holding that the decision was arbitrary. The Court of Special Appeals remanded the case to the circuit court for consideration of the taxpayers\u2019 constitutional claims. This Court, disagreeing with both the Court of Special Appeals and the circuit court, held that the motion by the defendant officials for summary judgment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In the <em>Clark </em>opinion, written by Judge Orth for the Court, we reviewed the <em>La Belle </em>and <em>Mont. Co. Council </em>cases, reiterated that the potential relief under \u00a7 67 (a) was a \"matter of grace\u201d and that the joint action of officials under \u00a7 67 (a) \"is entirely discretionary,\u201d pointed out that neither the tax article of the Code (Art. 81) nor the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> authorized judicial review of \u00a7 67 (a) proceedings, and concluded \"that there is no statutory authority giving a circuit court jurisdiction, by way of declaratory judgment or otherwise, over the propriety of a grant or denial of a reduction in a real property assessment under \u00a7 67.\u201d <em>State Dep\u2019t of A. &amp; Tax. v. Clark, supra, </em>281 Md. at 394-396.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The taxpayers\u2019 intitial argument in <em>Clark, </em>accepted by both the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals, was that courts have an \"inherent\u201d right to review administrative decisions for arbitrariness, capriciousness or illegality. Reliance was placed upon cases such as <em>Balto. Import Car v. Md. Port Auth., </em>258 Md. 335, 342, 265 A.2d 866 (1970); <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Nat\u2019l Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 300, 236 A.2d 282 (1967); <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 42 A.2d 73 (1945); <em>Hecht v. Crook, </em>184 Md, 271, 40 A.2d 673 (1945). We pointed out that the applicability of this principle was limited to the situation where there was no statutory right of judicial review, and that where an administrative and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>judicial review remedy is provided by statute, that remedy is ordinarily deemed to be exclusive. 281 Md. at 400-401. Because a statutory administrative and judicial review remedy was provided to contest each year\u2019s assessment, as long as a timely protest was filed, we held that there was no \"inherent\u201d authority in a court to review for arbitrariness the \"purely discretionary\u201d administrative decision under \u00a7 67 (a). <em>Id. </em>at 402-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We then pointed out in <em>Clark </em>that when there is an attack upon the constitutionality or validity of an enactment on its face, such case falls within a well-established exception to the principle that statutory administrative and judicial review remedies are normally deemed exclusive and must be pursued and exhausted. However, we further pointed out that when the attack is upon the constitutionality of an enactment <em>as applied </em>to a particular situation, as contrasted with an attack upon the validity of an enactment as a whole, the case does not come within the exception and the statutory administrative and judicial review remedies are ordinarily exclusive. We noted that the taxpayers\u2019 attack went only to the constitutionality of \u00a7 67 (a) as applied and not to its constitutionality on its face. 281 Md. at 403-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Nevertheless, the Court in <em>Clark </em>went on to recognize that the case presented an unusual situation. As the taxpayers in <em>Clark </em>had no complaint concerning the 1972 assessment as of the date of finality, and as they were satisfied with the increased assessment as of January 1, 1972, they had no reason to file a timely protest of the assessment and pursue the usual statutory administrative and judicial review remedies set forth in Art. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 29, 229, 255 and 256. They were not then aggrieved and, therefore, had no right to seek review in the Maryland Tax Court and then the circuit court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The basis for the taxpayers\u2019 complaint was the sewer moratorium occurring many months after the date of finality; the only remedy available at that time, with regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>to the 1972 assessment, was provided by \u00a7 67 (a); and the taxpayers did pursue and exhaust the \u00a7 67 (a) remedy. Under those circumstances, we held that the court did have authority to determine whether \u00a7 67 (a) was constitutionally applied, and could overturn the administrative action if \u00a7 67 (a) had been applied in an invidiously discriminatory manner. Thus, Judge Orth stated for the Court in <em>Clark </em>(281 Md. at 404-405):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\"In such circumstances, we believe it is imperative that the inherent power of a court be not limited to ascertaining whether \u00a7 67 is constitutional on its face, but may be properly invoked to determine whether it is constitutional as applied. For example, were it otherwise an aggrieved party would be completely without recourse as to a determination by the... [\u00a7 67(a)] assessing authorities which was invidiously discriminatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">After holding that a court could review \u00a7 67 (a) decisions, limited to determining whether \u00a7 67 (a) was constitutional on its face or as applied, the Court in <em>Clark </em>went on to consider the taxpayers\u2019 allegations and the undisputed facts. We pointed out that merely because the taxpayers were treated differently than others who may have timely protested their assessments before the date of finality, did not amount to an invidious discrimination in the application of \u00a7 67 (a), stating (281 Md. at 409-410):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">\"Considering the facts before the trial court, and the proper inferences to be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to appellees, ... we see no invidious discrimination. There was no intentional and systematic undervaluation by assessors of other taxable property in the same class. All those who sought the extraordinary relief after the date of finality, which may be granted as a matter of grace under \u00a7 67, were granted a decrease of 25%. It is clear that this did not amount to an intentional violation of the essential principle of practical uniformity. That some in another class, that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>those who pursued the protest procedures to which they were entitled as of right before the date of finality, may have received a larger abatement, did not make the tax on appellees\u2019 property invalid. We hold that there was no denial of equal protection of the laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The Court, concluding that there had been no showing that \u00a7 67 (a) had been unconstitutionally applied, held that the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In light of the <em>Clark </em>opinion, it is readily apparent that the defendants in the instant case, like the defendants in <em>Clark, </em>were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We shall assume arguendo that if the taxpayer\u2019s allegations had been sufficient to set forth a cause of action under <em>Clark, </em>then the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding concerning the alleged insufficiency in the Supervisor\u2019s affidavit would have been correct. Nevertheless, whether or not summary judgment should be granted is not dependent upon affidavits alone. The pleadings must also be considered. As Maryland Rule 610 dl. specifies, \"[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the <em>pleadings, </em>depositions and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The taxpayer\u2019s petition for injunction, and his opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, disclosed the nature of the taxpayer\u2019s complaint and demonstrated that the defendants were entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The taxpayer\u2019s petition for injunction did not even make a conclusory allegation of unconstitutionality. Although the petition did contain the statements that the 1975 and 1976 assessments were \"arbitrary, illegal [and] capricious,\u201d under <em>Clark </em>this is not a basis for judicial review of \u00a7 67 (a) determinations. And while it was asserted that the assessments were \"discriminatory,\u201d it is clear that not every \"discrimination\u201d amounts to a denial of equal protection of the laws. Instead, as indicated in our <em>Clark </em>opinion, only \"invidious\u201d discrimination or discrimination without any rational basis is constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Moreover, even if the conclusory allegations of the petition for injunction were' construed to be assertions of unconstitutionality, the facts alleged failed to show a prima facie case of unconstitutional administrative action. The sole factual basis for the taxpayer\u2019s petition was the 1976 circuit court order requiring a reduction in the 1971 assessment, and the assertion that there had been no change in the value of the property between 1971 and 1976. These allegations, however, are insufficient to show mere illegality in the 1975 and 1976 assessments, and clearly they fail to show a violation of constitutional requirements. Under Art. 81, \u00a7 214A, the circuit court\u2019s decision concerning the 1971 assessment did not carry over to 1975 and 1976. Furthermore, it is settled that \" 'each annual assessment of property for tax purposes is distinct and presents its own problems.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Dep\u2019t of A. &amp; Tax. v. Clark, supra, </em>281 Md. at 403, quoting <em>Easter v. Department, </em>228 Md. 547, 551, 180 A.2d 700 (1962), <em>appeal dismissed </em>and <em>cert. denied, </em>371 U.S. 235, 83 S.Ct. 326, 9 L.Ed.2d 495 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Apart from the failure of the plaintiff taxpayer to allege unconstitutional administrative action, there is a more fundamental reason why the principles of the <em>Clark </em>case required judgment for the defendants. As previously discussed, in <em>Clark </em>the taxpayers had no complaint concerning their 1972 assessment as of the date of finality; they were not then aggrieved; and, therefore, they had no occasion or right to pursue the normal administrative and judicial review remedy provided in Art. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 29, 229, 255 and 256. It was the sewer moratorium occurring several months after the date of finality which furnished the basis for their complaint, and the <em>only </em>remedy then available was that provided by \u00a7 67 (a). It was for this reason that the Court recognized a limited exception to the principle against reviewability of \u00a7 67 (a) decisions, permitting review to determine \"whether \u00a7 67 is constitutional on its face ... [or] as applied.\u201d 281 Md. at 404-405. We did <em>not </em>hold that the constitutional validity of the earlier administrative action, in making the assessment prior to the date of finality, could be reviewed in the court proceeding. Instead, the review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>recognized in <em>Clark </em>concerned the alleged unconstitutional application of \u00a7 67 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">In the present case, however, the taxpayer\u2019s complaint related to the original notices of assessments for the years 1975 and 1976 and not to any asserted illegality in applying \u00a7 67 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There were no allegations of events after the date of finality, like the sewer moratorium in <em>Clark, </em>which changed the value of the property during the two taxable years in question. Unlike the taxpayer in <em>Clark, </em>the plaintiff here was aggrieved as of the dates of finality, could have filed timely protests, and could have pursued the normal administrative and judicial review remedy. Under these circumstances, the case does not come within the <em>Clark </em>holding that judicial review of \u00a7 67 (a) decisions is available to determine whether the discretion under <em>that section </em>was being exercised in an \"invidiously discriminatory\u201d manner. Even if the taxpayer in this case had raised an issue of unconstitutional application of the assessment statutes, since his grievance existed prior to the 1975 and 1976 dates of finality, the case falls within the usual principle that when a constitutional issue goes to the application of a statute, rather than the statute on its face, resort must be had to the statutory, administrative and judicial review remedies. As the plaintiff failed to file timely protests of the 1975 and 1976 assessments, he had \"no further remedy and the assessment that has been allowed to become final remains on the books for the year in question.\u201d <em>La Belle v.
