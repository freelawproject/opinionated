His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals, <em>Marshall v. State, </em>46 Md. App. 695, 420 A.2d 1266 (1980). We granted certiorari to consider the important issues presented.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">At Marshall\u2019s trial the State adduced evidence that on the night of February 9, 1979, the victim, Harry Waters, had been drinking in Dickie\u2019s Bar in Pocomoke City. At about 10 p.m., Waters left the bar and was joined by appellant and appellant\u2019s sisters, Barbara and Delores Marshall. On the corner of Clarke Avenue and Maple Street, outside the bar, appellant seized Waters from behind, whereupon, Delores and Barbara seized the victim\u2019s wallet and took his money. After the victim\u2019s empty wallet had been returned, appellant hit Waters in the face, which caused him to fall on the sidewalk and strike his head, rendering him unconscious. Appellant testified that he struck Waters only because Waters had threatened to \"cut\u201d him and had been reaching into a pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">At some point that evening, Peggy Marshall, another sis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ter of Appellant, saw the three perpetrators outside Dickie\u2019s Bar. Barbara said to Peggy that \"they were messing with Harry Waters.\u201d The four of them, joined by Denise Trader, a friend of Peggy\u2019s, then walked around the corner to Maple Street where Waters was lying on his back. Delores poured water on him in an attempt to revive him, and a decision was then made to put Waters in his pick-up truck. Peggy testified that appellant made this decision; appellant testified that the suggestion was made by Peggy. Appellant and his sisters then placed Waters in his truck and returned to the bar. Waters was found unconscious in his truck the following morning and subsequently died as a result of his injuries and over-exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Several days after the attack, appellant was picked up and transported to the Pocomoke City police station for questioning. He made a statement to Trooper D. Bruce Hornung which Hornung transcribed in longhand while appellant was speaking. At a pretrial hearing the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress this statement, and at trial Trooper Hornung related it from his notes. Hornung testified that his notes reflected the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">In my notes taken on February the 12th I have got full name of Larry Randolph [sic] Marshall. His full description. And I go on that Larry, Barbara, and Delores \u2014 this is what Mr. Marshall was telling me \u2014 Larry, Barbara, and Delores were in Dickie\u2019s [Bar] after dark. Larry and Barbara went outside and Barbara went down the street to where Harry [Waters] was standing. Then I went down. He said he was going to give her some money. Larry held him from behind and Barbara took his wallet from his pants. She looked in his wallet and took the money out. Then she put his wallet back. We were walking back to the place and he was saying he was going to cut me. That\u2019s when I hit him and he slipped down. When I hit him \u2014 and in the margin I have got left side of face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">What Mr. Marshall did, when he was talking to me, was indicate that he had used his right hand in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>swinging motion, like this, and struck Mr. Waters on the left side of his face (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">When I hit him Barbara and Delores were there. Then Denise and Peggy came around the corner. Larry and Barbara and Delores carried him to his truck and Denise carried his hat. Put him in passenger side and put his key in pants pockets. Locked up truck and left. Sister said where vehicle was parked. Larry got $5.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">On direct examination at trial, appellant\u2019s testimony concerning his participation in the robbery was similar to the statement related by Trooper Hornung, except for a few details. On cross-examination, when appellant was questioned concerning his oral statement, he indicated that Trooper Hornung had attributed words to him which he had not said and, when asked to be specific, Marshall stated he could not remeber, but that there was something in there he had not said. When counsel began asking appellant on a line-by-line basis whether appellant had made the statements reflected in Hornung\u2019s notes, appellant answered the first two questions, regarding his initial departure from Dickie\u2019s Bar, in the negative. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">THE COURT: Just a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">MR. GROTON [Defense Counsel]: May I approach the bench, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">Madam Foreman, and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, will you retire to your room momentarily? (Whereupon, the jury retired from the courtroom and the following proceedings ensued out of their hearing and presence:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">MR. MOORE [State\u2019s Attorney]: Your Honor \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">THE COURT: Just a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-13\">MR. MOORE: I would like to make a proffer before you say \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-14\">THE COURT: No, just a minute. Unless you don\u2019t want me to tell him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>MR. MOORE: I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">THE COURT: Now, Mr. Marshall, you are under oath. If you fail to tell the truth, you can be charged with perjury. You took the witness stand in front of me the 13th of November.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">THE COURT: With regard to the statement which you had given Trooper Hornung.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">Now, during the course of that hearing you testified that you told him what had happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">THE WITNESS: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">THE COURT: And I asked you if you told him the truth, and you said you did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">Now, this was after Trooper Hornung had testified precisely as he did in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-13\">Now, you are trying now to testify differently from what you said on November the 13th, and I\u2019ll issue a bench warrant charging you with perjury if you persist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-14\">All right, what do you want to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-15\">MR. MOORE: Would you advise him of the penalties of perjury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-16\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t even remember, but you are disenfranchised for the rest of your life.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-17\">Now, ordinarily counsel cannot discuss the case with their client when the client is on cross-examination during a recess, but it\u2019s up to you, Mr. Moore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-18\">Do you care if Mr. Groton talks to his client during the recess?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-19\">MR. MOORE: I wish he would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-20\">THE COURT: Yes. All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>When cross-examination resumed appellant testified that Hornung\u2019s notes in fact accurately reflected the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals appellant argued that the admonitions of the trial judge, which resulted in the change in defendant\u2019s testimony when the examination resumed, constituted error. The court rejected appellant\u2019s contention that-the warnings were such as to deny him the right to present his defense and thus violated due process of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">First, it is apparent, upon a comparison of Marshall\u2019s testimony with the unsigned statement related at trial by Trooper Hornung, that there was some discrepancy in the details. Whereas Hornung\u2019s notes reflected that Marshall had left the bar and walked over to where the victim was standing, Marshall testified that they had left the bar together, and that Marshall had walked down the street right behind him. At no point, either at trial or at the suppression hearing, had Marshall testified that Hornung\u2019s notes accurately reflected the statement Marshall had given him. Merely, he had said, as the trial judge recalled correctly, that Marshall had \"told him what happened.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, there was no indication that Marshall was giving or was about to give testimony inconsistent with the substance of his own sworn statements, or that he was knowingly about to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The real crux of the problem, however, lies in the admonition itself. Although this Court has never addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the problems which may arise when the trial court takes it upon itself to warn a witness or the defendant in a criminal case about the consequences of failing to testify truthfully, we find little difficulty in observing that whenever a court does so, it is swimming in treacherous waters. Preliminarily, as noted by the Supreme Court in <em>Webb v. Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95, 97, 93 S. Ct. 351, 34 L. Ed. 2d 330 (1972) <em>(per curiam), </em>citing <em>United States v. Winter, </em>348 F.2d 204, 210 (2nd Cir. 1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">Once a witness swears to give truthful answers, there is no requirement to \"warn him not to commit perjury or, conversely, to direct him to tell the truth.\u201d It would render the sanctity of the oath quite meaningless to require admonition to adhere to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>found no difficulty in holding that a trial court\u2019s admonition to a defense witness to refrain from lying, coupled with threats of dire consequences if the witness did lie, effectively drove that witness off the stand and deprived the defendant of his right to present a defense. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">The trial judge gratuitously singled out this one witness for a lengthy admonition on the dangers of perjury. But the judge did not stop at warning the witness of his right to refuse to testify and of the necessity to tell the truth. Instead, the judge implied that he expected Mills to lie, and went on to assure him that if he lied, he would be prosecuted and probably convicted for perjury, that the sentence for that conviction would be added on to his present sentence, and that the result would be to impair his chances for parole. At least some of these threats may have been beyond the power of this judge to carry out. Yet, in light of the great disparity between the posture of the presiding judge and that of a witness in these circumstances, the unnecessarily strong terms used by the judge could well have exerted such duress on the witness\u2019 mind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>as to preclude him from making a free and voluntary choice whether or not to testify. [409 U.S. at 97-98].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The State argues, and the Court of Special Appeals agreed, that <em>Webb </em>is distinguishable from the instant case. As reasoned by the court below,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">[i]n the case at bar, the court cautioned the appellant only after he had begun to give testimony on cross-examination which was inconsistent with that which he had given on direct. Unlike the trial court in <em>Webb, </em>the court below did not expect the witness to lie. The court acted only after it appeared that the witness had in fact lied: unlike the <em>Webb </em>court, whose apparent purpose was to intimidate and to prevent the witness from testifying, the court below acted only to insure that the witness testified truthfully. [46 Md. App. at. 701].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">We cannot agree. In the instant case an examination of the relevant testimony leads to but one conclusion, that the trial court <em>did </em>expect the defendant to lie, once he had related that there was something incorrect in Trooper Hornung\u2019s notes. At that point the defendant had not contradicted himself. The trial judge thus effectively conveyed to Marshall that if he were to testify in a manner contrary to Trooper Hornung\u2019s rather cryptic notes, he would be punished. We are faced, therefore, with a situation far different from cases such as <em>United States v. Nunn, </em>525 F.2d 958 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Brantley v. State, </em>335 So. 2d 189 (Ala. App. 1976); and <em>People v. Davis, </em>88 Ill. App. 3d 265, 43 Ill. Dec. 533, 410 N.E.2d 533 (1980), in which the warnings given were mild or neutral, and in all of which the witness had plainly contradicted a prior statement he had made under oath. <em>Cf. Dearing v. State, </em>71 Ind. Dec. 211, 393 N.E.2d 167 (Ind. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The instant case, however, presents a problem even greater than that described in <em>Webb. </em>Not only are we concerned with the defendant himself, as opposed to some other witness, but we are also concerned with an admonition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>which caused the defendant to testify in a certain way, out of fear that if he did not, he would suffer some severe, but unexplained consequence. In <em>Commonwealth v. Laws, </em>474 Pa. 318, 378 A.2d 812 (1977), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reversed an appellant\u2019s convictions because the trial judge\u2019s admonitions, rather than simply conveying to the witness that he should tell the truth, directed him into adopting his previous testimony at the preliminary hearing. \"The need to maintain impartiality,\u201d the court explained, \"demands that the court exercise its authority with care, and refrain from questioning which may pressure a witness to testify in a particular way.\u201d 378 A.2d at 816. The appellant\u2019s conviction was reversed even though it was plain that the witness was attempting to recant statements he had made under oath at the preliminary hearings. See <em>Reese v. State, </em>382 So. 2d 141 (Fla. App. 1980); <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>State, </em>120 Tex. Crim. 158, 46 S.W.2d 314 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In sum, while we agree with the court below that a judge presiding over a jury trial has the right to interrogate witnesses in an effort to clarify the issues, we stress that he should exercise this right sparingly. It is a far more prudent practice for the judge to allow counsel to clear up disputed points on cross-examination, unassisted by the court. In this manner, the judge is most likely to preserve his role as an impartial arbiter, because he avoids the appearance of acting as an advocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Reasons abound for the trial court to proceed with extreme care when warning a witness about the penalties of peijury. First, it is the jury\u2019s function to assess the credibility of the witnesses and determine the facts from the evidence presented. When the judge unnecessarily warns a witness of the consequences of perjury, he may unwittingly change the course of the witness\u2019 testimony so that it jibes with the court\u2019s concept of what is true or is persuasive, or he may discourage the witness from testifying at all. Such a result infringes upon the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights to confront the witness against him and to present witnesses in his own defense. <em>See, e.g., Webb v. Texas, supra; State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>Rhodes, </em>290 N.C. 16, 24 S.E.2d 631, 638 (1976); <em>Commonwealth v. Laws, supra, </em>378 A.2d at 851-56. Second, the defendant is entitled to present and conduct his defense unhampered by the judge\u2019s idea of what that defense is or how it should be presented. Third, the defendant\u2019s right to competent representation during the course of the trial should remain untrammeled. Peijury warnings may intimidate defense counsel as well as the defendant himself, thereby discouraging counsel from eliciting essential testimony from the witness. <em>E.g., State v. Rhodes, supra. </em>Last, and perhaps most fundamental, a defendant in every case, whether it is a jury trial or not, is entitled to an impartial judge. A defendant is plainly denied this right when the judge\u2019s participation in the trial stifles the defendant\u2019s ability to freely present all of.the competent evidence available.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In the instant case, we hold that the admonitions of the trial judge unnecessarily affected the remainder of the appellant\u2019s testimony and thereby infringed upon his right to present a defense and to have the jury perform its function in resolving inconsistencies between the statement as recorded by Trooper Hornung and the defendant\u2019s own testimony at trial. The trial judge abused his discretion and the defendant\u2019s conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals reversed; case remanded to that court for reversal of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Worcester County and remand to that court for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Worcester County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-10\">. Because of the disposition we make in this case, it is unnecessary for us to address a second issue raised by appellant, namely, that it was error for the trial court to invoke a sequestration order to prevent a person from testifying on appellant\u2019s behalf where she was not a prospective witness when the order was issued and defense counsel became aware that she had relevant information only late in the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b231-21\">. It is possible that the appellant had no understanding of what this punishment would entail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\">. At the motion to suppress hearing, appellant had admitted that he made a statement to Trooper Hornung. The transcript of that proceeding thereafter reflects the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">Q. [MR. GROTON, DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What did you say at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">A. [APPELLANT]: I had told him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">Q. Is that the time that you made your statement to him that he testified to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">A. It\u2019s the time that I \u2014 when I testified to him is when he said, \"one way or the other I\u2019ll get it from you.\u201d That is when I told him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-14\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-15\">THE COURT: Is what you told him the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-16\">THE WITNESS: I told him what happened.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b236-8\">\n<em>Smith, J.,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AWR\">\n<em>dissenting:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The majority opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">\"In the instant case an examination of the relevant testimony leads to but one conclusion, that the trial court <em>did </em>expect the defendant to lie, once he had related that there was something incorrect in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Trooper Homung\u2019s notes. At that point the defendant had not contradicted himself.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">I see the matter somewhat differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The record relative to Trooper Hornung\u2019s testimony concerning the statement is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\"A. In reading them, when I take notes to this effect, I sometimes use first person and sometimes use the third person so that I know when I go back to them later what I am talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">In my notes on February the 12th I have got full name of Larry Randolph Marshall.

Larry held him from behind and Barbara took his wallet from his pants. She looked in his wallet and took the money out. Then she put his wallet back.

Now, what did Barbara do with the wallet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-28\">\"A. Like, she give it back to him because he said, told Barbara that for her give his wallet back to him. All he wanted was his wallet with his license in it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The transcript reflects that Marshall said Waters told Barbara to give him his wallet and that she could keep the $20.00, and that the wallet then was returned. Then the record shows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">\"Q. What happened next then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">\"A. Well, we started walking back up towards Dickie\u2019s Bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">\"Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">And when you say, 'we,\u2019 who is we?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">\"A. Me, Barbara, and Delores and Harry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">\"Q. What were the positioning again as you were walking back to Dickie\u2019s?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">\"A. Like me and Harry, we was walking in front of Barbara and Delores, and they were in back of us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">\"Q. You were side-by-side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">\"A. Well, \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">\"Q. With Harry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-15\">\"A. Yeah, you could say that we were side-by-side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-16\">\"Q. Was he saying anything to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-17\">\"A. Yes, before we had got up to the bar he told me again, he said, 'Boy, what you following me for.\u2019 Like that. He said, 'You better get somewhere before I cut you.\u2019 Like that. And he reached in his pocket. That is when I hit him on the left side of his face under his chin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-19\">\"Q. Okay. What hand did you hit him with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-20\">\"A. With my right hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-21\">\"Q. Did you hit him on the left side of the face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-22\">\"A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-23\">\"Q. And what happened at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-24\">\"A. Well, at that point he had slipped down and fell and he hit his head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-25\">And, like, after that, Peggy and ... no, after that Peggy had come up on the corner and we went over there where she was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\"Q. And what happened at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">\"A. And like she asked Barbara what was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">\"Q. And did Barbara say anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">\"A. Barbara told her that Harry Waters say he was going to cut me and I hit him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">\"Q. Okay. Now, at this point you were up on the corner of what street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">\"A. Clarke Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">\"Q. Clarke Avenue. And what was the other street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">\"A. Maple.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">\"Q. Maple. Where was Harry Waters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">\"A. He was laying down on the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">\"Q. And how far from him were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">\"A. Oh, about ten yards or ten feet, something like that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">The transcript then refers to the fact that Delores got a glass of water which she poured on Waters\u2019 face, that he appeared to have been \"unconscious for a few minutes,\u201d and after this he moved. The record then states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-17\">\"Q. And what happened at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-18\">\"A. And at that point Peggy said, 'Why don\u2019t you all take Mr. Harry Waters to his truck.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-19\">\"Q. Did you do anything at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-20\">\"A. Yes, I helped him up. Me and my sister, my sister, Barbara and Delores, and we were taking him to his truck, and before, as we were going through that little alleyway he said, he asked us where were we taking him, and we told him we were taking him to his truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-21\">\"Q. Did you take him to the truck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-22\">\"A. Yes, we did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-23\">\"Q. What did you do when you got there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-24\">\"A. Like, I went to the passenger side and tried to open the door but I guess it was locked. So I went around to the passenger side and that door was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>locked. So, then, I come back, I come back around where him and my sister was, around to the passenger side, and I took his keys out of his pocket and I went to the driver\u2019s side and got in that door, because I tried to open the passenger side but that door wouldn\u2019t open. So I got in and went around to the driver\u2019s side. I slid across his seat and opened the passenger side of the door from the inside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">\"Q. Okay. And what did you do at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">\"A. And at that point me and my sister, Barbara and Delores, we put Harry Waters in his truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">\"Q. How did you put him in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">\"A. Well, Delores and Barbara put his legs in and I held him by his shoulders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">\"Q. Okay. Now, did you put him on the seat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">\"A. Yes, we did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">\"Q. How was he positioned on the seat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\">\"A. He was sitting up just like I am now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-13\">\"Q. Was he moving?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-14\">\"A. Yes, he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-15\">\"Q. Did he say anything to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-16\">\"A. He asked us where was he and I told him we had put him in his truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-17\">\"Q. Did he say anything after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-18\">\"A. No, he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-19\">\"Q. What did he do at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-20\">\"A. At that point I locked the passenger side door and then we left, after Denise put his hat in the truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-21\">\"Q. All right. You locked the passenger side of the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-22\">\"A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-23\">\"Q. Did you lock the driver\u2019s side of the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-24\">\"A. Well, when I went to the driver\u2019s side of the door, I opened it. And as soon as I opened it I got in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>his truck and I just slid across his seat. No, I am quite sure that I didn\u2019t lock the door.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">It thus will be seen that out of the lips of Marshall on his own direct examination came virtually the same words which were contained in Trooper Hornung\u2019s notes. On cross-examination, much the same information was developed. The prosecutor on cross-examination brought out the fact that although Marshall said he grabbed the victim because of his fear of being cut, he let him go after about seven seconds without leaving the scene. This prompted a question as to whether Marshall \"expect[ed] anybody to believe what [he] ha[d] just said.\u201d The prosecutor then developed that although everything was removed from Waters\u2019 pockets and Marshall himself went into the pockets after keys to the pickup, Marshall at no time saw any knife. Then that which provoked the admonition of the trial judge appears as follows on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\"Q. ... Now, you remember Trooper Hornung, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\"A. Yes, I remember him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">\"Q. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">Now, you gave him a statement, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">\"A. Yes, I told him a few words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">\"Q. Beg your pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">\"A. Yes, I told him some words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-13\">\"Q. You told him what he said to the jury you told him, isn\u2019t that right? \"A. I <em>told him part of it. I didn\u2019t tell him all of it. </em>[(Emphasis added.)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-15\">\"Q. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-16\">Now, so Trooper Hornung was not being truthful to the jury when he was testifying, is that correct? Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-18\">\"A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-19\">\"Q. That is correct, Trooper Hornung was lying to the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\"A. Well, he could have been and he couldn\u2019t have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\"Q. Larry, don\u2019t \u2014 look, son, \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\"A. He had told me when he got up there, he said he was going to tell me what Barbara and Delores told him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\"Q. Okay. And then you told him what he wrote down on that page, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\"A. Not some of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">\"Q. What didn\u2019t you tell him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">\"A. I can\u2019t remember, but it\u2019s something in there that I didn\u2019t tell him, I know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">\"Q. What did you tell him then? Do you remember what you did tell him as opposed to what you didn\u2019t tell him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">Let me ask you specifically. Did you say to Trooper Hornung that you and Barbara went outside and Barbara went down the street to where Mr. Waters was standing? Did you tell him that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-13\">\"A. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-14\">\"Q. Did you tell him that you followed her down the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-15\">\"A. Told him what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-16\">\"Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-17\">\"A. No, I did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-18\">I think the trial judge did not <em>\"expect </em>the defendant to lie, once he had related that there was something incorrect in Trooper Hornung\u2019s notes\u201d; he knew the defendant had lied. (Emphasis added.) Under that circumstance, I think the admonition was entirely proper. When the witness returned to the stand after the admonition and testified, \"Well, when I realized, and think about it, I think what is on that piece of paper is what I told him,\u201d he was merely confirming that which he himself had already said on direct and cross-examination. It is apparent that he realized the difficulty he was in because he said he had grabbed Waters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>because of a threat by Waters to cut him but he had been obliged to admit that he saw no signs of a knife. It was then that he attempted to challenge the statement as taken down by Trooper Hornung.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">I think Judge Thompson was absolutely right when he said for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Marshall v. State, </em>46 Md. App. 695, 420 A.2d 1266 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\"We find the instant case and <em>Webb </em>[v. <em>Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95, 93 S. Ct. 351, 34 L. Ed. 2d 330 (1972),] to be in no way analogous. In <em>Webb, </em>the trial court delivered its admonition before the witness had begun to testify; as the Supreme Court stated: '[T]he judge implied that he expected [the witness] to lie....\u2019 <em>Id. </em>409 U.S. at 97. In the case at bar, the court cautioned the appellant only after he had begun to give testimony on cross examination which was inconsistent with that which he had given on direct. Unlike the trial court in <em>Webb, </em>the court below did not expect the witness to lie. The court acted only after it appeared that the witness had in fact lied: unlike the <em>Webb </em>court, whose apparent purpose was to intimidate and to prevent the witness from testifying, the court below acted only to insure that the witness testified truthfully.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 701.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Hence, I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Chief Judge Murphy and Judge Rodowsky authorize me to say that they concur in the views here expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
