J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AV0\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">We deal here in a single opinion with three separate but related appeals involving the revocation of Dr. Irving Stillman\u2019s license to practice medicine by the Commission on Medical Discipline (the Commission), a governmental agency established pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1980 Repl. Vol.) Art. 43, \u00a7 130, as a part of the State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Number 113 presents the question whether an order of the Baltimore City Court staying the Commission\u2019s revocation of Dr. Stillman\u2019s license pending judicial review is appealable and, if so, whether the stay order violated the provisions of Art. 43, \u00a7 130 (m), the separation of powers and due process provisions of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, or the due process clause Qf the fourteenth amendment to the federal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>stitution. Primarily at issue in No. 18 (two appeals in one record) is whether Art. 43, \u00a7 130 (a), which provides for appointment of the membership of the Commission, violates state and federal constitutional provisions respecting the delegation of governmental authority to a private organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The Commission is authorized by Art. 43, \u00a7 130 to investigate complaints of unprofessional conduct on the part of Maryland physicians. Under \u00a7 130 (b), the Commission is empowered to promulgate rules and regulations \"for the proper supervision and control of the professional conduct of all persons under its jurisdiction ....\u201d Under \u00a7 130 (g), the Commission is enjoined to refer complaints of unprofessional conduct to \"the appropriate local county [medical] society or committee of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of the State of Maryland, for investigation and report.\u201d The subsection requires that the report \"contain recommendations the investigation reveals may be necessary for adequate disciplinary procedures.\u201d Section 130 (j) provides for hearing before the Commission of charges of unprofessional conduct entered against a physician. Section 130 (h) enumerates with specificity the types of \"unprofessional conduct\u201d with which a physician may be charged, and authorizes the Commission to either dismiss the charges, issue a reprimand, place the physician on probation, or revoke or suspend his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">At the time of the proceedings in this case, \u00a7 130 (a) delineated the membership of the Commission as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">The president of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">Two practicing physicians appointed by the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene, selected from a list submitted by the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of the State of Maryland, such list, having been composed from a list of nominees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>submitted by component societies of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty and two other licensed practicing physicians of the State of Maryland appointed by the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">Three members of the Board of Medical Examiners to be selected by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">The chairman of the council of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of the State of Maryland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The Medical and Chirurgical Faculty is a private, voluntary membership organization constituting, in effect, the State Medical Society.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The Commission initiated its investigation of Dr. Stillman\u2019s professional conduct as a result of newspaper accounts of his arrest on charges of committing a sexual offense involving a female patient. Although Stillman was acquitted of the charges after a jury trial, the Commission, pursuant to \u00a7 130 (g), directed the Peer Review Committee of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty (the State Medical Society) to investigate Stillman\u2019s professional conduct. On November 27, 1978, the committee filed its report with the Commission, indicating that Stillman was professionally incompetent in a number of designated particulars. On September 5, 1979, the Commission charged Stillman with professional incompetence and scheduled a hearing to consider the charges. Prior to the hearing, Stillman, on February 11,1980, filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, seeking to enjoin the Commission from holding the hearing and to obtain a declaration that the Commission could not constitutionally proceed with the hearing. It was Stillman\u2019s primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>contention that Art. 43, \u00a7 130 (a) was unconstitutional because it constituted an impermissible delegation to the State Medical Society, a private, non-governmental body, of the power to make appointments to the Commission. The court (Kaplan, Jj, finding no merit in the contention, declined to enjoin the scheduled hearing, and declared that \u00a7 130 (a) was in all respects constitutional. Stillman appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari (No. 18) prior to decision by that court to consider the important issues raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The hearing on the disciplinary charges against Stillman was concluded on April 29,1980. The Commission thereafter issued an order dated May 20, 1980 revoking Stillman\u2019s medical license for professional incompetence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s order provided that the revocation would be effective on June 20, 1980 in order to afford time for Dr. Stillman to transfer his patients to the care of another physician. The order also provided that if Stillman entered a Commission-approved training program, the license revocation would be stayed and he would be placed on conditional probation. Stillman appealed to the Baltimore City Court and filed a motion to stay the Commission\u2019s order. Over the Commission\u2019s objection, the court (Karwacki, J.) stayed the order revoking Stillman\u2019s license pending judicial review by the Baltimore City Court. The Commission appealed to the Court of Special Appeals but that court, on September 2, 1980, dismissed the appeal on the ground that it was not taken from an appealable final judgment. We granted the Commission\u2019s petition for certiorari to review the intermediate appellate court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal (No. 113).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">On February 10, 1981, the Baltimore City Court (Perrott, J.) affirmed the Commission\u2019s order revoking Stillman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>license. Stillman appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari (No. 18) and consolidated all three cases for briefing and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The Commission contends that Judge Karwacki\u2019s order staying the revocation of Dr. Stillman\u2019s license in effect enjoined its judgment and therefore constituted an appealable interlocutory order under Maryland Code (1974, 1980 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-303 (c) (1) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. That section provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that a party may appeal an order \"granting ... an injunction ....\u201d We agree with the Commission. Where, as here, the Court restrains the action of an executive branch agency revoking the license of a physician, the order in effect permits the physician to continue to practice his profession and constitutes an order in the nature of an injunction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Laje v. R. E. Thomason Gen. Hospital, </em>564 F.2d 1159 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 905 (1978); <em>Cahokia Sportservice, Inc. v. Illinois Liq. Con. Comm\u2019n, </em>32 Ill. App. 3d 801, 336 N.E.2d 276 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Contrary to the conclusion reached by the Baltimore City Court, \u00a7 130 (m) plainly precludes a court from staying a Commission order revoking or suspending a medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>license.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The section provides that where judicial review of such an order is sought,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\">\"the revocation or the period of suspension shall not be stayed and shall be effective or commence to run immediately, except this shall not apply to any decision made prior to July 1, 1974, in which case the revocation or suspension shall be stayed until final judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">As a matter of statutory construction, therefore, the Baltimore City Court erred in interpreting \u00a7 130 (m) to permit a stay of the Commission\u2019s order revoking Stillman\u2019s license.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Stillman argues that the legislative prohibition contained in \u00a7 130 (m) against judicial stays of Commission orders revoking medical licenses violates the separation of powers provision contained in Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. That article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">\"That the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>In <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 689, 426 A.2d 929, 933 (1981), we said that Article 8</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">\"has been consistently interpreted from its inception</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">to parcel out and separate the powers of government, and to confide particular classes of them to particular branches of the supreme authority. That is to say, such of them as are judicial in their character to the judiciary; such as are legislative to the legislative, and such as are executive in their nature to the executive. Within the particular limits assigned to each, they are supreme and uncontrollable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">(Quoting <em>Wright v. Wright, </em>2 Md. 429, 452 (1852)). The judicial branch of government in this State possesses those powers expressly reserved to it by the Maryland Constitution and Declaration of Rights. In addition, the judiciary has certain implied or inherent powers under the Maryland Constitution. The breadth of these powers was described by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in <em>State v. Cannon, </em>196 Wis. 534, 221 N.W. 603, 603-604 (1928), quoted with approval in <em>Waldron:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">\"In order to accomplish the purposes for which they are created, courts must also possess powers. From time immemorial, certain powers have been conceded to courts, because they are courts. Such powers have been conceded, because without them they could neither maintain their dignity, transact their business, nor accomplish the purposes of their existence. These powers are called inherent powers. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">'The inherent power of the court is the power to protect itself; the power to administer justice ...; the power to promulgate rules for its practice; and the power to provide process where none exists. It is true that the judicial power of this court was created by the Constitution, but, upon coming into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>being under the Constitution, this court came into being with inherent powers.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">(Quoting <em>In re Bruen, </em>102 Wash. 472, 172 P. 1152 (1918)).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Along similar lines, the Supreme Court of Minnesota, in <em>Clerk of Court\u2019s Compensation for Lyon County v. Lyon County Commissioners, </em>308 Minn. 172, 241 N.W.2d 781 (1976), said that inherent judicial power</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\"grows out of express and implied constitutional provisions mandating a separation of powers and a viable judicial branch of government. It comprehends all authority necessary to preserve and improve the fundamental judicial function of deciding cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\"The test to be applied in these cases is whether the relief requested by the court or aggrieved party is necessary to the performance of the judicial function as contemplated in our state constitution. <em>The test is not relative needs or judicial wants, but practical necessity in performing the judicial function. The test must be applied with due consideration for equally important executive and legislative functions.\u201d Id. </em>at 786 (footnote omitted; emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">The inherent power at issue in the present case is the power to administer justice. A corollary of this power is a court\u2019s inherent power to review administrative actions for arbitrariness, illegality, capriciousness, or unreasonableness. The separation of powers doctrine mandates that the legislature may not divest the judiciary of these inherent powers. See <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, supra; Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 331 A.2d 55 (1975); <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 45 A.2d 73 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Stillman advances two distinct separation of powers arguments. First, he contends that the power to issue a stay is itself an inherent power of the judiciary that may not be circumscribed by the legislature. Second, he argues that the inability to issue a stay pending judicial review divests the judicial branch of its inherent authority to review administrative actions for arbitrariness, illegality, capriciousness and unreasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The power to issue a stay is not an inherent judicial power in the sense that it may never be limited or denied by legislative enactment. A stay is simply a tool that a court may use in the proper exercise of its authority. The power to stay administrative action is only inherent in the sense that it is a traditional power that equity courts could utilize without express statutory authorization. <em>See Fooks\u2019 Executors v. Ghingher, </em>172 Md. 612, 192 A. 782, <em>cert. denied, </em>302 U.S. 726, 58 S. Ct. 47, 82 L. Ed. 561 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">By enacting \u00a7 130 (m), the legislature limited the jurisdiction of the courts by prohibiting stays of Commission orders revoking medical licenses. <em>See </em>Md. Const. Art. IV, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This exercise of legislative authority did not of itself violate the separation of powers doctrine because the power to stay administrative action pending judicial review is not an essential power inherent in the courts in the discharge of their constitutionally mandated duty to administer justice. Stillman\u2019s separation of powers argument, therefore, must rise or fall on his contention that the prohibition on stays impermissibly precludes the courts from subjecting administrative action to judicial review for arbitrariness, illegality, capriciousness or unreasonableness \u2014 a recognized inherent judicial power.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>In <em>Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd. v. Gould, supra, </em>we reviewed a statutory scheme providing for awards of monetary compensation by an administrative agency to victims of crime. The statute provided that only the Attorney General (and not the claimant) could seek judicial review of a decision rendered by the agency. We held that this statutory provision was constitutional, concluding that although a claimant had no right to judicial review under the statute, the legislature had not intended to preclude the judiciary from exercising its inherent power to review administrative action alleged to have been arbitrary, illegal, capricious or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In <em>St. Dept. of A. &amp; Tax. v. Clark, </em>281 Md. 385, 380 A.2d 28 (1978), taxpayers sought judicial review of their real property assessment under Maryland Code (1957, 1975 Repl. Vol.), Art. 81, \u00a7 67, which permitted designated officials to decrease or abate an assessment after the date of finality in order to correct an error or to prevent injustice. The remedy under \u00a7 67 could be invoked by a taxpayer whether or not the assessment had been appealed in accordance with the regular statutory procedure for challenging an assessment\u2019s validity. The taxpayers successfully argued before the lower court that notwithstanding the absence of express statutory authority to appeal from the \u00a7 67 determination, the court nevertheless had jurisdiction to review it under its inherent power to review administrative action for arbitrariness, illegality, capriciousness, or unreasonableness. We reversed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\"The key to the right of a court to utilize inherent powers to prevent illegal, unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious administrative action is that 'the legislature has not expressly provided for judicial review.\u2019 If reasonable judicial review has been provided there is no <em>'untrammelled </em>right arbitrarily to grant or withhold that which is derived from the people.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\"... The plain teaching of <em>Gould </em>is that the inherent power of a court to review an administrative agency\u2019s determination is not unbridled. It may not be utilized when the statutory right of judicial review is available. That right did not exist under the Criminal Injury Compensation Act applicable in <em>Gould, </em>and, in fact, was expressly precluded. It was fully available under the applicable statute in the instant case. Section 67 cannot be isolated from the other provisions of Art. 81. It must be considered in the light of those sections which provide, as of right, review of the determination of each successive administrative agency, step by step, under administrative procedures, and then review by the courts of the final assessing authority\u2019s action. Under such a comprehensive scheme, we see no infirmity in the absence of judicial review of the potential extraordinary relief held out by \u00a7 67. That relief... is a matter of grace. When a taxpayer permits an assessment to become final, he can only hope that he may obtain relief under \u00a7 67. If relief is denied him or if the relief granted does not meet his expectations, he is entitled to nothing further at that time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 402, 380 A.2d at 37, 38.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Stillman argues that a court cannot effectively exercise its inherent power to review administrative action unless it can stay the agency\u2019s determination pending judicial review. This argument, however, overlooks our holding in <em>Clark. </em>A final decision of the Commission is subject to judicial review, Art. 43, \u00a7 130 (p), in accord with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See Comm\u2019n on Med. Discipline v. Bendler, </em>280 Md. 326, 373 A.2d 1232 (1977); Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (a). All actions taken by the Commission, if appealed, are therefore expressly subject to judicial review, and the Commission\u2019s decision is subject to reversal or modification under Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (f). <em>Clark </em>held that when reasonable judicial review is provided for by statute, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>statutory method of review is exclusive and a court may not exercise its inherent powers to review administrative agency determinations. Similarly, we now hold that because reasonable judicial review of Commission decisions is provided for by statute, the \u00a7 130 (m) prohibition on stays pending judicial review does not encroach upon the judiciary\u2019s inherent power to review administrative action for arbitrariness, illegality, capriciousness and unreasonableness. <em>See Scripps-Howard Radio v. Federal Communications Comm\u2019n, </em>316 U.S. 4, 62 S. Ct. 875, 86 L. Ed. 1229 (1942) (implicitly recognizing that Congress could prohibit stays of administrative action pending judicial review); <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Circuit Court, </em>231 Ind. 173, 108 N.E. 2d 58 (1952) (court had no jurisdiction to stay revocation of driver\u2019s license pending judicial review when statute prohibited stays); <em>Yacht Club Catering v. Bruckman, </em>276 N.Y. 44, 11 N.E.2d 345 (1937) (recognizing legislature\u2019s power to limit stay of agency\u2019s revocation of liquor license pending judicial review). We thus conclude that \u00a7 130 (m) does not violate the separation of powers doctrine contained in Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Stillman also attacks \u00a7 130 (m) on due process grounds, arguing that the prohibition on stays pending judicial review violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The right to practice medicine is a property right of which a physician cannot be deprived without due process of law. <em>Aitchison v. State, </em>204 Md. 538, 105 A.2d 495, <em>cert. denied, </em>348 U.S. 880, 75 S. Ct. 116, 99 L. Ed. 692 (1954). In that case, however, we noted that the right is subject to the paramount police power of the state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">\"[N]o person has an absolute vested right to practice medicine, but only a conditional right which is subordinate to the police power of the State to protect and preserve the public health. <em>Reetz v. People of State of Michigan, </em>188 U. S. 505, 23 S. Ct. 390, 47 L. Ed. 563. The State, in the performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>its duty to protect and preserve the public health, has the power, within constitutional limitations, to regulate the practice of medicine by those engaged therein. This regulatory power is justified by the fact that the practice of medicine requires special knowledge, training, skill and care, that health and life are committed to the physician\u2019s care, and that patients ordinarily lack the knowledge and ability to judge his qualifications.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 544, 105 A.2d at 498.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In <em>Flynn v. Board of Registration in </em>Optometry, 320 Mass. 29, 67 N.E.2d 846 (1945), an optometrist whose license had been suspended by the Board of Registration argued that he had been denied due process of law because the applicable statute, which covered disciplinary actions against physicians as well as optometrists, prohibited courts from staying the Board\u2019s orders pending judicial review. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts found no merit in the contention, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">\"We cannot say that it is a deprivation of fundamental rights if the right to a stay is withheld during the interval of time between a decision of the board and the entry of a decree of the court in the event a review is sought. We reach this conclusion the more readily because of the many safeguards in the statute ensuring an adequate hearing in the first instance before the board. The Legislature may have thought that the professions and callings to which this statute was applicable were such that the public health, safety, and welfare might be protected better if a stay were forbidden.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 34, 67 N.E.2d at 849-50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\"><em>Accord, State v. State Board of Medical Examiners, </em>68 Nev. 455, 235 P.2d 327 (1951) (statute prohibiting stay of agency action revoking a physician\u2019s license did not violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>In Maryland, due process challenges to legislative enactments are to be evaluated under the following standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">\"The test for constitutionality under the Due Process Clause is whether a statute, as an exercise of the state\u2019s police power, bears a real and substantial relation to the public health, morals, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state.... The exercise by the Legislature of the police power will not be interfered with unless it is shown to be exercised arbitrarily, oppressively or unreasonably. . . . The wisdom or expediency of a law adopted in the exercise of the police power of a state is not subject to judicial review, and the law will not be held void if there are any considerations relating to the public welfare by which it can be supported.... Such a statute carries with it a strong presumption of constitutionality....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alh\"><em>Bowie Inn v. City of Bowie, </em>274 Md. 230, 236, 335 A.2d 679, 683 (1975) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Stillman, in order to overcome the presumption that \u00a7 130 (m) is constitutional, must demonstrate that the prohibition on stays pending judicial review does not bear a real and substantial relationship to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">The legislature was undoubtedly aware of two important interests when it enacted \u00a7 130 (m). Physicians whose licenses have been properly suspended or revoked for unprofessional conduct pose a clear threat to the public health. On the other hand, preventing physicians from practicing medicine while awaiting judicial review could have a devastating effect on their ability to resume practice in the event that they prevail on appeal. Section 130 (m) may well have resulted from the legislature\u2019s belief that the negative effect on physicians whose licenses are suspended or revoked improperly was outweighed by the harm that might befall the public if any of the physicians sanctioned by the Commission were permitted to continue practicing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>pending judicial review. Indeed, those physicians who are merely placed on probation or reprimanded are not precluded from obtaining a stay under the statute. Thus, it is only when the potential threat to the public is the greatest that the legislature has seen fit to preclude judicial stays. We think \u00a7 130 (m) does bear a real and substantial relationship to the public health, safety, and welfare of the people of this State and does not constitute a denial of due process, particularly in light of the various statutory safeguards governing Commission proceedings. Consequently, we conclude that the legislature has exercised its police power in a permissible manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">As heretofore indicated, \u00a7 130 (a) expressly provides that the president and the chairman of the council of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty shall be members of the Commission. In addition, the subsection provides that three members of the Board of Medical Examiners \u2014: a board whose members are appointed by the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty (see Art. 43, \u00a7 120) \u2014 shall be appointed to the Commission by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Section 130 (a) further provides that two physicians be appointed to the Commission by the Secretary from a list submitted to him by the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty. Under the statute, therefore, a majority of the Commission membership is composed of physicians who are either officers of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty or whose eligibility for membership oh the Commission is subject to that private organization\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Stillman urges that the statute violates the separation of powers provisions of Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights because it removes \"the Governor\u2019s right to make executive branch appointments,\u201d presumably in contravention of Art. II, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution which vests the \"executive power of the State ... in a Governor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Article II, \u00a7 10 of the Maryland Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">\"[The Governor] shall nominate, and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint all civil and military officers of the State, whose appointment, or election, is not otherwise herein provided for, <em>unless a different mode of appointment be prescribed by the Law creating the office.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">A provision of the Maryland Constitution of 1851 (Art. II, \u00a7 11), identical to Article II, \u00a7 10 of our present constitution, was considered by the Court in <em>Davis v. State, </em>7 Md. 151 (1854), and <em>Baltimore v. State, </em>15 Md. 376 (1860). In <em>Davis, </em>the question was whether, under this constitutional provision, the legislature could provide for appointment to an office created by statute. Concluding that it could, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">\"[W]e think this provision [Art. II, \u00a7 11] means, simply, that the Governor shall have the power to fill all offices in the State, whether created by the Constitution or by Act of Assembly, unless otherwise provided by the one or the other. When, therefore, the legislature has created an office by Act of Assembly, the legislature can designate by whom and in what manner the person who is to fill the office shall be appointed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 161.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">In <em>Baltimore, </em>the Court reconciled the interpretation in <em>Davis </em>with the separation of powers provision contained in the Declaration of Rights. In answer to the contention that the power of appointment was \"an intrinsic executive function,\u201d beyond the legislature\u2019s authority, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">\"[T]he Legislature makes the laws, the Judiciary expounds them, and the Governor sees that they are faithfully executed .... It does not follow, as a necessary conclusion, that, in order to perform this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>duty, [the Governor] must have agents of his own nomination. Our form of government, in its various changes, has never recognized this power as an executive prerogative.\u201d 15 Md. at 456.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The Court in <em>Baltimore </em>said that the Constitution \"so far from treating ... [the appointment power] as an inherent executive power, indicates that it belongs where the people choose to place it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457. Addressing the separation of powers question, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">\"In considering the question as to separation of the departments, we are to bear in mind that the Declaration of Rights is not to be construed by itself, according to its literal meaning; it and the Constitution compose our form of government, and they must be interpreted as one instrument.... The former announces principles on which the government, about to be established, will be based. If they differ, the Constitution must be taken as a limitation or qualification of the general principle previously declared, according to the subject and the language employed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 459 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">In <em>Anderson v. Baker, </em>23 Md. 531 (1865), the Court considered a provision of the Maryland Constitution of 1864 which was also identical to Art. II, \u00a7 10 of our present Constitution. In holding that the legislature could constitutionally provide for appointment to an office created by it, notwithstanding the separation of powers provision of the Declaration of Rights, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asi\">\"The Act in question, creating the office, does prescribe a different mode of appointment. Where the office is of legislative creation, the Legislature can modify, control or abolish it, and within these powers is embraced the right to change the mode of appointment. <em>Davis v. State, </em>7 Md. 161.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">\"As to the supposed conflict between the Constitution of Maryland and the Bill of Rights, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>it is called, such a collision can scarcely occur, according to the accepted theory of the relation between these instruments. In representative constitutional governments, they are understood to be parts of a whole, constituting an entirety, and to be interpreted as one instrument. The Declaration of Rights is an enumeration of abstract principles, (or designed to be so,) and the Constitution the practical application of those principles, modified by the exigencies of the time or circumstances of the country. \"If they differ, the Constitution must be taken as a limitation of the principle previously declared, according to the subject and the language employed.\u2019 <em>Baltimore v. State, </em>15 Md. 459.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\"The Declaration of Rights is a guide to the several departments of government, in questions of doubt as to the meaning of the Constitution, and 'a guard against any extravagant or undue extension of power,\u2019 but does not control the Constitution itself, when it is clear and unambiguous.\u201d 23 Md. at 627-28.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In <em>Scholle v. State, </em>90 Md. 729, 46 A. 326 (1900), the Court interpreted Art. II, \u00a7 10 of the present Maryland Constitution in accordance with the holding in the <em>Davis, Baltimore, </em>and <em>Baker </em>cases. It is thus clear that when the legislature creates an office by statute, as it did in \u00a7 130 (a), the separation of powers provision of Article 8 does not of itself prevent the legislature from placing the power of appointment in the hands of someone other than the Governor. As stated in <em>Scholle, </em>when the legislature has created an office by statute, it \"can designate by whom, and in what manner the person who is to fill the office shall be appointed.\u201d 90 Md. at 743. Relying upon <em>Scholle, </em>the Court in <em>McCurdy v. Jessop, </em>126 Md. 318, 95 A. 37 (1915), upheld a statute requiring the Baltimore County Commissioners to appoint as game warden the candidate nominated by a private hunting and fishing organization. The viability of <em>Scholle </em>was reaffirmed by the Court in <em>Price v. Clawns, </em>180 Md. 532, 25 A.2d 672 (1942). We need not probe the limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>of the <em>Scholle </em>doctrine in this case, for we are satisfied that placing the appointment authority in the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty, a professional organization chartered by the General Assembly of Maryland by ch. 105 of the Acts of 1798, does not offend the separation of powers provision of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Stillman characterizes the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty as \"essentially a privately selected, self-regulating board, largely beyond the meaningful scrutiny of any State agency, including the courts.\u201d He contends that the provisions of \u00a7 130 placing the power to discipline physicians in the hands of this private organization constitute an impermissible delegation of legislative power in violation of the Maryland Constitution and Articles 4 and 6 of the Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">A similar argument was before the Court in <em>Scholle v. State, </em>90 Md. 729, 46 A.2d 326 (1900). In that case, Scholle was convicted of practicing medicine without having obtained a license from the Board of Medical Examiners. He challenged the constitutionality of the statute regulating the practice of medicine on the ground that it impermissibly authorized a private organization \u2014 the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty \u2014 to appoint all members of the licensing board, thereby unlawfully committing the execution of the statute to a non-governmental body. The Court held that the legislature, in regulating the practice of medicine, was empowered to create a Board of Medical Examiners to test the qualifications of applicants. The Court concluded that no delegation of the legislature\u2019s lawmaking powers was involved in designating the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty as an agent of the State, to perform acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>of a public character in appointing the members of the licensing body.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Stillman contends that <em>Scholle </em>has been implicitly overruled by subsequent decisions invalidating the delegation of legislative power to private interest groups. We do not agree. The rule in Maryland is well established. In the enactment of laws, the legislature acts in the exercise of a power conferred upon it by the people; it cannot validly redelegate its lawmaking authority to others. <em>Board v. Attorney General, </em>246 Md. 417, 229 A.2d 388 (1967); <em>Md. Co-Op. Milk Producers v. Miller, </em>170 Md. 81, 182 A. 432 (1935); <em>Brawner v. Supervisors, </em>141 Md. 586, 595, 119 A. 250 (1922). In examining the validity of a delegation of power from the legislature, we have adopted a standard as set forth, for example, in <em>Gino\u2019s v. Baltimore City, </em>250 Md. 621, 640, 244 A.2d 218 (1968), where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\"When legislative power is <em>delegated </em>to administrative officials it is constitutionally required that adequate guides and standards be established by the delegating legislative body so that the administrative officials, appointed by the executive and not elected by the people, <em>will not legislate, </em>but will find and apply facts in a particular case in accordance with the policy established by the legislative body.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In <em>Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. v. Linchester, </em>274 Md. 211, 218-219, 334 A.2d 514 (1975), the Court, after noting that the legislature may delegate powers, described the proper role of an administrative agency receiving the legislature\u2019s delegated power: \"after being provided with general rules and standards [for guidance],\u201d it has the duty to make factual determinations and apply the standards in specific cases. <em>See also Governor v. Exxon Corp., </em>279 Md. 410, 440, 370 A.2d 1102 (1977), <em>aff'd, </em>437 U.S. 117, 98 S. Ct. 2207, 57 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1978); <em>Sanza v. Md. Board of Censors, </em>245 Md. 319, 334-35, 226 A.2d 317 (1967); Oppenheimer, <em>Administrative Law in Md., </em>2 Md. L. Rev. 185, 199 (1938). Because this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>involves an area of public health, we note that even more flexible standards of control over an administrative agency are permitted than in other areas of legislation. <em>Truitt v. Board of Public Works, </em>243 Md. 375, 387, 221 A.2d 370 (1966); <em>Givner v. Commissioner of Health, </em>207 Md. 184, 191, 113 A.2d 899 (1955), and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Section 130 of Art. 43 clearly provides sufficient standards delineating powers of the Commission so as to constitute a valid delegation of power from the legislature. The statute sets forth at length the composition of the Commission, its powers to discipline physicians for specific acts of misconduct, the procedures to be followed during the investigative process, and the right to appeal from any action taken by the Commission. Although members or designees of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty may constitute a majority of the Commission membership, neither body is free to enact its own legislation governing physicians in Maryland. Thus, \u00a7 130 does not impermissibly delegate the legislature\u2019s lawmaking power to the Commission or to the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Stillman next argues that his right to practice medicine was arbitrarily terminated by the Commission, in violation of both federal and state constitutional due process provisions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by a private, special-interest organization, <em>i.e., </em>the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty which, by its control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>over the Commission membership, he contends, actually controls the disciplining of physicians in Maryland. Stillman suggests that because he is not a member of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty, its members or designees serving on the Commission, were inherently prejudiced against him, and he was thereby deprived of his due process right to a fair and impartial hearing. He relies upon <em>Gibson v. Berryhill, </em>411 U.S. 564, 93 S. Ct. 1689, 36 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">In <em>Gibson, </em>charges of unprofessional conduct were brought before the Alabama Board of Optometry against various optometrists because of their employment with a commercial optometry corporation. Both the organization filing the charges and the Board itself were composed entirely of optometrists in private practice. The trial court found as a fact that the Board intended to revoke the licenses of all optometrists employed by corporations and that this would benefit the private practices of the members of the Board. The Supreme Court, in affirming the trial court\u2019s disqualification of the Board, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">\"It is sufficiently clear from our cases that those with substantial pecuniary interest in legal proceedings should not adjudicate these disputes. . . . The District Court proceeded on this basis and, applying the standards taken from our cases, <em>concluded that the pecuniary interest of the members of the Board of Optometry had sufficient substance to disqualify them, given the context in which this case arose. </em>As remote as we are from the local realities underlying this case and it being very likely that the District Court has a firmer grasp of the facts and of their significance to the issues presented, we have no good reason on this record to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>overturn its conclusion and we affirm it.\u201d 411 U.S. at 579 (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">. It is plain that <em>Gibson </em>did not hold, as Stillman suggests, that the commercial optometrists were deprived of due process of law solely because they did not belong to the same professional organization as the members of the Board that imposed sanctions upon them. This point is more clearly indicated in <em>Friedman v. Rogers, </em>440 U.S. 1, 99 S. Ct. 887, 59 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1979). In that case, Rogers, a commercial optometrist who was also a member of the Texas Optometry Board, challenged the constitutionality, on equal protection and due process grounds, of a statute that required that four out of the six members of the Board belong to a professional organization which commercial optometrists were ineligible to join. After stating that no disciplinary proceedings had been instituted against Rogers, the Court distinguished <em>Gibson, </em>noting that in that case the Court was \"able to. examine in a particular context the possibility that the members of the regulatory board might have personal interests that precluded a fair and impartial hearing of the charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. Moreover, the Court observed that because the private optometrists\u2019 organization had long supported the provisions of the Professional Responsibility Rule for optometrists, a rule later enacted into law by statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">\"it was reasonable for the legislature to require that a majority of the Board be drawn from a professional organization that had demonstrated consistent support for the rules that the Board would be responsible for enforcing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">It is clear from <em>Friedman </em>and <em>Gibson </em>that Stillman cannot successfully contend that he was deprived of due process merely because members of the Commission were members of a private medical society which he had not joined. Although the economic competition between commercial optometrists and optometrists with private practices described in <em>Gibson </em>evidently also existed in Texas, the Supreme Court in <em>Friedman </em>stated that it was reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>that a majority of the members of the state regulatory board were required to belong to the professional organization of one faction of the profession. The record before us does not contain any evidence of similar economic competition in Maryland between physicians belonging to the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty and those like Stillman who do not. Stillman does not contend, and the record fails to reveal, that any of the members of the Commission would personally benefit from the revocation of his license. In addition, the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty has had a long tradition of overseeing the medical profession in Maryland since it was first authorized by the legislature in 1798 to select a Board of Medical Examiners to license physicians. <em>See Scholle, supra; University of Md. v. Williams, </em>9 G. &amp; J. 365 (1838).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Stillman next contends that he was denied due process because of a lack of \"meaningful review of the Commission\u2019s actions by a court.\u201d Although \u00a7 130 (p) provides for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decisions, Stillman maintains that to provide sufficient safeguards to adequately supervise the actions of the Commission, the appeal from the Commission\u2019s decision must in essence be a de novo review with an independent evaluation of all relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In <em>Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. v. Linchester, </em>274 Md. 211, 334 A.2d 514 (1975), we declared a statute unconstitutional because it provided for a de novo appeal from the decision of an administrative agency. The proper role for a court reviewing the actions of an administrative agency was, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\"to see that these responsibilities were properly empowered to the agency and have been performed within the confines of the traditional standards of procedural and substantive fair play.... This power of review, whether authorized by statute or assumed inherently, cannot be a substitution of the court\u2019s judgment for that of the agency. In those instances where an administrative agency is acting in a manner which may be considered legislative in nature (quasi-legislative), the judiciary\u2019s scope of review of that particular action is limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>assessing whether the agency was acting within its legal boundaries ...; furthermore, when an agency is acting in a fact-finding capacity (quasi-judicial) the courts review the appealed conclusions by determining whether the contested decision was rendered in an illegal, arbitrary, capricious, oppressive or fraudulent manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223-24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><em>Linchester </em>clearly indicates that not only is the scope of judicial review advocated by Stillman unconstitutional but that the mode of appeal provided by \u00a7 130 is sufficient to ensure that his right to a fair and impartial hearing is protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Stillman contends that the order revoking his license should be reversed because the Commission failed to comply with \u00a7 130 (g) (1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">\"The Commission shall refer <em>any cases </em>coming to its attention to the appropriate local county society or committee of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of the State of Maryland, for investigation and report. The report shall be acted upon within 90 days unless there is a time extension granted by the Commission. The report shall contain recommendations the investigation reveals may be necessary for adequate disciplinary procedures. The recommendations shall then be considered by the Commission, which shall take whatever action it deems appropriate, as provided herein....\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Stillman argues that the word \"cases\u201d refers, in the plural, to the case of an individual patient who has been treated by the physician under investigation. Consequently, he urges that the Commission should have considered only the cases of patients treated by him that had been screened by the Peer Review Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>If the word \"cases\u201d in \u00a7 130 <em>(g) </em>(1) is construed narrowly to mean only patient cases, then the Commission would not have the authority, for example, to refer the \"case\u201d of a physician alleged to be an alcoholic to the Peer Review Committee for investigation. The subsection makes sense as an integral part of \u00a7 130 only if the word \"cases\u201d is construed to mean matters involving physicians who are to be investigated, and not merely the patient cases that may or may not form the basis for the investigation. Under this construction of the statute, which we adopt, the Commission was not precluded from considering patient cases other than those initially screened by the Peer Review Committee.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Finally, Stillman argues that the order revoking his license should be reversed because the Commission improperly restricted his cross-examination of Dr. Berman, the head of the Peer Review Committee which investigated his medical practice and recommended that his license be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">On direct examination, Dr. Berman testified primarily about the contents of his committee\u2019s report on Stillman\u2019s medical practice. Upon Stillman\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Berman, the following colloquy occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\"Q. Have you had any contact before May 18,1978, or after, and coming right down to date, in the way of face-to-face discussion, telephone conversation, or other correspondence that might not be in the record with the Commission members about Dr. Stillman\u2019s case or any aspect of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">A. Before May 18?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">Q. Or after. The referral was on May 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">A. Yes, after up until what time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Q. Today, this minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">MS. GAUVEY: I have to object because it goes beyond the scope of direct. I don\u2019t think there were any questions raised about correspondence between the two parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">THE CHAIRMAN: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">MR. LORD [Stillman\u2019s counsel]: Am I correct, Mr. Chairman, that I cannot ask any questions of Dr. Berman that would relate to these discussions outside the record with members of this Commission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">MR. CHAIRMAN: I think your question was too broad, Mr. Lord, I don\u2019t understand. Perhaps you can try again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">MR. LORD: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">Q. Bearing in mind, as you have said, that a lot of time has elapsed since this referral was made almost two years ago to the Med-Chi Committee, of which you were then Chairman, do you recall having any conversation initiated by you or someone else with any Commission member about Dr. Stillman\u2019s case since that date down to this moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">A. Since that date down to this minute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-12\">MS. GAUVEY: I\u2019m going to object. Which date down to this minute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-13\">MR. LORD: May 18, 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-14\">MS. GAUVEY: I object because I don\u2019t think there was any discussion on direct as to Dr. Berman\u2019s relationship or contact with the Commission at that point. There was discussion about an earlier contact because of the referral but nothing about any later contact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-15\">THE CHAIRMAN: Sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">Stillman contends that because of Dr. Berman\u2019s contacts with the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty, the Commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of which the Commission is a part, there existed a great risk that Dr. Berman had engaged in ex parte communications with the Commission, possibly concerning the criminal charges filed against Stillman, of which Stillman needed to be informed to rebut the information, if necessary. Moreover, Stillman asserts that the Commission violated its affirmative duty to place such communications on the record as required by Code (1957, 1978 Repl. Vol., 1981 Cum. Supp.) Art. 41, \u00a7 254A, and established principles of due process.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Stillman further contends that the Commission should not have sustained the objection to his cross-examination of Dr. Berman because in the context of administrative hearings, \"technical common law rules\u201d do not apply. He also asserts that because Dr. Berman testified on direct examination concerning his committee\u2019s official communications with the Commission, the cross-examination was not beyond the scope of direct examination and, therefore, should not have been restricted. Finally, he maintains that because this segment of his cross-examination was of enormous importance to his case, the Commission\u2019s action deprived him of his right to a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We cannot assume that \u00a7 254A was violated in this case because no ex parte communications between Dr. Berman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>and the Commission were placed on the record. The record before us does not suggest that any improper ex parte contacts were made, and we cannot conclude that the Commission violated \u00a7 254A in some way by limiting Stillman\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Berman.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The stated ground for the objection to Stillman\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Berman was that it exceeded the scope of direct examination. We have long held that cross-examination can relate only to the facts and incidents connected with matters stated in the direct examination of the witness, and if a party desires to examine a witness as to other matters, he must do so by making the witness his own. <em>Plank v. Summers, </em>205 Md. 598, 608, 109 A.2d 914 (1954); <em>Williams v. Graff, </em>194 Md. 516, 522, 71 A.2d 450 (1950); <em>Corens v. State, </em>185 Md. 561, 566, 45 A.2d 340 (1946). Stillman suggests that because none of the cases propounding the above rule arose from administrative hearings and that because we have repeatedly held that administrative agencies are not bound by \"technical common law rules of evidence,\u201d <em>Dickinson-Tidewater v. Supervisor, </em>273 Md. 245, 253, 329 A.2d 18 (1974), the Commission erred in restricting his cross-examination on that ground. The short answer to his argument is that while administrative agencies are not bound to observe the \"technical common law rules of evidence,\u201d they are not prevented from doing so as long as the evidentiary rules are not applied in an arbitrary or oppressive manner that deprives a party of his right to a fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Control over the scope of cross-examination has traditionally been left to the discretion of the trial court unless there is \"a showing of prejudicial abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Fleming v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>277 Md. 655, 358 A.2d 892 (1976). The rule may properly be applied in administrative hearings. The record indicates that the Commission did not abuse its discretion by restricting Stillman\u2019s cross-examination and prevent Stillman from receiving a fair hearing. Although Stillman now asserts that the information he sought from Dr. Berman was of crucial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>importance to his case, he did not call Dr. Berman as his own witness or advise the Commission of the purpose of his inquiry. Moreover, in view of the evidence establishing Stillman\u2019s professional incompetence, which Stillman does not contest, it is unlikely that any ex parte communication concerning the criminal charges against Stillman, of which he had been acquitted, had any bearing upon the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">As <em>to No. 113: Judgment vacated and case remanded to the Baltimore City Court to be dismissed as moot; costs to be paid by appellee Irving M.

Two lay consumer members were added to the Commission by ch. 702 of the Acts of 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-6\">. The Commission found that Stillman\u2019s medical records were inadequate; that his prescription practices were medically unacceptable; that he used laboratory tests inappropriately; that his medical care did not reflect an orderly, thoughtful and l\u00f3gica^ approach to medical diagnosis and treatment; that his knowledge and clinical skills were medically unacceptable; and that care provided to sixteen specified patients was not medically acceptable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b420-9\">. After the Baltimore City Court, on February 10, 1981, affirmed the Commission\u2019s order revoking Dr. Stillman\u2019s license, the stay expired and Stillman was forced to withdraw from practice. Whether the stay order was appealable is therefore a moot issue. We nevertheless consider the issue because of its extreme importance and the certainty that the issue is one of a recurring nature. <em>See </em>Attorney Gen. v. A. A. Co. School Bus, 286 Md. 324, 407 A.2d 749 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b421-9\">. The court, expressing concern that a literal interpretation of \u00a7 130 (m) might render the statute unconstitutional, held that a stay was permissible notwithstanding the clear statutory language to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b421-10\">. By ch. 8 of the Acts of 1981, the legislature comprehensively revised Maryland statutes dealing with health occupational laws. The substance of \u00a7 130 (m) was revised to read, under the heading \"Administrative and judicial review ... <em>Stay of </em>decision,\u201d \"An order of the Commission may not be stayed pending review.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Code (1981) \u00a7 14-508 of the Health Occupations Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b421-11\">. Prior to July 1, 1974, \u00a7 130 (m) provided that a Commission order revoking a medical license was automatically stayed pending judicial review. This provision was in contrast to Maryland Rule B6 a, governing the procedure on appeal of a decision of an administrative agency, which specifies that the filing of an appeal does not act as an automatic stay, but that the court may, in its discretion, grant a stay. Rule B6 a is not applicable in the present case in view of the post-1974 provisions of \u00a7 130 (m).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\">. This constitutional provision now states in subsection a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">\"(a) There shall be a Circuit Court for each County and for Baltimore City.
