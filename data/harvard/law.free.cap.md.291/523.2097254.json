Code (1957, 1978 Repl. Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 244-256A. We shall hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Appellant, Vincent N. Valentine, trades as the \"Sandbar Lounge\u201d on Fort Smallwood Road in the Pasadena section of Anne Arundel County. For the year beginning May 1,1979 he held a class D (taverns), beer, wine and liquor license for those premises, with special licenses permitting Sunday operation and dancing. On March 7, 1980 the Board summonsed the appellant to show cause why his license should not be suspended or revoked. A number of alleged violations were charged under the rules and regulations of the Board which had been generally revised and adopted effective July 1, 1977. There was no publication of the 1977 rules of the Board in the Maryland Register. Nor were the Board rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>approved by the Attorney General of Maryland. Asserting that review by the Attorney General and publication in the Maryland Register were prerequisites to the validity of the rules, appellant filed a bill of complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, seeking a declaration that the rules were invalid and an injunction against their enforcement. Both parties moved for summary judgment. After taking testimony, the circuit court concluded that the statutes establishing the requirements on which appellant relied did not apply to the Board. By reference to the declaration requested in the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court declared that the Board was not a state agency subject to the APA. We granted appellant\u2019s petition for certiorari prior to consideration of the appeal by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The statutory requirements on which appellant relies involve three subtitles of Art. 41: the APA, the State Documents Law (\u00a7\u00a7 256B-256T) and, under the subtitle, \"General Provisions,\u201d \u00a7 9. In each instance we are concerned with the provisions of those statutes as of July 1, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In the APA subtitle, \u00a7 245 (c) provided, in relevant part, that \"prior to the adoption of any rule authorized by law, or its amendment or repeal, the adopting agency shall publish notice of its intended action in the Maryland Register . ...\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 246 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Each agency shall comply with the provisions of \u00a7 9 of this article and the State Documents Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">A rule is effective as provided in the State Documents Law, unless otherwise provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">For the purpose of the APA subtitle, \u00a7 244 (a) defined \"agency,\u201d in relevant part, to mean \"any State board, commission, department or officer authorized by law to make rules or to adjudicate contested cases, except those in the legislative or judicial branches . ...\u201d *<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The State. Documents Law, in \u00a7 256C, establishes the Code of Maryland Regulations, and on July 1,1977 required, <em>inter alia, </em>that there \"shall be compiled\u201d therein \"[e]very administrative rule adopted by any agency pursuant to the procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. ...\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Maryland Register, published at least once every two weeks, is a temporary supplement to the Code of Maryland Regulations. Under \u00a7 256F (b), the \"Register shall include: (1) [ejvery document required to be published in the Code of Maryland Regulations . . . .\u201d For purposes of the State Documents Law,as of July 1,1977, \u00a7 256B (c) said that\" <em>\\a\\gency\u2019 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>has the same meaning as under the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Section 9 of Art. 41 read as follows on July 1, 1977:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">Prior to the adoption of any rule or regulation by an officer or department of the executive branch of the State of Maryland under any rule-making power granted by the General Assembly of Maryland, the rule or regulation shall be submitted to the Attorney General of Maryland for approval as to its legality. Every officer, department, board, commission, bureau and similar agency of the State government other than those within the Legislative and Judiciary Departments who has power to make, promulgate, adopt or enforce rules and regulations shall file copies of them pursuant to the provisions of the State Document Law. No rule or regulation hereafter made, promulgated or adopted is effective until after compliance with this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Appellant does not assert that Art. 41, \u00a7 9 applies directly to the Board. The relevance of \u00a7 9 to appellant\u2019s argument is its incorporation by reference into \u00a7 246 of the APA. It is appellant\u2019s position that the Board is an agency which must comply with the provisions of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">A board of license commissioners, or \"liquor board,\u201d such as that for Anne Arundel County, exists and generally functions under Md. Code (1957,1981 Repl. Vol.), art. 2B. These boards are granted rule making authority under Art. 2B, \u00a7 184 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This rule making power can be traced to Ch. 2 of the Acts of the Special Session of 1933, Md. Code (1924,1935 Cum. Supp.), Art. 2B, \u00a7 50.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Article 2B has never set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>any procedure by which rules are to be adopted by a board of license commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Other principal functions of liquor boards include determining, after notice and hearing, whether applications for the issuance of alcoholic beverage licenses should be approved or disapproved (Art. 2B, \u00a7 60 (a)), whether, upon protest, existing licenses should be renewed (Art. 2B, \u00a7 68 (a)), and whether licenses should be suspended or revoked for violation of law (Art. 2B, \u00a7\u00a7 69 (a), 69A and 70).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In support of his position that the Board is an \"agency\u201d under the APA, appellant points out that boards of license commissioners are created by act of the General Assembly and that they administer statutes enacted by the General Assembly, all pursuant to a policy of this State, declared in Art. 2B, \u00a7 1, \"that it is necessary to regulate and control the manufacture, sale, distribution, transportation and storage of alcoholic beverages within this State....\u201d However, a mere glance at Art. 2B reflects that it is replete with provisions which apply in only a single county.* 5<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board points out that it may exercise its jurisdiction only within Anne Arundel County.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It cites <em>Bernstein v. Board of Education of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>245 Md. 464, 471, 226 A.2d 243, 248 (1967) in which that appellee was held not to be an agency under the APA and where we said that \"[a] county board of education has control of educational matters affecting only the county, subject to the by-laws and policies of the State Board [of Education].\u201d Appellant emphasizes that the Board is appointed by the Governor pursuant to Art. 2B, \u00a7 148 (a) and (b-1), and that its members are subject to removal by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Governor under \u00a7 156 (a). Indeed, in <em>Nesbitt v. Fallon, </em>203 Md. 534, 102 A.2d 284 (1954), this Court held that a member of the Board of License Commissioners of Anne Arundel County was a civil officer \"of the State\u201d within the meaning of Md. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 IQ.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Board counters with Art. 2B, \u00a7\u00a7 150 and 151. Liquor boards are appointed by the boards of county commissioners in Carroll, Cecil, Charles and Queen Anne\u2019s counties, and by the county executives in Montgomery and Baltimore counties. The county commissioners constitute the board of license commissioners in Dorchester and Kent counties. In Howard County, the County Council constitutes the liquor board. Appellant thrusts with \u00a7 155 (c) of Art. 2B which sets the maximum salaries of members of the Board and with \u00a7 158 (d) which fixes the salaries of the Board\u2019s inspectors, clerk and attorney. The Board parries with the fact that its operations are included in the Anne Arundel County annual operating budget, that it occupies, free of rent, premises owned by Anne Arundel County, that its equipment is owned by Anne Arundel County, that, under Art. 2B, \u00a7 63 (c), the fees collected for alcoholic beverage licenses approved by it are remitted by the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to the county government for its general purposes and that, under \u00a7 199 (a), fines imposed by the Board are payable to Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">We add that the license certificate for the Sandbar Lounge in this case reads that the appellant \"is licensed by the State of Maryland and the County of Anne Arundel to keep for sale and sell alcoholic beverages . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>There is at least one conclusion which clearly emerges from the foregoing review. It is that when Art. 41, \u00a7 244 (a) says that \" <em>\\a\\gency&gt; </em>means any State board [or] commission,\u201d and one attempts to apply that definition to a board of license commissioners, the statute does not have so plain a meaning as to preclude resort to administrative construction. <em>See Smith v. Higinbothom, </em>187 Md. 115, 132-33, 48 A.2d 754, 763 (1946). The administrative construction of the APA from its inception has been that liquor boards are not included, and the General Assembly has acquiesced in that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The APA took effect on June 1, 1957. Chs. 94 and 428 of the Acts of 1957. Because of the difference between the provisions of the APA relating to appeals from agencies in contested cases and certain provisions of Art. 2B relating to appeals from liquor boards, the Board of License Commissioners for Baltimore City requested the Attorney General to render an opinion on whether it was subject to the APA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By an opinion dated November 21, 1957, he ruled that the APA did not apply. 42 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 63. The Attorney General placed principal reliance on Md. Code (1957), Art. 41, \u00a7 3, which was not a part of the APA, but which provided that \"[a]ny officers, boards or commissions not referred to in this article shall not be affected hereby.\u201d Inasmuch as liquor boards were not referred to in Art. 41, it was reasoned that no part of Art. 41, including the APA, affected such boards. 42 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 63, 64-65 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">On May 8, 1962, this Court decided <em>Pearce v. Board of Liquor License Commissioners of Baltimore County, </em>228 Md. 515, 180 A.2d 651 (1962), involving a protestants\u2019 appeal to the circuit court from the grant of a liquor license. One issue related to the timeliness of the applicant\u2019s intervention in the circuit court. By way of dicta we then said: \"The Administrative Procedure Act (which is not applicable in this case) does appear to recognize a distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>between time limitations in regard to the appearance of a party to a proceeding as opposed to an intervenor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 180 A.2d at 655. <em>Pearce </em>does not give the reason underlying this parenthetical statement. However, <em>Pearce </em>was authored for this Court by Judge C. Ferdinand Sybert who, as Attorney General, had issued the opinion of November 21, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">By Ch. 305 of the Acts of 1963, the APA definition of \"agency,\u201d Md. Code (1957), Art. 41, \u00a7 244 (a), was repealed and re-enacted with amendments in order to include the State Insurance Department among those departments which are specifically excepted from the definition. No change was made in the statute at that time to reject the construction which the Attorney General had placed upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Art. 41, \u00a7 3 was substantially rewritten by Ch. 156 of the Acts of 1969, and further amended by Ch. 415 of the Acts of 1970, all as part of the movement toward a general reorganization of the executive and administrative departments of state government. As rewritten, \u00a7 3 of Art. 41, Md. Code (1957, 1978 Repl. Vol.) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">The executive and administrative departments, offices, boards and other units of the State government now existing or created during this or any subsequent session of the General Assembly which are not assigned to and do not constitute one of the principal departments may be placed at the discretion of the Governor in one of the principal departments at the time of or at any time after the establishment of the appropriate principal department. Each of the principal departments shall be constituted and shall have and exercise the rights, powers, duties, obligations and functions provided by law. Any officers, agencies, boards or commissions specifically exempted in this or any other article shall not be affected hereby.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">We find no statute or executive order of the Governor assigning boards of license commissioners to a principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>department. Nor do we find any statute which specifically exempts boards of license commissioners from the plan for executive department reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Again, in 1972, by Ch. 569, the General Assembly re-enacted Art. 41, \u00a7 244 (a) to exempt the State Accident Fund, but no change was made affecting the gloss as to liquor boards which the Attorney General had put on \"agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">It might be contended that the 1969 repeal of old \u00a7 3 of Art. 41, on which the Attorney General relied in his 1957 opinion, eliminated the basis for excluding liquor boards from the Art. 41, \u00a7 244 (a) definition of \"agency,\u201d so that it should thereafter automatically be construed to include license commissioners. However, the construction lived on after the reason given by the Attorney General for the construction had disappeared. This is made plain by administrative practice under the State Documents Law, which was enacted by Ch. 600 of the Acts of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">From 1974 until 1978, \u00a7 256B (c) of the State Documents Law said that \"agency\u201d has \"the same meaning as under the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d The State Documents Law is administered by the Division of State Documents of the Office of the Secretary of State. In the court below the assistant administrator of the Division of State Documents testified without contradiction that that division has <em>never </em>published the rules and regulations of any liquor board in the State of Maryland. Indeed, the chairman of the Board, who has served on it for 10 years, testified that on two occasions he submitted rules and regulations of the Board for publication in the Maryland Register but they were turned down by the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In 1976, by Ch. 648, and in 1977, by Ch. 528, the APA definition of \"agency\u201d was further amended with respect to the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund and the Parole Commission, but without the Legislature making any change in the Attorney General\u2019s 1957 construction or in the administrative practice of two decades which had resulted therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>What we said in <em>Smith v. Higinbothom, supra, </em>187 Md. at 132-33, 48 A.2d at 763, is applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">This Court considers that the construction placed upon a statute by administrative officials soon after its enactment, when not changed by legislative or judicial decision, is generally the best construction. It is true that the administrative construction of a statute does not preclude an inquiry by the Court into the correctness of such construction, for no custom, however long and generally it has been followed by officials of the State, can nullify the plain meaning and purpose of a statute. But where the language of a statute is susceptible of two constructions, a long-continued and unvarying construction applied by administrative officials is strong persuasive influence in determining the judicial construction of the statute, and it should not be disregarded except for the strongest and most urgent reasons. <em>Leitch v. Gaither, </em>151 Md. 167, 176, 177, 134 A. 317; <em>American-Stewart Distillery v. Stewart Distilling Co., </em>168 Md. 212, 217, 177 A. 473; <em>Bouse v. Hutzler, </em>180 Md. 682, 687, 26 A.2d 767, 141 A.L.R. 843 . . . . By re-enactment of the section now before the Court in exactly the same words contained in the Act of 1908, the Legislature gave tacit approval to the construction placed upon the section by administrative officials. In declaring the meaning of a statute, the Court may avail itself of the construction put upon it by the Legislature itself through long-continued acquiescence. The Legislature\u2019s acquiescence in the administrative construction furnishes a strong presumption that the intention has been interpreted correctly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">In <em>Read Drug &amp; Chemical Co. v. Claypoole, </em>165 Md. 250, 257-58, 166 A. 742, 745 (1933), we said the following with respect to opinions of the Attorney General construing statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">This was an official interpretation and the adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>of an administrative construction in a case very analogous to, if not identical with, the one now being considered; and, while courts are not bound by an Attorney General\u2019s opinion, or an administrative construction in conformity therewith, yet, when the meaning of the legislative language is not entirely clear, such legal interpretation and administrative construction should be given great consideration in determining the legislative intent. The Legislature knew, or must be presumed to have known, of this interpretation and administrative construction at the time of the passage of the act of 1933, and must be held to have employed the language it did with that interpretation in view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><em>Accord, Williams v. Loyola College, </em>257 Md. 316, 329, 263 A.2d 5, 11-12 (1970); <em>Benco Vending v. Comptroller, </em>244 Md. 377, 382, 223 A.2d 759, 762 (1966); <em>Comptroller v. Rockhill, Inc., </em>205 Md. 226, 233, 107 A.2d 93, 97 (1954); <em>Vaughan v. Boone, </em>191 Md. 515, 521-22, 62 A.2d 351, 354 (1948). Here, there was not only an administrative construction, but also a contemporaneous dicta statement by this Court in <em>Pearce v. Board of Liquor License Commissioners, supra, </em>which reinforces the legislative acquiescence in the construction of \"agency\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In addition to the legislative acquiescence in the administrative construction, there are two other factors which support our conclusion that \"agency\u201d in the APA is not intended to embrace boards of license commissioners. The State Documents Law definition of \"agency\u201d was amended by Ch. 858 of the Acts of 1978 to eliminate the incorporation of the APA definition. \"Agency\u201d <em>now </em>means \"any State board, commission, department or officer authorized by law to make rules or adjudicate contested cases, except those in the legislative or judicial branches.\u201d Md. Code (1957, 1978 Repl. Vol., 1981 Cum. Supp.), Art. 41, \u00a7 256B (c) (1). The title to Ch. 858 states that the purpose of changing the definition was \"to require additional State agencies to comply\u201d with the State Documents Law. Then, by Ch. 464 of the Acts of 1981, \u00a7 256B (c) was divided into two subsections. The first subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>tion continues the immediately pre-existing definition but subsection (2) states that \" '[ajgency\u2019 does not include any Board of License Commissioners in the State.\u201d By \u00a7 2, Ch. 464 further enacts that it \"may not be construed to affect the status of Boards of License Commissioners for any purpose other than exclusion from the State Documents law.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We need not in this case determine whether rules and regulations promulgated by a board of license commissioners in the period between June 1, 1978 and July 1, 1981* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> were required to be adopted in accordance with the State Documents Law. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that the first explicit declaration by the General Assembly of its intent on the applicability <em>vel non </em>to liquor boards of the rule making procedures of the State Documents Law is consistent with that which we have determined, from legislative acquiescence in the administrative construction, to have been the legislative intent at least up to and including July 1, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Our conclusion is also supported by consideration of the law relative to the limited nature of judicial review of liquor board decisions in contested cases. For example, at the time the APA was enacted, the decision of a circuit court on an appeal from a liquor board was final, unless the case finally decided \"a point of law at variance with any decision previously rendered by any other judge of the State on the same question ....\u201d Md. Code (1957), Art. 2B, \u00a7 175 (f). That provision continues in effect today. Md. Code (1957, 1981 Repl. Vol.), Art. 2B, \u00a7 175 (f). Appeals governed by the APA are not so limited. Art. 41, \u00a7 256. This Court has consistently applied the judicial review provisions of Art. 2B to appeals in liquor board cases, most recently in <em>Brown v. Baer </em>[No. 145, Sept. Term, 1980, decided October 8, 1981]. If in adopting the APA the General Assembly had intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\"agency,\u201d as used therein, to embrace liquor boards, it is clear that that intent did not extend to the judicial review provisions of the APA. Thus, appellant\u2019s contention that the APA governs the rule-making function of liquor boards would lead to the seemingly anomalous result that the General Assembly intended \"agency\u201d to have a different meaning as to liquor boards in different sections of the APA, without any express language in the APA to support that distinction. Such a distinction would then necessarily have to rest on having the prior, but more specific, provisions of Art. 2B, \u00a7 175 construed to prevail over the later enacted, but more general, judicial review provisions of the APA. We think the administrative practice shows that the legislative intent was not so subtly compartmentalized and that a liquor board was not intended to be an \"agency\u201d under the APA either as to rule-making or in deciding contested cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">We hold that as of July 1, 1977 when the rules in issue here were adopted, the Board of License Commissioners of Anne Arundel County was not an \"agency\u201d within the meaning of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ab2\">\n<em>Appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">. The full text of Art. 41, \u00a7 245 (c), as of July 1, 1977, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">Except for emergency regulations adopted pursuant to Article 40, \u00a7 40A, prior to the adoption of any rule authorized by law, or its amendment or repeal, the adopting agency shall publish notice of its intended action in the Maryland Register, and afford interested persons opportunity to submit data or views orally or in writing. An agency may not adopt or amend any rule or administrative act which increases the agency\u2019s expenditures beyond budgetary limitations without the express approval of the General Assembly; or if the General Assembly is not then in session, without the express approval in writing of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Delegates, acting jointly and after consulting with and receiving the advice in writing of the joint budget and audit committee. Approval by the General Assembly or its presiding officers, as provided in this section, is not required if the Governor by proclamation declares that the rule or administrative act to increase an agency\u2019s expenditures beyond budgetary limitations is necessary and a matter of emergency. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>This limitation with respect to the agency\u2019s budget is applicable to every agency in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government notwithstanding any exemptions from the provisions of this subtitle contained in \u00a7 244(a) of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">There is no contention in this case that the special provision of \u00a7 245 (c) relating to rules which increase an agency\u2019s expenditures is applicable to the Board\u2019s rules of July 1,1977, and we intimate no opinion on the construction or application of that provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">.
