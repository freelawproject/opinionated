Hill, </em>and Case No. 31, <em>Rauth (Myers) v. Rauth, </em>were argued before this Court. We shall consider these cases together because they both present the common question whether, under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> upon dissolution of a marriage, federal law <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> precludes the division of military retired pay pursuant to Md. Code (1974, 1980 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 3-6A-01 (e) and \u00a7 3-6A-05 (a) and (b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, effective 1 January 1979. Section 3-6A-01 (e) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-13\">\" 'Marital property\u2019 is all property, however titled, acquired by either or both spouses during their marriage. It does not include property acquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>prior to the marriage, property acquired by inheritance or gift from a third party, or property excluded by valid agreement or property directly traceable to any of these sources.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Section 3-6A-05 (a) and (b) provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">\"(a) In granting an absolute divorce or annulment ... the court shall determine which property is marital property if the division of property is an issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">\"(b) The court shall determine the value of all marital property. After making the determination, the court may grant a monetary award as an adjustment of the equities and rights of the parties concerning marital property, whether or not alimony is awarded. The amount of the award and the method of its payment shall be determined after considering each of the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">(1) The contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">(2) The value of all property interests of each spouse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">(3) The economic circumstances of each spouse at the time the award is to be made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-11\">(4) The circumstances and facts which contributed to the estrangement of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-12\">(5) The duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-13\">(6) The age and the physical and mental condition of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-14\">(7) How and when specific marital property was acquired, including the effort expended by each party in accumulating the marital property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-15\">(8) Any award or other provision which the court has made under this Subtitle 6A with respect to family use personal property or the family home, and any award of alimony; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>(9) Such other factors as the court deems necessary or appropriate to consider in order to arrive at a fair and equitable monetary award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The record in <em>Hill </em>shows that the Appellant and Cross-Appellee, Mae H. Hill (wife), and the Appellee and Cross-appellant, Theodore R. Hill, Jr. (husband), were married in 1955. The husband served as an enlisted man in the United States Army from 1945 until his retirement in 1972. Upon his retirement, he became eligible for and received military retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">On 30 November 1979, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, a decree was entered granting the wife an absolute divorce, alimony, counsel fees, and a monetary award pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 3-6A-05. The trial court held that the husband\u2019s military retirement benefits were not subject to the provisions of that section and did not consider their value in determining the amount of the monetary award. The trial court, however, did consider the husband\u2019s interest in the military retirement benefits in determining the amount of alimony awarded to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The wife appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Hill v. Hill, </em>47 Md.App. 460, 424 A.2d 779 (1981). That Court confined its inquiry to the question whether military retirement pay is \"marital property\u201d under \u00a7 3-6A.01(e). While the Court of Special Appeals recognized that \"military retirement pay is an economic resource and may be considered in fixing the amount of alimony and child support,\u201d it held \"that as a matter of state law ... military retirement pay is income and not 'marital property\u2019 subject to division upon divorce.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>47 Md.App. at 469, 424 A.2d at 783. In view of that decision, the Court of Special Appeals found it unnecessary to determine whether federal law precludes the division of military retirement benefits under \u00a7 3-6A-05. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>The wife filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and the husband filed a conditional cross-petition. We granted both.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The record in <em>Rauth </em>shows that the Appellant, Lois F. Rauth (Myers) (wife), and the Appellee, James A. Rauth (husband), were married in 1961. The husband served as a commissioned officer in the United States Navy from 1961 until his retirement in 1979. Upon his retirement, he became eligible for and received military retired pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, decrees were entered granting the wife, among other things, an absolute divorce and a monetary award pursuant to \u00a7 3-6A-05. The trial court held that under the Supremacy Clause, federal law precludes the division of military retired pay under \u00a7 3-6A-05 and did not consider its value in determining the amount of the monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The wife filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. While that appeal was pending, the wife filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. We issued the writ to the Court of Special Appeals before consideration by that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">In <em>McCarty v. McCarty, </em>453 U.S. 210, 1010 S. Ct. 2728 (1981), the United States Supreme Court considered the question whether, upon the dissolution of a marriage, federal law precludes a state court from dividing military nondisability retired pay pursuant to state community property laws. After reviewing the language, structure, legislative history, and congressional intent of federal statutes relating to retired pay for military personnel, the Supreme Court concluded that there was \"a conflict between the terms of federal retirement statutes and the community property right asserted. ...\u201d In determining whether the \" 'consequences of that [community property right] sufficiently injure the objectives of the federal program to require nonrecognition,\u2019 \u201d the Supreme Court found that \"the application of community property principles to military retired pay threatens grave harm to 'clear and substantial\u2019 federal interests.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\"... Congress has enacted a military retirement system designed to accomplish two major goals: to provide for the retired service member, and to meet the personnel management needs of the active military forces. The community property division of retired pay has the potential to frustrate each of these objectives.\u201d <em>McCarty, </em>453 U.S. at 232-33, 101 S. Ct. at 2741.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The Supreme Court held that the federal law precludes a state court from dividing military nondisability retired pay pursuant to state community property laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">We recognize that the analysis in <em>McCarty </em>was premised on a division of property in a community property state, not an \"equitable distribution\u201d state such as Maryland.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In our view, the rationale in <em>McCarty </em>is equally applicable to a division of property in an equitable distribution state and its holding is dispositive of the common question presented in Hill<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <em>Rauth. </em>We now hold that, under the Supremacy Clause, upon the dissolution of a marriage, federal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>precludes a Maryland court from dividing military nondisability retired pay as marital property pursuant to \u00a7 3-6A-05.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, in <em>Hill, </em>we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals on a ground other than the one relied upon by that Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Rauth, </em>we shall affirm that portion of the trial court\u2019s decree that held that federal law precluded the husband\u2019s military retired pay from being divisible as marital property. In view of the parties\u2019 agreement that the appropriate amount of the monetary award was $4,032.75, we shall reverse that portion of the trial court\u2019s decree that granted the wife a monetary award in the amount of $2,950.01. Accordingly, we shall remand the <em>Rauth </em>case to the trial court for the entry of an order granting the wife a monetary award in the amount of $4,032.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">\n<em>No. 19, Hill v. Hill:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6B\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">\n<em>Costs to be equally divided.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">\n<em>No. 31, Rauth (Myers) v. Rauth:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-U\">\n<em>Judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">\n<em>Case remanded to that court for the entry of an order in accordance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-14\">. U.S. Const, art.

The Court of Special Appeals remanded the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of modifying the decree to award counsel fees and costs to the wife rather than the wife\u2019s law firm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\">. We note that subsequent to its decision in <em>McCarty, </em>the Supreme Court denied certiorari in Russell v. Russell, 605 S.W.2d 33 (Ky. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3158 (1981), and Cose v. Cose, 592 P.2d 1230 (Alas. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3158 (1981). Both of these cases involved a division of property in \"equitable distribution\u201d states. <em>See </em>Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 403.190 (1970) and Alaska Stat. \u00a7 09.55.210 (1973). In each it Was held that military nondisability retired pay was not divisible.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">In addition, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana in In re Marriage of Miller, Mont. 609 P.2d 1185 (1980), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>Miller v. Miller, 453 U.S. 918, 101 S. Ct. 3152 (1981), in which it was held in an \"equitable distribution\u201d state that military nondisability retired pay was divisible. <em>See </em>Mont. Rev. Codes Ann. \u00a7 48-321 (1977). The case was remanded \"for further consideration in light of <em>McCarty v. McCarty,\u201d </em>453 U.S. at 213, 101 S. Ct. at 3152.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\">. In <em>McCarty, </em>the Supreme Court specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">\"Under current law, there are three basic forms of military retirement: nondisability retirement; disability retirement; and reserve retirement. Por our present purposes, only the first of these three forms is relevant.\u201d McCarty, U.S. at , 101 S. Ct. at 2731 (citation omitted) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">The Supreme Court considered and decided the sole question whether federal law (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3911 et seq.) precludes a state court from dividing military nondisability retirement pay pursuant to state community property laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">In addition to the three basic forms of military retirement referred to in <em>McCarty, </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 521-23 (1976 &amp; Supp. III 1979) provides for pensions for veterans for nonservice-connected disability or death. We recognize that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>when <em>Hill </em>was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, the husband proffered, for the first time, that his military retirement benefits consisted of military nondisability retired pay and veterans\u2019 disability benefits. The Court of Special Appeals drew no distinction between these two types of benefits and confined its inquiry to the question \"whether military retirement pay is 'marital property\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 3-6A-05. The question whether federal law precludes the division of veterans\u2019 disability benefits was not specifically raised, briefed, argued or decided in either the trial court or the Court of Special Appeals. Accordingly, it will not be considered here. Md. Rule 885.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b643-18\">. In light of this decision, Appellants\u2019 contentions in both <em>Hill </em>and <em>Rauth </em>that military retired pay constitutes marital property under \u00a7 3-6A-01 (e) and \u00a7 3-6A-05 need not be considered here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b643-19\">. In reaching this conclusion, we have determined, after a careful review of the record, that Cross-Appellants\u2019 contentions that \"the chancellor erred in his award of alimony, counsel fees and costs\u201d and \"in his calculation of the monetary award\u201d are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
