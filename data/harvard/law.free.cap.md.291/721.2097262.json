Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 541 (c). That subsection, known as the uninsured motorist law, goes on to provide, <em>inter alia, </em>that any provision in an uninsured motorist endorsement which requires the submission to binding arbitration of any dispute between the insured and insurer is prohibited and shall be of no legal effect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>We granted petitions for writs of certiorari in these two cases, and ordered that the cases be consolidated, because both petitions seemed to encompass the same important legal issue arising under the uninsured motorist statute. That issue concerned the enforceability, in light of the statute and the surrounding circumstances, of a \"consent to sue\u201d clause in an uninsured motorist endorsement. The clause provided that no judgment against any person alleged to be legally responsible for the insured\u2019s injuries will be conclusive, as between the insured and the insurer, on the issues of the liability of that person to the insured or the amount of damages which the insured is entitled to recover, \"unless such judgment is entered pursuant to an action prosecuted by the insured with the written consent of the [insurance] Company.\u201d Although both cases had appeared to present this issue, it is now clear that only one of them, <em>Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund </em>v. <em>Franz, </em>actually involves the question. Consequently, we shall deal with the cases separately in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">\n<em>I. Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund v. Franz</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">On January 1, 1976, the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF) issued, upon payment of the requisite premium, an automobile liability insurance policy to Anthony J. Franz, providing insurance coverage, including an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>uninsured motorist endorsement, on Mr. Franz\u2019s taxicab from January 1, 1976, until January 1, 1977.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under one of the \"coverage\u201d sections of the endorsement, it was provided that no default judgment against anyone \"alleged to be legally responsible\u201d for the insured\u2019s damage \"shall be conclusive, as between the insured and the company,\u201d as to liability or damages \"unless such judgment is entered pursuant to an action prosecuted by the insured with the written consent of the Company.\u201d The same coverage section provided that the insured\u2019s legal entitlement to recover against the uninsured motorist and the amount of that recovery, in the absence of an agreement between the insurer and insured, was to be determined by arbitration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>In addition, there was an exclusion in the uninsured motorist endorsement if the insured or his representative \"without written consent of the company, made any settlement with any person or organization who may be legally liable\u201d for the insured\u2019s bodily injury or property damage. Finally, the endorsement in the MAIF policy contained a detailed arbitration clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">On January 17, 1976, the insured, Mr. Franz, while operating his taxicab, was injured in a collision in Baltimore City between his vehicle and an automobile owned and operated by John Henry Adams. The insurance policy on Adams\u2019s automobile had been cancelled the day before because of nonpayment of premium, and thus Adams was an uninsured motorist. It is undisputed that Franz timely notified MAIF of the accident, made a claim under the uninsured motorist endorsement of his policy, submitted proof of his injuries, and demanded payment from MAIF. The insurer refused to pay Franz\u2019s claim without giving any reason for its refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>After MAIF\u2019s rejection of his claim, Franz, in September 1976, filed in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore City, a tort action against the uninsured motorist Adams, seeking recovery of his damages resulting from the accident. Also in September, Franz, by his attorney, sent MAIF a letter notifying the insurer of the suit, enclosing copies of the \"suit papers,\u201d and requesting that MAIF appear in the matter. MAIF replied by a letter dated September 28, 1976, informing Franz\u2019s attorney that it would not participate in the case. Franz\u2019s attorney, on December 2,1976, and again on January 3, 1977, wrote to MAIF and informed the insurer that the tort suit was scheduled for trial on January 25, 1977, that, if MAIF did not intervene and enter a defense, Franz would seek a default judgment against Adams (who, apparently, had made it known that he would not defend), and that Franz would take steps to enforce the judgment against MAIF under the uninsured motorist endorsement of the policy. At the trial of the tort suit on January 25, 1977, MAIF did not appear and a default judgment was entered in favor of Franz and against Adams for $3,182.84 plus court costs. Shortly thereafter, Franz notified MAIF of the judgment and requested payment, but the insurer refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Franz then instituted the present contract action against MAIF in the Superior Court for Baltimore City, claiming damages of $3,196.84 (consisting of the $3,182.84 tort judgment plus $14.00 court costs in the tort action). Franz filed a motion for summary judgment, taking the position that MAIF, having had notice and an opportunity to intervene in the tort action but having refused to intervene, was liable as a matter of law for the amount of the tort judgment against Adams. Franz contended that the clause in the uninsured motorist endorsement, requiring MAIF\u2019s consent for the prosecution of the tort suit in order for the insurer to be bound by the default judgment, was unenforceable under the uninsured motorist law.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">MAIF opposed the motion for summary judgment on the ground that it had not consented to the prosecution of the tort suit against Adams and that, therefore, it was not bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>by the default judgment under the terms of the endorsement. MAIF\u2019s position was that Franz was required to relitigate, in the contract action, the issues of Adams\u2019s tort liability and the amount of damages. MAIF\u2019s answer did not suggest that it had any contract defenses apart from the issues resolved in the tort suit; instead, the insurer relied entirely upon its asserted right under the policy to have the Superior Court, in the contract action, \"adjudicate the legal liability of the uninsured motorist, John Henry Adams, to the Plaintiff, Anthony J. Franz ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The Superior Court, agreeing with MAIF\u2019s position, denied the motion for summary judgment and ordered that the case be tried. At the subsequent non-jury trial, MAIF defended on the ground that Franz\u2019s contributory negligence had been the proximate cause of the collision between his taxicab and Adams\u2019s uninsured automobile. At the conclusion of the trial testimony, the court found that Franz was not contributorily negligent and awarded him judgment in the amount of $3,000.00 plus costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">MAIF appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, contending that the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous and that Franz was guilty of contributory negligence. Franz took a cross-appeal, insisting that the issues in the earlier tort case should not have been re-litigated in the contract action, that under the circumstances MAIF was bound by the judgment in the tort suit, and that, therefore, he was entitled to a judgment for $3,196.84 instead of the $3,000.00 awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The Court of Special Appeals, agreeing with Franz, modified the judgment of the Superior Court of Baltimore City by raising the award to the same figure as the judgment in the tort case, and, as modified, affirmed. The intermediate appellate court, in an opinion by Judge Lowe, held that the clause in the uninsured motorist endorsement, requiring the insurer\u2019s consent to prosecute a tort suit against the uninsured motorist in order for that judgment to be binding, was void under the statute and that an insurer, having notice of the tort action and an opportunity to intervene, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>bound by the determinations in that tort action regarding the liability of the uninsured motorist to the insured and the amount of damages, 44 Md.App. 547, 409 A.2d 1127 (1980). This Court then granted MAIF\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, 287 Md. 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">This Court has consistently rejected attempts by insurers, as well as insureds and the insurance commissioner, to circumvent the plain language of the required coverage provisions of the statutes dealing with automobile insurance. <em>Yarmuth v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>286 Md. 256, 407 A.2d 315 (1979); <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., </em>285 Md. 548, 403 A.2d 1229 (1979); <em>State Farm Mut. v. Ins.

Stith, </em>277 Md. 595, 356 A.2d 272 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Furthermore, in <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., supra, </em>285 Md. at 553, and in <em>State Farm v. Md. Auto. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>277 Md. at 605, we held that conditions or limitations in an uninsured motorist endorsement, which provide less than the coverage required by the statute, are void. This uniformly recognized principle was well-stated by a Kansas Court as follows: \"[A]ny provisions of the insurance policy which purport to condition, limit or dilute the unqualified uninsured motorist coverage mandated by the statute are void and unenforceable.\u201d <em>Barnett v. Crosby, </em>5 Kan.App.2d 98, 612 P.2d 1250, 1252 (1980). In our view, the Court of Special Appeals correctly applied this principle in holding void the \"consent to sue\u201d clause relied upon by MAIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Two types of \"consent to sue\u201d clauses have been included in uninsured motorist endorsements used throughout the country, and the typical endorsement usually contains one or the other of these clauses. Under one type, coverage is completely lost if the insured prosecutes to judgment a tort action against the uninsured motorist without obtaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>consent of his insurance carrier. Under the other type, coverage is not lost if the insured prosecutes the tort suit without his insurer\u2019s consent, but it is provided that the tort judgment shall not be conclusive or binding upon the insurer regarding the tort liability of the uninsured motorist and the amount of damages. The typical uninsured motorist endorsement also provides that the insured\u2019s entitlement to recover under the endorsement, and the amount, should be settled by binding arbitration, upon the demand of either party, if the insured and insurer cannot agree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is often said that the purpose of the \"consent to sue\u201d clauses is to supplement the arbitration clause or to protect the insurer\u2019s right to have its liability determined by binding arbitration, and that where statutes or public policy invalidate the binding arbitration provision, the \"consent to sue\u201d clauses fall with the arbitration clause. <em>Vernon Fire and Casualty Ins.

Healey, </em>104 N.H. 157, 181 A.2d 634 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">More specifically, judicial opinions dealing with statutory schemes like Maryland\u2019s have with virtual unanimity invalidated both types of \"consent to sue\u201d clauses in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>uninsured motorist endorsements. They have held that, if the insurer had notice of the tort suit and an opportunity to intervene but failed to seek intervention, then the insurer will be bound by the determination in the tort suit regarding the insured\u2019s entitlement to damages from the uninsured motorist and the amount of those damages. Furthermore, with regard to those judicial opinions which are not based upon uninsured motorist statutes similar to Maryland\u2019s, the overwhelming majority of cases nevertheless have held that the \"consent to sue\u201d clauses are against public policy and that an insurer, with notice and an opportunity to intervene, will be bound by the resolution of the issues in the tort suit.

Co., </em>16 Utah 2d 223, 398 P.2d 873 (1965).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The language of the standard uninsured motorist statute, the purpose underlying required uninsured motorist coverage, and the desirability of avoiding a multiplicity of suits, all support the soundness of the decisions throughout the country holding that \"consent to sue\u201d clauses are invalid and that insurers are generally bound by tort judgments against the uninsured motorists.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., supra, </em>285 Md. at 554, this Court pointed out that \"[t]he provision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Maryland statute specifying the basic coverage of the uninsured motorist endorsement is standard language, similar to the language in statutes ... that have been considered by courts throughout the country.\u201d This statute, in unambiguous language, provides that \"every policy of motor vehicle liability insurance ... <em>shall </em>contain coverage ... for damages which the insured <em>is entitled to recover </em>from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle. ...\u201d Art. 48A, \u00a7 541 (c) (emphasis added). If an insured has obtained a valid judgment in a tort suit against the uninsured motorist, he clearly \"is entitled to recover\u201d those damages from the uninsured motorist. To allow an insurer to pay something <em>less </em>than the damages which the insured is entitled to recover against the uninsured motorist because of a policy clause requiring the insurer\u2019s consent to prosecute the tort suit against the uninsured, on its face cannot be squared with the statutorily mandated coverage. As the Indiana Court of Appeals observed with regard to language like that in the Maryland statute: \"It is difficult to imagine that a judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction would not legally entitle Matney [the insured] to recover the damages specified by that judgment.\u201d <em>Vernon Fire and Casualty Ins. Co. v. Matney, supra, </em>351 N.E.2d at 66. Or, as the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, after holding void the consent to sue clause, stated <em>(Boughton v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, supra, </em>354 P.2d at 1090-1091):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">\"Exchange [the insurer] agreed to pay all sums plaintiff was legally entitled to recover as damages. The judgment against the uninsured motorist determined that plaintiff was entitled to recover from an uninsured motorist and established the amount she was entitled to recover. Exchange cannot now say ... that it is entitled to relitigate these issues when it agreed to pay that which has already been determined. We therefore conclude the question of damages and legal liability of the uninsured motorist may not be relitigated in the present action and that the judgment against the uninsured motorist is conclusive of the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>therein determined, subject, however, to any defenses Exchange might have against it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-3\">To the same effect, <em>see, e.g., State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Girtman, </em>113 Ga.App. 54, 147 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1966); <em>Heisner v. Jones, supra, </em>184 Neb. at 608; <em>Glover v. Tennessee Farmers Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>468 S.W.2d at 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Our recent opinion in the <em>Reese </em>case emphasized the nature of an action by an insured against his insurer under the statutorily required uninsured motorist endorsement (285 Md. at 552-553):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">\"... this is neither a tort action nor an action by an asserted third party beneficiary of an insurance policy. Instead, this is a breach of contract action by the insured against his own insurer. Under the statutorily required coverage, the defendant has directly promised to pay the insured plaintiff under certain conditions. Because it is a promise by the insurer to pay its own insured, rather than a promise to its insured to pay some third party, the uninsured motorist coverage is in insurance parlance \"first party coverage\u201d like collision, comprehensive, medical payments or personal injury protection, and not \"third party coverage\u201d such as personal injury or property damage liability insurance. A suit based upon the insured\u2019s allegations that he is entitled to payment under one of the first party coverage clauses in the contract he entered into with his insurance carrier, and that the carrier has refused payment thereby breaching its promise, is clearly a contract action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The Supreme Court of Montana pointed out in <em>Dominici v. State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., supra, </em>143 Mont. at 411, that \" 'uninsured motorist insurance more closely resembles accident insurance restricted to a limited class of accident, than it does the type of insurance commonly regarded as indemnity insurance.\u2019 \u201d Thus, under the statutorily required uninsured motorist coverage, the insured pays a premium in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>return for the insurer\u2019s promise to pay if certain conditions are met. The statutory conditions do not require that the insured prove in an action against his insurer that the uninsured motorist was negligent, that the insured was free of negligence, and what the damages were. As pointed out in the <em>Reese </em>case, this is not a tort cause of action based on negligence. Instead, the condition is that the insured prove that he \"is entitled to recover\u201d damages in a specified amount from the uninsured motorist. If he already has a valid, final tort judgment against the uninsured motorist, he has met the statutory condition regardless of which party might be deemed to be negligent in a later contract action or what the \"proper\u201d damages might be ascertained to be in such contract action. Like other statutorily required first party coverages, if the premium was paid and the statutory conditions were met, the insurer is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">We stated in <em>Reese </em>that in light of the statutory language, the insured has different options for establishing that he \"is entitled to recover\u201d from the uninsured motorist. \"He has the option of bringing a contract action against his insurer or a tort action against the uninsured motorist.\u201d 285 Md. at 554. Under MAIF\u2019s argument in the instant case, however, the insured would have no real option. If the \"consent to sue\u201d clause is valid, and if the insurer is not bound by the outcome in the tort case, the insurer can always require that the insured bring a contract action against the insurer in order to establish the tort liability of the uninsured motorist and the amount of tort damages. The insured would have no \"option\u201d to finally establish these tort issues in a tort suit against the uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The language of the statute mandating coverage for damages which the insured \"is entitled to recover\u201d from the uninsured motorist, as well as the language stating that compulsory arbitration clauses to determine such entitlement are \"prohibited and shall be of no legal force,\u201d lead to the conclusion that the \"consent to sue\u201d clause in the MAIF policy is void, and that MAIF is bound by the determinations in the tort suit regarding the uninsured motorist\u2019s liability and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>This conclusion is confirmed by the purpose underlying statutorily mandated uninsured motorist coverage. The courts have repeatedly stated that the purpose of uninsured motorist statutes is \"that each insured under such coverage have available the full statutory minimum to exactly the same extent as would have been available had the tortfeasor complied with the minimum requirements of the financial responsibility Law.\u201d <em>Webb v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>479 S.W.2d 148, 152 (Mo. App. 1972). Or, as stated by an Arizona court, the statutes reflect \"a public policy that every insured is entitled to recover the damages he or she would have been able to recover if the uninsured motorist had maintained a policy of liability insurance in a solvent company.\u201d <em>Dairyland Insurance Company v. Lopez, </em>22 Ariz.App. 309, 526 P.2d 1264, 1265 (1974). <em>See, e.g., Simpson v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>225 Kan. 508, 592 P.2d 445, 447-448 (1979); <em>Burgo v. Illinois Farmers Insurance Company, </em>8 Ill.App.3d 259, 290 N.E.2d 371, 373 (1972); <em>Glover v.

Mead, </em>14 Wash.App. 43, 47, 538 P.2d 865 (1975) (statute embodies \" 'the public policy that a claimant shall have the same rights in an uninsured motorist situation as he would have against a responsible third party.\u2019 \u201d). Moreover, it is settled that \"the remedial nature\u201d of the uninsured motorist statute \"dictates a liberal construction in order to effectuate its purpose of assuring recovery for innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents.\u201d <em>State Farm v. Md. Auto. Ins. Fund, supra, </em>277 Md. at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Turning to the present case, MAIF\u2019s position is flatly inconsistent with the purpose of placing the insured in the same position as he would have been if the tortfeasor had been insured, and inconsistent with the principle of liberal construction. If the tortfeasor Adams had been insured, the plaintiff Franz would have been able to recover the full tort judgment of $3,182.84 plus court costs. For MAIF to be able to disregard this judgment, even though it had notice of the tort suit and an opportunity to intervene, clearly defeats the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>statutory purpose of placing Franz in the same posture as if Adams had been insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Finally, as the courts have generally recognized, considerations of judicial economy and the desirability of reducing litigation expenses militate against MAIF\u2019s position. Because an insurer \"may be bound\u201d by the judgment in the tort case, it has a right to intervene in the tort suit under both Maryland Rule 208 a (applicable to circuit court actions) and Maryland District Rule 208 a (applicable to District Court actions).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The right of an insurer to intervene in the tort suit under circumstances like those in the present case, and to defend against the insured\u2019s tort claim (regardless of whether the uninsured motorist is defending or not), is well recognized. <em>See, e.g., State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. v. Glover, </em>113 Ga.App. 815, 149 S.E.2d 852, 856 (1966); <em>Vernon Fire and Casualty Ins. Co. v. Matney, supra, </em>351 N.E.2d at 64-65; <em>Rawlins v. Stanley, </em>207 Kan. 564, 486 P.2d 840, 842-844 (1971); <em>Wells v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, supra, </em>459 S.W.2d at 259-260; <em>State v.

MFA Insurance Company, supra, </em>553 P.2d at 157-159. If an insurer, with notice of the tort suit and an opportunity to intervene, declines to do so, and if the insurer is entitled to re-litigate the issues in a later contract action, there will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>two separate court actions devoted to resolving the identical issues of tort liability and damages. A second unnecessary lawsuit represents neither a proper utilization of judicial resources nor a sound use of premium dollars. As was pointed out in <em>Indiana Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Noble, supra, </em>265 N.E.2d at 434:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">\"... there is no good reason to put the burden on the insured to relitigate the same issues in a second suit against the insurance company. It is sound legal policy to avoid multiplicity of suits and resolve disputes in one case where possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-6\"><em>See also State v. Craig, supra, </em>364 S.W.2d at 347; <em>Heisner v. Jones, supra, </em>184 Neb. at 608-609; <em>Keel v. MFA Insurance Company, supra, </em>553 P.2d at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">In defending the \"consent to sue\u201d clause, MAIF makes essentially three arguments: (1) the clause protects the insurance carrier from \"collusive judgments\u201d in the tort case; (2) requiring the insurer to intervene in the tort case may result in a conflict of interest; (3) the insurer may have policy defenses unrelated to the issues in the tort case, and these issues will in any event require a second lawsuit. Even if these arguments were highly persuasive, they would not justify our ignoring the plain language of the uninsured motorist statute. Moreover, we agree with the courts in our sister states that these arguments are not very persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">(1) Since, under the uninsured motorist statute and our intervention rules, the insurance carrier has a right to intervene in the tort action and to assert against the plaintiff insured any defenses which it has relating to tort liability or damages, regardless of whether the uninsured motorist raises such defenses or defends at all, the occurrence of \"collusive judgments\u201d is unlikely. The insurer, in oral argument before us, pointed to the possibility that the insured and the uninsured motorist would settle the tort suit, thereby depriving the insurance company of the right to assert defenses. However, the insurer can easily protect itself from being bound by such settlement. The standard uninsured motorist endorsement, and the endorsement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>the instant case, requires the insurer\u2019s consent to any settlement with the uninsured motorist. Unlike \"consent to sue\u201d clauses, \"consent to settle\u201d clauses are generally upheld, at least to the extent that settlements, consent judgments, releases, covenants not to sue, etc. between insureds and the uninsured motorists are not binding upon insurers unless the insurers have given their consent. <em>Dancy v.

Co., </em>550 S.W.2d 663 (Tex. 1977).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">(2) We agree with the insurance company that a conflict of interest may arise because of the uninsured motorist coverage. Thus, in defending against its insured in the tort action, the insurer might seek to establish that the insured was contributorily negligent and/or that the uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>motorist was free of negligence. On the other hand, if the uninsured motorist has or may have a claim against the insured, the insurer has a duty of defending its insured under the liability provisions of the policy and, in that connection, might want to show exactly the opposite, i.e., that the insured was not negligent and/or that the uninsured motorist was negligent. However, the potential for a conflict of interest does not arise simply because the \"consent to sue\u201d clause is invalid. Rather, the potential for such conflict is inherent in uninsured motorist coverage. <em>See </em>the discussion in <em>Vernon Fire and Casualty Ins. Co. v. Matney, supra, </em>351 N.E.2d at 65. Furthermore, the danger of conflict exists in other insurance situations, such as when the plaintiff and defendant in a tort case have the same liability insurer, or when the plaintiff in a tort case presents claims against the insured which are both within and without the policy coverage. <em>See, e.g., Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 409, 347 A.2d 842 (1975). Such conflicts, if they occur, are resolved by having the insurer provide an independent attorney to defend the insured against any liability claims. <em>Brohawn, supra, </em>276 Md. at 411-413, and cases there cited. The Supreme Court of Nebraska, after holding that the \"consent to sue clause\u201d in an uninsured motorist endorsement was void and that the insurer, having had notice and an opportunity to intervene, was bound by a default judgment in the tort case, stated with regard to the conflict point <em>(Heisner v. Jones, supra, </em>184 Neb. at 611):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">\"To give the uninsured motorist\u2019s carrier the right to intervene is to give assurance that it may litigate the issues and at the same time avoid the multiplicity of suits and the harassment of the insured by the necessity to litigate his rights twice. The terms of his contract and the uninsured motorist\u2019s statutes imply that they need to be litigated only once.... It is true that this may place the carrier in an inconvenient position with respect to the issues of negligence and contributory negligence. We see no difference between this situation and the common situation where the carrier has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>coverage on two insureds involved in the same accident. Beyond that the carrier receives a separate premium for a policy which on its face requires it to be placed in an ambivalent or inconsistent position and it therefore calculatedly assumes the inconveniences that may arise from that situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">(3) The final point made in argument before us is that an insurer may have policy defenses unrelated to the issues in the tort suit against the uninsured motorist, and that, therefore, a second contract suit against the insurer may be necessary in any event. The short answer to this contention is that, under the insurance company\u2019s position, two lawsuits are going to be required in every case when the uninsured motorist seeks to enforce his legal right to obtain a judgment ag\u00e1inst the uninsured tortfeasor and the insurer will not consent to the prosecution of the suit. However, if the insurer having notice of the tort suit is bound by the outcome of that litigation, a second suit will ordinarily be required only in those relatively few instances when the insurer has contractual defenses unrelated to the tort issues. Moreover, in many of these instances, the contractual matters could be litigated in the underlying tort suit. Under Rule 313, contract and tort claims may be joined in a single action. <em>Bogley v. Middleton Tavern, </em>288 Md. 645, 647-648, 421 A.2d 571 (1980); <em>Harkins v. August, </em>251 Md. 108, 110, 246 A.2d 268 (1968); <em>Osborn v. Swetnam, </em>221 Md. 216, 220, 156 A.2d 654 (1959). Furthermore, when an initial claim is in tort, a counterclaim, cross-claim or third-party claim may be in contract, and vice versa. <em>See, Allen &amp; Whalen v. Grimberg Co., </em>229 Md. 585, 586-587, 185 A.2d 337 (1962). Thus, if the insurer intervenes in the underlying tort case, the plaintiff insured could amend his declaration and add a contract claim against the insurer grounded upon the uninsured motorist endorsement. Moreover, in a circuit court action, if an insured plaintiff fails to assert a contract claim against the insurer under the endorsement, but if an actual controversy concerning coverage exists apart from the \"tort\u201d issues, the insurer could make a claim against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>the plaintiff under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Code (1974, 1980 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-401, et seq., of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. <em>Cf., Master v. Master, </em>223 Md. 618, 626, 166 A.2d 251 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">For the reasons discussed above, we hold that MAIF, having had notice of the tort action against the uninsured motorist and ample opportunity to intervene, was bound by the judgment in the tort suit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">\n<em>II. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Webb</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">William Jackson Webb, a resident of Salisbury, Maryland, was driving his 1970 Chevrolet automobile in the City of Salisbury on October 13, 1977, when, at an intersection controlled by a traffic light, his vehicle collided with an automobile driven by Arthur Brownell Jones. According to Webb, he was properly proceeding through the intersection on a green light and the accident was caused by Jones\u2019s negligence in failing to stop for a red light.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>At the time of the accident, Webb\u2019s automobile was insured under a policy which had been issued by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company on October 29,1976. The sheet of the policy listing the \"Schedule Of Coverages\u201d disclosed that there was uninsured motorist coverage for bodily injuries limited to $20,000.00 for a single injury and $40,000.00 for an accident, and for property damage limited to $5,000.00. Shortly after the accident, Webb notified Nationwide that he \"might have a claim under the uninsured motorist\u2019s provision\u201d of his policy. Nationwide, on April 7, 1978, wrote to Webb stating that \"we must deny your uninsured motorist claim.... After talking with all parties involved in this accident we are still unable to prove who was the negligent party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Meanwhile, on April 3,1978, Webb, by his attorney, filed a tort action in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County against Jones. By letter dated July 31, 1978, Jones\u2019s attorney notified Webb\u2019s attorney that Jones \"had no insurance on his vehicle at the time of the accident.\u201d Consequently, on August 23, 1978, Webb\u2019s attorney notified Nationwide that Jones was an uninsured motorist, that Webb had filed suit against him in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County and that the matter was awaiting trial assignment. Nationwide was also informed of the case number and the name and address of Jones\u2019s attorney. Upon receipt of this information on August 24, 1978, Nationwide did nothing. About four months later, the tort suit was tried and judgment was entered in favor of Webb for $16,591.77 plus costs. Webb notified Nationwide of the judgment and requested payment. However, the insurer again denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The instant case was commenced when Webb filed a contract action against Nationwide in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, seeking the amount of the tort judgment ($16,591.77 plus costs) under the uninsured motorist coverage of his policy. Webb then filed a motion for summary judgment, on the theory that the insurer, having been notified of the tort action and having elected not to participate, was bound by the outcome of the tort suit with regard to the liability of the uninsured motorist to Webb and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>amount of damages. Nationwide answered by asserting certain contract defenses and filed its own motion for summary judgment. The principal defense was set forth as follows in Nationwide\u2019s answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">\"3. The uninsured motorist coverage sued upon in this cause of action is found in Form 576B, and entitled 'Family Protection Coverage.\u2019 A true copy of the same has been attached to the Plaintiffs Motion for the Production of Written Instruments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\"Under the Insuring Agreement, I, entitled Damages for Bodily Injury caused by uninsured automobiles, it is specifically provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">No judgment against any person or organization alleged to be legally responsible for the bodily injury shall be conclusive, as between the insured and the company, of the issues of liability of such person or organization or of the amount of damages to which the insured is legally entitled unless such judgment is entered pursuant to an action prosecuted by the insured with the written consent of the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">\"No where in the record of this case is there any evidence that the insured Plaintiff secured the written consent of the Defendant prior to prosecuting Civil Case 9496 in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">The other defense which Nationwide raised and has continued to rely upon, was that paragraph 5 of the \"Conditions\u201d section of endorsement number 576B, required the insured, in addition to giving the insurer notice of the tort suit against the uninsured motorist, to forward to the insurer \"a copy of the summons and complaint or other process served in connection with such legal action ....\u201d Nationwide claimed that this condition was breached and that it was, therefore, excused from liability under endorsement 576B.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the only ground on which Nationwide relied for having denied Webb\u2019s uninsured motorist \"claim\u201d up until the time of the tort suit, was that it did not know whether the uninsured motorist Jones was liable to Webb and it did not know the amount of damages. It argued that because it had not consented to the prosecution of the tort action, the outcome of that action was \"basically a meaningless judgment as far as we are concerned.\u201d Nationwide also relied on the insured\u2019s failure, after the tort suit was instituted, to forward copies of the suit papers. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court refused to enforce the \"consent to sue\u201d clause. With respect to condition 5 of the endorsement, relating to notice of the tort action, the circuit court found \"that the notice to them of August the 23rd, while not in strict compliance, is in substantial compliance and satisfies the obvious purpose of the requirements. The Company had an opportunity to do whatever it wanted to defend it [the tort action].\u201d The circuit court granted Webb\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Nationwide appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals decided the matter in the same opinion which resolved <em>Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund v. Franz. </em>As in the <em>Franz </em>case, the intermediate appellate court held that the \"consent to sue\u201d clause in an uninsured motorist endorsement was void. The appellate court held that Webb was entitled to summary judgment unless Nationwide suffered prejudice by not being notified of the tort suit until August 23, 1978, and not being sent copies of the suit papers, 44 Md.App. at 558. Although pointing out that \"[t]here has been no allegation by the insurer that noncompliance with the condition and the delayed notification prejudiced Nationwide from having a reasonable opportunity to protect its interest by intervention,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals nevertheless remanded the case under Maryland Rule 1071 \"to provide the insurer an opportunity to move to set aside the summary judgment if it can by affidavit or evidence convince the [circuit] court that a question of fact regarding such prejudice exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558-559.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Nationwide then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court, broadly challenging the opinion and judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. In the first \"question presented,\u201d Nationwide asserted that the uninsured motorist endorsement upon which it relied \"supports] ... its contention that it is not bound by the outcome of the tort case between its insured and the uninsured motorist\u201d and that the provisions of the endorsement \"do not diminish or reduce the insured\u2019s coverage ....\u201d Three other \"questions presented\u201d in the certiorari petition set forth specific arguments by the insurer similar to those dealt with in Part I of this opinion. We granted the petition and consolidated the case with <em>Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund v. Franz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\">If this case actually presented the same issues as <em>Franz, </em>what was said in Part I of this opinion would be dispositive. However, those issues cannot logically be reached in this case. The factual basis for Nationwide\u2019s position throughout this litigation, and the express premise of the first \"question\u201d in the certiorari petition, was that the uninsured motorist endorsement contained in Mr. Webb\u2019s policy was applicable, and that, under the terms of that endorsement, Nationwide was not bound by the outcome of the tort suit because it did not consent and because it did not receive the suit papers. However, the endorsement relied upon by Nationwide has no application to the controversy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">The uninsured motorist endorsement invoked by Nationwide in its answer and in its motion for summary judgment, and the endorsement included in its record extract in the Court of Special Appeals and in this Court, was endorsement number 576B. This is also the only uninsured motorist endorsement contained in Mr. Webb\u2019s insurance policy, which is also included in the record. No other uninsured motorist endorsement is contained in the record, or has been referred to throughout this litigation. The \"consent to sue\u201d and other policy provisions relied on by Nationwide are all found in endorsement number 576B. Endorsement number 576B, under \"exclusions,\u201d provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>\"This endorsement does not apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">(d) to any accident occurring in the state of Maryland if the Named Insured resides in the state of Maryland ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Later in the endorsement, after the specification of liability limits of $10,000 for each person and $20,000 for each accident, the endorsement contains the following provisions (underlining in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">\"This endorsement adds protection for you against bodily injury losses caused by uninsured motorists or hit-and-run drivers \u2014 when such accidents occur *outside the State of Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">\"*The Maryland Unsatisfied Judgment Fund, a similar protection, covers you within the State of Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">Because the named insured is a Maryland Resident, and because the accident in this case occurred within the State of Maryland, it is obvious that endorsement number 576B has no application to the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">Consequently, Nationwide cannot prevail because of the threshold issue contained in the first question presented in its certiorari petition. There are in this case no policy clauses supporting Nationwide\u2019s position. The entire foundation for Nationwide\u2019s contention that it is not bound by the tort judgment are two clauses in endorsement number 576B: (1) the consent to sue clause; (2) the requirement that the insured forward to the insurer the pleadings in the tort action. Since these clauses have no application to this accident, Nationwide\u2019s contention must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">The basis for the remand by the Court of Special Appeals was the clause in endorsement number 576B requiring that the insured give notice of the tort action and forward the pleadings. The asserted violation of this clause was the failure to forward the suit papers. The intermediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>appellate court, exercising its discretion under Rule 1071, gave Nationwide an opportunity to show that it was prejudiced by the violation of the clause. In light of the discovery that this clause has no application to the present controversy, we shall remand the case in order to give the Court of Special Appeals an opportunity to reconsider its exercise of discretion under Rule 1071.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\n<em>In Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund v.

Only a few cases have upheld the validity of \"consent to sue\u201d clauses, and none of them have dealt with a statute like Maryland\u2019s. In California, a \"consent to sue\u201d clause was upheld because of a state statute expressly sanctioning such clauses. Travelers Indemnity Company v. Kowalski, 233 Cal.App.2d 607, 43 Cal.Rptr. 843 (1965); Mills v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, 231 Cal.App.2d 124, 41 Cal.Rptr. 650, 653 (1964). The Supreme Court of Arkansas held invalid, on public policy grounds, a clause voiding coverage if a tort suit against the uninsured motorist were prosecuted to judgment without the insurer\u2019s consent, but it upheld a clause requiring the insurer\u2019s consent to sue for the judgment in the tort case to be binding upon the insurer. It should be noted that this decision was before a tort and contract claim could be joined in a single action in Arkansas. MFA Mutual Ins. Co. v. Bradshaw, 245 Ark. 95, 431 S.W.2d 252 (1968). The Supreme Court of New Hampshire in Kirouac v. Healey, 104 N.H. 157, 181 A.2d 634 (1962), indicated that a \"consent to sue\u201d clause would be valid because arbitration was permitted by the New Hampshire statute. This also appears to be the view in Illinois after a statute was enacted sanctioning the arbitration clause, although in that State a \"consent to sue\u201d clause does not seem to be enforceable when the insurance company fails to furnish a valid reason for refusing to permit the insured to obtain a judgment against the uninsured motorist.

It should be noted that the cases holding that \"consent to sue\u201d clauses are void and that insurers are bound by the judgments in the tort suits against uninsured motorists, have made no distinction between default judgments and other judgments in the tort actions. Many of these cases have involved default judgments. <em>See, e.g., </em>Clayton v. Alliance Mutual Casualty Company, 212 Kan. 640, 512 P.2d 507, 509-511 (1973); State v. Craig, 364 S.W.2d 343 (Mo.

Most of those cases which have refused to enforce \u201cconsent to settle\u201d clauses have done so in the context of settlements with a party other than the uninsured motorist.

Although not relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals or the respondent, it should be noted that there may be a wholly separate ground in this case for holding that MAIF is bound by the tort judgment. As indicated earlier, MAIF in this case flatly denied liability before the tort action was prosecuted. Even in those few jurisdictions in which \"consent to sue\u201d clauses are upheld, or those jurisdictions in which courts have not yet ruled upon the validity of \"consent to sue\u201d clauses, it is uniformly held that if the insurer disclaims liability under the uninsured motorist endorsement before the insured prosecutes to judgment or settles a suit against the uninsured tortfeasor, the insurer thereby waives the consent clauses and the insured is relieved of any duty to comply with the consent clauses. Under these circumstances, the insured may, without the insurer\u2019s consent, prosecute to judgment or settle the case against the uninsured tortfeasor, and the insurer will be bound by that judgment as to the issues of tort liability and damages. The insurer\u2019s denial of liability is deemed \"inconsistent with claiming the right under the policy to consent,\u201d Ford v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

In this connection, it should be noted that, although no pertinent policy clause in this case required notice to the insurer of the tort action, considerations of due process do require such notice in order for an insurer to be bound by the outcome of the tort action. <em>See </em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. v. Glover, 113 Ga.App. 815, 149 S.E.2d 852, 856 (1966); Vernon Fire and Casualty Ins. Co. v. Matney, 170 Ind.App. 45, 351 N.E.2d 60, 66 (1976). <em>See also </em>Wells v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, 459 S.W.2d 253, 259 (Mo. 1970). We are aware of no authority, however, supporting the position that the pleadings in the tort case must be forwarded to the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Even when the uninsured motorist endorsement specifically requires notice, it has been held that the requirement does \"not become operative until an insured reasonably believes he has an uninsured motorist claim.\u201d Finney v. Farmers Ins. Co., <em>supra, </em>586 P.2d at 524. In the instant case, the insured\u2019s attorney was informed by letter dated July 31, 1978, that Mr. Jones was uninsured, and he sent notice to Nationwide a few weeks later, on August 23,1978. This was four months before the trial of the tort case. It would certainly seem that such notice was sufficient to meet due process requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
