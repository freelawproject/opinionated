Ahmas, </em>943 F.2d 53, Nos. 90-5197, 90-5198 (6th Cir. Aug. 29, 1991) (table). According to his mandamus petition, Dawalibi has been incarcerated at various federal prisons since first being indicted on those offenses in 1989. During his time at FCI-Schuylkill in Pennsylvania, Dawalibi worked for prison officials as \u201can informant for the Special Investigation Supervisor,\u201d assisting with the detection of, and investigation into, crimes and disciplinary infractions by other inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">Dawalibi participated in one such investigation concerning a theft, and uncovered \u201cinmate Khabir Ahmad as [the] culprit.\u201d Ahmad was fired from his prison job because of the theft, and he retaliated against Dawalibi by assaulting him shortly thereafter. Dawalibi acted as a witness and prepared a statement for the federal prosecution of Ahmad in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Ahmad eventually entered a guilty plea for the assault on Dawalibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">In the years that followed, Dawalibi wrote the prosecutor and asked him to file a motion to reduce his criminal sentence for the Tennessee conviction pursuant to Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> based on Dawalibi\u2019s assistance in the prosecution of Ahmad. When no response was forthcoming, Dawalibi wrote to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office in the Middle District of Tennessee (\u201cthe Government\u201d). Dawalibi received a response from the Government stating that it did \u201cnot perceive that a sufficient basis exists to support a reduction\u201d of his sentence. Dawalibi implored the Government to reconsider, but it did not change its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-17\">Dawalibi then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, seeking an order from that court directing the Government to file a Rule 35(b) motion. The District Court dismissed the mandamus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), and denied Dawa-libi\u2019s motion for reconsideration. He then filed the instant mandamus petition, purportedly under the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act (\u201cCVRA\u201d). Therein he argues that by not filing a Rule 35(b) motion, the Government \u201chas flatly violated his right \u2018to be treated with fairness\u2019 under 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>3771(a)(8).\u201d Dawalibi also filed a \u201cmotion to seal,\u201d requesting that his name be stricken from \u201call official public documents related to [this] case ... in order to protect his privacy right under the CVRA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy available only in the most extraordinary of circumstances. <em>See In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir. 2005). To demonstrate that mandamus is appropriate, a petitioner must establish that he has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to issuance of the writ. <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996). At issue here is whether Dawalibi may compel the Government to act pursuant to Rule 35(b). He may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Where no cooperation agreement exists between the parties, as is the case here, the government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion is not reviewable, unless that refusal is either \u201cbased on an unconstitutional motive\u201d or \u201cnot rationally related to any legitimate Government end.\u201d <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>see also United States v. Friedland, </em>83 F.3d 1531, 1536 (3d Cir.1996). \u201c[A] claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even discovery or an evidentia-ry hearing.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Rather, the movant must make a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d of impropriety in the Government\u2019s refusal to seek a sentence reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">While Dawalibi perceives the Government\u2019s refusing to file a Rule 35(b) motion to be unfair, that is not enough under <em>Wade; </em>he has failed to demonstrate that its reasons for not doing so are either unconstitutional or arbitrary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This conclusion is further supported by the correspondence that he solicited from Assistant United States Attorney Hester and that Dawalibi attached to his filing in this Court. Thus, it cannot be said that Dawa-libi has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to mandamus relief. <em>Madden, </em>102 F.3d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Accordingly, we will deny Dawalibi\u2019s mandamus petition. Dawalibi\u2019s motion to seal is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-13\">. Rule 35(b) provides for the reduction of a defendant's criminal sentence if the defendant provides \"substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\">. Dawalibi\u2019s invocation of the CVRA to demonstrate the arbitrary nature of the Government\u2019s actions is unavailing. He has not been denied any right under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(a) which could form the basis for a mandamus petition to this Court. In particular, the Government's refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion as a reward for Dawalibi\u2019s cooperation in the prosecution of his assailant in no way amounts to a violation of his \"right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim\u2019s dignity and privacy.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(a)(8). Nor does that refusal relate to the crime of which he was a victim or to Dawalibi's status as victim in general. Simply put, the CVRA, including its provision of expedited mandamus review, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(d)(3), does not apply. As such, Dawalibi is not entitled to relief on his \"motion to seal.\u201d Moreover, even if the CVRA applied, its enforcement provision appears to prohibit the relief Dawalibi is seeking. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(d)(6) (\"[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his direction\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
