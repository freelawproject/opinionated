Watson alleged that he wished to sell a piece of real estate and was unable to do so after the defendants reported that the Internal Revenue Service had a lien on the property. Watson alleged that the lien was invalid and that the defendants thus acted wrongfully by reporting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">The defendants filed motions for summary judgment. LAAT explained that the contract to sell Watson\u2019s property had been placed in escrow with LAAT and that LAAT had examined the title to the property in anticipation of issuing a title insurance policy. The title examination showed that there were recorded notices of a tax lien on the property, and the IRS sent LAAT documentation showing that the payoff amount on the liens was $531,134. LAAT reported these liens on its commitment for title insurance. Yancy explained that she had been assigned as the \u201ccloser\u201d on the contract to sell Watson\u2019s property and that the sale was not closed as a result of the tax issues. The defendants asserted that they were entitled to summary judgment because they had no duty to accept Watson\u2019s assertion concerning the invalidity of the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-18\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The district court noted that Watson did not assert that there were no liens on his property. The court held that the defendants had no obligation to investigate Watson\u2019s claim that the liens were invalid and that Watson\u2019s claims were \u201centirely without merit\u201d because \u201cnone of the conduct alleged in the complaint violates any state or federal law.\u201d Watson, proceeding <em>pro </em>se, filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-19\">This court reviews the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Threadgill v. Prudential Sec. Group, Inc., </em>145 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-20\">Watson argues that the district court erred by granting the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, because he has viable claims against the defendants pursuant to various statutes. This argument is without merit. Watson does not have a viable claim against the defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982, because he has not alleged \u201can intentional act of racial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>discrimination by a defendant.\u201d <em>Vaughner v. Pulito, </em>804 F.2d 873, 877 (5th Cir.1986). He does not have a viable claim against the defendants under the criminal bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. He does not have a viable claim against the defendants under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426(a), which provides for suits against the United States, but not private parties, for an allegedly improper levy. Watson has no viable claim against the defendants under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3201, because it does not provide a basis for a civil suit by a seller of property, such as Watson, against a title company, such as LAAT, that reported the existence of recorded notices of liens. Watson has no viable claim against the defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, because he has not alleged a violation of his constitutional rights by a state actor. He has no viable claim against the defendants under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331, which provides for levies by the IRS against those who have wrongfully refused to pay taxes. Finally, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 is not a basis for a viable claim against the defendants because Watson has not shown that his suit arises under \u201cthe Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">We decline Watson\u2019s request that we \u201creview the court cases of the original claim.\u201d Incorporation of other documents by reference is not permitted in appellate briefs. <em>See Peel &amp; Co., Inc. v. The Rug Market, </em>238 F.3d 391, 398-99 (5th Cir. 2001); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). To the extent that Watson raises arguments in his reply brief that were not presented in his opening brief, we decline to consider them. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>426 F.3d 301, 304 n. 2 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Watson has not shown that he had a viable claim against the defendants or that the district court erred by granting their motions for summary judgment. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
