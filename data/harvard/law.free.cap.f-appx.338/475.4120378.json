Davis\u2019s motion to vacate sought to challenge his 2008 conviction and sentence due to lack of subject matter and territorial jurisdiction. Thus, the motion should have been construed as arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Although Davis\u2019s direct appeal was pending when he filed the motion to vacate, the district court had jurisdiction to consider the motion in exceptional circumstances. <em>See Woollard v. United States, </em>416 F.2d 50, 51 (5th Cir.1968). Nevertheless, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Davis\u2019s motion is properly construed as arising under \u00a7 2255, this court lacks jurisdiction over the instant appeal absent a certificate of appealability (COA) ruling in the district court. <em>See United States v. Youngblood, </em>116 F.3d 1113, 1114-15 (5th Cir.1997). The district court did not construe Davis\u2019s notice of appeal as a COA request. However, this court declines to remand this case in light of the patent frivolity of Davis\u2019s appeal. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the instant appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
