Wooderts argues that his sentence, the Sentencing Guidelines, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 are unconstitutional and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing. Wooderts argues that the remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention because this court has refused to address arguments relating to the Guidelines in \u00a7 2255 motions. We review the dismissal of Wooderts\u2019s \u00a7 2241 application de novo. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Section 2255 provides \u201cthe primary means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence.\u201d <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, however, if a prisoner can demonstrate that the \u00a7 2255 remedy would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d he may be permitted to bring a habeas corpus claim pursuant to \u00a7 2241 instead. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting \u00a7 2255(e)) (emphasis omitted). Section 2255\u2019s savings clause applies to a claim \u201c(i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and \u201c(ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Wooderts has not advanced an argument that a Supreme Court case has rendered his conviction invalid. His ai-guments relate entirely to his sentence. Wooderts has not made the showing required to proceed under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
