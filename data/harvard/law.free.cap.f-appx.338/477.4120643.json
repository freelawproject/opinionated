Singh was convicted in February 2008 of delivery by actual transfer of less than one gram of cocaine, in violation of Texas Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code \u00a7 481.112, and he was sentenced to six months in county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-20\">In April 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) charged Singh with being deportable pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i) as an alien convicted of, respectively, an aggravated felony and a controlled substance violation. Singh admitted the factual allegations of the DHS, but the IJ ruled that Singh was not eligible for cancellation of removal due to his prior conviction of an aggravated felony related to a controlled substance. The IJ ordered Singh removed to Trinidad and Tobago.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-21\">Singh appealed to the BIA, arguing that the IJ violated his due process rights and that, because his conviction for delivery by actual transfer of less than one gram of cocaine was not an aggravated felony, the IJ erred in refusing to allow him to apply for cancellation of removal. The BIA rejected these claims and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>We have jurisdiction over Singh\u2019s legal and constitutional claims pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We generally review only the BIA\u2019s decision, not that of the IJ, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision influences the BIA. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We review the BIA\u2019s conclusions of law de novo, according deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretations of ambiguous provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) in accordance with <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194,197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Singh argues that, because his cocaine delivery conviction under \u00a7 481.112 does not constitute an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the INA in light of <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714-15 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>551 U.S. 1156, 127 S.Ct. 3031, 168 L.Ed.2d 748 (2007), he is not deportable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2) (A) (iii) and not ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). The Texas statute of Singh\u2019s prior conviction provides that \u201ca person commits an offense if the person knowingly manufactures, delivers, or possesses with intent to deliver a controlled substance\u201d such as cocaine. \u00a7 481.112(a); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 418.112(b) (punishing such an offense as a \u201cstate jail felony\u201d if the aggregate drug quantity is less than one gram). In addition, Texas Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.002 defines \u201cdeliver\u201d in part, as used in \u00a7 481.112, to mean \u201cto transfer, actually or constructively, to another a controlled substance, counterfeit substance, or drug paraphernalia.\u201d Singh\u2019s judgment of conviction states that he was convicted of \u201cdelivery by actual transfer of cocaine less than 1 gram.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Delivery of cocaine by actual transfer is punishable under the CSA as a felony. The CSA states that \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to ... distribute ... a controlled substance,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), defines \u201cdistribute\u201d as meaning to \u201cdeliver,\u201d which in turn is defined as \u201cthe actual, constructive, or attempted transfer of a controlled substance,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(8) &amp; (11), and punishes distribution of cocaine in any amount by a term of imprisonment of not more than 20 years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c) (listing cocaine under Schedule II); \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (penalty provision). Because the judgment in Singh\u2019s prior case makes clear that Singh did not simply \u201coffer to sell\u201d the cocaine but delivered it by actually transferring it to another, and because that conduct is set forth as a distinct means of committing the offense in the statute of conviction, Singh\u2019s crime falls within the meaning of \u201caggravated felony\u201d in the INA. <em>See Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 464 (5th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">Singh argues that the BIA erred in treating his prior state drug conviction as an aggravated felony because the BIA relied on recidivist statutory provisions, but the argument is misplaced because the BIA did not in fact apply any recidivist provision under state or federal law in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">Singh also contends that the IJ and the BIA violated his due process rights. Due process is not implicated where the claimant has no liberty interest at stake in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the agency\u2019s action. <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.2002). Because there is no constitutionally protected liberty interest in the discretionary relief of cancellation of removal or in eligibility for that relief, Singh\u2019s due process claim is without merit. <em>See Manzano-Garcia v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 471 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-5\">. Singh has never argued that his judgment of conviction does not qualify as a <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) document on the basis that it does not reflect a \u201cfactual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d Therefore, we do not reach that question. See \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
