Pritchett on a plea of guilty to a prison term of 113 months, and a five-year term of supervised release, for conspiracy to distribute in excess of 500 grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. On April 21, 2004, the court granted the Government\u2019s Rule 35 motion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and reduced the prison term to 68 months (with credit for time served).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Pritchett was released from prison and began his term of supervised release on December 18, 2007. On August 27, 2008, the District of Kansas transferred jurisdiction over the supervised release to the Middle District of Georgia. On November 17, 2008, that district\u2019s probation office petitioned the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia to revoke the supervised release. The petition alleged that Pritchett\u2019s urine had tested positively for amphetamine and methamphetamine in July 2008, and for hydroeo-done and hydromorphone in October 2008, and that he had failed to participate in an approved substance abuse program as directed by his probation officer and to submit to urinalysis on two occasions, in July and October 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">The district court convened a revocation hearing on December 18, 2008. Pritchett appeared with counsel and admitted the violations. The Guidelines prescribed a sentence range of 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, with a statutory maximum of 60 months. The district court found the Guidelines range inadequate because of Pritchett\u2019s \u201ccontinued drug usage while being afforded treatment,\u201d and that, given his addiction, he presented a danger to society and himself, and sentenced Pritch-ett to a prison term of 24 months. The court recommended that he be afforded treatment in the Bureau of Prisons 500-hour Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (\u201cRDAP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Pritchett now appeals the sentence, arguing that, in light of the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the sentence is unreasonable; it is not necessary to accomplish \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals. The sentence should be set aside, he says, because the court either failed to take the \u00a7 3553(a) factors into account or failed to do so adequately. Moreover, the court failed to explain on the record why a sentence of 24 months was necessary, in that other treatment options are available and the 500-hour RDAP only has a duration of 9-12 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">We review a sentence imposed for revocation of supervised release for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106 (11th Cir.2006), using the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 45-47, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first determine whether the \u201cdistrict court committed ... significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">Section 3583 provides that a district court may revoke a term of supervised release and impose a sentence of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>ment after considering the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), and (a)(4)-(7), including the need to provide a defendant with additional correctional treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), (e). However, consideration of \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors is <em>not </em>required when revocation of supervised release is mandatory. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1241 (11th Cir.2000). Revocation of supervised release is mandatory if, among other things, the defendant possesses an illegal drug or refuses to comply with drug testing in violation of the conditions of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1, 3). That is the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">The maximum term of imprisonment for revocation of supervised release is 60 months where the offense that resulted in the supervised release is a Class A felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1). An offense authorizing a term of imprisonment of life is a Class A felony. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3559(a)(1). The maximum term of imprisonment for conspiring to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing methamphetamine is life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b), 846. The Guidelines recommend 6-12 months\u2019 imprisonment for a Grade C violation of supervised release for a defendant, like Pritchett, with a criminal history category of IV. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">\u201cThere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The challenger \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009). While \u201ca court cannot impose an initial incarcerative sentence for the purpose of providing a defendant with rehabilitative treatment .... a court may consider a defendant\u2019s rehabilitative needs when imposing a specific incarcerative term following revocation of supervised release.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1241. Additionally, \u201c[w]here the original sentence was the result of a downward departure,\u201d as in Pritchett\u2019s case, \u201can upward departure may be warranted\u201d when sentencing for revocation of supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4 App. n. 4. When a court imposes a sentence outside of the guidelines, it must explain why it did so. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir. 2008). In holding a particular sentence to be reasonable, we have noted it was appreciably below the statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Pritchett to prison for 24 months. The court was not required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it explained why it imposed a sentence above the prescribed Guidelines sentence range, and we are satisfied that the sentence is substantively reasonable, since it falls well below the statutory maximum of 60 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-12\">. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
