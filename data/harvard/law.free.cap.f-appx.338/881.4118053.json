The district court denied the motion because Warrick was held responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, such that Amendment 706 did not affect his guideline range. On appeal, Warrick argues that, (1) although he was responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, he was eligible for a reduction, (2) the continued disparities in cocaine and crack cocaine sentences and the unequal application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), violated the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses; (3) the court has discretion to reduce his sentenced because <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only; and (4) his sentence was unreasonable under \u00a7 3553(a) because it was greater than necessary. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-14\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582 \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-16\">The district court properly denied \u00a7 3582 relief, because Warrick\u2019s guideline range was not lowered by Amendment 706, given that he was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, and Amendment 706 only lowered base offense levels for quantities of crack cocaine less than 4.5 kilograms. <em>See James, </em>548 F.3d at 986 (holding that the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in sentence because he had been held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>crack cocaine, and Amendment 706 did not lower his guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Additionally, Warrick\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument fails, because <em>Booker </em>is not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment and cannot be a jurisdictional basis for \u00a7 3582 relief. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009) (holding that neither <em>Booker </em>nor <em>Kimbrough </em>render a guideline range advisory in the context of a \u00a7 3582 proceeding, whether or not the guideline range is reduced by a sentencing amendment); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>did not provide a jurisdictional basis for \u00a7 3582 relief because it was not a sentencing amendment). Warrick\u2019s due process and equal protection arguments also fail, because a \u00a7 3582 proceeding \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentenc-ing\u201d and does not permit the district court to address \u201cextraneous resentencing issues,\u201d including constitutional claims. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that the district court correctly declined to consider the defendant\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim in the context of a \u00a7 3582 proceeding). Finally, because Warrick was not entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 706, the district court did not err in failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cGiven that [defendant\u2019s] sentencing range did not change, the district court correctly recognized that it had no authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence and that it did not need to examine the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
