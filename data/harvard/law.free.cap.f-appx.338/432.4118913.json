Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). Under the plain language of the Real ID Act, this court does not have jurisdiction to review \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1255.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). As such, we are statutorily barred from reviewing the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s purely discretionary denial of adjustment of status. <em>Ayanbadejo v. Chertoff, </em>517 F.3d 273, 275, 276-78 &amp; 277 n. 11 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Odero attempts to circumvent this jurisdictional limitation by asserting that her claims on appeal are legal and constitutional challenges. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). She first claims that the IJ committed legal error by requiring that she prove that her marriage to a United States citizen was bona fide and viable despite her being the beneficiary of an approved 1-130 visa petition. This argument is unavailing. <em>Hadwani, </em>445 F.3d at 800; <em>see also INS v. Chadha, </em>462 U.S. 919, 937, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983) (explaining that classification as an immediate relative does not automatically entitle an alien to adjustment of status). Odero also contends that the IJ and BIA violated her right to a full and fair hearing. \u201cThis circuit has repeatedly held that discretionary relief from removal, including an application for an adjustment of status, is not a liberty or property right that requires due process protection.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 440 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, Odero can claim no fundamental liberty interest in applying for or receiving an adjustment of status, and her due process claim fails. Accordingly, because Odero\u2019s challenge to the discretionary denial of her application for adjustment of status does not raise a substantial question of law or constitutional claim, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider it. <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475-76 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">Accordingly, Odero\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
