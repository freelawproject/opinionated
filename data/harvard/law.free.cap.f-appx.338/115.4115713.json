The government has moved for summary affirmance. Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will grant the motion. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-27\">In October 2004, a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania returned an indictment against Robinson charging him with three counts of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and one count of possession of heroin by a federal prisoner in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(2). Robinson pled guilty to all counts, and, on November 14, 2006, was sentenced to an aggregate term of 151 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 5 years of supervised relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 26, 2008, we affirmed the judgment of sentence. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>293 Fed.Appx. 958 (3d Cir .2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Meanwhile, on July 29, 2008, Robinson filed in the District Court a motion titled \u201cNotice and Demand to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction-28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1359; F.R.C.P. Rules 9(b), 12(b)(1), 12(h)(3).\u201d (Dist.Ct. Dkt.# 49.) In the motion, Robinson claimed that the District Court never had jurisdiction over his criminal case because \u201cit lacked exclusive jurisdiction over the exact geographical location where the alleged criminal activity mentioned in the indictment was alleged to have taken place.\u201d (Dist.Ct.Dkt.# 49, p. 2.) The government opposed the motion on the ground that Robinson\u2019s argument was meritless. By order entered August 25, 2008, the District Court denied the motion. Robinson sought reconsideration, but the District Court denied his request. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Upon review, we conclude that the District Court properly denied relief. It is well established that the district courts have original jurisdiction over \u201coffenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. The indictment here charged Robinson with violations of two federal criminal statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(2). There can be no question, then, that the District Court had jurisdiction over Robinson\u2019s case. Therefore, the court properly denied Robinson\u2019s motion, and his subsequent request for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will grant the government\u2019s motion and summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s orders. <em>See </em>Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-19\">. The District Court initially entered judgment against Robinson in February 2005, but amended the judgment in November 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
