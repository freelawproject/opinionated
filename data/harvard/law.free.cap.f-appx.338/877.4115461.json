The court reduced Washington\u2019s sentence to the low end of his amended guideline range based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. On appeal, Washington argues that the district court erred because his reduced sentence violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because it was higher than the applicable statutory maximum, given that the jury verdict did not specify the amount of drugs for which he was responsible. He also submits that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which rendered the Guidelines advisory, applies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, but he acknowledges that his position in contrary to our recent decision in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-21\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>mission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, state that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The court did not err by declining to reduce Washington\u2019s sentence below the low end of the amended range because the court was not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to make such a reduction, given that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A); <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192 (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d). Furthermore, the court did not err by not applying <em>Apprendi </em>in resentencing Washington because such a consideration was outside the scope of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (declining to address in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding an Eighth Amendment argument and noting that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d); <em>see also Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1193 (stating that district court had power under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only to reduce defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cconsistent with the applicable policy statements of the Sentencing Commission.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
