Burrell\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706, which amended the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses. The district court denied the motion, finding that Burrell was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and thus any reduction would not be consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-15\">On appeal, Burrell argues that the guidelines were advisory in the \u00a7 3582 context, and the court should consider his post-sentencing conduct and the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He also argues that he had a right to an attorney throughout the \u00a7 3582 proceedings. Additionally, Burrell contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act during the original sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-16\">We review the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir. 2005). Where the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, however, review is <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003). The district court may reduce the sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d provided that \u201csuch a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-17\">Amendment 706, which has been made retroactive, amends the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2D1.1(c) \u201cto provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number><em>denied, McFadden v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). However, if a defendant is a career offender, his base offense level is determined under the career offender guideline in \u00a7 4B1.1(b), and not the drug quantity guideline in \u00a7 201.1(c). 541 F.3d at 1327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">For this reason, we held in <em>Moore </em>that Amendment 706 has no effect on the applicable guideline range for defendants who are sentenced under the career offender guideline. <em>Id. </em>In addition, <em>Booker </em>does not provide an independent jurisdictional basis for an ineligible defendant to receive a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Burrell was sentenced as a career offender and is therefore ineligible for relief under Amendment 706. In addition, because Burrell is ineligible for a \u00a7 3582 sentence reduction, <em>Booker </em>cannot be applied on its own to permit such a reduction to take place. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">With regard to Burrell\u2019s argument that the district court should have assigned counsel to assist him in the \u00a7 3582 proceedings, Burrell never filed a motion for counsel in the district court. Moreover, defendants are not entitled to counsel in post-conviction proceedings. <em>See Barbour v. Haley, </em>471 F.3d 1222, 1227-28 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>551 U.S. 1134, 127 S.Ct. 2996, 168 L.Ed.2d 707 (2007). Finally, Burrell\u2019s arguments regarding errors in his original sentence are foreclosed because such considerations were outside the scope of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, as \u201c[t]his Circuit has been very clear in holding that a sentencing adjustment undertaken pursuant to Section 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a de novo resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
