On appeal, Pai-son argues, through counsel, that our holding in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) <em>(per </em>curiam), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>affirmed the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on a crack cocaine amount unaffected by Amendment 706, is inapplicable even though Parson was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. He asserts that (1) the statutory maximum sentence for his crime of conviction is thirty years of imprisonment because the indictment only charged him with a detectable amount of cocaine and crack cocaine, (2) the district court was required to recalculate a new sentence, and (3) the life sentence imposed exceeded the court\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">We \u201creview <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) <em>(per curiam). </em>A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission \u2014 and is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. <em>Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Here, the district court properly denied \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Parson\u2019s guideline range was not lowered as a result of Amendment 706. Parson was held accountable for more than 200 kilograms of crack cocaine, and Amendment 706 only lowered the base offense levels for quantities of crack cocaine less than 4.5 kilograms. <em>See Jones, </em>548 F.3d at 1369 (holding that the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in sentence because he had been held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, and Amendment 706 did not lower his guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Parson\u2019s argument concerning the applicable statutory maximum appears to be based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), in which the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. However, <em>Apprendi </em>is not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment, and, therefore, cannot be a basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(per curiam) </em>(observing that <em>Booker </em>did not provide a basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because it was \u201ca Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Because Parson is not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief and <em>Apprendi </em>is not applicable, Parson\u2019s argument that the court must recalculate his guidelines range is also meritless. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009) <em>(per curiam </em>) (noting that where Amendment 706 did not change the guideline range, the district court correctly found that it need not examine the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors). Consequently, the district court properly denied Parson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
