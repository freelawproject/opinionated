Stacker argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), which applies where a \u201cdangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed,\u201d because when police searched his house a pistol was found in a separate room from the cocaine and drug paraphernalia. He argues that the district court erred in finding the weapon was \u201caccessible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">When reviewing for procedural error in the application of the Guidelines, we examine the district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings for clear error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A \u00a7 2D1.1 enhancement is appropriate if a weapon is present \u201cunless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">In <em>United States v. </em>McKeever,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this Court affirmed a \u00a7 2D1.1 enhancement even though the weapons were not in the same room as the drugs: \u201cWhile it is true that none of these weapons was discovered in the laboratory area, the judge was entitled to infer that they were still \u2018present\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>within the meaning of Application Note 3.\u201d Here, the record establishes that an operational .380 caliber pistol was found in Stacker\u2019s residence the day after Stacker had sold illegal drugs from the residence. It is not clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
