We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-18\">Carter was employed by Nationwide in a secretarial position. The Plan paid her long-term disability benefits for fourteen months after she stopped working. It then terminated the benefits after deciding that Carter no longer qualified as disabled. This decision was based on a review of Carter\u2019s medical records and several examinations performed by independent physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-19\">Carter\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the Plan abused its discretion in making this determination, primarily in its weighing of evaluations by her personal physicians versus those of the independent doctors. She also argues that a recent Supreme Court decision has changed the law such that closer scrutiny of the benefits decision in this case is required. <em>See Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-22\">Essentially for the reasons explained by the district court in its initial opinion, we conclude that no abuse of discretion has been shown. <em>Glenn </em>was decided after the district court\u2019s initial order. The district court issued a subsequent opinion finding that <em>Glenn </em>made no significant change to the standard of review. Decision from this court after <em>Glenn </em>have not answered all the questions the new decision poses for the \u201csliding scale\u201d standard of deference previously employed by this circuit. It is clear, though, that <em>Glenn </em>requires no more than that a potential conflict of interest must be considered as one factor among many in assessing whether an abuse of discretion occurred. It does not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>de novo </em>review of claim denials. <em>See Sanders v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>553 F.3d 922, 925 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">This is not a case where the other considerations are in such complete equipoise that we must use the conflict as a \u201ctiebreaker\u201d to determine whether there was an abuse of discretion. <em>Glenn, </em>128 S.Ct. at 2351. The issue was not whether Carter suffered from any pain or physical symptoms, but whether she was disabled from working as defined by her policy. The Plan was under no burden to \u201caccord special weight to the opinions of\u2019 Carter\u2019s personal physicians, nor was there \u201cany discrete burden of explanation when [the Plan] credited] reliable evidence\u201d from the multiple independent evaluations that conflicted with Carter\u2019s preferred evidence. <em>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, </em>538 U.S. 822, 834, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed\u00fcd 1034 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Carter has not shown that the district court committed any error. Accordingly, its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
