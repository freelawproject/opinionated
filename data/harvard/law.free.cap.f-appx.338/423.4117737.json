Osei seeks review only of the denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The parties agree that the relevant issue is when Osei agreed to plead guilty to a 1996 state charge of credit card abuse. If an agreement was reached before April 24, 1996, then Osei was eligible for relief under former \u00a7 212(c); if an agreement was reached after April 23, 1996, then he was not eligible for relief. The BIA found that Osei had \u201cnot shown that he entered a plea agreement before April 24, 1996.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Osei argues, inter alia, that the BIA applied the wrong standard in finding that he \u201centered\u201d his plea after April 24, 1996. The parties agree that the relevant regulation provides that in evaluating the alien\u2019s eligibility for relief, one factor for consideration is whether the alien was eligible to apply for relief \u201cunder the standards that were in effect at the time the alien\u2019s plea was made, regardless of when the plea was entered by the court.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(b)(4). Despite its citation to \u00a7 1003.44(b) in its order, the BIA erred by considering the date Osei\u2019s plea was entered rather than the date it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The Government argues that, based on the record evidence, a remand would be futile. However, because the BIA has applied an improper standard, we conclude remand is appropriate in this case. <em>See INS v.

INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 306 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
