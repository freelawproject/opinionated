Morgan, a federal prisoner convicted of a crack cocaine offense, appeals through counsel the sentence the district court imposed after granting his <em>pro se </em>motion for a sentence reduction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to offenses involving crack cocaine. The district court found that Amendment 706 reduced Morgan\u2019s guideline sentencing range from 168 to 210 months to 135 to 168 months, and imposed a sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Morgan argues that district court erred by failing to consider <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether a further reduction was appropriate. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2002). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(e)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. \u201cInitially, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Next, the court must decide, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in its discretion, whether it will impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Morgan\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument is without merit, because <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and the district court was, therefore, not authorized to reduce Morgan\u2019s sentence below the low end of the amended guideline range. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009); <em>see also, </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) (prohibiting a court from reducing a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">The record demonstrates that the district court calculated Morgan\u2019s amended Guideline range and, after applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 departure Morgan received at his initial sentencing, sentenced Morgan at the low end of the guideline range. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780; <em>see also, </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) (allowing comparable reduction for departures imposed at initial sentencing). While the district court did not state that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining the extent of the reduction, and specifically stated that it would not consider these factors in determining whether a further reduction was warranted, the court was not authorized to further reduce Morgan\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) (prohibiting reduction to a \u201cterm that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range\u201d). Thus, even if the court erred by not considering the \u00a7 3553(a) fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>tors in determining the extent of the reduction, such error is harmless, because Morgan would not have received a lower sentence even if the court had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Arevalo-Juarez, </em>464 F.3d 1246, 1252 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that we will \u201caffirm for harmless error in the sentencing context if ... the sentencing court would have likely sentenced the defendant in the same way absent the error\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B 1.10(b)(2)(A). Accordingly, we affirm Morgan\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
