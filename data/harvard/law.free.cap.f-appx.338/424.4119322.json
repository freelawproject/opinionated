Shorty\u2019s complaint alleged, inter alia, that the confiscation of his bedding for eighteen days and of his clothing for over two months in the winter of 2007, forcing him \u201cto sleep on a concrete slab with only my shorts in the winter,\u201d violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Given the liberality to be afforded <em>pro se </em>pleadings and the absence of a <em>Spears </em>hearing or the like, we conclude that this <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim, without leave to amend, was error. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 2326-27, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991); <em>Helling v.

R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
