Reed\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. On ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>peal, Reed argues that he was not sentenced as a career offender because the district court found that Reed\u2019s career offender criminal history category of VI overrepresented his prior criminal conduct, and, therefore, it departed downward, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, to a criminal history category of IV. Reed attempts to distinguish our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), by arguing that none of the career offender defendants in <em>Moore </em>had received a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has \u201csubsequently been lowered\u201d by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B), (c)(2). Amendment 706, which has been made retroactive, amends the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e) \u201cto provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. However, if a defendant is a career offender, his base offense level is determined under the career offender guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b) and not the drug quantity guideline in \u00a7 2D1.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. A defendant is only entitled to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction if an amendment actually reduces his applicable guideline range. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. In this case, Amendment 706 did not reduce Reed\u2019s applicable guideline range because his final offense level was based on the career offender provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and not the \u00a7 2D1.1 table that Amendment 706 changed. Therefore, because Reed\u2019s applicable guideline range remained unaffected by Amendment 706, he was not entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, we hereby affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
