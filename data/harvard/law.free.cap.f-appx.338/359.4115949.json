The district court found that it lacked jurisdiction over her employment discrimination claim because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies prior to filing suit. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b382-16\">Fobbs is an employee of the Postal Service. Fobbs was long employed as a mail carrier in New Orleans, but in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, she was reassigned to a temporary position with the Mesquite Post Office in the Dallas, Texas area. At the time of her reassignment, Fobbs had attained a Level Six employment position. A few months after her transfer, on June 7, 2006, the Postal Service notified Fobbs that she had been downgraded to a Level Five position. Fobbs contends that she was the only reassigned employee downgraded in this manner and that all other employees reassigned due to Hurricane Katrina retained their prior employment grade level. Fobbs alleges that her downgrade violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a (\u201cADEA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">Fobbs filed a complaint with the Postal Service\u2019s Equal Employment Office (\u201cEEO\u201d) to challenge her downgrade. An administrative hearing on her complaint was held on July 10, 2007, and the EEO Administrative Judge subsequently en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>tered a finding of no discrimination. Fobbs appealed that decision to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), which affirmed on October 23, 2007. On November 11, 2007, Fobbs filed a request for reconsideration of the EEOC decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">While the request for reconsideration was still pending, Fobbs filed the instant suit in the district court on January 14, 2008, and the Postal Service moved to dismiss. On October 2, 2008, the district court dismissed Fobbs\u2019s complaint without prejudice for failure to properly exhaust her administrative remedies. Fobbs appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including the determination of whether the exhaustion requirement is satisfied, <em>de novo. Pacheco v. Mineta, </em>448 F.3d 783, 788 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Hebert v. United States, </em>53 F.3d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1994) (\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s granting of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">A federal employee who wishes to sue for discrimination under Title VII or the ADEA must first exhaust her administrative remedies. See <em>Pacheco, </em>448 F.3d at 788; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.407. Fobbs properly filed a discrimination charge with her agency\u2019s EEO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the Postal Service denied her claim, Fobbs had a choice: appeal to the EEOC or file suit in district court. <em>Tolbert v. United States, </em>916 F.2d 245, 248 (5th Cir.1990). Fobbs appealed the EEO administrative finding of no discrimination to the EEOC, and the EEOC affirmed. At that point, Fobbs had ninety days to file her suit in federal court. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.407.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">Instead, Fobbs asked the EEOC to reconsider its decision. Once Fobbs chose to continue along the administrative relief path by requesting reconsideration by the EEOC she was required to wait until that administrative remedy was exhausted. <em>Cf. Tolbert, </em>916 F.2d at 248; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.407 (a federal employee otherwise eligible to proceed to district court with her Title VII or ADEA employment discrimination claim may only do so \u201c[wjithin 90 days of the Commission\u2019s final action on appeal,\u201d or \u201cafter 180 days from the date of the filing of an appeal with the Commission if there has been no final decision by the Commission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">Fobbs filed suit in the district court both before the EEOC\u2019s \u201cfinal action\u201d on her appeal \u2014 a decision on her request for reconsideration \u2014 and before 180 days passed from her filing of that request. A premature filing is a failure to exhaust administrative remedies and requires dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Tolbert, </em>916 F.2d at 249. The fact that the EEOC entered a final decision denying Fobbs\u2019s request for reconsideration while the motion to dismiss was pending in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>district court does not change our analysis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Finding no error, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-11\">. Although the district court stated that Fobbs initiated her charges in an EEOC complaint, Fobbs in fact initiated her discrimination charges with the Postal Service's EEO. Federal employees must first file a charge of discrimination with the EEO division of their agency. This is in contrast to private sector employees, who exhaust their administrative remedies by first filing a charge with tire EEOC. <em>Pacheco, </em>448 F.3d at 788 &amp; n. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AOe\">. The presence of Fobbs\u2019s ADEA claim in addition to her Title VII claim presents a minor distinction from <em>Tolbert, </em>but one without significance. The regulation our court interpreted in <em>Tolbert </em>was succeeded by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.407, which applies the 90- and 180-day windows to claims under Title VII, the ADEA, and the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
