Moore challenges the denial of his motion for a mistrial. Moore argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by inquiring on cross-examination about his prior convictions after he had stipulated to them. He also argues that the prosecutor violated the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d during closing argument by asking the jurors to place themselves in Moore\u2019s position. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">The denial of a motion for a mistrial is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 992 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2790, 174 L.Ed.2d 290 (2009). Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct present mixed questions of fact and law that are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Noriega, </em>117 F.3d 1206, 1218 (11th Cir. 1997). When we review an issue of prose-cutorial misconduct, we must determine (1) whether the challenged comments were improper and (2) if so, whether they prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Paul, </em>175 F.3d 906, 909 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cA defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudicially affected when a reasonable,probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial 'would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Moore\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on the cross-examination about his prior convictions. The district court sustained Moore\u2019s objection and provided a curative instruction for the jury to disregard the questions. Moore\u2019s prior convictions could have been admissible for impeachment, under Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(1), subject to the discretion of the district court. There was ample evidence that Moore was a felon who had intentionally possessed a firearm and ammunition. Moore has not established that, but for any error, the outcome of his trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-17\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it denied Moore\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on the closing argument of the prosecutor. In closing, the prosecutor urged the jurors to \u201cdraw on their own common sense, your life experiences.\u201d The prosecutor also invited the jurors to consider Moore\u2019s position for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>the purpose of evaluating Moore\u2019s credibility. Even if the prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper, it did not prejudice Moore\u2019s substantial rights. The district court provided a curative instruction, and there was ample evidence of Moore\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Moore\u2019s conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
