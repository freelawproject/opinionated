After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b914-26\">In November 2007, Harris was indicted on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Before trial, the parties stipulated that Harris was a convicted fel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>on. Thus, the only issue at trial was whether Harris possessed a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">At trial, Christopher Potter, a detective and former patrol officer with the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office, testified that he and Officer Alex Carrion responded to a reported automobile crash with injuries and found Harris lying on the ground a few feet from an overturned motorcycle. Harris rolled over, and Officer Potter saw a gun tucked into Harris\u2019s waistband. Harris moved his hand toward the gun, and Officer Potter drew his own gun and kicked Harris\u2019s hand away from the gun in Harris\u2019s waistband.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">There were two others at the scene: a male named Ernie Walden and a female named Christy Geiger. Potter acknowledged that, as he was kicking Harris\u2019s hand away from the gun in Harris\u2019s waistband, Walden said, \u201cNo, man, that\u2019s mine, I put that on him.\u201d Potter stated that Geiger \u201cstarted freaking out,\u201d was \u201cemotional,\u201d and cried. After the officers arrested Harris, Officer Potter went to speak to Geiger. Potter stated that Geiger \u201cseemed to be upset\u201d by the situation and was \u201caware ... that there was a real possibility that Mr. Harris was going to get shot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">On cross-examination, Officer Potter stated that he later determined that Walden had been operating the motorcycle at the time of the accident and that there had been no crash. Instead, Walden and Harris simply had fallen off the motorcycle, possibly because they were intoxicated. Potter admitted that he did not test for gun residue on either Harris\u2019s or Walden\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The government next called Officer Carrion. Carrion also saw the motorcycle laying a few feet away from Harris\u2019s position on the ground. Seeing a gun in Harris\u2019s waistband, Carrion drew his weapon and pointed it at Harris. Carrion watched as Harris reached for the gun and Officer Potter kicked Harris\u2019s hand away. Carrion saw Walden and Geiger at the scene. According to Carrion, Walden \u201csaid something about, That\u2019s my gun.\u201d Geiger, who was crying and \u201ca little hysterical,\u201d identified herself as Harris\u2019s girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">The government then introduced an audio recording and transcript of one particular prison phone call, made with Harris\u2019s I-PIN number, in which Harris appears to admit that he possessed the firearm. To lay the foundation, the government called Thomas Price, the Jacksonville Department of Corrections\u2019 communications coordinator, who was responsible for the inmate phone system. Price testified that prisoners can only use the phones inside the dorms by entering an individually assigned, seven digit I-PIN number. All inmate phone calls are automatically recorded, and these recordings can be copied but not altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Price identified a disk on which he had downloaded a copy of three calls found by searching for Harris\u2019s jail identification number, which corresponded with his I-PIN number. The government\u2019s audio recording of one particular phone call made with Harris\u2019s I-PIN number came from this disk. The inmate making the call identifies himself as \u201cMichael,\u201d which is Harris\u2019s first name. Price testified that the government\u2019s transcript of the call was accurate. Harris objected to the admission of the audio recording and transcript because \u201cthe proper predicate ha[d]n\u2019t been laid.\u201d The district court overruled Harris\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">The district court then excused the jury from the courtroom while the recording was discussed further. The court listened to the recording. The government explained that it could not force Harris to identify the recording because of his privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>lege against self-incrimination and that the other participants in the conversation were biased in Harris\u2019s favor. The government analogized the authentication of the automatic phone recording to the authentication of an automatic unmanned surveillance camera. The district court again overruled Harris\u2019s objection, finding that the government \u201cha[d] established a sufficient predicate that it\u2019s Mr. Harris on the line here\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s enough indicia of reliability here that allows the transcript to be played, especially with the limiting instruction which I intend to give.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Before the jury heard the recording, the district court instructed the jury that the transcript was admitted for the limited purposes of aiding the jury to follow the conversation and identify the speakers. The district court told the jury that \u201cwhether the transcript correctly or incorrectly reflects the content of the conversation or the identity of the speakers is entirely for you to determine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">In the recording, the person who initiates the collect call identifies himself as \u201cMichael.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The pre-recorded voice on the collect call then identifies \u201cMichael\u201d as an inmate in the Duval County Jail. Roughly seven minutes into the call, a male, a female, and \u201cMichael\u201d begin discussing the contents of a police report, suggesting that the report incorrectly states that \u201cMichael\u201d was originally on his stomach. The female then states, \u201cMichael was laying on his back.... That\u2019s how they seen the fucking gun.\u201d \u201cMichael\u201d asks, \u201c[Y]ou didn\u2019t hear me tell the police he did put it there?\u201d The female responds, \u201c[Y]ou said, yall [sic] planted that on me, yall [sic] planted that gun on me.\u201d The female then states that she \u201cwas so fucking scared\u201d and \u201cjust st[ood] there screaming please don\u2019t shoot him, please don\u2019t shoot him.\u201d Apparently referring to the gun, \u201cMichael\u201d states, \u201c[T]hat bitch ain\u2019t got no bullets, no nothing. I just remember grabbing that motherfucker out of the house.\u201d \u201cMichael\u201d then mentions that, when he fell off of the motorcycle, he could not get his leg out from underneath it. He asks if the motorcycle was messed up.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">On cross-examination, Price admitted that inmates sometimes exchanged or stole I-PIN numbers, but stated that they were told to keep their I-PIN numbers confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">The jury found Michael Harris guilty. He was sentenced to 195 months\u2019 imprisonment. Harris timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">Harris argues that his conviction should be reversed because neither the recording of the phone call nor the transcript was authenticated properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cole, </em>755 F.2d 748, 766 (11th Cir.1985). The district court\u2019s determination of authenticity should not be disturbed unless there is no competent evidence in the record to support it. <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>16 F.3d 1116, 1120-21 (11th Cir.1994). Moreover, the district court has \u201cbroad discretion in determining whether to allow a recording to be played before the jury.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>755 F.2d at 766 (citing <em>United States v. Biggins, </em>551 F.2d 64 (5th Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">Evidence is properly authenticated when there is \u201cevidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 901(a). Rule 901 requires only the presentation of \u201csufficient evidence to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case that the proffered evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>what it purports to be.\u201d <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>776 F.2d 989, 1001-02 (11th Cir. 1985). \u201cOnce that <em>prima facie </em>showing has been made, the evidence should be admitted\u201d and the trier of fact permitted to determine whether the proffered evidence is what it purports to be. <em>Id. </em>at 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">Furthermore, this Court held in <em>Biggins </em>that a district court \u201cproperly admits a sound recording into evidence only when the party introducing it carries its burden of going forward with foundation evidence demonstrating that the recording as played is an accurate reproduction of relevant sounds previously audited by a witness.\u201d 551 F.2d at 66.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The proponent bears the burden of establishing: (1) the competency of the operator; (2) the fidelity of the recording equipment; (3) the absence of material deletions, additions, or alterations in the relevant portions of the recording; and (4) the identification of the relevant speakers. <em>Id. </em>The primary purpose of these requirements is to \u201censur[e] the accuracy of the recording.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67. Therefore, even if one or more of the above-listed requirements has not been satisfied, \u201c[i]f there is independent evidence of the accuracy of the tape recordings admitted at trial, we shall be extremely reluctant to disturb the trial court\u2019s decision\u201d to admit the recording. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Here, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the recording. Hams challenges only that the government failed to prove the fourth <em>Big-gins </em>factor because no witness identified the voice on the recording as his. Although no witness identified the voice as Harris\u2019s, the evidence showed that the recording was associated with Harris\u2019s jail identification number, which corresponded with the unique I-PIN number assigned to Harris. Moreover, the speaker identified himself as \u201cMichael,\u201d which is Harris\u2019s first name. The inmate speaker in the recording also makes reference to the actual facts at the time of the motorcycle accident that were within the Defendant Harris\u2019s knowledge, further corroborating that the Defendant is the speaker. As such, the government met its burden of authentication by providing sufficient evidence to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case that the speaker in the recording is Michael Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">For similar reasons, we also cannot say the district court abused its discretion in admitting the transcript of the recording. Harris claims that the people who prepared the transcript of the recording attributed the dialogue to him without any personal knowledge to justify the attribution. However, as noted above, the government met its burden of showing that the speaker is Harris. Moreover, the district court reviewed the accuracy of the transcript and instructed the jury on the limitations of the use of the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">For these reasons, we affirm Harris\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-6\">. Thereafter, the transcript referred to him as \u201cMichael Harris.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b917-6\">.
