The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue: whether Nunez\u2019s \u201ctrial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by not putting on (and/or by not being prepared to put on) an insanity defense.\u201d Nunez argues that even though he informed counsel he did not want an insanity defense, his counsel\u2019s failure to prepare to present an insanity defense was ineffective assistance because the state trial court suggested to counsel that he should prepare to present the insanity defense in case Nunez changed his mind. After careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-22\">\u201cWhen reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition, we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo, </em>and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2000). As amended by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) forbids federal courts from granting habeas relief on claims that were previously adjudicated on the merits in state court, unless the adjudication</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-23\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-24\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). \u201c[A] federal habeas court making the \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 inquiry should ask whether the state court\u2019s application of clearly established law was objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Moreover, \u201c[i]t is the objective reasonableness, not the correctness <em>per se, </em>of the state court decision that we are to decide.\u201d <em>Brown v. Head, </em>272 F.3d 1308, 1313 (11th Cir.2001). Regarding factual findings, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1) provides that \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The U.S. Constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VI. The benchmark for judging a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is whether counsel\u2019s performance so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To make such a showing, a petitioner must prove two things. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. First, the petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Second, the petitioner must establish that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Id. </em>If a petitioner fails to show deficient performance, the court need not go on to determine whether there was prejudice, and vice-versa. <em>Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">\u201cCounsel\u2019s competence ... is presumed, and the defendant must rebut this presumption by proving that his attorney\u2019s representation was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms and that the challenged action was not sound strategy.\u201d <em>Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 384, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986) (citation omitted). There is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. If the record is incomplete or unclear about counsel\u2019s actions, then it is presumed that counsel exercised reasonable professional judgment. <em>Williams v. Head, </em>185 F.3d 1223, 1228 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Although the question under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) hinges on Supreme Court law, our application of <em>Strickland </em>is useful in illustrating whether the state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>was reasonable. In <em>Gates v. Zant, </em>we said, \u201c[gjiven the finite resources of time and money that face a defense attorney, it simply is not realistic to expect counsel to investigate substantially all plausible lines of defense.\u201d 863 F.2d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1989). We further explained that counsel renders effective assistance when his decision to not pursue a particular defense is reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052). And in <em>Foster v. Strickland, </em>707 F.2d 1339, 1343 (11th Cir.1983), the petitioner had instructed his defense counsel to not present an insanity defense, but then argued that his counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate an present an insanity defense. We held that because defense counsel had an ethical obligation to follow his client\u2019s choice to not present an insanity defense, the petitioner could not claim that counsel was ineffective for following the petitioner\u2019s instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 1343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">As applied here, the state court\u2019s determination that counsel was not ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>was not objectionably unreasonable. As the record shows, Nunez instructed his counsel as early as February 1999 to \u201cabandon all mental health issues.\u201d Nunez later explained that an insanity defense was not in his best interest because, if he was acquitted on the basis of insanity, his release from a state hospital would be at the discretion of the court, while if he was convicted of first-degree murder, he would only need to serve an additional 16 to 17 years\u2019 imprisonment before being eligible for parole because of the time he had already served. In September 1999, Nunez told the court that his counsel was still planning to use the insanity defense, despite Nunez\u2019s instructions not to, and the court confirmed that counsel understood that he could not put forth an insanity defense without Nunez\u2019s permission. At a status conference in December 1999, Nunez informed the court he was still refusing the insanity defense. A month later, during a break in voir dire, Nunez\u2019s counsel told the court that he had prepared what he thought was the best insanity defense he had ever seen as a lawyer; however, Nunez continued to refuse the defense, and counsel had abandoned it. While the trial court reminded counsel that it had previously suggested that he be prepared to present an insanity defense in case Nunez changed his mind, counsel explained that it was unrealistic for him to prepare the insanity defense and Nunez\u2019s requested defense \u2014 erime-of-passion\u2014be-cause of the amount of time required to prepare the case for trial. The court opined that \u201cNunez has made the decision he didn\u2019t want to pursue an insanity defense. I previously ruled he was competent by those two doctors. He gets to call that shot. It is in direct opposition to the advice of counsel ... He has chose to make this decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Following his conviction and appeals, Nunez filed a petition in state court for post-conviction relief, which included an ineffective-assistance-of-eounsel claim asserting that even though he told his counsel he did not want an insanity defense, his counsel was ineffective for not preparing an insanity defense because the trial court told counsel to have the insanity defense ready in case Nunez changed his mind. The state habeas court denied Nunez\u2019s claim, concluding that his counsel was not ineffective because Nunez precluded counsel from proceeding with an insanity defense. Nunez later filed this same claim in his \u00a7 2254 petition in federal district court, which similarly denied Nunez\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">On the record here, we reject Nunez\u2019s claim that the state court\u2019s determination that trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective was an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. As our case law shows, it was a reasonable choice for counsel to not prepare a defense his client had repeatedly refused because he did not think,- it was an appropriate use of his limited trial preparation time, which is a choice left to counsel\u2019s reasonable discretion. <em>See Gates, </em>863 F.2d at 1498 (holding that counsel renders effective assistance of counsel when he makes a choice, that is reasonable under the circumstances, to not use his limited amount of preparation time to pursue a defense that he did not think was viable); <em>Foster, </em>707 F.2d at 1343-44 (holding that a petitioner may not complain of his counsel following his instructions to not investigate and prepare an insanity defense). Because this is the same reason that the state court <em>used </em>\u2014 ie. Nunez\u2019s instruction to counsel to not pursue the insanity defense \u2014 Nunez cannot show that the state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Since Nunez has not shown that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient under the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>he cannot show that his counsel was constitutionally inef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>fective. 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We therefore need not consider whether Nunez changed his mind as to wanting the insanity defense or whether the insanity defense would have prevailed at trial because those issues are part of the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland. Holladay, </em>209 F.3d at 1248. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Nunez\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-18\">. In addition, Nunez's motion to reconsider our denial of his prior motion to expand the certificate of appealability, construed from his brief on appeal, is DENIED as untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
