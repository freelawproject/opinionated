Pettiette contends that her attorney failed to advise her adequately about the Sentencing Guidelines and failed to advise her that she could mitigate her sentence by entering a guilty plea. She contends also that counsel failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>to advise her about a plea bargain proposed by the Government, pursuant to which she could have pleaded guilty to misprision of a felony and would have received a more lenient sentence. She contends that the district court should not have denied her motion without holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">On review of a district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2255 relief, this court reviews factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Cavitt, </em>550 F.3d 430, 435 (5th Cir.2008). The district court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentia-ry hearing is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo establish abuse of discretion, a petitioner must present \u2018independent indicia of the likely merit of [her] allegations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>442 F.3d 258, 264 (5th Cir. 2006); pronoun modified). The district court must review the record and any materials submitted by the parties, including affidavits, to determine whether an eviden-tiary hearing is warranted. Rules 7(b) and 8(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings; <em>see also Cavitt, </em>550 F.3d at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">To prove that her counsel was ineffective, Pettiette must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that his deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A movant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be stated with specificity; \u201cconclusional allegations\u201d and \u201cgeneralized assertions\u201d will not suffice. <em>United States v. Demik, </em>489 F.3d 644, 646-47 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 U.S. 982, 128 S.Ct. 456, 169 L.Ed.2d 319 (2007). \u201cThe district court need not hold an evi-dentiary hearing to resolve ineffective claims where the petitioner has failed to allege facts which, if proved, would admit of relief.\u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>565 F.3d 290, 298 (5th Cir.2009) (quotation marks and brackets omitted). If this court \u201ccan conclude as a matter of law that the petitioner cannot establish one or both of the elements necessary to establish [her] constitutional claim, then an evidentiary hearing is not necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and brackets omitted; pronoun modified).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Because Pettiette\u2019s drug use while on pretrial release and obstruction of justice would have disqualified her from receiving an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, she cannot show that she was prejudiced by her attorney\u2019s failure to advise her that she could qualify for an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility by entering a guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Rickett, </em>89 F.3d 224, 227-28 (5th Cir. 1996). For that reason, Pettiette cannot show that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting this ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim without benefit of an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Fields, </em>565 F.3d at 298-99; <em>Cavitt, </em>550 F.3d at 435, 441-42. Because the record does not contain independent indicia of the likely merit of Pettiette\u2019s contention that she was not made aware of the Government\u2019s proposed plea bargain offer, Pettiette cannot show that the district court abused its discretion in denying her \u00a7 2255 motion without holding an evidentiary hearing as to this ineffective-assistance-of-eounsel claim. <em>See Cavitt, </em>550 F.3d at 435, 441-42. The district court\u2019s order denying Pettiette\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Pettiette\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Tubwell, </em>37 F.3d 175, 179 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
