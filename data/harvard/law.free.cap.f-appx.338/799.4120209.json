We granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-23\">Whether, after finding that a prior conviction used to determine [Adams\u2019s] criminal history category had been subsequently vacated, the district court erred by not holding a resentencing hearing before imposing a new sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-24\">On appeal Adams argues that the district court erred after granting his \u00a7 2255 motion because it reduced his sentence without conducting a new sentencing hearing. He asserts that the text of \u00a7 2255, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>and case law demonstrate that he was entitled to a new sentencing hearing in order to advocate for a lower sentence. Specifically, he argues that, following a successful \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court must vacate the judgment and then either discharge the prisoner, resentence him, grant him a new trial, or correct the sentence. He claims that the district court\u2019s only feasible option in this case was to conduct a resentencing hearing to permit him to advocate for a lower sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also asserts that the district court denied him the ability to assert his rights under Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to raise new objections and introduce mitigating evidence at re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">In a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review legal issues <em>de novo. United States v. Walker, </em>198 F.3d 811, 813 (11th Cir.1999). A federal prisoner may use a \u00a7 2255 motion to challenge his federal sentence \u201cupon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). If the prisoner is successful, the district court \u201cshall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall\u201d either: (1) discharge the prisoner, (2) resentence him, (3) grant a new trial, or (4) correct the sentence as may appear appropriate. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2255(b). Pursuant to a \u00a7 2255 motion, a district court \u201cmay reopen and reduce\u201d a federal prisoner\u2019s sentence once the prisoner has, \u201cin state court, successfully attacked a prior state conviction\u201d that previously was used to enhance the federal sentence. <em>Walker, </em>198 F.3d at 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The prisoner\u2019s right to a resentencing hearing depends on whether his original sentencing package was vacated in its entirety. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>923 F.2d 1494, 1496-97 (11th Cir.1991). In <em>Jackson, </em>a case involving a former version of Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, we held that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s right to be present extends to the imposition of a new sentencing package after an original sentencing package is vacated in its entirety on appeal and the case is remanded for resentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1496. In contrast, \u201cwhere the entire sentencing package has not been set aside, a correction of an illegal sentence does not constitute a resentencing requiring the presence of the defendant, so long as the modification does not make the sentence more onerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1497.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">In <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>11 F.3d 149 (11th Cir.1994), a case involving a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, we held that a defendant had the right to be present and allocute at a resentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 152. There, we relied on the district court\u2019s actions and noted that the \u201cdistrict court was not required to vacate Taylor\u2019s sentencing package in its entirety and schedule a resentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152. It could have \u201centered an order amending [his] sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, because the district court \u201c \u2018set aside and vacated\u2019 the original sentence and scheduled a resen-tencing,\u201d the defendant had the right to be present and allocute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">In this case, the district court considered the available options and chose to modify the existing sentence by applying the low end of Adams\u2019s adjusted Guidelines range after one of Adams\u2019s state convictions, relied upon for sentence enhancement, was vacated. Unlike <em>Taylor, </em>the district court in this case specifically chose not to vacate Adams\u2019s original sentencing package in its entirety before mod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>ifying the sentence. Therefore, Adams was not entitled to a resentencing hearing. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s reduction of Adams\u2019s sentence from 292 months to 262 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\">.
