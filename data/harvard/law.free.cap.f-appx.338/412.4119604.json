Tassin alleges that the defendants were deliberately indiffer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>ent to his medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment by prescribing him unnecessary medication that caused him internal injuries and distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Because the district court dismissed Tassin\u2019s suit pursuant to both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1916(e)(2)(B)(i) and 1915A(b)(1), review is <em>de novo, Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 378 (5th Cir.2005), using the same standard of review applicable to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) dismissals, <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999). When reviewing a dismissal for failure to state a claim, all well-pleaded facts are accepted as true and are viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u201cIt is cruel and unusual punishment to hold convicted criminals in unsafe conditions.\u201d <em>Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 38, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see Herman v. Holiday, </em>238 F.3d 660, 664 (5th Cir.2001). A plaintiff states a cause of action under the Eighth Amendment when he alleges that a defendant has, with deliberate indifference, exposed him to an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health. <em>Helling, </em>509 U.S. at 35,113 S.Ct. 2475; <em>Burleson v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>393 F.3d 577, 589 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cDisagreement with medical treatment does not state a claim for Eighth Amendment indifference to medical needs.\u201d <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997). Further, defendants may not be held liable for their alleged negligent acts under \u00a7 1983. <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 329-30, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Tassin alleges only that the medication in question was unnecessary, that his outside doctor should have been consulted, that necessary medical tests were not performed, and that he suffered injuries caused by the defendants\u2019s negligence. These allegations, taken as true, do not state a plausible claim for deliberate indifference. <em>See Bell Atl., </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955; <em>Burleson, </em>393 F.3d at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Tassin\u2019s appeal lacks any issue of arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>Fifth Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Tassin is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is under immediate danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-17\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
