On July 29, 2002, the district court sentenced appellant as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 to a prison sentence of 151 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appealed his conviction and sentence. We affirmed. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>99 Fed.Appx. 885 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-27\">On July 2006, the district court denied appellant\u2019s claim, made in a motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, that his attorney had rendered ineffective assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>counsel in failing to demonstrate at sentencing that he was not a career offender. Appellant did not appeal the ruling; instead, on March 7, 2008, he sought this court\u2019s leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, claiming that he was actually innocent of career offender status under \u00a7 4B1.1 given the application of Guidelines Amendment 709. We declined to grant leave. Also on March 7, appellant moved the district court separately to reopen the dormant \u00a7 2255 proceeding and to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); both motions challenged his career offender status under Amendment 709. The district court ordered the Government to respond to the motions, and it did so. The court thereafter heard argument of counsel. At that time, appellant\u2019s attorney argued that the court could grant a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 709 under alternative theories: under \u00a7 3582(c)(3) or by reopening the \u00a7 2255 proceeding pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and granting relief in the interest of justice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court denied the motions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">1) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Appellant argues that the district court was authorized to grant the requested sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny, a district court may reject as unsound the failure of the Guidelines to designate Amendment 709 as retroactive. He further argues that the court erroneously assumed that his request for relief was based on Amendment 706, the crack cocaine guideline amendment, rather than Amendment 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentence range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The amendment to the Guidelines must be retroactively applicable, however, and only amendments listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) qualify as retroactively applicable amendments warranting \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1), (c); <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 907-08 (11th Cir. 2003). Clarifying amendments are intended to clarify the meaning of a particular Guidelines section, and they generally do not effect a substantive change in the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>880 F.2d 1204, 1215 (11th Cir.1989) (direct appeal context). Thus, clarifying amendments do not provide a basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because they do not change the Guidelines substantively and are not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See id.; Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 908-09 (providing that, while consideration of a clarifying amendment \u201cmay be necessary in the direct appeal of a sentence or in a petition under \u00a7 2255, it bears no relevance to determining retroactivity under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">Amendment 709 elucidated how to determine the criminal history category under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1 and 4A1.2 when multiple convictions are involved. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 709 (2008). Pursuant to Amendment 709, prior offenses separated by an intervening arrest are counted separately for purposes of calculating a criminal-history score, and, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>there was no intervening arrest, prior sentences are counted separately \u201cunless the sentences (1) were for offenses that were named in the same charging document, or (2) were imposed on the same day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Reason for Amendment. Amendment 709 is not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c), and, therefore, it is not a retroactively applicable amendment that may be the basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (listing the retroactively applicable amendments, which does not include Amendment 709).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Section 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues,\u201d which should be brought on direct appeal or on collateral review. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). Moreover, <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">As an initial matter, appellant\u2019s argument that the district court assumed that appellant\u2019s request for relief was based on the crack cocaine guideline amendment is unavailing because the district court\u2019s order, although identifying the \u201ccrack amendment,\u201d referred to its statements at the motion hearing, and a review of the hearing shows that the district court considered and applied Amendment 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">As for the merits, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s supplemental motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 709 does not afford appellant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief since it is not retroactively applicable, and <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">2) Rule 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">Pursuant to our language in <em>Armstrong </em>providing that consideration of a clarifying amendment \u201cmay be necessary in the direct appeal of a sentence or in a petition under \u00a7 2255,\u201d appellant argues that the district court was authorized to reopen his prior \u00a7 2255 proceedings raising this issue, under Rule 60(b) in order to effectuate Amendment 709. Armstrong, 347 F.3d at 908-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">\u201cRule 60(b) allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment, and request reopening of his case, under a limited set of circumstances including fraud, mistake, and newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 528, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2645-6, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). Rule 60(b) motions challenging the denial of habeas relief are subject to the restrictions on second or successive habeas petitions if the prisoner is attempting to either (1) raise a new ground for relief, or (2) attack a federal court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits, which itself is \u201ceffectively indistinguishable\u201d from a direct claim that a petitioner is entitled to substantive habeas relief. <em>Id. </em>at 530-32, 125 S.Ct. at 2647-48. Where the motion attacks \u201csome defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings,\u201d however, the motion is not a successive habeas petition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number><em>Id., </em>at 532, 125 S.Ct. at 2648. Thus, Rule 60(b)(6) properly may be used to assert that a federal court\u2019s previous ruling precluding a merits determination (ie., a procedural ruling such as failure to exhaust, a procedural bar, or a statute-of-limitations bar) was in error. <em>Id. </em>at 532-35 &amp; n. 4, 125 S.Ct. at 2648-50 &amp; n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to the extent it sought to reopen his prior \u00a7 2255 proceedings under Rule 60(b) because the motion qualified as a successive motion to vacate and Martinez had failed to obtain an order authorizing the district court to consider a successive motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-19\">. The Guidelines sentence range called for imprisonment from 151 to 188 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">. Appellant argued that Amendment 709 could operate to reduce his sentence range to a term of imprisonment of 68 to 78 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A5dj\">. The court did so after ordering the Government to respond to the motions and, following the response, hearing argument of counsel for the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b870-8\">. Appellant cites our unpublished opinion in <em>United States v. Small, </em>No. 95-4045, manuscript op., 1995 WL 579521 (11th Cir. Sept. 19, 1995) as authorizing the district court to grant a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), notwithstanding our prior affir-mance of his sentence, to avoid manifest injustice. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Martinez's supplemental motion to the extent that he requested relief to avoid manifest injustice under the authority of <em>Small </em>because <em>Small </em>is non-binding authority and factually distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
