She challenges the loss calculation, the reasonableness of the 57-month sentence, and the restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Grant\u2019s suggestion that she was entitled to have the loss amount determined by a jury or beyond a reasonable doubt lacks arguable merit in the aftermath of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 798 (5th Cir.2006). Further, the Government adduced ample evidence at the sentencing hearing to provide a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss caused by Grant\u2019s involvement in the counterfeiting conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>475 F.3d 701, 705 (5th Cir.2007). Because the loss amount is plausible in light of the record, there was no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Grant\u2019s 57-month sentence was within the guideline range adopted by the court. However, due to an apparent error in the offense level calculation in the presentence report, the sentence was actually below the proper guideline sentence of 60 months. Regardless whether the 57-month sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, it is reasonable because the court considered the advisory Guidelines, the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and Grant\u2019s personal history and characteristics as ably presented by counsel at the sentencing hearing. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The court adequately explained its reasoning in light of \u00a7 3553(a) and Grant\u2019s arguments for a below-guideline sentence. <em>See U.S. v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 362-63 (5th Cir.2009); \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Grant\u2019s assertion that the restitution award is unconstitutional or unlawful because the court did not determine her ability to pay restitution is devoid of arguable merit. The court was not required to make such a finding. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 369 (5th Cir.2003). Grant\u2019s fears of automatic revocation for nonpayment are unfounded. <em>See Bearden v. Georgia, </em>461 U.S. 660, 672-73, 103 S.Ct. 2064, 76 L.Ed.2d 221 (1983); <em>United States v. Payan, </em>992 F.2d 1387, 1397 (5th Cir. 1993); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3614. Moreover, the record evidence shows no clear error in the restitution amount, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in making the award. <em>United States v. Crawley, </em>533 F.3d 349, 358 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Beydoun, </em>469 F.3d 102, 107 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
