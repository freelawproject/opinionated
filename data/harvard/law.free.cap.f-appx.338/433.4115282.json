He argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level upward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense, namely, the offense of unlawfully carrying a weapon on licensed premises, in violation of Texas Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 46.02. Tena asserts that the offense of unlawfully carrying a weapon was not sufficiently distinct from the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm so as to permit the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-19\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court continues to review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). In determining whether a guideline enhancement applies, a district court is allowed to draw reasonable inferences from the facts, and these inferences are fact-findings re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>viewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a four-level increase if the defendant \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). \u201cAnother felony offense\u201d is defined as \u201cany federal, state, or local offense, other than the explosive or firearms possession or trafficking offense, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n. 14)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">A person violates \u00a7 46.02(a) if he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly carries on or about- his person a weapon. An offense under this section is a felony if the offense is committed on any premises licensed or issued a permit by this state for the sale of alcoholic beverages. \u00a7 46.02(c). Tena does not dispute that he violated \u00a7 46.02(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Here, Tena\u2019s mere possession of the firearm would not itself implicate \u00a7 46.02(c). Rather, Tena also had to carry or possess the firearm on licensed premises, an act that goes beyond mere possession. <em>See United States v. Kuban, </em>94 F.3d 971, 975-76 (5th Cir.1996). Thus, the enhancement was properly applied. <em>See id. </em>at 976; <em>see also United States v. Armstead, </em>114 F.3d 504, 512-13 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">We also agree with the Government\u2019s alternative argument that Tena\u2019s conduct of waving the loaded firearm at a crowd of people warranted the imposition of the enhancement. <em>See Kuban, </em>94 F.3d at 976; <em>United States v. Le, </em>512 F.3d 128, 134-135 (5th Cir.2007); \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.14(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
