The district court also issued a personal forfeiture judgment, ordering Haberman to pay $20,000,000. He contends that the district court erred by denying him a downward adjustment to his offense level for acceptance of responsibility; that the district court did not provide an adequate explanation for his sentence; that his sentence was substantively unreasonable; and that the district court erred by imposing a personal money judgment in the forfeiture order. Haberman requests that his case be assigned to a different district judge on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-19\">Our review of a sentence must fust consider whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the sentencing decision is procedurally sound, we then consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This framework in mind, we reject each of Haberman\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">First, our review of the records in Haberman\u2019s case and his sister Lori Haberman\u2019s case indicates a foundation for the district court\u2019s finding that Haberman did not fully acknowledge his sister\u2019s role in his offense. Haberman\u2019s contention as to acceptance of responsibility is unavailing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Haberman did not object to the district court\u2019s explanation for the sentence at his sentencing hearing, thus we review this second issue for plain error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A plain error is a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When those elements are shown, this court has the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Haberman advanced unexceptional reasons for a downward variance from the guideline sentencing range. The district court read Haberman\u2019s written motion for a variance, heard his arguments for a variance, and heard the Government\u2019s statement about Haberman\u2019s cooperation. The district court also indicated that the 360-month sentence was reasonable and that it had considered the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a), though the district court did not elaborate on how the sentence addressed those factors. The district court\u2019s explanation was adequate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">As for his substantive unreasonableness claim, we first note that Haber-man\u2019s sentence is within the guideline sentencing range and thus presumptively reasonable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> His conclusional arguments to the contrary are insufficient to rebut this presumption.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Haberman argues in his reply brief that <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), <em>Gall, </em>and <em>Spears v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 840, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009), have invalidated any presumption of correctness accorded to within-range sentences. He is mistaken; a within-range sentence is still presumed reasonable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-18\">Lastly, Haberman did not object to the imposition of the money forfeiture judgment in the district court and we review this issue for plain error.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>we have not directly addressed whether a district court may impose a personal money forfeiture judgment \u2014 in light of the relevant statutes, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the published opinions of several sister circuits \u2014 any error by the district court is not clear or obvious.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Haberman has not shown reversible error. No remand is necessary and Haber-man\u2019s request that a different judge be assigned on remand is moot.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
