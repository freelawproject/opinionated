SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Jose Urias-Escobar appeals his seventy-month sentence for illegal reentry into the United States. He argues that the district court erred in concluding that his earlier, state conviction for misdemeanor assault was an aggravated felony that warranted an enhanced sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Finding no error regarding this issue of first impression, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">Urias-Escobar, a native of El Salvador, first entered the United States in 1990. In 1994, he pleaded guilty of assault with bodily injury, a misdemeanor offense under Texas law. The state court sentenced him to one year in jail, suspended the sentence, and placed him on probation for one year. He was deported in 1995 and again in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">In September 2000, after he again was found in Texas, Urias-Escobar pleaded guilty of illegally reentering the United States after deportation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) concluded that his state misdemeanor conviction constituted an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) and, accordingly, recommended that his offense level be increased sixteen points. After a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, Urias-Escobar faced a guideline range of seventy to eighty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">Urias-Escobar objected to the PSR, arguing that his misdemeanor conviction could not, by definition, be an aggravated felony, and thus the sixteen-level enhancement was error. Without that enhancement, his guideline range would have been nine to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment. The court overruled the objection and imposed a seventy-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\">Urias-Escobar challenges the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 1326(b)(2), 1101(a)(43)(F), and 2L1.2. These are questions of law that we review <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Courts are bound to follow each sentencing guideline, <em>Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 391, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989), and accompanying policy statements, <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 199-201, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). The guidelines\u2019 commentary is given controlling weight if it is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the guidelines. <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 42-45, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Section 2L1.2 sets the offense level for violations of \u00a7 1326(b). Subsection (a) provides a base offense level of 8, and subsection (b)(1) mandates a sentencing enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was deported after a criminal conviction\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">(A) If the conviction was for an aggravated felony, increase by 16 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">(B) If the conviction was for (i) any other felony, or (ii) three or more misdemeanor crimes of violence or misdemeanor controlled substance offenses, increase by 4 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The guidelines commentary explains, \u201c \u2018Aggravated felony,\u2019 is defined at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).... \u2018Felony offense\u2019 means any federal, state, or local offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt., n.l. Section 1101(a)(43)(F), in turn, defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as \u201ca crime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment at<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">Urias-Escobar argues that because he was convicted of only <em>misdemeanor </em>assault, that offense cannot, by definition, be an aggravated <em>felony </em>under \u00a7 2L1.2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although this is an issue of first impression in this circuit, five other circuits have addressed it and agree that under \u00a7 2L1.2, a misdemeanor can be an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d even though it is not a felony at all.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finding their reasoning persuasive, we adopt it as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">Title 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(F) defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as \u201ca crime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d \u201cUnder the plain language of this definition, there is no requirement that the offense actually have been a felony, as that term is conventionally understood.\u201d <em>Wireko, </em>211 F.3d at 835. In defining \u201caggravated felony,\u201d Congress was defining a term of art, one that includes all violent crimes punishable by one year\u2019s imprisonment, including certain violent misdemeanors. <em>Graham, </em>169 F.3d at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">Though Urias-Escobar is correct that federal law traditionally defines a felony as a crime punishable by <em>over </em>one year\u2019s imprisonment, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a); U.S.S.G. 2L1.2, cmt. 1, the plain language of this statute says otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-16\">Congress has the power to define the punishment for the crime of reentering the country after deportation.... Our decision would be much simpler if Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>gress had used the term \u201caggravated offense.\u201d However, rather than making the underlying offense conform to the label Congress erroneously used to describe section 1101(a)(43) as amended, we give effect to the definition of the underlying offense and ignore the label.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX2\"><em>Graham, </em>169 F.3d at 792-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Whatever the wisdom of Congress\u2019s decision to alter the historic one-year line between a misdemeanor and a felony, the statute is unambiguous in its sweep.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judgment of sentence, accordingly, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-11\">. Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) states in relevant part that for any alien \"whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, such alien shall be fined under such Title, imprisoned not more than 20 years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-18\"><em>.
