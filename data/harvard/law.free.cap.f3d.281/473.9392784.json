The officers found 704 kilograms of packaged marijuana inside the truck. A Border Patrol agent placed the two men under arrest and moved them to a federal facility, where they spent the night in a cell. The next morning, DEA agents transferred Leal and Galindo to another location and interviewed them. According to the DEA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>agents, both Leal and Galindo freely and willingly gave statements. They confessed that a man named \u201cChief\u2019 paid them $5,000 each to transport marijuana from a truck stop in Sierra Blanca, Texas to Odessa, Texas. They described in their interviews the way in which \u201cChief\u2019 recruited them at a party and his advice on escaping detection during the drug run.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Leal and Galindo filed motions to suppress evidence, asserting violations of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. They later waived their right to a jury trial. After the district court denied their suppression motions at a hearing, Leal and Galindo stipulated to all of the facts necessary to support their guilt, and the district court found them guilty as charged in the indictment. At sentencing, the district court reduced Leal and Galindo\u2019s sentences by two levels for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), but declined to reduce their sentence an additional level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). The court also rejected the contention that Leal and Galindo played only \u201cminimal\u201d or \u201cminor\u201d roles in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 and accordingly refused to reduce their sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">We review a sentencing judge\u2019s determination on acceptance of responsibility under a standard variously described as \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d \u201cwithout foundation,\u201d or \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>United States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>62 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir.1995). This standard requires even more deference than a \u201cpure\u201d clearly erroneous standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The sentencing judge, visiting the Western District of Texas from the Eastern District of Louisiana, reluctantly awarded a two-point reduction of the sentencing level for \u201cacceptance of responsibility.\u201d The judge followed what he believed to be the rule of the Western District of Texas, which purportedly awards the two-level reduction in cases where the defendant moves to suppress evidence but otherwise does not challenge the facts establishing his guilt. The judge made clear that, but for the Western District\u2019s policy, he would not have awarded even two levels. The judge declined to award the third-level reduction because of his reluctance on whether even the two-level decrease was justified. In rejecting the additional reduction, he said: \u201cBut the fact of the matter is that to me that doesn\u2019t make a difference because, frankly, if I weren\u2019t applying the rules of this Court, they wouldn\u2019t get 3 point \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t get a 2-point reduction; they\u2019d get zero. The facts here, to me, don\u2019t justify even a 2-point reduction. But the policy of the court is to give it. I\u2019m going to give them the 2-point reduction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">We reject the proposition that a sentencing judge\u2019s reluctance in awarding the two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) can have any bearing on the independent inquiry of whether to award another level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). Section 3E1.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">(a) If the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense, decrease the offense level by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">(b) If the defendant qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a), the offense level determined prior to the operation of subsection (a) is level 16 or greater, and the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by taking one or more of the following steps:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-12\">(1) timely providing complete information to the government concerning his own involvement in the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\">(2) timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>by permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently, decrease the offense level by 1 additional level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. To qualify for the additional reduction in \u00a7 3El.l(b), the defendant must meet three criteria: (1) he must qualify for the two-level reduction under subsection (a), (2) the offense level prior to the operation of section (a) must be 16 or higher, and (3) the defendant must <em>either </em>\u201ctimely provide complete information to the government concerning his own involvement in the offense\u201d <em>or </em>timely enter a guilty plea. <em>United States v. Tello, </em>9 F.3d 1119, 1124-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Whether a defendant qualifies for the two-level reduction in subsection (a) is an all or nothing proposition: once the district court decides that a defendant is entitled to the subsection (a) reduction, the only inquiries remaining under subsection (b) are the last two prongs of the test. In other words, a district court cannot find that a defendant \u201caccepted responsibility\u201d for the purposes of subsection (a) but did not \u201caccept responsibility\u201d for the purposes of the first prong of the test under subsection (b). We explicitly held as much in <em>United States v. Tello, </em>9 F.3d at 1127-29. In <em>Tello, </em>the district court awarded the two-level reduction under subsection (a) despite the defendant\u2019s obstruction of justice. But because the defendant had obstructed justice, the court concluded that he had not sufficiently accepted responsibility for the full three-level reduction under subsection (b). We reversed, explaining that district courts may not adopt \u201cinternally inconsistent position[s]\u201d in sentencing under \u00a7 3E1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1128. Whether a defendant obstructed justice was relevant to the determination under subsection (a). But once the district court determined that the obstruction did not prevent the reduction under subsection (a), it was not free to revisit the obstruction issue again under subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Here, similarly, the fact that the defendants required the government to go to trial on the suppression motion might have been relevant under subsection (a) in determining whether they had \u201caccepted responsibility.\u201d In <em>United States v. Maldonado, </em>42 F.3d 906 (5th Cir.1995), the district court denied a sentencing reduction under subsection (a) on facts nearly identical to those here: the defendant put the government to trial on a suppression motion, but waived his right to a jury trial and otherwise stipulated to all of the relevant facts. We upheld the court\u2019s decision. Had the government appealed the reduction under subsection (a) in this case, we might very well have reversed on the strength of <em>Maldonado. </em>But the government did not appeal the reduction under subsection (a). Having determined (however reluctantly) that Leal and Galindo qualified for the two-point reduction under subsection (a), the district court was not entitled to revisit that decision in considering subsection (b). As such, the only remaining relevant questions were (1) whether the offense level was greater than 16 and (2) whether Leal and Galindo either timely provided complete information to the authorities or timely entered a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Neither Leal nor Galindo entered a guilty plea. <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>19 F.3d 982, 984 (5th Cir.1994) (holding that a bench trial on stipulated facts in lieu of a conditional guilty plea does not constitute a \u201cguilty plea\u201d for the purposes of the sentencing guidelines). But each defendant timely provided complete information to the authorities. They each freely and willingly gave statements to the DEA at their first interviews, the morning after their arrests. Aside from the fact of the car chase itself, apparently the only facts used at trial were those provided by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>defendants. As such, because the offense level for each defendant exceeded 16, they were entitled to the full three-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b)(l). We VACATE the defendants\u2019 sentences and REMAND for re-sentencing in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Leal and Galindo also challenge the district court\u2019s determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 that they played more than a \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d role. We review the district court\u2019s decision on this point under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Giraldi, </em>86 F.3d 1368, 1378 (5th Cir.1996). Given that Leal and Galindo were paid a substantial sum and moved a large quantity of drugs, the district court did not clearly err in finding that they were more than \u201cminor\u201d participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
