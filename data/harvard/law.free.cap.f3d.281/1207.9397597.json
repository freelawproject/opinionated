First, whether a petition before the Florida Monroe County Career Service Counsel was a proceeding in a \u201ccourt of law.\u201d Second, if so, whether the petition was seeking \u201cmoney damages.\u201d Because we find no definitive Florida precedent for this insurance policy language interpretation issue, we certify both questions to the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>CERTIFICATION FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA, PURSUANT TO SECTION 25.031, FLORIDA STATUTES, AND RULE 9.150, FLORIDA RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA AND ITS HONORABLE JUSTICES:</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">I.FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">The following facts are undisputed. The appellee, Florida Keyes Mosquito Control District purchased a Public Officials and Employment Liability Insurance Policy from the appellant, Coregis Insurance Company. Appellee incurred attorney\u2019s fees after Coregis refused to provide a defense for a petition that was filed before the Monroe County Career Service Counsel by Dennis Wardlow, a former employee of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellee holding that Monroe County Career Service Counsel qualifies as a \u201ccourt of law\u201d and the petition was a \u201csuit\u201d seeking \u201cmoney damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">II.STYLE OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">Mosquito Control District of Florida, Special Taxing District, a.k.a.
