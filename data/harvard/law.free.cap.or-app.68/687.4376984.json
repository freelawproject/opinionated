In each case the court sentenced defendant to five years imprisonment with a two and one-half year minimum term pursuant to ORS 144.110(1). The judgment order specifies that the sentences are to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Defendant first contends the sentences imposed were excessive and constitute cruel and unusual punishment. They are not. <em>State v. Dinkel, </em>34 Or App 375, 579 P2d 245 (1978), <em>rev den </em>285 Or 195 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">He next argues that the court had no authority to impose minimum terms of imprisonment pursuant to ORS 144.110(1). The same argument was rejected in <em>State v. Turner, </em>296 Or 451, 676 P2d 873 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The court, in its oral pronouncement of sentence, ordered that the sentences run concurrently. The judgment specifies consecutive sentences. The state concedes that there was a scrivener\u2019s error in drafting the written judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The judgment order is modified to provide that the sentences imposed are to be served concurrently. Affirmed as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
