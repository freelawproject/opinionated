J.</author>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">In these consolidated cases, defendants appeal their convictions for manufacturing marijuana in violation of ORS 475.992(1), contending that the trial court should have suppressed the marijuana seized. We agree. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">On March 22, 1981, while on patrol in a remote area of Curry County, Deputy Sheriff Gibson of Josephine County received an informal complaint that defendants\u2019 dogs were running loose and chasing deer. He had previously received a similar complaint. Gibson attempted to contact defendants by driving to their house, which was located on 120 acres of mountainous and heavily wooded terrain, but was unable to reach the house because their driveway was closed off by a cable and a sign which read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">\u201cThis is the front door to our home * * *. Please honk your horn; if we\u2019re home and available for visitors, we\u2019ll come to the door within five minutes. If we don\u2019t come, we\u2019re not home or not available. Please leave your name and message and we\u2019ll contact you. * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Gibson honked his horn, but no one responded; he then left. No further complaints were made concerning defendants\u2019 dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Over three months later, Deputy Gibson and Deputy Omlin of Curry County decided to meet in the area of defendants\u2019 house \u201cto do some patrol work in that area and try to clear the dog problem up at the same time.\u201d When they arrived in the area, they heard dogs barking in the general vicinity of defendants\u2019 property. In an attempt to locate the source of the barking, they rode their motorcycles down defendants\u2019 driveway, passing several signs marked \u201cprivate property\u201d and \u201cno trespassing.\u201d When they came to the cable and the sign instructing them to honk, they went around the cable and proceeded about one-eighth of a mile to defendants\u2019 house. They did not honk. As they crossed a wooded walkway to the front door, they observed 385 marijuana plants growing approximately 40 yards to the south of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">Defendants moved to suppress the marijuana, claiming that, by entering their property without a search warrant, the deputies violated both Article I, section 9, of the Oregon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The trial court denied the motion, finding that the barking dogs gave the deputies the right to enter the property to investigate. In a trial to the court on stipulated facts, defendants were found guilty of manufacturing marijuana in violation of ORS 475.992(1). They were each sentenced to a maximum period of eight years, with a minimum sentence of two years. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">As a preliminary matter, we note that we originally dismissed this case for lack of jurisdiction because defendants filed their notice of appeal after their convictions but before they were sentenced and judgment was entered. <em>State v. Russo, </em>66 Or App 758, 675 P2d 190 (1984). After that opinion was issued, however, it was brought to our attention that ORS 138.071(1) allows defendants to file their notice of appeal \u201cat any time after verdict * * <em>See State v. McFarland/Chappel, </em>10 Or App 90, 497 P2d 1243 (1972), <em>rev den </em>(1972). Accordingly, we withdrew our opinion dismissing the appeal. <em>State v. Russo, </em>67 Or App 480 (1984). We now consider the case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\"> We first examine whether the deputies\u2019 actions violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-7\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable search or seizure * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">This section provides protection not only to an individual\u2019s house proper, but also to the area surrounding the house, known as the curtilage. <em>State v. Lee, </em>120 Or 643, 253 P 533 (1927). The curtilage includes the area adjoining the house and all outbuildings used in connection with it, such as garages, sheds and barns. <em>State v. Lee, supra, </em>120 Or at 648-49. Whether the place searched is within the curtilage is to be determined from the facts, including its proximity or annexation to the dwelling, its inclusion within the general enclosure surrounding the dwelling and its use and enjoyment as an adjunct to the domestic economy of the family. <em>Care v. United States, </em>231 F2d 22, 25 (10th Cir 1956), <em>cert denied </em>351 US 932 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>In the present case, defendants\u2019 house is situated in a remote clearing surrounded by dense woods and thick underbrush which serve as a natural exclusionary barrier. The 385 marijuana plants were growing in the same clearing, not more than 120 feet from the house. No fence or other barrier separated the plants from the house and access to both was provided by the same driveway. In our view, because the plants were located within the same enclosure as the house, in an area clearly defined and separated from the surrounding woods, and were in close proximity to the house, they were within the curtilage. <em>See United States v. Van Dyke, </em>643 F2d 992 (4th Cir 1981); <em>Brinlee v. State, </em>403 P2d 253 (Okla 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The state argues that the deputies\u2019 intrusion into the curtilage was justified because of the prior complaints about defendants\u2019 dogs and the presence of barking dogs on defendants\u2019 property. According to the state, \u201cthe urgent facts at hand required immediate action.\u201d We fail to see how a three-month old complaint and some barking dogs constitute probable cause and exigent circumstances entitling the deputies to enter the curtilege without a warrant. The deputies\u2019 unconsented trespass violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The evidence, therefore, must be suppressed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\"> We have considered the cases cited to us by the parties, but do not find them dispositive. For example, the result we reach in this case is consistent with <em>State v. Carter/Burton, </em>54 Or App 852, 636 P2d 460 (1981), relied on by defendants. That case, however, was decided under the Fourth Amendment and <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 US 347, 88 S Ct 507, 19 L Ed 2d 576 (1967), and so we do not treat it as binding precedent for the purposes of our Oregon constitutional analysis. <em>State v. Illingworth, </em>60 Or App 150, 652 P2d 834 (1982), <em>rev den </em>294 Or 569 (1983), relied on by the state is inapposite. In addition to being a Fourth Amendment case, it involved a true exigency \u2014 a fresh complaint of gunshots.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\"> In disposing of this case under traditional curtilage concepts we find to be inherent in Article I, section 9, we do not mean to imply that the result would necessarily be different had the plants in question been in an \u201copen field.\u201d The existence and extent of an \u201copen field\u201d doctrine under the Oregon Constitution is an open question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
