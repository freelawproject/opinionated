The South Park Commissioners directed their auditor, whose salary for his services as such was fixed at $3000, (the highest amount allowed by law,) to procure a loan of $100,000 for their use, which he did. There was no promise to pay him anything for this service, either express or implied, at the time or before it was rendered. He claimed commissions on the loan, with interest, and brought suit for the same: Held, that he was not entitled to anything for such service beyond his fixed salary as auditor.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-12\" pgmap=\"496\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the First District;\u2014 heard in that court on appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.

Sidway, against the South Park Commissioners, to recover certain commissions alleged to be due him for procuring a loan of $100,000 for defendants. At the time plaintiff procured the loan he was himself one of the park commissioners, and had been appointed, by the board, auditor of that body, and was acting in that capacity. His salary, as auditor, was fixed at $3000, and section 2 of the Park act provides, the auditor of the board shall receive a salary not exceeding $3000. It seems, the board, by resolution, instructed plaintiff, then auditor, to negotiate the loan required, on such terms as he might think to the best interests of the commissioners. It was under the authority of that resolution plaintiff secured the loan for defendants for which he now seeks to recover a compensation in the nature of commissions. By agreement, the cause was tried by the court without a jury, and the court found the issues for defendants. The' motion made for a new trial was overruled, and \"judgment rendered for defendants, to which ruling of the court plaintiff excepted. The judgment of the circuit court was affirmed by the Appellate Court for the First District, and plaintiff brings the case to this court on his further appeal.</p> <p id=\"b498-5\" pgmap=\"498\">No questions of law were raised by plaintiff at the trial in the circuit court, by propositions submitted 'to the court' to be held or refused to be law, as applicable to the facts, or otherwise. It is apparent, then, that no questions of law can be considered in this court, other than plaintiff\u2019s right, as a matter of law, to recover on the facts, as the same were found by the trial and Appellate Courts. It seems the Appellate Court found as a fact in the case, \u201cthat the services for which this suit was brought, were rendered without any promise on the part of the appellee, before or at the time the services were rendered, either expressed or implied, to pay appellant for said services, beyond the compensation received by him as auditor. \u201d As has been seen, plaintiff, at the time, was himself a member of the board of commissioners, and was its auditor, and conceding the facts to be as the Appellate Court has found them to be, the law is well settled there could be no recovery, and the judgment of the Appellate Court must Be affirmed.
