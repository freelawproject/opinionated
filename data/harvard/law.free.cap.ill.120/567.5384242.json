Camp meetings\u2014section 59 of the Criminal Code considered as a police regulation, not as in restraint of trade, etc. Section 59 of the Criminal Code, making it a penal offence for any one, without the permission of those in charge of a camp meeting, to establish any tent, booth or place for vending provisions or refreshments within one mile of such meeting, with a proviso that any one who has his regular place of business within such limits shall not be required to suspend his business, is not invalid, as being in restraint of trade, or creating a monopoly, or making discriminations, but is a valid law, tending to prevent disturbance and disorderly conduct. The act is \u25a0a mere police regulation, and one within the legislative power.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b567-10\" pgmap=\"567\">2. The proviso in the act, that \u201cwhoever has his regular place of business within such limits is not hereby required to suspend his business, \u201d was not intended to be limited to those who might have a business within the pre\u25a0scribed limits at the time the act was passed, but applies equally to all who may, in good faith, establish a place of business therein at any time when \u2022no camp meeting is in progress or being carried on.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b567-11\" pgmap=\"567\">3. The court does not hold that a person, on the eve of a meeting being held, will have the right to establish a booth for the sale of provisions for a \u25a0short period or during a session of a meeting, and claim protection under the proviso. To avail of the law he must have established a regular, permanent business. When that has been done, he will not be required to suspend \u25a0during the time a meeting is held.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b567-12\" pgmap=\"567\">4. The act does not confer power on those in charge of camp meetings to license the sale of provisions and refreshments. The fact that it confers on \u25a0such authorities, the right to consent or refuse consent, can not be held to authorize them to license.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b567-13\" pgmap=\"567\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Woodford county; the Hon.

Stat. chap. 38, see. 59.</p> <p id=\"b569-10\" pgmap=\"569(62) 570(56)\">Meyers, the appellant, and the Normal District Camp Meeting Association of the Methodist Episcopal Church, each own adjoining lands within the incorporated village of Eureka, in Woodford county. The appellant purchased his premises about two years before the camp meeting association purchased its premises, but appellant did not occupy his premises until after the association purchased its grounds and held meetings thereon. When the meeting commenced, appellant lived on his premises, hut he had never kept a booth thereon. After the camp meeting commenced, appellant established his booth, and commenced the sale of his goods, without the consent of the association. Whether he had the right to do so, depends upon the validity of the law.</p> <p id=\"b570-5\" pgmap=\"570\">In the argument of appellant it is said: \u201cWe apprehend that an act in restraint of trade, or one erecting and vesting a business monopoly, or one creating discriminations between citizens transapting the same lawful business, or one vesting taxing power in private individuals, .corporations or associations, for their own benefit, or one vesting in individuals or associations, or private corporations, power to license trades or business, for their own benefit, would also be beyond the competency of the legislature, * * * and all these we claim the statute in question attempts to do. \u201d</p> <p id=\"b570-7\" pgmap=\"570(202) 571(225)\">The argument that the act is in restraint of trade,\u2014one creating a monopoly and making discriminations,\u2014is based upon the proviso in the act, declaring, \u201cthat whosoever has his regular place of business within such limits is not hereby required to suspend his business.\u201d We do not think that the proviso, upon a fair construction of its terms, is liable to the objection urged against it. If it was intended, by the proviso, to protect any person who might have a business within the designated limits at the time the act was passed, and not afford protection to any person who might engage in regular-business, within the designated limits, after the passage of the act, there might be much force in the position of appellant ;' but we do not understand that such is the meaning of the proviso. But, on the other hand, we think the manifest intention was to allow any person who might think proper, to establish a place for the vending of provisions or refreshments within the designated limits, at a time when the camp meeting was\" not in progress, and aftdr such person became established in a regular business he would not be required to suspend his business during the time the camp meeting was held,\u2014in other words, we think the word \u201chas, \u201d in the proviso, should be read \u201cmay have.\u201d The proviso would then read, \u201cwhosoever may have his regular place of business within such limits is not hereby required to suspend his business. \u201d Under this construction, no privilege or right is conferred on one which is not granted to all. Ho monopoly is created by the act, which protects the one and excludes the others, but all persons stand upon an equality under the law, as they should. All who desire may establish a regular place of business,\u2014not temporary, but permanent. We do not hold that a person, on the eve of a meeting being held, would have the right to establish a booth or place for selling provisions or refreshments for a short period, or during a session of' the camp meeting, and claim protection under the statut\u00f3, as this would be a device to defeat the purpose of the law, which could not be sanctioned; but in order to be protected, whoever undertook to avail of the law would have to establish a regular, permanent business, and after such regular business was established, the person engaged in such regular business would not be required to suspend during the session of a camp meeting.</p> <p id=\"b571-5\" pgmap=\"571\">Tugman v. City of Chicago, 78 Ill. 405, has been cited as an authority sustaining appellant\u2019s view. In that case it was held, that an ordinance which prevents one citizen engaging in a particular kind of business in a certain locality, under a penalty, whilst another is permitted to engage in the same business in the same locality, is not only unreasonable, and therefore void, but its direct tendency is to create a monopoly, which the law will not tolerate. Of course, the rule which would control an ordinance would also apply to an act of the legislature, and if the proviso of the act in question protected persons who might be in business when it was enacted, and excluded those who might afterwards engage in business, the case cited would be in point; but, as said before, that construction can not be placed on the law.</p> <p id=\"b572-4\" pgmap=\"572\">It is also said, that vendors of provisions and refreshments can not, under the constitution, be taxed, and that the act empowers the authorities in charge of the meeting to license, which, in effect, is a tax. As we understand the statute, it does not confer the power to license, on the authorities in charge of the meeting. The act merely declares, that whoever, during the time of holding any camp or field meeting, without the permission of the authorities having charge of such meeting, establishes any tent, booth or place for vending provisions or refreshments, within a certain distance of the meeting, shall be fined. The fact that the act confers on the authorities the right to consent, or refuse consent, can not be held to authorize such authorities to license. The right to consent, or refuse consent, is one thing, while the right or power to license a person to conduct a certain business at a certain place is quite a different thing. Had the legislature intended to authorize the authorities to license, language expressing that intention in plain words would no doubt have been used. But however this may be, we see nothing in the language of the act which can be construed as authorizing the authorities to license. The act is a mere police regulation. The purpose of the act is to preserve order, and prevent the disturbance of those engaged in public worship. For many years we have had similar acts in our statute. Section 147 of the Criminal Code of-1845 is an act of a similar character,\u2014one enacted as a police regulation, to prevent a disturbance of a religious congregation. There is, in our judgment, no question in regard to the power and authority of the legislature to pass such laws. The tendency of such laws is to prevent disturbance and disorderly conduct, and preserve peace and quiet, where a large number of people are assembled for religious worship. The statute is a mere police regulation,\u2014one which the legislature had the right to enact. We regard it valid, and free from the objections urged against it.</p> <p id=\"b572-5\" pgmap=\"572\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b572-6\" pgmap=\"572\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
