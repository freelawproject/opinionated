The trial court decreed that this income was immune from state taxation, and that the Board must refund the sums collected. On appeal, the Board contends that this ruling was incorrect and that the court erred in adopting certain procedures for resolving individual claims. We find no error, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Plaintiff Sandra Brown represents the class of investors who paid the challenged tax. Plaintiffs Capital Preservation Fund (Fund), Capital Preservation Fund II (Fund II), and Capital Preservation Treasury Note Trust (Trust) are registered investment companies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fund and Fund II are organized as share-issuing corporations and appear in their own names, while Trust is organized as a trust and appears by its trustees. There is little need to distinguish here between these three plaintiffs, and for the most part we refer to them collectively as Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">During tax years 1978 through 1981, all money managed by Companies was invested in federal obligations, and all income distributed to their investors originated in such obligations. During those same years, Companies were required to report to the Board, and the investors were required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>pay state income tax on, these distributions. Plaintiff Brown sought a refund of this tax on her own behalf and on behalf of the class. Companies also sought to be excused from reporting their distributions as taxable income. The Board denied both requests. This action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Plaintiffs moved for summary adjudication on the grounds that (1) the tax was indirectly imposed on federal obligations in violation of federal law; and (2) it discriminated against the federal government, its obligations, or persons with whom it deals, because similar distributions by state and local bond funds were exempt from California income tax.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court granted the motion on the former ground, without reaching the question whether the tax was impermissibly discriminatory. The action was then certified as a class action, notice was given to the class, and some 43,000 claims were submitted by investors. The Board allowed approximately 40,000 of these claims, subject to appeal on the underlying issue of the validity of the tax. The Board rejected the rest of the claims for various reasons. After a trial, the court entered a judgment directing payment of the undisputed claims, setting aside a fund for payment of the disputed claims, and providing a procedure for resolution of the latter by a referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">II. Validity of Tax</p>\n<p id=\"A1G\">A. <em>Tax on Federal Securities</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Obligations of the federal government, and the interest paid on them, are exempt from state taxation. <em>(American Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Dallas County </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 855, 866-867 [77 L.Ed.2d 1072, 1081-1082, 103 S.Ct. 3369]; <em>Memphis Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Garner </em>(1983) 459 U.S. 392, 396 [74 L.Ed.2d 562, 566, 103 S.Ct. 692]; <em>see First Nat. Bank of Atlanta </em>v. <em>Bartow County Bd. </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 583 [84 L.Ed.2d 535, 105 S.Ct. 1516]; <em>Rockford Life Ins. Co. v. Ill. Dept. of Revenue </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 182, 96 L.Ed.2d 152, 107 S.Ct. 2312.) This exemption is conferred by both statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>and the federal constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is intended \u201c \u2018to prevent taxes which diminish in the slightest degree the market value or the investment attractiveness of obligations issued by the United States in an effort to secure necessary credit.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Memphis Bank, supra, </em>at p. 396 [74 L.Ed.2d at p. 566], quoting <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1944) 323 U.S. 111, 117 [89 L.Ed. 107, 112, 65 S.Ct. 157].) It applies to any tax \u201cregardless of its <em>form </em>if federal obligations must be considered, either directly or indirectly, in <em>computing </em>the tax.\u201d <em>(American Bank, supra, </em>at p. 862 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 1079], italics in original.) In this context, \u201cconsidered\u201d means \u201ctaken into account, or included in the accounting.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">That the immunity extends to the tax before us seems to follow from the leading federal cases on the subject. In <em>Memphis Bank </em>the Supreme Court held that the statute barred a tax on banks which included in taxable earnings the interest on federal securities. (459 U.S. at pp. 396, 398-399 [74 L.Ed.2d at p. 566-568].) The Board initially sought to distinguish that case by noting that the tax there fell directly on the holders of federal securities, whereas the securities here are held by companies who are not taxed. This distinction was erased by <em>American Bank, supra, </em>463 U.S. 855, in which the Supreme Court set aside a tax <em>measured </em>by a bank\u2019s assets (including federal securities), but <em>imposed </em>on bank <em>shareholders. </em>The court described the immunity accorded to federal obligations as broad and \u201csweeping.\u201d <em>(American Bank, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 862 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 1078]; see <em>Memphis Bank, supra, </em>at p. 396 [74 L.Ed.2d at p. 566].) It noted that the statute was amended in 1959 to \u201csweep away formal distinctions and to invalidate all taxes measured directly or indirectly by the value of federal obligations . . . .\u201d <em>(American Bank, </em>463 U.S. at p. 867 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 1082].)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">(2) The Board asserts that the tax before us is not \u201cmeasured directly or indirectly\u201d by income from federal obligations, but concerns only \u201cdividends\u201d paid by Companies to their investors. The Board contends that this distinction flows from the general principle that \u201ca corporation is a nonconductor that cuts off connection between dividends to its stockholders and the corporate funds from which the dividends are paid.\u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Milwaukee </em>(1927) 272 U.S. 713, 714 [71 L.Ed. 487, 489, 47 S.Ct. 280].) However, this point is reminiscent of the \u201cformal but economically meaningless\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>distinctions which were previously held to permit taxation of bank shareholders even if the underlying assets were federal securities\u2014distinctions which became untenable with the 1959 amendments to the federal statute. <em>(See American Bank, supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 858, 871, fn. 14 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 1076, 1085].)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Moreover, as applied here, the \u201cnonconductor\u201d principle is less than \u201ceconomically meaningless\u201d; as a functional matter, it is wrong. The plaintiff Companies are not ordinary corporations, but registered investment companies whose business is to provide a conduit for investment in federal securities by persons who might otherwise be unable or unwilling to enter that market. The ability to pool investments in such funds stimulates the market for such securities by lowering the minimum investment necessary to participate in a given type of security, spreading the risks and rewards associated with (for example) fluctuating interest rates, and providing greater convenience and liquidity than would often be realized with individually purchased securities. Congress expressly recognized the \u201cconductor\u201d role of such companies when it declared, in the Investment Company Act of 1940, that they are <em>\u201cmedia </em>for the investment in the national economy of a substantial part of the national savings,\u201d which \u201cmay have a vital effect upon the <em>flow of such savings </em>into the capital markets.\u201d (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 80a-1(a)(4), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The constricting effect of this tax on a congressionally recognized conduit for investment capital must be weighed, together with the legislative goal of preserving the market value and investment attractiveness of federal securities, in subjecting this tax to the statutory test, i.e., whether the proceeds of federal securities are <em>directly or indirectly </em>taken into account in computing the tax. In this context, the Board\u2019s claim that it is blind to the origin of the distributions paid to the plaintiff class, even if accepted, is without economic significance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Unless Congress directs otherwise, the distributions Companies pay to their investors must be considered as so closely identified with their source that the computation of the tax involves indirect consideration of federal obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">This conclusion is consistent with the holdings reached in other jurisdictions. (An<em>dras </em>v. <em>Illinois Department of Revenue </em>(1987) 154 Ill.App.3d 37, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>106 Ill.

The taxing authorities in <em>American Bank </em>also relied on reporting by the shareholder and the bank, but this did not prevent a holding of illegality. (See 463 U.S. at p. 860 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 1077]; <em>Bank of Texas </em>v. <em>Childs </em>(Tex. Civ.App. 1981) 615 S.W.2d 810, 813.) Moreover, the Board is empowered to confirm the figures supplied to it by compelling production of documents and examining witnesses. (See Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 19254.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"> The three cases last cited are trial court opinions. The Board contends that such opinions cannot be relied upon. It argues that since unpublished opinions of the California Courts of Appeal cannot be cited in our courts (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 977), it would be anomalous to consider unpublished trial court decisions from elsewhere. We disagree. The purpose of rule 977 is not to declare all unpublished cases anathema, but to preserve the effective operation of the \u201cselective publication rule\u201d as it affects the courts of this state. (See 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 583, 578, pp. 574-575, 569-570.) Unpublished decisions by the courts of other jurisdictions may be cited and considered for their persuasive value. In this case we have found the thoughtful opinions of Judges Proffitt, Frankel, and Katz illuminating and persuasive on the points discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 300.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
