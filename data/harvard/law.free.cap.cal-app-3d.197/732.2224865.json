Code, \u00a7 192, subd. (c)(1)), a felony, and additional Vehicle Code violations. On this appeal he challenges only the vehicular manslaughter conviction for which he was sentenced to prison for the middle term of four years. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Because defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the proximate cause of Officer Esquibel\u2019s death, it is necessary to provide a detailed and lengthy statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">On August 8, 1985, at approximately 3:20 in the afternoon, California Highway Patrol Officer Gregory DeLaCruz was in his marked patrol car, a Dodge Diplomat, stopped at the intersection of 10th Avenue and Hanford-Armona Road. He was northbound on 10th Avenue when he noticed a motorcyclist, defendant Russell Glenn Pike, headed eastbound on Hanford-Armona Road. As defendant turned left and northbound onto 10th, DeLaCruz noticed that the cycle did not have a left side mirror. DeLaCruz followed on 10th and determined to pull defendant over. He planned to cite him for the equipment violation, a fix-it type of infraction. He was about 150 feet behind defendant when he activated the red spotlight on his car and accelerated in an attempt to catch up with the cycle. As the two were approaching the fairgrounds, defendant accelerated and DeLaCruz did the same. DeLaCruz paced the cycle at 66 miles an hour, although the speed limit was 45 miles per hour. As they approached the 10th Avenue overpass over Highway 198 near Third Street, defendant began slowing down where the speed limit changed from 45 to 35 miles per hour. DeLaCruz saw defendant turn his head over his left shoulder and look in DeLaCruz\u2019s direction. About one to one and one-half miles from the intersection of 10th and Hanford-Armona, DeLaCruz also activated his siren for a couple of short bursts. DeLaCruz thought defendant would pull into the market at the corner of 10th and Lacey and stop; instead, defendant took the curve onto East Lacey. Defendant turned and looked in DeLaCruz\u2019s direction a couple of times. After making the curve, defendant accelerated. As they continued accelerating while proceeding eastbound on Lacey, DeLaCruz, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>addition to his red lights, again activated the siren on full. At that point, DeLaCruz planned to cite defendant for the speeding as well as the equipment violation. Near the Golden Pancake House, DeLaCruz called on his radio to report he was chasing a motorcycle. He was still about 150 feet behind the motorcycle. Shortly thereafter, as DeLaCruz neared <em>9\u00bc </em>Avenue, California Highway Patrol Officer Esquibel, who was stopped facing westbound on Lacey, came on the radio and asked DeLaCruz if he was headed toward Highway 43. At some point, DeLaCruz called in the license number of the cycle and he thought it must have come back without any warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Defendant and DeLaCruz proceeded eastbound on Lacey. Up to that point, defendant had looked back at the officer some three or four times. At the turn from Lacey to Highway 43, defendant slowed down and moved to the inside of the curve. DeLaCruz went wide around him. As he caught up with defendant, DeLaCruz used his public address system and told him to pull over or he would \u201c. . . knock him off.\u201d This was a proper tactic to try to get defendant to stop even though the officer did not intend to do that. Defendant \u201ckind of smiled\u201d and kept going. During the turn both vehicles slowed down and defendant \u201ckind of drifted out into the right front door of [the] patrol vehicle\u201d and bumped it. The officer slowed even more so as not to flip defendant. Defendant looked down, kicked the patrol car door, turned around, laughed at DeLaCruz and took off accelerating. Immediately thereafter, DeLaCruz called Fresno dispatch and notified dispatch they had touched. Later, DeLaCruz found a small dent, a little gouge and a footprint on the patrol car door.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Defendant proceeded southbound on Highway 43 toward the cloverleaf to Highway 198. At the cloverleaf, DeLaCruz was about 50 feet behind him, tires squealing, as defendant sped eastbound on Highway 198. That section of Highway 198 is a four-lane road, two lanes in each direction, with a center divider. Defendant proceeded into the fast lane of eastbound Highway 198, but shortly started zig-zagging between the two eastbound lanes so that DeLaCruz could not pass him. As DeLaCruz proceeded on 198 he saw Esquibel\u2019s Ford LTD patrol car going from Lacey to Highway 43. Driving in the center of the road, DeLaCruz followed defendant at about 50 feet with both his red light and siren on. Shortly, DeLaCruz saw Esquibel\u2019s car on the cloverleaf entering eastbound 198 with his headlights flashing on and off. DeLaCruz saw Esquibel\u2019s car go across the center divider of Highway 198 and into the fast lane of westbound Highway 198 as he anticipated defendant making a U-turn. DeLaCruz heard Esquibel\u2019s car skid and almost stop. DeLaCruz noticed that traffic in the westbound lane of 198 had started to pull over. At that point, both defendant and DeLaCruz were almost at a stop on their side of the road. DeLaCruz was right at defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>ant\u2019s left rear and saw him look toward the left. Defendant leaned forward, accelerated again, and DeLaCruz followed suit. The road narrowed to two lanes, and defendant was in the eastbound lane, accelerating and pulling away from Officer DeLaCruz. At this point, there was other eastbound traffic and defendant began going around them at the intersection of Highway 198 and Seventh Avenue. There was, however, also traffic going westbound which began to pull over as defendant passed the eastbound traffic. DeLaCruz spoke to Esquibel who had asked if Esquibel should go around defendant. DeLaCruz stated he should not. DeLaCruz again spoke to Esquibel and they agreed to just stay behind defendant. Passing eastbound traffic, some of which pulled over to the shoulder, DeLaCruz and Esquibel pursued defendant. Defendant began pulling away from DeLaCruz again until they were about 150 yards apart at the point they passed Seventh Avenue. Defendant did not look behind again.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">After the cycle passed Sixth Avenue, DeLaCruz noticed some traffic in the eastbound lane. The cycle passed that traffic. As DeLaCruz came up to that traffic, it yielded to the right so he could pass in the traffic lane. At this time, DeLaCruz was able to call in a description of defendant. He was not wearing a shirt and DeLaCruz saw tattoos on the back of his shoulder. Between the two bridges after Sixth Avenue, DeLaCruz noticed defendant catch up to a tan car that appeared to be about to pass traffic in front of it. As defendant began to pass the tan car, the tan car pulled out, realized defendant was there and pulled back to the right and toward the shoulder of the road. The car fishtailed a bit as the driver attempted to maintain control. DeLaCruz notified dispatch that defendant nearly had caused an accident. DeLaCruz passed the tan car which had yielded so the officer could pass in the traffic lane. DeLaCruz then began drifting toward the center of the road looking for westbound traffic. He noticed a white semi-truck about one-half mile down the road along with other traffic behind it. At the Cross Creek Bridge, DeLaCruz moved over into the westbound lane so that traffic could see he was coming and would yield. He could see defendant as defendant passed the eastbound vehicles. Officer DeLaCruz had his lights activated. He saw Officer Esquibel\u2019s car, light activated, following behind. DeLaCruz started to catch up to three or four eastbound cars. The last car pulled over to the right and DeLaCruz started to pass. After passing that car, DeLaCruz approached the next car, a tan pickup. The pickup had gone to the right and then started to drift back into the eastbound lane from the right side. When DeLaCruz realized the pickup was continuing into the lane, he hit his brakes and started going around the pickup, aware at the time that the semi-truck was approaching in the westbound lane. DeLaCruz went into the westbound lane as the oncoming semi-truck was there, half way off the westbound roadway. DeLaCruz was skidding, headed for the trailer of the semi-truck. Rather than hit the truck, he took his foot off the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>brakes and steered back toward the right, the eastbound lane. He began to skid off the shoulder of the eastbound lane and then over to the westbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">As he was skidding, DeLaCruz\u2019s car hit the front end of Esquibel\u2019s car, which was now alongside DeLaCruz, and both cars spun. Esquibel\u2019s car continued off the road, hitting a road grader parked on the north shoulder of the westbound side of the road. DeLaCruz\u2019s car came to rest off the westbound side of the road about 15 feet from Esquibel\u2019s car. DeLaCruz\u2019s knee was \u201cbanged up ... a little bit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">DeLaCruz got out of his car and saw a fire under the engine compartment of Esquibel\u2019s car. He noticed defendant continuing eastbound and accelerating. DeLaCruz called Fresno dispatch to tell them of the accident and to send an ambulance. Thereupon he got the fire extinguisher from his car. DeLaCruz and others were able to force the car door open and drag Esquibel forcibly from the car wreckage that had enveloped him. Esquibel was alive. He was wearing a bullet-proof vest.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The jury viewed a videotape of the scene of the accident taken on the day of the accident. Various witnesses who had witnessed the chase were called. In all material respects, the witnesses corroborated DeLaCruz\u2019s account of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Defendant was described by one witness as \u201cswinging in and out, really driving crazy.\u201d A number of witnesses also estimated defendant\u2019s speed at between 70 and over 100 miles per hour. One witness described defendant\u2019s reaction to the accident behind him as follows: \u201cHe was looking over his right shoulder . . . watching what was going on back there.\u201d Defendant then \u201craised up his fist and smiled. Like he did something great or something.\u201d Defendant then continued toward Visalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">After defendant was arrested, Officer Kanna conducted a tape-recorded interview with him which was played to the jury. In his statement, defendant admitted that he decided to try to outrun the officer rather than stop. Defendant had seen the officer turn to follow him, and defendant had seen the officer\u2019s red light. He tried to get away because he had outstanding tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Various members of the Multi-disciplinary Accident Investigation Team, MAIT, testified to their investigation of the accident scene. Raymond Carlson examined the two California Highway Patrol cars driven by DeLaCruz and Esquibel. He found no mechanical problems that would have contributed to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Edward Wells was part of the MAIT assigned to gather evidence. He arrived at the scene around 4:45 p.m. and measured a variety of skid marks related to the cars. He also determined the coefficient of friction at various locations on the roadway. Esmay, who examined the evidence, determined that the Dodge driven by DeLaCruz was going approximately 88 to 98 miles per hour at the time it first braked. It slid for 431 feet before it collided with the Ford driven by Esquibel. At the time of the collision, the Dodge was going approximately 33 miles per hour. The Ford at that point of impact was going approximately 50 to 60 miles per hour. The Ford then slid across the dirt and pavement, slowing as it did so. When the Ford hit the road grader its speed was approximately 46 miles per hour. Esmay indicated that there were no visible brake marks from the Ford, but the Ford quite probably was braking heavily.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Warren Studer, the head of the MAIT investigating the accident, testified as to his conclusions regarding the incident. He was of the opinion that the motorcyclist the officers were pursuing was a noncontact involving party because of his violation of failing to yield to an emergency vehicle, or failing to stop when requested, and that this motorcyclist was driving in a willful and wanton manner that violated reckless driving statutes. On cross-examination when asked to consider just the collision between the two vehicles, he concluded that the primary cause of the accident was improper driving by Esquibel. He should have positioned his car at a safe distance behind DeLaCruz\u2019s car, rather than what may have been an attempt to pass DeLaCruz\u2019s skidding car. However, the motorist, who caused Officer DeLaCruz to attempt evasive action, was drifting back into the lane as a reaction to the motorcycle passing him at high speed. Officer Studer considered the tactic of a high speed pursuit of the motorcycle to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">DeLaCruz originally had hurt his left knee and he had suffered some small cuts on his hand in the process of removing Esquibel from the car. DeLaCruz went to the hospital where he was examined by Dr. Robert Ricketts. Dr. Ricketts found minor superficial abrasions on the outside of the left knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Esquibel died on August 21, 1985, as a result of injuries sustained in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Defendant did not testify. He called one witness, George Blair, an expert in accident reconstruction. Mr. Blair reviewed the MAIT report and the automobiles and concluded that the Ford was going between 67 and 96 miles per hour at the time it collided with the road grader. He concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>that the Ford was going 70 to 96 miles per hour at the time of impact with the Dodge. The parties stipulated that defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been suspended prior to August 8 and that he was aware of the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\n<em>Did the trial court commit prejudicial error in failing to instruct that a finding of gross negligence could not be based solely on facts inherent in the crime of vehicular manslaughter?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Citing this court\u2019s opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>McNiece </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 1048 [226 Cal.Rptr. 733], defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that a finding of gross negligence requires more than a finding that defendant committed the unlawful act which served as the basis for vehicular manslaughter. Defendant misconstrues our holding in <em>McNiece, </em>which was that <em>under the circumstances of that case </em>the failure of the trial court to clarify its instructions defining gross negligence constituted reversible error. The circumstances requiring clarification of the instructions on gross negligence were (1) defendant was prosecuted for felony vehicular manslaughter under Penal Code section 192, subdivision (c)(3), of which the driving of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol is an essential element; (2) the unlawful act relied upon was running a stop sign; and (3) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument could have misled the jury to believe that the defendant\u2019s driving under the influence of alcohol could, in and of itself, constitute gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">With these circumstances in mind, we held in <em>McNiece: </em>\u201cUnder the circumstances, the definition of <em>gross </em>negligence was improperly presented to the jury. It was not made clear what the jury was required to find.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">\u201cAgain, while the instructions indicated there was a difference between the two levels of negligence, nowhere in the instructions was the jury actually told that drunk driving alone did not constitute gross negligence. It was indicated the two kinds of negligence differed, and gross negligence was defined generally; however, no instruction clarified that something in addition to appellant\u2019s being under the influence of alcohol was necessary to establish gross negligence. There was no request for this additional instruction. It was necessary in all fairness that the jury be instructed that the element of gross negligence could not be supported solely by facts which satisfied other essential elements of section 192, subdivision (c)(3), namely (1) drunk driving and (2) a traffic offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McNiece, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.3d at p. 1057.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>In the instant case, defendant was prosecuted and convicted of felony vehicular manslaughter under Penal Code section 192, subdivision (c)(1), in that he \u201cdid unlawfully kill, without malice, Dean Esquibel while driving a vehicle and in the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony, with gross negligence.\u201d The court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cThe crime of vehicular manslaughter is the unintentional but unlawful killing of a human being in the driving of a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u201cKilling is unlawful when a person commits an act inherently dangerous to human life or safety, amounting to a misdemeanor or an infraction\u2014as will be later defined\u2014or negligently commits an act ordinarily lawful which might produce death.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u201cIn order to prove the commission of the crime of vehicular manslaughter, each of the following elements must be proved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">\u201cOne, that a human being was killed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">\u201cTwo, that the driver of the vehicle committed an unlawful act, to wit, a violation of speeding or reckless driving or negligently committed an act ordinarily lawful which might cause death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">\u201cAnd, three, that such unlawful act or negligent conduct was a proximate cause of the death of the person killed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">\u201cProximate cause of a death is a cause which, in natural and continuous sequence produces the death, and without which the death could not have occurred or would not have occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">\u201cIf you find that the defendant is guilty of manslaughter, you must also find whether the act causing the death was done with or without gross negligence, and you must declare your finding in that respect in your verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">\u201cIf you find that the defendant was guilty of manslaughter in the driving of a vehicle, but entertain a reasonable doubt as to whether the act causing death was committed with gross negligence, it would be then your duty to find that it was committed without gross negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">\u201cNegligence is the doing of something which a reasonably prudent person would not do, or the failure to do something which a reasonably prudent person would do under similar circunstances. It is the failure to use ordinary or reasonable care. Ordinary or reasonable care is that care which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>persons of ordinary prudence would use in order to avoid injury to themselves or others under similar circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u201cThe term \u2018gross negligence\u2019 as used in the definition of manslaughter given in these instructions means the failure to exercise any care or the exercise of so little care that you are justified in believing that the person whose conduct was involved was wholly indifferent to the consequences of his conduct to the welfare of others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">At all relevant times, Penal Code section 192, subdivision (c), defined four types of vehicular manslaughter. The element common to all four types is driving a vehicle in the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony or driving a vehicle in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death in an unlawful manner. The offense is a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of one year in the county jail. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 193, subd. (c)(2).) Thereafter, the subdivisions add additional requirements with a corresponding increase in the penalties. Thus, if the act was done with gross negligence the vehicular manslaughter may be a felony and, if so, the penalty is imprisonment in state prison for two, four or six years. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 192, subd. (c)(1), and 193, subd. (c)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Here, the trial court, after defining the crime of vehicular manslaughter, properly instructed that if the jury found defendant guilty of manslaughter it must also find \u201cwhether the act causing death was done with or without gross negligence.\u201d The court then properly defined the terms \u201cnegligence\u201d and \u201cgross negligence.\u201d The prosecuting attorney, rather than stating anything in closing argument that would have misled the jury, carefully emphasized the difference between the two levels of negligence and told the jury what it was required to find before a finding of \u201cgross negligence\u201d could be returned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She distinguished the simple offense of speeding from conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>amounting to gross negligence and informed the jury that the former was only negligent conduct. She also indicated to the jury that driving recklessly would amount to gross negligence. We agree that if the jury found that the unlawful act causing death was defendant\u2019s reckless driving, that finding, in and of itself, would support the finding of gross negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Under the circumstances of the instant case, therefore, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\n<em>Did the trial court correctly and adequately instruct the jury on the doctrines of proximate cause, concurrent causes and contributing cause?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Defendant makes an assault on three California jury instructions (CALJIC Nos. 8.55, 8.90 and 8.93) contending that they are erroneous on the issue of proximate cause, concurrent causes and contributory negligence. Defendant concludes that the giving of these instructions was prejudicial error requiring reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction for involuntary manslaughter. Each contention will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">A. <em>Proximate Cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">In several of the instructions given, the trial court defined the proximate cause of a death as follows: \u201c . . . proximate cause of a death is a cause which, in natural and continuous sequence, produces the death, and without which the death would not have occurred.\u201d (CALJIC No. 8.55; CALJIC No. 8.90; CALJIC No. 8.93.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Defendant contends that this definition of proximate cause is erroneous under well settled principles of law because it defines only cause in fact or actual cause, not proximate cause. We reject this contention for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">First, defendant fails to cite any authority which has held that the quoted instruction defines only actual cause or that it fails to define proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Second, although defendant does discuss the distinction between actual cause and proximate cause, there is no analysis which provides a basis for the conclusion that the instruction defines actual cause but not proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Third, defendant not only fails to suggest an instruction which would \u201ccorrectly define\u201d proximate cause, but fails to provide even a clue as to how the CALJIC instruction could be improved upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Finally, an analysis of the quoted instruction indicates that defendant\u2019s contention cannot withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Defendant is incorrect in his contention that the CALJIC instruction merely defines actual cause. Such an instruction would state as follows: \u201cThe actual cause of a death is a cause which produces the death and without which the death would not have occurred.\u201d What distinguishes proximate cause from actual cause as just defined is that in addition, the death must be produced in a natural and continuous sequence by defendant\u2019s conduct. Natural indicates that it must be \u201cnormal or usual: in the ordinary course of events [a <em>natural </em>outcome].\u201d (Webster\u2019s New World Dict. (2d college ed. 1982) p. 947.) It also requires that the death be \u201cproduced or existing in nature; not artificial or manufactured\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>thus excluding unexpected and unnatural deaths. Furthermore, the requirement of \u201ccontinuous\u201d sequence limits application \u201cto that which extends without interruption in either space or time.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 307.) This comports with the dictionary definition of \u201cproximate\u201d and excludes deaths which are only remotely produced. Thus, the proximate cause definition which was given the jury adequately \u201climits or ends the linking of numerous \u2018but-fors\u2019 \u201d which concerns the defendant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">B. <em>Concurrent causes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The trial court instructed the jury regarding concurrent causes of death as follows: \u201cThere may be more than one proximate cause of a death. When the conduct of two or more persons contributes concurrently as proximate causes of a death, the conduct of each of said persons is a proximate cause of the death regardless of the extent to which each contributes to the death. A cause is concurrent if it was operative at the moment of death and acted with another cause to produce the death.\u201d  Defendant maintains that this instruction misstates the law regarding a finding of proximate cause when two or more persons act concurrently. Specifically, defendant contends that an actor\u2019s conduct is a proximate cause only if it was a substantial factor contributing to the death (relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Caldwell </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 210 [203 Cal.Rptr. 433, 681 P.2d 274]) and here, the jury was not</p>\n<p id=\"AIBG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>informed that defendant\u2019s conduct must be a substantial factor in the death of Officer Esquibel in order to be a proximate cause of that death.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 210, the California Supreme Court discussed causation in the context of a defendant\u2019s liability for the death of his crime partner who was shot by a police officer. In that case, Belvin (the murder victim) and Washington held up a Church\u2019s Fried Chicken restaurant and Caldwell drove the getaway car. Following a high speed chase by four sheriff\u2019s cars, the getaway car stopped and a shootout ensued. During the shootout, Belvin was shot by one of the deputy sheriffs. Washington was convicted of first degree murder, and Caldwell was convicted of second degree murder. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 214-216.) Defendants asserted \u201cthat it was Belvin\u2019s act of pointing a gun out the window of the car that precipitated the deputies\u2019 fire, and that they themselves did nothing which could be characterized as likely to result in death.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 217.) Since they could not be held liable for Belvin\u2019s malicious conduct <em>(People </em>v. <em>Antick </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 79, 90-91 [123 Cal.Rptr. 475, 539 P.2d 43]), defendants insisted that the murder convictions could not stand. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>at p. 217.) Thus, as framed, the issue before the Supreme Court was whether defendants were the actual or but-for cause of their accomplice\u2019s death. The high court stated: \u201cTo be considered a <em>proximate </em>cause of Belvin\u2019s death, the acts of the defendants must have been a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 contributing to the result. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Scola </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 723, 726 [128 Cal.Rptr. 477]; Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 779-780; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Vernon </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 853, 864 [152 Cal.Rptr. 765] [a number of defendants concurrently contributed to victim\u2019s death by kicking].) \u2018[N]o cause will receive juridical recognition if the part it played was so infinitesimal or so theoretical that it cannot properly be regarded as a <em>substantial factor </em>in bringing about the particular result. This is merely a special application of the general <em>maxim\u2014\u201cde minimis non curat </em>lex\u201d . . .\u2019 (Perkins &amp; Boyce, <em>supra, </em>at p. 779.) The fact that one of the deputies who testified was primarily concerned about Caldwell\u2019s actions after the car stopped and their inferential importance to Belvin, and that another reacted to Washington\u2019s brandishing of the shotgun, militate in favor of recognizing said acts as a substantial factor in bringing about the gun battle and Belvin\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u201cDecisions in cases involving conduct of more than one co-felon acting in concert reflect the settled view that <em>the extent of an individual's contribution </em>to the resulting death need not be minutely determined.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pp. 220-221, last italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Although the Supreme Court used only the word \u201cproximate\u201d cause, it appears clear that the court was discussing the actual cause aspect of the</p>\n<p id=\"A0o\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>\u201clegal\u201d definition of proximate cause. As noted by Perkins: \u201cThe substantial factor test has been said to be useful only to determine the fact of causation. Perhaps the statement should be that it serves to emphasize common sense and rule out purely theoretical abstractions. . . . However it is expressed, the substantial factor test is one of exclusion only. What was not a substantial factor in causing harm was not a proximate cause thereof. What was a substantial factor may have been a proximate cause\u2014or it may not.\u201d (Perkins on Criminal Law (2d ed. 1969) p. 696, fn. omitted.) Thus, once it could be established that Caldwell\u2019s and Washington\u2019s personal conduct were at least a substantial factor in the actual cause of the police officers\u2019 decisions to shoot, proximate cause involved the simple determination of whether Belvin\u2019s death was a natural and continuously sequential result\u2014a foregone conclusion in that case. Using this standard, the majority concluded the evidence was sufficient to support defendants\u2019 convictions for murder. Justice Bird dissented, agreeing with defendants that Belvin\u2019s own pistol pointing could be the only cause for the police officers\u2019 responsive shooting. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">It is important to note that the correctness or sufficiency of the jury instructions on the issue of causation was not an issue in <em>Caldwell. </em>Instead, it is clear from the posture of that case and the court\u2019s holding that defendant\u2019s contention herein must be-rejected. The question in <em>Caldwell </em>was whether the conduct of each of the defendants was a substantial factor contributing to the resulting death of Belvin. If so, their conduct could be considered a concurrent, proximate cause of the death. Thus, had defendants conceded that their conduct in any way was a concurrent cause of the officers\u2019 responsive shooting, there would be no issue left to resolve. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Caldwell, </em>\u201cDecisions in cases involving conduct of more than one co-felon acting in concert reflect the settled view that the extent of an individual\u2019s contribution to the resulting death need not be minutely determined.\u201d Therefore, former CALJIC No. 8.93 correctly stated that \u201cWhen the conduct of two or more persons contributes concurrently as proximate causes of a death, the conduct of each of said persons is a proximate cause of the death regardless of the extent to which each contributes to the death.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Vernon </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 853, 864 [152 Cal.Rptr. 765].)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Defendant also points to BAJI No. 3.76 which states: \u201cLegal Cause\u2014 definition of [^[] A legal cause of [injury] [damage] [loss] [or] [harm] is a cause which is a substantial factor in bringing about the [injury] [damage] [loss] [or] [harm].\u201d However, the use note indicates that this instruction should be given where the \u201cinjury may have resulted from either of two causes operating alone.\u201d Such an instruction would have been improper in the instant case because there was not more than one cause which operated</p>\n<p id=\"A-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>alone in bringing about the death. Officer Esquibel\u2019s negligence could not be considered to have operated alone in causing his death because, but for defendant\u2019s conduct, Officer Esquibel would not have been driving negligently. At most, his conduct was a concurring cause of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Moreover, defendant\u2019s erroneous conclusion that the proximate cause definition given by the court was in error appears to have led him to detrimentally argue that less is more. Defendant argues that the court should have given a proximate cause definition similar to BAJI No. 3.76 on legal cause instead of the one given. However, it is clear that BAJI No. 3.76 would require a lesser causal showing than the proximate cause definition. BAJI No. 3.76 only requires that the jury find that defendant\u2019s conduct was a cause which was a substantial factor in bringing about the death rather than a finding that the conduct was a cause which \u201cin natural and continuous sequence, produces the death, and without which the death would not have occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Thus, contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the giving of the challenged proximate cause instruction rather than the legal cause or \u201csubstantial factor\u201d instruction actually increased the prosecution\u2019s quantum of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">C. <em>Contributing cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIt is not a defense to a criminal charge that the deceased or some other person was guilty of negligence, which was a contributory cause of the death in the case.\u201d (CALJIC No. 8.56 (1979 rev.).)  Defendant boldly asserts, without citation to authority, \u201cthis instruction misstates the law because the contributory negligence of a third party or the deceased may constitute a superseding cause in which case that negligence is a superseding cause and the defendant is not liable for the results.\u201d There is, of course, ample authority that the instruction is a correct statement of law. (1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) \u00a7\u00a7 252, 347, pp. 234, 318-319, and cases cited therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Defendant goes on to contend that not only is CALJIC No. 8.56 erroneous, it also negates the court\u2019s instructions on superseding causes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>to defendant\u2019s contention, CALJIC No. 8.56 did not negate the court\u2019s instructions on superseding cause. It correctly informed the jury that defendant could not escape liability for his grossly negligent conduct proximately causing the death by showing that the victim or some other party was also negligent. If the jury concluded that defendant\u2019s grossly negligent conduct was a proximate cause of Esquibel\u2019s death, no further analysis was required. The fact that the jury might also have concluded that the conduct of another person, whether simply negligent or grossly negligent, was a contributory cause of the death could not relieve defendant of culpability. Only when the defendant\u2019s grossly negligent conduct is a remote cause, and the negligent or reckless conduct of the victim or other party is the sole proximate cause of the death, will the defendant be relieved of culpability. <em>(See People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 419, 426-428 [125 Cal.Rptr. 40]; 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 252, 347, pp. 234, 318-319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In the case at hand, we conclude that the giving of CALJIC No. 8.56 was not error and could not have misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\n<em>Is there sufficient evidence that defendant\u2019s gross negligence was the proximate cause of the officer\u2019s death?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Defendant contends that, even assuming arguendo that his conduct in driving the motorcycle was grossly negligent, the evidence is insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that his gross negligence was the proximate cause of Officer Esquibel\u2019s death. This contention is totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">In reviewing a claim that the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction, an appellate court must review the record in the light most favorable to the judgment and presume in support of the judgment every fact the trier of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence. If, when so viewed, it appears that no reasonable trier of fact could have found each element of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the judgment must be reversed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576-578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255].) Whether a reasonable trier of fact could have found that an element of the crime was proven beyond a reasonable doubt turns on whether substantial evidence of that element exists in the record. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reilly </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 421, 425 [90 Cal.Rptr. 417, 475 P.2d 649].)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Here, defendant contends that \u201cThe evidence indicates that the chase, accident and ensuing fatality were based solely on [defendant\u2019s] commission of traffic violations discovered prior to the accident. All the evidence pointed to the conclusion that the officers planned to chase [defendant] until he was caught: his driving on [Highway] 198 was not the \u2018but for-\u2019 cause of the accident, and no substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding in this regard.\u201d Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u201cAlthough defendant\u2019s own unlawful act must be a proximate cause of the death, negligence on the part of the victim is not a defense to criminal liability. [Citations.] Moreover, defendant\u2019s conduct can be a proximate cause of a death even where death results from collision with a third vehicle. [Citations.] The determination of whether defendant\u2019s unlawful act or acts were a proximate cause of the death is a question for resolution by the trier of fact [citation] and is determined according to the ordinary principles governing proximate causation. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u201cA defendant may be criminally liable for a result directly caused by his act even if there is another contributing cause. If an intervening cause is a normal and reasonably foreseeable result of defendant\u2019s original act the intervening act is \u2018dependent\u2019 and not a superseding cause, and will not relieve defendant of liability. [Citation.] \u2018(1) The consequence need not have been a strong probability; a possible consequence which might reasonably have been contemplated is enough. (2) The precise consequence need not have been foreseen; it is enough that the defendant should have foreseen the possibility of some harm of the kind which might result from his act.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, 52 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 426-427, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In the instant case, the evidence adduced at trial indicates that defendant operated his motorcycle in an unlawful and reckless manner on public streets for approximately 10 miles in an effort to evade law enforcement officers who, using emergency sirens and red lights, tried to apprehend him. Defendant\u2019s speed at times reached 100 miles per hour. As held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, 52 </em>Cal.App.3d at page 427: \u201cIt was reasonably foreseeable that the officers would continue to chase him as he speeded recklessly and circuitously over public thoroughfares and failed to stop at boulevard stops, thus setting in motion circumstances creating peril to others on the public streets and a high probability that collisions, injuries and deaths would occur in the course of the chase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Defendant\u2019s grossly negligent acts consisted of his seeking to elude the pursuing law enforcement officers by charging through traffic at extremely high speeds. Had defendant stopped as he should have, the accident would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>not have occurred. Instead, his persistent attempt to escape brought about just what would be expected: pursuit by more officers. The speeds, places, conditions and methods of driving were primarily dictated by defendant; he chose the route and speeds. Predictably, the officers chose to follow suit, keep him in view and apprehend him when he stopped or was stopped. The probability that this might result in one or both of the officers losing control and/or colliding with another vehicle or some object is sufficient to establish that defendant\u2019s conduct was a cause that, in natural and continuous sequence, produced Officer Esquibel\u2019s death and without which that death would not have occurred. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.3d at p. 427; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>French </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 511, 523-525 [143 Cal.Rptr. 782].)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Hamlin, Acting P.

And all I can say to you is negligence is like running a stop sign accidentally and it\u2019s a $34.00 ticket, maybe even if you hit a car or kid it\u2019s manslaughter. Is that gross? Or evil purpose? No. It\u2019s carelessness. Was Mr. Pike just merely negligent or was he grossly negligent? Did he have an appreciation for what he did? Did he do more than just the casual running of a stop sign or speeding? You bet. Did he do many things? Yes. Did he force cars off the road? Did he drive recklessly? Did he whip in and out of traffic? Did he reach speeds in excess of 80 to 85 miles an hour? You bet. Is that gross negligence? I think it is, very clearly.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">\u201cThe Court gave you an instruction on gross negligence, and it talks about the fact, the exercise of such little care that you are justified in believing the person whose conduct was involved was wholly indifferent to the consequences of his conduct and the welfare of others. Was Mr. Pike indifferent? The only person he cared about was Mr. Pike, and he was having fun. He was laughing, he was smiling. He was enjoying it. Is that gross negligence? Yes, it is. Is it simple negligence? No. This is not the case of running a stop sign or going too fast in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>fog and rearending somebody.
