J.</author>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Federal law provides that when unemployed parents who are the recipients of benefits from the federally funded aid to families with dependent children program (AFDC-U) receive a nonrecurring lump-sum of money it shall be treated as income, with the consequence that a fixed period of automatic ineligibility to receive such benefits is imposed based upon the size of the sum and the applicable AFDC-U monthly payment standard. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602 (a)(17); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(F).) The major issue presented on these consolidated appeals is whether current provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (especially \u00a7 11157) and administrative regulations require the same result with respect to that version of the same program funded exclusively by the state (State-only AFDC-U). (\u00a7\u00a7 11201, subd. (b), 11315, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">II. Background and Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">Petitioner Tamie Shaw (plaintiff) commenced this action by filing a verified petition for writ of mandamus together with a complaint for declar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>atory and injunctive relief. She alleged that on February 29, 1984, one week after she received a $10,000 insurance settlement for her injuries in a 1980 automobile accident, her AFDC eligibility was terminated. When she applied for resumption of AFDC benefits two months later, \u201c[h]er application was denied by a notice which stated that her receipt of the insurance settlement . . . rendered her ineligible for AFDC from April 1984 to October 1985\u201d in accordance with Eligibility and Assistance Standard (EAS) 44-207.4. Plaintiff further alleged that this regulation was unlawful because it \u201cviolates\u201d sections 11157 and 11201. Among the various forms of relief sought by plaintiff were a writ of mandamus compelling defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cto provide State-only AFDC-U benefits to otherwise eligible families without regard to any period of ineligibility based on receipt of a lump sum\" and an injunction prohibiting denial of benefits on a contrary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">After considering the written and oral arguments of the parties, the trial court issued a permanent injunction and a peremptory writ of mandamus as prayed by plaintiff. Defendants thereafter moved to set aside this decision on the grounds that a recent amendment to section 11157 \u201cmake[s] it clear that the lump-sum rule applies to both state only and federal share AFDC programs.\u201d This motion was denied, the trial court ruling that the amendment did not validate application of the lump-sum rule to State-only AFDC-U benefits. A judgment ordering the injunctive and mandamus relief requested by plaintiff was subsequently entered. The court specifically noted in the judgment that \u201cThe provisions of this injunction are prohibitory, and shall not be stayed if an appeal is filed by defendants.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Defendants appealed from the judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Their petition for a writ of supersedeas and request for a stay of the judgment was denied by this court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1097, plaintiff then moved the trial court for an order compelling defendants\u2019 compliance with the judgment. The motion was granted and an order entered as requested. Defendants filed a timely notice of appeal from this order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The contentions on the judgment and the compliance order are discussed in separate chapters.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">III. Review</p>\n<p id=\"A07\">A. <em>The Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">By the time the trial court entered its judgment, the core of the controversy had boiled down to the interpretation of two versions of section 11157. Our task of reviewing the correctness of the trial court\u2019s statutory constructions has been compounded by the fact that section 11157 was amended yet again during the pendency of these appeals.  The rule that an injunction is to be evaluated according to the most current law governing at the time of an appeal\u2019s resolution <em>(McKinney </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 79, 85, fn. 1 [181 Cal.Rptr. 549, 642 P.2d 460]; <em>Citizens for Non-Toxic Pest Control </em>v. <em>Department of Food &amp; Agriculture </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1575, 1584 [232 Cal.Rptr. 729]) obliges us to consider section 11157 at each stage of its evolutionary development. Before doing so, however, it will be useful to place section 11157 in its context in the State-only AFDC-U scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The AFDC program was initiated by Congress as part of the Social Security Act of 1935. (Pub.L. No. 271 (Aug. 15, 1935) 47 Stat. 620.) In 1961 the AFDC-U program was experimentally extended to authorize states to receive matching federal funds for a state-administered system. (Pub.L. No. 87-31 (May 8, 1961) 75 Stat. 75.) The experiment was apparently deemed a success, for the program was made permanent in 1968. (Pub.L. No. 90-248 (Jan. 2, 1968) 81 Stat. 821.) California elected to participate in this model of cooperative federalism. (See Stats. 1963, ch. 510, p. 1372; Stats. 1965, ch. 1784, p. 3977.)  The state was thus obligated to comply with federal laws and regulations in order to receive federal funds. (See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 604(a), (d); <em>Lukhard </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 368 [95 L.Ed.2d 328, 107 S.Ct. 1807]; <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Vialpando </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 251, 253 [40 L.Ed.2d 120, 125, 94 S.Ct. 1746]; <em>Darces </em>v. <em>Wood </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>871, 880 [201 Cal.Rptr. 807, 679 P.2d 458].) A state is, however, free to adopt and implement a more liberal eligibility standard with respect to a State-only AFDC-U program. (See <em>Engelman </em>v. <em>Amos </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 23, 24 [30 L.Ed.2d 143, 144-145, 92 S.Ct. 181]; <em>Darces </em>v. <em>Woods, supra, </em>at pp. 894-895; <em>Reyna </em>v. <em>McMahon </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 220, 223 [225 Cal.Rptr. 405].) California has enacted its version of such a program. (\u00a7\u00a7 11201, subd. (b), 11315, subd. (a); see in detail, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The first version of section 11157 with which we must concern ourselves was enacted in late 1981. As relevant here, it read in pertinent part as follows: \u201cTo the extent required, as a condition for receipt of federal funds, by federal law, lump-sum payments of income, as defined by federal law, received by an applicant for or recipient of aid under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11200) shall be considered income in the month received and the family shall be ineligible for aid for the number of months that equals the sum of all income received during such month less all applicable income disregards divided by the standard of need applicable to the family . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1982, First Ex. Sess., ch. 3, \u00a7 10, p. 6894.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The second version\u2014the one brought to the trial court\u2019s attention shortly before the judgment was entered\u2014insofar as it is germane to our inquiry, amended the prefatory part of section 11157 so that it read: \u201cTo the <em>same </em>extent <em>as </em>required, as a condition for receipt of federal funds, by federal law . . . .\u201d (Italics added, Stats. 1984, ch. 1447, \u00a7 4, p. 5063.) This amendment was an urgency measure effective September 26, 1984 <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 16, p. 5072), only five days before the October 1, 1984, date to which the judgment was keyed. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The final change wrought by the Legislature occurred during the pendency of these appeals. Effective January 1, 1987, section 11157 was amended to delete the words \u201csame\u201d and \u201cas\u201d inserted by the 1984 amendment. (Stats. 1986, ch. 1402, \u00a7 4.) This brings the evolution of section 11157 full circle, returning its first sentence (the part which the parties treat as controlling) to the exact wording originally construed by the trial court. The correctness of that construction we now consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Plaintiif\u2019s position at all times has been simple. For her, the variants of section 11157\u2019s opening references to \u201cfederal funds\u201d and \u201cfederal law\u201d demonstrate that California\u2019s adoption of the lump-sum rule is confined to the joint state-federal AFDC-U program and thus has no application to the State-only AFDC-U program. Defendants contend that the language \u201c \u2018lump-sum payments . . . received by an applicant for or recipient of aid under chapter 2\u2019 \u201d does apply to the state-only program author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>ized by sections 11201 and 11315 because these provisions are within chapter 2. (\u00a7\u00a7 11200-11489.)</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">In construing section 11157 and ascertaining the legislative intent behind it, we first look to the statute\u2019s language. <em>(Steketee </em>v. <em>Lintz, Williams &amp; Rothberg </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 46, 51 [210 Cal.Rptr. 781, 694 P.2d 1153]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d <em>477, </em>485 [208 Cal.Rptr. 724, 691 P.2d 272]; <em>T. M. Cobb Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 273, 277 [204 Cal.Rptr. 143, 682 P.2d 338].) All of that language must be considered, giving where possible significance to each word, avoiding constructions which make words surplusage, and reading the statutory language according to its ordinary and usual import. <em>(Steketee </em>v. <em>Lintz, Williams &amp; Rothberg, supra, </em>at p. 52; <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Farrell </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 47, 54 [184 Cal.Rptr. 713, 648 P.2d 935].) This court recently reiterated that statutes should receive a practical and commonsense construction which achieves a reasonable result consistent with legislative purpose and intent. <em>(Dreyer\u2019s Grand Ice Cream, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 1174, 1181-1182 [224 Cal.Rptr. 285].)  Application of .these principles leaves no doubt that the trial court properly sustained plaintiff\u2019s construction as correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The opening part of section 11157 reading \u201cTo the extent required, as a condition for receipt of federal funds, by federal law\u201d is naturally interpreted as referring only to the joint state-federal AFDC-U program. The State-only AFDC-U program, being funded and administered entirely by the state would not be \u201crequired ... by federal law\u201d to do anything \u201cas a condition for receipt of federal funds\u201d because no federal funds were to be received. The ordinary import of the quoted language is therefore pertinent only to the joint state-federal program and thus irrelevant to the state-only program. The quoted language, read in the context of the two existing programs, naturally conveys a distinction between them. If, as defendants contend, the Legislature did intend to make the lump-sum rule applicable to both programs, maintaining this implicit distinction would be unnecessary. The fact that the Legislature did not see fit to amend the statutes authorizing the state-only program is strong evidence that such a fundamental change was not contemplated. The construction defendants urge would more reasonably be found in the <em>absence </em>of the quoted language. The fact that the State-only AFDC-U program is within chapter 2 is without consequence in the absence of a more specific legislative intent to make substantive changes in that program.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">This much we think discernible from the language of the statute. We believe that the construction of section 11157 claimed by plaintiff and sustained by the trial court is a practical one which is consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Legislature\u2019s apparent aim to maintain both the joint state-federal and the state-only programs. (See <em>Dreyer\u2019s Grand Ice Cream, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1181-1182.) Defendants\u2019 construction is unreasonable in that it would achieve the opposite result and would make the quoted language surplusage. It must therefore be rejected. (See <em>Steketee </em>v. <em>Lintz, Williams &amp; Rothberg, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 52; <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Farrell, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Plaintiff has submitted a wealth of legislative materials relative to the 1984 and 1986 amendments of section 11157 which reinforce her construction of that statute. The 1984 amendment of section 11157 was introduced as part of Assembly Bill No. 1557. During the course of the Assembly-Senate conference, the Department of Social Services proposed that sections 11008.13, 11008.14, and 11157 be amended to include the following: \u201cThis section shall be applied to all applicants for, and recipients of, aid under Chapter 2, . . . <em>regardless of whether federal financial participation is available </em>for the family.\u201d (Italics added.) With minor and nonsubstantive modifications, this language was inserted in sections 11008.13 and 11008.14. (Stats. 1984, ch. 1447, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, pp. 5061-5063.) It was not, however, added to section 11157.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This omission is compelling evidence against defendants\u2019 construction of section 11157. Had the Legislature intended to obliterate the distinctions between the joint state-federal and the state-only programs, it obviously knew how to express such an intent. The only possible conclusion is that it consciously chose to maintain the distinction between the two programs.  It is thus- appropriate to invoke the principles that \u201c[wjhere a statute on a particular subject omits a particular provision, the inclusion of such a provision in another statute concerning a related matter indicates an intent that the provision is not applicable to the statute from which it was omitted.\u201d <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Edwards Theatres Circuit, Inc. </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 881, 891 [134 Cal.Rptr. 844]; accord <em>Balboa Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aguirre </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1008 [197 Cal.Rptr. 250]; <em>Fogarty </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 316, 320 [172 Cal.Rptr. 594]), and that \u201c \u2018[t]he failure of the Legislature to change the law in a particular respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>when the subject is generally before it and changes in other respects are made is indicative of an intent to leave the law as it stands in the aspects not amended.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Estate of McDill </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 831, 837-838 [122 Cal.Rptr. 754, 537 P.2d 874]; accord <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 970, 977 [140 Cal.Rptr. 669, 568 P.2d 394] [text &amp; fn. 10]; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Union Pacific Land Resources Corp. </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 307, 315 [224 Cal.Rptr. 487]; <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 331, 338 [205 Cal.Rptr. 518].)  Defendants\u2019 contention that we should in effect construe section 11157 as if the proposed language had been inserted is consequently untenable. \u201cTo do so would not be interpreting the legislative intent but would be a gross example of judicial legislation in contravention of the legislative intent logically implied from the rejection by the Legislature of an identical provision.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brannon </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 971, 977 [108 Cal.Rptr. 620]; accord <em>Western Land Office, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cervantes </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 724, 741 [220 Cal.Rptr. 784].)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Assembly Bill No. 1557 is made additionally comprehensible when considered in conjunction with Senate Bill No. 2002. The latter, as amended, would have deleted section 11315 (see fn. 6, ante) and would have added to section 11201 language specifying that \u201cAll other federal requirements and eligibility standards applicable to the federal AFDC-U program shall apply to the State-only AFDC-U program.\u201d (See 5 Sen. J. (1984 Reg. Sess.) pp. 8653-8654.) Senate Bill No. 2002 died on the Senate floor in late November of 1984 (see 8 <em>id., </em>pp. 14425, 14609), approximately two months after Assembly Bill No. 1557 had been enacted. (Stats. 1984, ch. 1447, p. 5061 et seq.) The Legislature\u2019s almost concurrent passage of Assembly Bill No. 1557 and its rejection of Senate Bill No. 2002 confirm our opinion that defendants\u2019 construction of section 11157 is unacceptable. (See <em>Western Land Office, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cervantes, supra, </em>175 Cal.App.3d 724 at p. 741; <em>Seibert </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 1, 19 [120 Cal.Rptr. 233].)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The insertion of the \u201csame . . . as\u201d wording in the 1984 amendment and its deletion from the 1986 amendment are of no significant moment. As we have seen, the pertinent language of both of these enactments concerns only the joint state-federal AFDC-U program. A reasonable construction of these amendments, when considered in the context of section 11157 in its entirety, denies to these provisions any impact on the existing and established State-only AFDC-U program. Both the plain language of section 11157 and the legislative history recounted above, refute defendants\u2019 claim that the Legislature intended a substantial modification of that program. (Cf. <em>Reyna </em>v. <em>McMahon, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d 220 at pp. 224-226.) This analysis loses none of its force with regard to each and all of the versions of section 11157 effective at various points during this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Our initial conclusion is that each of those versions is compatible with plaintiff\u2019s construction and none supports defendants\u2019 construction.  We further conclude that EAS 44-207.4<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was correctly treated by the trial court as void because the regulation is inconsistent with section 11157 in that the regulation purports to extend the lump-sum rule to the State-only AFDC-U program, an extension neither authorized nor required by the statute. The trial court therefore properly enjoined its enforcement. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 11342.2; <em>Ontario Community Foundations, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 811, 816-817 [201 Cal.Rptr. 165, 678 P.2d 378]; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 668, 680 [170 Cal.Rptr. 484, 620 P.2d 1032]; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 856, 864 [115 Cal.Rptr. 1, 524 P.2d 97]; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 737, 748 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">B. <em>The Compliance Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Following entry of the judgment, a dispute arose between the parties concerning the scope of the relief ordered by the trial court. As part of the \u201cAll-County Letter\u201d required by the judgment (see fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>defendants advised county welfare authorities that lump-sum recipients were not eligible for State-only AFDC-U benefits if the principal earner of the family met all of the eligibility conditions of the joint state-federal program except the receipt of a lump-sum payment. The trial court held that this was improper and ordered dispatch of a new letter informing local welfare departments that State-only AFDC-U benefits \u201cmay not be denied to families because they meet federal requirements for work history or connection to the labor force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Defendants argue that the compliance order issued by the trial court is erroneous and should be set aside. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the state-only benefit rule is applicable to all parents receiving AFDC benefits under section 11201, even if the parent (or parents) are eligible for such benefits under the federal law,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ous. The law is clear that under section 11201 a parent is entitled to joint state-federal unemployment AFDC benefits if he or she qualifies as unemployed under either the federal standards<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (subd. (a)(1)) or the state standards as specified in subd. (b)(1)-(4) (see \u00a7 11201, subd. (a)(2)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since we have held that under the correct interpretation of section 11157 the federal lump-sum rule is applicable whenever the applicant or recipient is entitled to AFDC-U under the federal law, it follows that the parent qualifying as unemployed under the federal standards must fall within the federal lump-sum rule. An imposition of a unitary state-only rule to all parents regardless of whether they are entitled to receive AFDC-U benefits under the state or federal qualifying standards would be in inherent conflict with our basic holding reached with respect to the applicability of the federal lump-sum rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Furthermore, our proposition is buttressed by the specific provisions of the statute as well. <em>Section 11315, subdivision (a), explicitly provides that the State-only AFDC-U program has been established solely for those parents </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>who meet the eligibility standards under subdivision (b) of section </em>11201.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It bears emphasis that <em>subdivision (b) sets out the eligibility criteria for the State-only AFDC-U benefits. </em>(See fn. 12, <em>ante.) </em>Equally importantly, subsection (5) of subdivision (b) clarifies that in determining unemployment for the purposes of AFDC benefits the federal rules are paramount by spelling out that whenever one parent qualifies as unemployed under the federal standards, it precludes the other parent from availing himself or herself of the State-only AFDC-U program.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim that the application of different standards to the unemployed parents violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution, requires but a brief reply. In <em>Darces </em>v. <em>Woods, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 871, 894, our Supreme Court emphasized that a state may adopt and apply differing eligibility standards to State-only and federal AFDC-U welfare recipients.

I do not know how or on what basis the majority treats the former standard as an apple while the latter qualifies as an orange. On its face the statute\u2019s language does not justify picking and choosing which federal standards are applicable to the state-only program, yet this is precisely what the majority does. Nor does the majority identify any discernible basis for making a principled distinction as to which federal standards are in and which are out. At best, the majority\u2019s opinion is internally inconsistent; the respective positions regarding the construction of sections 11157 and 11201 are totally irreconcilable. At worst, and as I shall attempt to demonstrate hereafter, the majority\u2019s position will make the State-only AFDC-U program a virtual dead letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u201c \u2018The rule of law in the construction of remedial statutes requires great liberality, and wherever the meaning is doubtful, it must be so construed as to extend the remedy.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Continental Cas.

This court is on record as agreeing that \u201can interpretation which would lead to an unreasonable result or absurdity must be avoided.\u201d <em>(Dreyer\u2019s Grand Ice </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>Cream, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 1174, 1182 [224 Cal.Rptr. 285].)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">I take it as a given that the statutes respecting the State-only AFDC-U program qualify as remedial in nature. The statutes establishing that program can only be seen as a conscious decision by the Legislature to establish a more liberal eligibility standard than those governing the joint state-federal AFDC-U scheme. The majority recognizes the Legislature\u2019s unquestioned power to make such a decision. (See <em>Engelman </em>v. <em>Amos </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 23, 24 [30 L.Ed.2d 143, 144-145, 92 S.Ct. 181]; <em>Darces </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 871, 894-895 [201 Cal.Rptr. 807, 679 P.2d 458]; <em>Reyna </em>v. <em>McMahon, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d 220 at p. 223.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The majority professes its intention \u201cto maintain both the joint state-federal and the state-only programs.\u201d (Majority opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 425.) Yet this goal is at odds with what the majority does, which is to gut the state-only program and abolish any distinction between it and the joint state-federal AFDC-U program.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">One can only assume that there must be some difference between the two programs, or else the Legislature\u2019s decision to establish the state-only program (see \u00a7 11315, subd. (a)) was nothing less than an exercise in futility. Granted, section 11201 is hardly an exemplar of precise legislative draftsmanship. But even the majority recognizes that section 11201 establishes differing eligibility standards for the joint state-federal program (subd. (a)) than for the state-only program (subd. (b)). The obvious import of section 11201 is that if a parent does not qualify under subdivision (a) for inclusion in the joint program, he or she can qualify for eligibility in the state-only program if the requirements of subdivision (b) are met. Yet this bifurcation flies in the face of subdivision (b)(5)\u2019s incorporation of \u201cthe standards . . . set by the federal government.\u201d Read literally, this requires a parent to meet all federal standards in order to qualify, not for the joint state-federal program, but for the state-only program. Applied literally, this language makes the state-only program redundant: a parent who qualifies for the state-only program would also qualify for the joint program and would presumably be included in the joint program. If this is the case, who would qualify for just the state-only program? The unavoidable answer would seem to be: no one.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">This would make the Legislature\u2019s deliberate decision to establish the State-only AFDC-U program a beautiful gesture devoid of any substance. I cannot imagine a more absurd, capricious, or unreasonable result so totally disharmonious with the Legislature\u2019s manifest purpose in establishing that program. A different yet logical construction will avoid these dire consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>I would construe the reference to \u201cstandards for unemployed parents set by the federal government\u201d in subdivision (b)(5) of section 11201 to mean all such standards not incompatible with state law. Defendants conceded before the trial court that the \u201cwork history\u201d factor is not an eligibility standard for the state-only program.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They recognized in the \u201cAll-County Letter\u201d quoted <em>ante </em>that \u201cin order to get state-only AFDC-U a principal earner cannot be eligible for the federal AFDC-U program.\u201d The same statute that establishes the State-only AFDC-U program also states: \u201cFor purposes of this section, if neither parent has a connection to the labor force, as defined by federal law, the family may designate the primary wage earner.\u201d (\u00a7 11315, subd. (c).) This provision can only be read as a decisive repudiation of the majority\u2019s view that \u201cwork history or connection to the labor force\u201d must be treated as a prerequisite for eligibility in the state-only program.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">These circumstances put the compliance order in a different and completely sustainable light. The construction of section 11201 I propose is consistent with the principles of statutory interpretation quoted above. It is also the only reasonable way to prevent the State-only AFDC-U program from being consigned to oblivion and becoming \u201conly a promise to the ear to be broken to the hope, a teasing illusion like a munificent bequest in a pauper\u2019s will.\u201d <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>California </em>(1941) 314 U.S. 160, 186 [86 L.Ed. 119, 132, 62 S.Ct. 164] (conc. opn. of Jackson, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">My vote is for unqualified affirmance of the judgment and the compliance order.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 27, 1988.
