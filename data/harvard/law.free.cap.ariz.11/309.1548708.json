The case presents an elementary principle \u2014 how a pleading should be construed against a general demurrer. The action is in the nature of ejectment, and complies with the provisions of section 4112, Revised Statutes of 1901. \u201cEven on demurrer the pleadings are to be liberally construed. The complaint on demurrer must be deemed to allege that which can be implied from the allegations therein by reasonable and fair intendment. And a reasonable construction will be given, although the facts are imperfectly or informally averred and argumentatively stated, or the pleading lacks definiteness and precision.\u201d 4 Eney. of PI. &amp; Pr. 749, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>755, 756; <em>Santa Fe </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>4 Ariz. 258, 36 Pac. 217; <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Nilima, </em>133 Fed. 214, 66 C.

The pleading must he construed as a whole, and if it can be determined therefrom what is intended, the pleading is sufficient, and that construction must be given which will support the pleading and reach the real intent of the pleader. 4 Ency. of Pl. &amp; Pr., 744-746; 6 Ency. of Pl. &amp; Pr., 346, 369, 389.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-5\">Seth E.

Co. </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>6 Ariz. 323, 57 Pac. 643; <em>Keppler </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>9 Ariz. 234, 80 Pac. 334. The party filing the contest should allege and prove every step necessary to establish his right to his mining claim that would be required in the land office for patent, with the exception of the advertisement and the certificate of the surveyor general as to the amount of work required before patent could be obtained. <em>Allyn </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>5 Ariz. 152, 48 Pac. 960. The plaintiff, in order to recover in an adverse suit, must show that he is the owner of a valid and subsisting location of the land in dispute, superior in right to that of defendants, and he must recover on the strength of his own title and not on the weakness of that of his adversary. <em>Gwillim </em>v. <em>Dennellan, </em>115 U. S. 45, 5 Sup. Ct. 1110, 29 L. Ed. 348. To render the complaint sufficient in an adverse suit, plaintiff must allege that the ground in controversy was mineral land subject to location. <em>Keppler </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>9 Ariz. 234, 80 Pac. 334.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-7\">The allegation of the plaintiff in his complaint that the ground in controversy was unoccupied public mineral land, open to plaintiff\u2019s location, is governed by the allegations of the facts whereby it became so open to location, and these do not justify the conclusion deduced from them, and the resulting allegation is a nullity. \u201cIt is a rule of pleading that where a general result or fact is pleaded, and also the special facts by which such result is reached, and they do not support the result, the special facts control, and the pleading is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>bad.\u201d <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Presbyterian Board etc., </em>67 Minn. 436, 70 N.

O. Phillips brought suit against Hoval Smith- and Martin Costello to quiet title to a mining claim in support of an adverse proceeding pending in the land office. Defendants demurred to the complaint on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The demurrer was sustained, and, plaintiff having declined to-amend, judgment was rendered against him. Prom this judgment he has appealed. The question before us, therefore, is whether the complaint states a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The complaint is long, is involved, and pleads several pages of evidential matter. It would not be useful to set it forth in full, or to abstract it. It will suffice to take up -the defects urged against it by the appellee Smith through his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">1. Plaintiff, the subsequent locator, seeks in his complaint to show that the defendants, prior locators, have not had a valid mining location, and specifies in detail the alleged deficiencies in the location proceedings. Among other matters in this behalf he pleads \u201cthat the said Key lode, defendants\u2019 claim, was never marked nor monumented on the ground so that the boundaries thereof could be distinctly traced, and that the surface boundaries of the said Key lode were never marked by any substantial posts projecting four feet above the surface of the ground, nor by substantial stone monuments three feet high, nor to mark or monument the same at all.\u201d The infinitive verbs in the concluding clause of this allegation do- not have, as infinitives, a syntactical relation with any finite verb in the sentence. It has been held by this court that, in construing the language of a complaint, \u201cwe should make every reasonable intendment, and . . . sustain the pleading, if possible.\u201d <em>Santa Fe etc. Ry. Co. </em>v. Hurley, 4 Ariz. 258, 36 Pac. 216. In Pomeroy\u2019s Code Remedies, third edition, section 549, the author has said: \u201cThe true doctrine-to be gathered from all the cases is that, if the substantial facts which constitute a cause of action . . . can be inferred by reasonable intendment from the matters which are set forth, although the allegations of these facts are imperfect, incomplete and defective \u2014 such insufficiency pertaining, however, to the form rather than to the substance \u2014 the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>mode of correction is not by demurrer, . . . but by motion before the trial to make the averments more definite and certain by amendment. ... If the pleader should aver conclusions of law in place of fact, the resulting insufficiency and imperfection would pertain to the form rather than to the substance. The mode of correction would be by motion, and not by a demurrer.\u201d See, also, <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Manhattan Life Ins. Co., ante, </em>p. 232, 95 Pac. 89, and <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Nilima, </em>133 Fed. 209, 66 C. C. A. 263. If the defendants were not satisfied with the allegation that \u201cthe said Key lode was never marked nor monumented on the ground so that the boundaries thereof could be easily traced\u201d as an allegation of ultimate fact, they should have attacked the allegation by motion; and, if they were perplexed as to the syntax of the infinitive verbs, the remedy likewise was by motion. Giving the first clause its full weight, it discloses a violation of the requirement of the federal statute that \u201cthe location must be distinctly marked on the ground so that its boundaries can be readily traced.\u201d Kev. Stats., sec. 2324 (U. S. Comp. Stats. 1901, p. 1426). Extending but little indulgence to the concluding clause, we may regard it as an allegation that the location was not marked or monumented in anywise. The sufficiency of the allegations in the other clauses of the quoted portion of the complaint is attacked by reason of the fact that it does not appear from the complaint that the location of the Key lode was made at a time when the Arizona statutes required that the location should be marked by substantial posts projecting at least four feet above the ground, or by substantial stone monuments at least three feet high. The deficiency in these last-mentioned clauses is negligible, since the first and last clauses in the quotation charge facts which, if true, disclose that the defendants have not a valid location under the federal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">But appellee contends that the effect of this pleading is nullified by the subsequent allegations in the complaint that \u201cin fixing the boundaries and marking the claim upon the ground and making the monuments on the Bonanza placer claim, plaintiff\u2019s claim, the plaintiff fixed upon and selected the same points for corner monuments that had been selected and fixed for corner monuments for said Key lode by the locators thereof, and that the boundaries and monuments of the said Key lode and amended Bonanza claim are identical,\u201d with a certain exception. Applying the rule of liberal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>struetion, we do not feel, in the face of the allegation that the Key lode was not marked or' monumented, that we should interpret this last expression as an admission that it was marked and monumented. Certainly it may not be construed as an admission that the Key claim was \u201cdistinctly marked on the ground so that its boundaries can be readily traced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">2. Appellee contends that the complaint is insufficient by reason of the fact that it shows upon its face a forcible, clandestine or surreptitious entry by the plaintiff in order to make his location. This criticism is directed at plaintiff\u2019s allegation that he \u201centered upon the grounds comprised within the Key lode in a peaceable and lawful manner, and explored said premises, and discovered and found placer gold.\u201d The adjective \u201clawful,\u201d as contended by appellee, adds nothing to the strength of the allegation; and of course the entry could have been peaceable, and still have been clandestine. <em>Nev. Sierra Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Home Oil Co. </em>(C. C.), 98 Fed. 673. But there is nothing in the complaint to support a conclusion that the Key claim was ever occupied by the defendants or in their possession, other than as constructive possession may be inferred fjpom their acts of location. If the defendants were not in actual possession of the ground, plaintiff was within his rights in exploring and locating the ground, and may be heard to litigate his contention that he has acquired the mining claim as against the defendants. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>38 Colo. 393, 88 Pac. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">3. Appellee submits that it is not averred in the complaint that at the time of the location by plaintiff, or at any other time, the ground in controversy was unoccupied mineral ground, subject to location. Plaintiff\u2019s allegation in this behalf is \u201cthat by reason of the defendants, their grantors and predecessors in interest, never having discovered any vein, lode, ledge, or mineral in place on said Key lode, and never having made a valid location or appropriation thereof as required by law as hereinbefore alleged, that all the hereinbefore described lands covered by their pretended location of the said Key lode was, and ever since has been, vacant, unoccupied and unclaimed mineral lands of the United States, and subject to location under the mining laws thereof,\u201d until plaintiff located; and, further, that \u201cthe plaintiff has and claims the legal right to occupy and possess all thos.e premises hereinbefore described in his amended location notice of said Bonanza claim, is the legal owner thereof, and is en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>titled to the immediate and exclusive possession of every part and parcel thereof by virtue of a full compliance with the local laws and rules of miners in said mining district, the laws of the United States, and of the territory of Arizona, by pre-emption, and by actual prior possession, as a placer mining claim, located on the public domain of the United States.\u201d Extending to these allegations the liberal interpretation demanded by the rule hereinbefore announced, we hold that they sufficiently aver that the -ground in controversy was unoccupied public mineral land open to plaintiff\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">These are the only points of attack by the appellee which we need to consider. We have given the complaint careful examination, and are satisfied that it states a cause of action. The demurrer should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The judgment of the district eourt is reversed, with direction to that court to overrule the demurrer to the complaint, to the end that further proceedings may be had not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">KENT, C. J., and SLOAN and CAMPBELL, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
