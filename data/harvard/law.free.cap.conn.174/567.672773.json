However, in February, 1976, a Notice of Dormant Cases was sent to the parties advising them that a hearing would be held on the court\u2019s motion to dismiss the action for failure to prosecute with reasonable diligence as provided for under $ 191A of the Practice Book.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, the plaintiffs\u2019 action was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">On March 29,1976,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> before the end of the January session, the plaintiffs filed a \u201cMotion to Open Dismissal\u201d (presumably a motion to restore the case to the docket), together with a motion for default by reason of the defendants\u2019 failure to plead. Although the defendants filed an objection to that motion on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear it, the record reveals that no action was taken by the court on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. On April 20, 1976, the plaintiffs once again filed a \u201cMotion to Open Dismissal\u201d which was in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>respects identical to their March 29 motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court heard this latter motion on January 14, 1977, which it treated as a motion to restore to the docket, and, on January 31, 1977, denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The plaintiffs have appealed from the judgment striking their case and have assigned as error the court\u2019s refusal to restore the case to the docket. This was entirely proper. \u201cA judgment striking a case from the docket is a final judgment terminating the rights of the parties to proceed with the action. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Shore Line Electric Ry. Co., </em>84 Conn. 24, 31, 78 Atl. 587. A motion to restore a ease struck from the docket is like a motion to reopen a judgment; the decision upon it is not the basis of an appeal but it may postpone the limitation of the time within which an appeal from the judgment striking the case from the docket must be taken. <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal, </em>64 Conn. 526, 534, 30 Atl. 775; <em>Equitable Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Plume, </em>92 Conn. 649, 652, 103 Atl. 940.\u201d <em>Glazer </em>v. <em>Rosoff, </em>120 Conn. 120, 122, 179 A. 407; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corporation, </em>134 Conn. 198, 201, 56 A.2d 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The trial court did not make a finding since it was not requested to do so. \u201cIn the absence of a finding and appendix containing relevant evidence, we can properly turn to the memorandum of decision to ascertain the grounds on which the court acted. <em>National Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>153 Conn. 219, 226, 215 A.2d 123; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 152.\u201d <em>Keane </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>163 Conn. 606, 607, 316 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>A.2d 416, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1113, 93 S. Ct. 927, 34 L. Ed. 2d 696; <em>Worden </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>170 Conn. 186, 188, 365 A.2d 1205. In its memorandum of decision, the court made it clear that its refusal to restore the case to the docket was based upon its determination that it lacked jurisdiction over the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In the absence of waiver or consent of the parties, a court is without jurisdiction to modify or correct a judgment in other than clerical respects after the expiration of the term of the court in which it was rendered. <em>Lake Garda Co. </em>v. <em>Lake Garda Improvement Assn., </em>156 Conn. 61, 65, 238 A.2d 393; <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Douglas &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>121 Conn. 377, 379, 185 A. 70. However, if proceedings to vacate or modify a judgment are begun during the term at which it was rendered, the court may act upon the matter at a subsequent term. <em>D. V. Frione &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Harbor Construction Corporation, </em>168 Conn. 386, 387, 362 A.2d 859; <em>Pizzola </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>167 Conn. 202, 209, 355 A.2d 21; <em>Poneleit </em>v. <em>Dudas, </em>141 Conn. 413, 416, 106 A.2d 479. Under such circumstances, the court retains jurisdiction over the case. <em>Pizzola </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra. The word \u201cterm\u201d as used in the common-law rule that a judgment may not be opened after the term at which it was rendered has been interpreted to mean \u201csessions\u201d of court as defined in \u00a7 51-181<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>of the General Statutes and not the statutory annual term provided for in \u00a7 51-179<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the General Statute v. <em>Cichy </em>v. <em>Kostyk, </em>143 Conn. 688, 695-96, 125 A.2d 483; <em>D. V. Frione &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Harbor Construction Corporation, </em>supra. See <em>Hudson Glen Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>171 Conn. 307, 308-309, 370 A.2d 935; <em>Fidelity Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>164 Conn. 126, 134, 318 A.2d 109; 2 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 207. Since the April 20 motion of the plaintiffs was not filed within the same court session in which judgment was rendered, therefore, it did not, by itself, operate to preserve the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction and thus allow the court to restore the case to the docket in a subsequent court session.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first \u201cMotion to Open Dismissal\u201d filed on March 29, 1976, however, <em>was </em>filed before the expiration of the session of the Superior Court in which the judgment of dismissal was rendered.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In its memorandum of decision, the trial court simply states that this motion \u201cwas never pursued or heard by the court.\u201d While we may consult the memorandum of decision to determine the basis of the trial court\u2019s action, it establishes no facts and cannot take the place of a finding. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Commissioner, </em>167 Conn. 377, 378, 355 A.2d 256. The record presented contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>no evidence that this motion was either abandoned, withdrawn or stricken. The short calendar schedule for April 9, 1976, mentioned in the dissenting opinion, does not appear in the file before this court. However, upon inquiry of the clerk of the Superior Court in Tolland County, a copy of that short calendar was sent for our examination. No specific notation by the court appears on this schedule to indicate that any affirmative action was taken on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, and thus, there is no evidence to support the dissent\u2019s conclusion that \u201cno one appeared in support of it and it was stricken.\u201d We do not read Practice Book \u00a7 218 as allowing for a party\u2019s pleadings to be permanently stricken from the case in the absence of any indication by the court that this was its express intention. Thus, since the plaintiffs\u2019 March 29 motion constituted a \u201cstart of the proceedings\u201d before the expiration of the court session in which judgment was rendered, the trial court was not without jurisdiction to restore the case to the docket. <em>D. V. Frione &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Harbor Construction Corporation, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">At oral argument, the defendants urged this court to apply the doctrines of waiver or abandonment to the plaintiffs\u2019 apparent inaction regarding their first motion. It is significant to note that when such a claim is made, the individual conduct of each party becomes a relevant factor for our consideration. See <em>Novella </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>163 Conn. 552, 316 A.2d 394. In the present case, during the twenty-one months which elapsed from the filing of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint until the judgment of dismissal was rendered, the defendants did not file any pleading to the complaint. We cannot predicate a waiver in favor of \u201cone whose own omission or inadvertence has contributed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>problem at hand.\u201d Id., 565. The defendants certainly have not demonstrated the same degree of dne diligence in proceeding with this litigation which they are now demanding of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Although we hold that, on the face of the record, the trial court had jurisdiction to restore the present case to the docket, on remand, the ultimate determination regarding that motion rests within the sound discretion of the court. <em>A. Sangivanni &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>F. M. Floryan &amp; Co., </em>158 Conn. 467, 477, 262 A.2d 159. As we stated in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corporation, </em>supra, 202, however, \u201cpresumably a court will not deny a motion to restore unless the case has been on the docket for an unduly protracted period or the court is satisfied from the record or otherwise that there is no real intent to prosecute.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is not unreasonable to believe that, in view of the state of the pleadings which had been filed, this case could neither have been placed on the trial list nor actually tried at an earlier date. Practice Book \u00a7 192. It is the policy of the law to bring about a trial on the merits of a dispute whenever possible and to secure for the litigant his day in court. The design of the rules of practice is both to facilitate business and to advance justice; \u201cthey will be interpreted liberally in any case where it shall be manifest that a strict adherence to them will work surprise or injustice.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 547, 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In this opinion Bogdanski, Longo and Speziale, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-12\"> Frederick Snow commenced the action on his own behalf and on behalf of his son, Vincent. Although the words \u201cplaintiff\u201d and \u201cplaintiffs\u201d are used interchangeably throughout the record (without any objection being raised), the apparent ambiguity in no way affects the merits of this appeal. Since the defendants themselves refer to the \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 motion,\u201d and the appeal and assignment of errors were filed by the \u201cplaintiffs,\u201d we do not make any distinction as to a particular plaintiff. No identification was made where the word \u201cplaintiff\u201d was used in the singular; therefore, \u201cplaintiffs\u201d will be used for the purpose of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\"> \u201c[Practice Book] Sec. 191A. dismissal fob lack of diligence.

The state of the pleadings, therefore, indicates that the plaintiffs had continued to pursue their claim for some time after the complaint was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b601-7\">House, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAh\">(dissenting.) I do not agree with the majority opinion in this case. The judgment dismissing the action brought by the two plaintiffs, Vincent Snow, P.P.A., and Frederick Snow, was entered February 23, 1976. No appeal was taken from that judgment until April 13, 1977, when both plaintiffs appealed from that judgment. The record discloses that on March 29,1976, a \u201cMotion to Open Dismissal\u201d was filed by \u201cthe plaintiff\u201d without identifying which plaintiff. Although the majority opinion correctly states that \u201c[tjhe record presented contains no evidence that this motion was either abandoned, withdrawn or stricken,\u201d what happened is no mystery. Section 218 of the Practice Book expressly provides that matters on the short calendar (which includes such matters as the motion of \u201cthe plaintiff\u201d) \u201cshall not be continued except for good cause shown; and no matter in which adverse parties are interested shall be continued unless the parties shall agree thereto before the day of the short calendar session and notify the clerk, who shall make note thereof on the list of the presiding judge.\u201d Not only is there no indication that the short calendar motion was continued but the court\u2019s memorandum of decision notes that the motion \u201cwas never pursued\u201d and the file in the case indicates exactly what happened. \u201cThere is no question . . . concerning our power to take judicial notice of files of the Superior Court, whether the file is from the case at bar or otherwise. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lenihan, </em>151 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Conn. 552, 554, 200 A.2d 476; <em>Politzer </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, Inc., </em>133 Conn. 605, 606, 53 A.2d 201; <em>Preferred Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Musante, Berman &amp; Steinberg Co., </em>133 Conn. 536, 540, 52 A.2d 862; <em>McCleave </em>v. <em>John J. Flanagan Co., </em>115 Conn. 36, 39, 160 A. 305; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 312, 313.\u201d <em>Karp </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>162 Conn. 525, 527, 294 A.2d 633. The file discloses that the motion was on the court\u2019s short calendar for April 9, 1976, no one appeared in support of it and it was stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Thereafter, on April 20, 1976, after the session of court at which the judgment of dismissal had been rendered, a new \u201cMotion to Open Dismissal\u201d was filed by \u201cthe plaintiff,\u201d again not otherwise identified. It was heard by the court, treated as a motion to restore the case to the doeket and denied by the court on January 31, 1977. The court, thereafter, granted to \u201cthe plaintiff\u201d two extensions of time \u201cin which to file an appeal from the Court\u2019s decision denying the reopening of this matter,\u201d and, on April 13, 1977, both plaintiffs, Vincent Snow and Frederick Snow, filed the present appeal, not from the denial of the \u201creopening of this matter\u201d but \u201cfrom the Superior Court\u2019s decision striking the case,\u201d which was the judgment which had been rendered February 23, 1976. Notwithstanding the fact that the appeal was taken \u201cfrom the Superior Court\u2019s decision striking the ease,\u201d the sole assignment of error filed by \u201cthe plaintiffs\u201d was \u201cthe Court\u2019s refusal to open the dismissal and restore the case to the docket on the ground that the Court lacked jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The majority opinion properly notes that \u201c[i]n the absence of waiver or consent of the parties, a court is without jurisdiction to modify or correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>a judgment in other than clerical respects after the expiration of the term of the court in which it was rendered,\u201d citing <em>Lake Garda Co. </em>v. <em>Lake Garda Improvement Assn., </em>156 Conn. 61, 65, 238 A.2d 393, and <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Douglas &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>121 Conn. 377, 379, 185 A. 70. To these authorities the cases of <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>169 Conn. 154, 160, 362 A.2d 831, and <em>Fidelity Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>164 Conn. 126, 134, 318 A.2d 109, may be added. The majority opinion also properly notes that since the motion which the court decided \u2014 the motion to open dismissal filed April 20, 1976, \u2014 was not filed within the same court session in which the judgment dismissing the action was rendered, it did not \u201cby itself, operate to preserve the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction and thus allow the court to restore the case to the docket in a subsequent court session.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">I fully agree with the majority opinion\u2019s enunciation of these two well established legal principles. I cannot, however, agree with its conclusion that because an unidentified one of the two plaintiffs during the session at which the judgment dismissing the action was rendered did file a \u201cMotion to Open Dismissal\u201d the filing of that motion preserved indefinitely the court\u2019s jurisdiction of the action and over the parties even after that motion, not having been pressed, was stricken. I know of no authority which supports such an anomaly.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The brief in support of the present appeal has been submitted not by the plaintiffs-appellants but by \u201cthe plaintiff-appellant,\u201d the identity of which plaintiff remaining undisclosed. Since it does not brief or contain any argument concerning the judgment from which the two plaintiffs appealed \u2014 \u201cthe Superior Court\u2019s decision striking the case\u201d \u2014 I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>would treat any suggestion of error with respect to the judgment appealed from as abandoned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>172 Conn. 65, 66, 372 A.2d 154; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>171 Conn. 264, 265, 368 A.2d 222. If, nevertheless, the court were to consider the merits of the appeal as briefed by the unidentified individual plaintiff, I would find no error in the judgment of the trial court and its conclusion that, under the circumstances, it was without jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the April, 1976, \u201cMotion to Open Dismissal\u201d which was not filed during the same court session in which the judgment dismissing the action was rendered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
