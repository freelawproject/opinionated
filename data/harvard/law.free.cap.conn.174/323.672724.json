Smith and Sara F. Smith. The variance was requested in anticipation of the state\u2019s taking of .03 of an acre of the plaintiffs\u2019 land in connection with the relocation of U.S. route 7. The partial taking of a narrow strip running along the frontage on Perry Avenue reduced the one-acre lot to .97 of an acre, rendering the plaintiffs\u2019 property a non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>conforming nse under a Norwalk zoning ordinance requiring one acre of land for a single-family house in an \u201cAAA\u201d residence zone. The variance application was made without the knowledge or approval of the plaintiffs. After a public hearing which the plaintiffs attended, the board granted the application in a resolution stating that \u201cthe small difference of .03 of an acre should not be a substantial detriment to the zoning regulations or to the other houses in the area.\u201d The plaintiffs strenuously objected to the granting of the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The state, upon certification, has appealed to this court from a judgment rendered by the Court of Common Pleas sustaining the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the action of the zoning board of appeals. The trial court decided the appeal on the record returned by the board. No finding was requested and none was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Where a zoning authority has stated reasons for its action, the questions for the court to determine on appeal are whether the reasons assigned are reasonably supported by the evidence in the record and whether they are pertinent to the considerations which the authority was required to apply under the governing statutes and zoning regulations. <em>DeMaria </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>159 Conn. 534, 540, 271 A.2d 105; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 484, 489, 227 A.2d 91. In reviewing the court\u2019s decision absent a finding, we may consult the memorandum of decision to ascertain the conclusions upon which the court based its judgment. <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 23, 26, 376 A.2d 385; <em>A.P. &amp; W. Holding Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>167 Conn. 182, 187, 355 A.2d 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 8-6<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> authorizes a zoning hoard of appeals to grant a variance where two basic requirements are satisfied: (1) the variance must be shown not to affect substantially the comprehensive zoning plan, and (2) adherence to the strict letter of the zoning ordinance must be shown to cause unusual hardship unnecessary to the carrying out of the general purpose of the zoning plan. <em>Fiorilla </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>144 Conn. 275, 280, 129 A.2d 619; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>140 Conn. 290, 295, 99 A.2d 149. Section 118-32 of the Norwalk zoning ordinance adopts these statutory requirements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In its resolution granting the variance the board stated in effect that the first of these requirements had been satisfied. The board\u2019s conclusion was reasonably supported by evidence in the record that the plaintiffs\u2019 one-acre house lot would be diminished only by a narrow strip of frontage amounting to .03 of an acre. See <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>140 Conn. 433, 441, 101 A.2d 284. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>could not reasonably have rejected the board\u2019s conclusion, nor did it do so. Rather, the memorandum of decision indicates that the basis of the court\u2019s judgment in favor of the plaintiffs was its conclusion that the second requirement, hardship to the property owner, had not been met. The court reasoned that General Statutes \u00a7 48-24 must be read together with General Statutes \u00a7 8-6 to require that the state allege and prove hardship to the owner in order to obtain a variance under \u00a7 48-24. Since the record returned by the board revealed no showing of hardship to the plaintiffs, the court found the board\u2019s action to be illegal, arbitrary, and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We agree with the reasoning of the court that in enacting \u00a7 48-24 when \u00a7 8-6 was in existence, the legislature must be presumed to have acted with existing relevant statutes in mind and with the intention of creating a consistent body of law. <em>Cicala </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>161 Conn. 362, 365, 288 A.2d 66; <em>Knights of Columbus Council No. 3884 </em>v. <em>Mulcahy, </em>154 Conn. 583, 589, 227 A.2d 413. We cannot agree, however, with the court\u2019s conclusion that the proper way to reconcile the two statutes is to require that the state show hardship to property owners in every application for an area variance under \u00a7 48-24. The meaning of \u201cexceptional difficulty or unusual hardship\u201d as used in General Statutes \u00a7 8-6 has been extensively litigated. It is well settled that the hardship must be different in kind from that generally affecting properties in the same zoning district, and must arise from circumstances or conditions beyond the control of the property owner. <em>Garibaldi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>163 Conn. 235, 238-39, 303 A.2d 743; <em>Highland Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 40, 43, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>229 A.2d 356; <em>Booe v. Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>151 Conn. 681, 683, 202 A.2d 245; <em>McMahon v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>140 Conn. 433, 442, 101 A.2d 284. Surely there is a clear case of uncommon hardship beyond the control of a property owner when the state seeks to condemn a portion of his or her land and thereby render it nonconforming to a minimum lot area restriction. See 2 Rathkopf, Zoning and Planning (3d Ed.), p. 51-11. We conclude that exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship was implicit in the proposed taking which rendered the plaintiffs\u2019 property nonconforming and that no requirement of further proof of hardship devolved upon the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Our decision does not mean that whenever a condemning authority proceeds under \u00a7 48-24 it is automatically entitled to a variance. As the state properly points out in its brief, zoning boards of appeals remain responsible for determining whether a proposed variance is in harmony with the general purpose of the zoning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The remaining issue in this appeal is the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the granting of a variance without their consent violates their constitutional right to just compensation by forcing them to assume the financial risk of structural alteration or sale of property subject to a variance. We disagree. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims for consequential damages to the remaining land resulting from the partial taking could be considered by a trier of fact under General Statutes \u00a7 13a-76. Damages would be calculated by subtracting the market value of the remainder after the taking from the market value of the property just prior to the taking. <em>Laurel, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>169 Conn. 195, 205, 362 A.2d 1383; <em>Meriden </em>v. <em>Highway Commissioner, </em>169 Conn. 655, 660, 363 A.2d 1094. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>The state referee could properly consider the variance as a factor affecting the market value of the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining land. <em>Talarico </em>v. <em>Conkling, </em>168 Conn. 194, 197, 362 A.2d 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 48-24. condemning authority to OBTAIN' ZONING VARIANCE FOR PORTION OF PROPERTY NOT TAKEN OR take entire unit.
