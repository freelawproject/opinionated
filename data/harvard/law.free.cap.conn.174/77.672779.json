The plaintiff sought a deficiency judgment and made a timely motion, pursuant to \u00a7 49-14, for the appointment of three disinterested appraisers. The appraisers were duly appointed and filed their report within the ten-day time limit. The plaintiff moved for acceptance of the appraisers\u2019 report. The defendant Richard R. Splain filed an objection entitled a \u201cremonstrance\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to the acceptance of the report, and, after a full hearing, the court sustained the objection and denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to accept the appraisal report.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The remonstrance represented that one of the appraisers, Joseph A. Bishop, \u201cdid not personally do a formal evaluation, hut relied upon the advice and opinion of other persons not appointed by the court in arriving at a value.\u201d The court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Bishop had consulted with and was influenced by an outside appraiser, and on this basis concluded that Bishop failed to exercise his own independent judgment in arriving at conclusions of value; it also concluded that the outside consultation constituted a divergence from strict compliance with \u00a7 49-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The plaintiff claims on appeal that the conclusions of the court are not supported by the facts found and that the actions of appraiser Bishop were proper under General Statutes \u00a7 49-14. We agree. The remonstrance should have been overruled and the appraisal report accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">As required by the statute, the court appointed \u201cthree disinterested appraisers,\u201d Louis E. Durocher, George J. Houser, and Joseph A. Bishop. Of the three, two, Bishop and Houser, were nominated by the defendants. In the course of reaching a determination as to the value of the property, Bishop consulted Philip W. Ball, a professional appraiser, and agreed to pay him a fee. Ball indicated to Bishop that he would estimate the value of the property as $450,000. The court found that \u201cBishop did not accept Mr. Ball\u2019s opinion of value in this matter\u201d; also in its finding, however, the court quoted a statement by Bishop that part of the basis for his appraisal was made \u201cpurely on the recommendation of Mr. Ball, that he thought it was worth $450,000 . . . .\u201d The plaintiff represents that this latter finding is of doubtful meaning because the court has quoted only part of Bishop\u2019s statement, thereby creating the impression that his appraisal was based solely on Ball\u2019s recommendation. Bishop\u2019s statement, read in full, indicates that the basis for his appraisal was not only Ball\u2019s recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tion, but also a reading of the reports of the other appraisers, and his own experience and knowledge in real estate investment. Upon an examination of the evidence presented, this court may correct any finding to which error has been assigned if the facts have been found in language of doubtful meaning. Practice Book \u00a7 627. Such a correction is appropriate in a case such as this, where the language of the finding is such that its real significance does not clearly appear. Practice Book \u00a7 628 (b); cf. <em>Southern New England Contracting Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>165 Conn. 644, 653 n.2, 345 A.2d 550 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Section 49-14 of the General Statutes does not prescribe a particular appraisal procedure. It simply sets forth that \u201cthe court shall appoint three disinterested appraisers, who shall, under oath, . . . appraise the mortgaged property and shall make written report of their appraisal to the clerk of the court.\u201d Although the three court-appointed appraisers were acting in a quasi-judicial capacity as public agents doing a public duty; <em>Congress Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Brockett, </em>111 Conn. 490, 492, 150 A. 742 (1930); see <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Morris Park, Inc., </em>153 Conn. 290, 292, 216 A.2d 187 (1965), appeal dismissed, 385 U.S. 2, 87 S. Ct. 33, 17 L. Ed. 2d 2;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court did not instruct them to follow any special appraisal procedures, nor did it caution them that outside consultation was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Under the statute, the appraisers \u201care appointed that they may, in the light of such personal knowledge <em>as they have or may acquire, </em>bring to bear upon the matter of value their own judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>122 Conn. 451, 458, 190 A. 616 (1937). It is obvious that the words \u201cmay acquire\u201d negate any possible interpretation that the appraisers must act in a vacuum, completely isolated from any outside influences. A reasonable, logical, and natural method for an appraiser to \u201cacquire\u201d personal knowledge is from outside sources, such as texts, public records, and consultations with realtors or professional appraisers. This is the kind of personal knowledge that appraisers, whether they be appointed under \u00a7 49-14 or not, may draw upon to \u201cdetermine the value of property upon their own experience and judgment.\u201d <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Morris Park, Inc., </em>supra, 293.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In fact, the court found that it is common practice for real estate appraisers to consult with other appraisers in arriving at an opinion of value. As noted, personal knowledge may be acquired in a variety of ways, and, among appraisers, outside consultation is considered a helpful source of information. In the absence of controlling language in the statute, or special instructions from the court, the practice and custom of consulting with another appraiser is a legitimate means of acquiring the personal knowledge upon which to base an independent judgment of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Bishop personally inspected the property and arrived at his appraisal figure by employing an income approach. There has been no claim raised that Bishop failed to meet with the other appraisers to discuss the valuation opinion, or that any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>appraisers was denied the opportunity to participate fully at the valuation meeting. See <em>Congress Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Brockett, </em>supra, 492-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The facts show that Bishop inspected the property, reached a conclusion as to value, and was one of two appraisers to agree on a figure of $470,000. When an objection to an appraisal is filed, the inquiry of the court is limited to claimed errors of law. <em>Connecticut Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Hanoman Realty Corporation, </em>168 Conn. 554, 558, 362 A.2d 827 (1975); <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>supra, 456. The facts as found do not support the conclusions of the court that Bishop failed to exercise his own independent judgment in arriving at conclusions of value for the court, that the appraisal report was not the joint act of all three appraisers bringing to bear upon the problem the individual knowledge and judgment of each appraiser, or that the actions of appraiser Bishop in consulting with a fourth appraiser constituted a divergence from strict compliance with \u00a7 49-14 of the General Statutes. Because there was no error of law in the appraisal report, it should have been accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Only brief comment need be made on the defendant Splain\u2019s tardy constitutional attack on the statute. The constitutionality of General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 was first challenged by that defendant in the appeal to this court. The issue was initially raised by the trial court in its memorandum of decision. Having sustained the objection to the appraisers\u2019 report on other grounds, the court ventured the opinion that the statute was constitutionally defective. Generally, issues not raised in the trial court will not be considered on appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 652; <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, </em>168 Conn. 160, 176, 363 A.2d 22 (1975); <em>Pizzola </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>Zoning Commission, </em>167 Conn. 202, 209, 355 A.2d 21 (1974). This rule is applicable even when the constitutionality of a statute is being challenged. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Timenterial, Inc., </em>168 Conn. 41, 43, 357 A.2d 507 (1975); <em>Pizzola </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">There is nothing in the circumstances of this case which would justify an exception to the rule. \u201cOnly in most exceptional circumstances can and will this court consider a claim, constitutional or otherwise, that has not been raised and decided in the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). Since no new, unforeseeable, constitutional right has arisen since the trial, and \u2022the record does not indicate a clear deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial, this claim need not be considered. Id., 69-70. Moreover, the fact that the defendant Splain has introduced the issue as an afterthought in a terse statement in his brief<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is in itself sufficient reason for deferring any consideration of the constitutionality of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to accept the appraisers\u2019 report and grant the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">In this opinion House, C. J., Loiseule and Longo, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-12\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 49-14. appraisal of mortgaged property AFTER FORECLOSURE. DEFICIENCY JUDGMENT. Upon the motion of any party to a foreclosure, the eourt shall appoint three disinterested appraisers, who shall, under oath, within ten days after the time limited for redemption has expired, appraise the mortgaged property and shall make written report of their appraisal to the clerk of the court where such foreclosure was had.

The dissent adopts the trial court\u2019s reasoning. A perusal of <em>Buck </em>and the cases cited therein clearly shows that this reliance is misplaced. <em>Buck </em>merely states that appraisers, unlike committees or referees, do not hold evidentiary hearings to determine the value of property; rather, they rely on \u201ctheir own experience and judgment\u201d and set a value on property at their estimate of what it is worth. <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Morris Park, Inc., </em>153 Conn. 290, 292-93, 216 A.2d 187 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\"> See footnote 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\"> The full text of the defendant Splain\u2019s argument on this issue is set forth here: \u201cThe Statute In Question Is Unconstitutional, As The Taking Of The Defendant\u2019s Property Is At Issue And He Has ,No Opportunity To Submit Evidence Or To Otherwise Be Heard As To Value Prior To Potential Assessing Of A Deficiency Judgment. Contrary to any statements or holdings in <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>it is suggested that the more recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States are controlling as noted in the court\u2019s Memorandum of Decision below. The present case should be decided on this issue alone in fairness to all litigants of this State.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Bogdanski, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsL\">(dissenting). The trial court properly applied the law to the facts when it concluded (1) that \u201c[ajppraiser Bishop was influenced in his decision by Mr. Ball\u201d; (2) that \u201cappraiser Bishop failed to use his own experience\u201d and \u201chis own judgment in determining the value of the subject property\u201d; and (3) that \u201cMr. Bishop delegated a part of his authority as court-appointed appraiser to Mr. Ball and agreed to pay Mr. Ball a fee for doing so.\u201d Those conclusions are fully supported by the finding<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the appendices<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Section 49-14 requires that appraisers appointed by the court for the purpose of a deficiency judgment shall make a written report of their appraisal to the court and that \u201csuch appraisal shall be final and conclusive as to the value of such mortgaged property.\u201d The statute makes no provision for the mortgagor against whom a deficiency judgment is sought to receive notice of or an opportunity to be heard at the meeting of the appraisers. It is at that meeting that the appraisal is determined, and thereafter it is reported to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Our law requires that such appraisers, appointed pursuant to the provisions of \u00a749-14, \u201cdetermine the value of property upon their own experience and judgment.\u201d <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Morris Park, Inc., </em>153 Conn. 290, 293, 216 A.2d 187, appeal dismissed, 385 U.S. 2, 87 S. Ct. 33, 17 L. Ed. 2d 2; <em>Connecticut Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Hanoman Realty Corporation, </em>168 Conn. 554, 558, 362 A.2d 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In the <em>Buck </em>case, decided in 1965, this court was confronted with the claim that the procedure set forth in \u00a7 49-14 was unconstitutional in that it made no provision for notice of the meeting of the appraisers to be given the mortgagor so that he might introduce evidence and be heard on the question of value, thus depriving the mortgagor of his property without due process of law in violation of the federal and state constitutions. In rejecting that constitutional claim, the court placed much emphasis on the fact that the appraisers <em>must </em>determine the value of the property on their own experience and judgment and, \u201c[c] onsequently, they are not required to hear evidence or to give notice of the meeting at which they make the appraisal.\u201d <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Morris Park, Inc., </em>supra, 293; <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>German Ins. Co., </em>120 Iowa 272, 278, 94 N.W. 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>After a hearing on the remonstrance filed by the mortgagor to the appraisers\u2019 report, the trial court ruled that appraiser Bishop did not \u201cdetermine the value of the property upon his own experience and judgment\u201d and sustained the remonstrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">My colleagues, however, have concluded that Bishop did ultimately give his opinion as to value and that whether that opinion was influenced by a third party not appointed as an appraiser by the court is of no consequence since such outside influence on an appraiser\u2019s opinion is common in the appraisal field.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The flaw in that reasoning is that court-appointed appraisers under \u00a749-14 cannot be equated with ordinary real estate appraisers. Appraisers appointed pursuant to \u00a7 49-14 partake of a special quasi-judicial nature. <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Morris Park, Inc., </em>supra, 292. They are appointed to make an appraisal that is binding and conclusive on the court and on the parties. They do not take the witness stand, do not give testimony and are not subject to cross-examination. They are, in fact, appointed officers who, in an ex parte proceeding attended only by themselves, determine value from which no right of appeal lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The traditional real estate appraiser, on the other hand, is generally a witness in a court proceeding whose testimony is subject to cross-examination and whose opinion may be rejected in whole or in part by the court. Moreover, it is the court which makes the ultimate determination of value from which judgment a right of appeal lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">In essence, appraisers under \u00a7 49-14 can be equated to a jury of three which, after deliberating, return a verdict to the court as to value. Like any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>other such deliberative body, the opinions of the individual members are subject to being influenced by the opinions of their fellow jurors but cannot be so influenced by anyone not a member of the deliberative body, nor by any other outside influence. Unlike the verdict of a jury, however, the appraisal is not subject to any review by the trial court, nor to an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">There is then no basis for equating the two types of appraisers. While it is true that the ordinary real estate appraiser can express an opinion as to value regardless of its source, that opinion is not binding on the court and is subject to the safeguards of a judicial hearing. The determination of value by appraisers under \u00a7 49-14, however, amounts to a conclusive judgment which is subject to none of the safeguards of a judicial hearing. The latter procedure is permitted only because our law requires that such appraisers determine the value of property upon their own experience and upon their own independent judgment. Otherwise, the procedure under \u00a7 49-14 would be in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States. See <em>Roundhouse Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>Telesco Masons Supplies Co., </em>168 Conn. 371, 362 A.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">I would, therefore, find no error and would uphold the action of the trial court in sustaining the remonstrance to the report of the appraisers.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-5\"> \u201cMr. Bishop felt the need of help from Mr. Ball and agreed to pay him a fee. Mr. Ball recommended to appraiser Bishop that the subject premises were worth $450,000. It is admitted by Mr. Bishop that the advice of Mr. Ball influenced the ultimate decision rendered by Mr. Bishop. It is stated by Mr. Bishop that part of the basis for his appraisal was made \u2018purely on the recommendation of Mr. Ball, that he thought it was worth $450,000.\u2019\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-6\"> \u201cJoseph A.

And I had just started in a new association with Philip Ball who is a professional appraiser. And I made an arrangement with him prior to this on another occasion where we appraised a building. And I felt that T needed his advice.\u2019 When asked whether he agreed to pay Mr. Ball a fee for his advice, Mr. Bishop responded: \u2018Correct.\u2019 When asked who did this appraisal work, Mr. Bishop responded: \u2018I went there to the building twice with Mr. Ball.\u2019 When asked what function Mr. Ball served in assisting him, Mr. Bishop responded: \u2018I took Mr. Ball out there and we viewed the premises together. Subsequent to that, I talked with him on four or five occasions. And his recommendation to me was that he didn\u2019t think the building was worth much more than $450,000. Now, he is a professional appraiser and that is the advice 1 got from him.\u2019 When asked if he was an appraiser of real estate, Mr. Bishop responded: \u2018I do appraisal work, yes.
