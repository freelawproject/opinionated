They claimed that the testatrix \u201clacked sufficient testamentary capacity to make and execute a [w]ill\u201d and that the will was the product of undue influence exerted upon the testatrix by the defendant, Frank Bielski. The trial court found the will to be invalid and, from the judgment rendered, the defendant, proponent of the will, appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">In its finding, the trial court concluded that \u201c[t]he testatrix did not possess the requisite testamentary capacity to execute . . . [the] will\u201d and that \u201c[t]he proponent of the will failed to sustain his burden of proof.\u201d In his assignments of error, the defendant attacked the court\u2019s finding but failed to brief those assignments of error. Assignments of error not briefed are considered abandoned. <em>Pappas </em>v. <em>Pappas, </em>164 Conn. 242, 243, 320 A.2d 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201c \u2018Due execution and testamentary capacity are statutory issues (General Statutes \u00a7\u00a745-160, 45-161),[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] and the burden of proof as to each is upon the proponent. This remains so even though the contestant, as was the case here, affirmatively pleads lack of due execution and lack of testamentary capacity.\u2019 <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>Wheat, </em>156 Conn. 575, 578, 244 A.2d 359; <em>Berkeley </em>v. <em>Berkeley, </em>152 Conn. 398, 401, 207 A.2d 579. In any appeal from probate, the Superior Court is exercising a limited statutory jurisdiction and has no greater powers than those of the Probate Court. <em>Heiser </em>v. <em>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., </em>150 Conn. 563, 565, 192 A.2d 44; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>120 Conn. 405, 409, 182 A. 138. \u2018Since there is a trial de novo on the appeal to the Superior Court, the proponent of a will has the burden of proof on the statutory issues of due execution and testamentary capacity exactly as he had in the Probate Court. <em>Boschen </em>v. <em>Second National Bank, </em>130 Conn. 501, 504, 35 A.2d 849; <em>Livingston\u2019s Appeal, </em>63 Conn. 68, 74, 26 A. 470. This is so whether in the appeal from probate the proponent is the appellee or the appellant. <em>Livingston\u2019s Appeal, </em>supra, 75.\u2019 <em>Berkeley </em>v. <em>Berkeley, </em>supra, 401.\u201d <em>D\u2019Agostino </em>v. <em>Amarante, </em>172 Conn. 529, 530-31, 375 A.2d 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The record clearly reveals that the defendant, proponent of the will, failed to sustain his burden of proof as to the statutory issues of execution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>testamentary capacity. Since the resolution of those issues is dispositive of the appeal, we need not consider the issue of undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 45-160. who may make a will Any person of the age of eighteen years, and of sound mind, may dispose of his estate by will <em>. . . .\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u201c[General Statutes] See. 45-161. making and execution op wills.
