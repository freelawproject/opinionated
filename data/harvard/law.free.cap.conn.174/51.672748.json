Although the cases were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>brought separately by different parties, they have reached our docket simultaneously, were argued at the same session and involve related issues. We have, therefore, decided to consider them in a single opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Both of the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Common Pleas after hearings, pursuant to \u00a7 12-421 of the General Statutes, at which the defendant state tax commissioner denied each of their requests for refunds of sales taxes paid under protest. The cases were not tried in the Court of Common Pleas because there were no disputed issues of fact. The parties in each case stipulated as to the facts and the questions which they wished to have reserved for the advice of this court. The questions asked in the <em>Waterbury Motor Lease, Inc., </em>case are printed in footnote <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. Those asked in the <em>Engi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>neered Sinterings and Plastics Company, Inc., </em>case are printed in footnote <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. Basically, the plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of certain provisions of 1975 Public Acts, No. 75-213, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Increased State Seventies\u201d (hereinafter referred to as the act) which extensively revised the Sales and Use Tax Act, chapter 219 of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> More particularly, they argue that while the act created a new classification (i.e., lessees) of persons subject to the sales and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>use tax which may have a \u201crational basis,\u201d such a classification is unconstitutional because it treats some lessees \u201cdifferently.\u201d The classification which they attack was created by the expansion of the \u201csale,\u201d \u201cselling,\u201d \u201cpurchase,\u201d \u201cpurchasing,\u201d and \u201cgross receipts\u201d definitions to include the rental or leasing of tangible personal property. The plaintiffs claim that by virtue of the expansion, the imposition sections, \u00a7 12-408 for the sales tax and \u00a7 12-411 for the use tax, thereafter subjected them to double taxation. The act imposed a 7 percent sales tax on the total amount of payment or periodic payments received after July 1, 1975, for leasing or rental in Connecticut of tangible personal property. The act also provided that (1) any equipment brought into Connecticut and leased to a Connecticut lessee for use in Connecticut after July 1,1975, was exempt from a use tax, and (2) purchases of tangible personal property after July 1, 1975, made exclusively for leasing or rental are purchases for resale and thus exempt from the sales tax. Thus, after July 1, 1975, the only applicable sales tax on a leasing transaction is that imposed on the rental payments received under the lease or rental agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The parties stipulated and agreed to the following facts: The plaintiff Waterbury Motor Lease, Inc. (hereinafter referred to \"as Motor Lease) is a Connecticut corporation engaged in the business of buying motor vehicles from Connecticut sellers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>and leasing them to Connecticut lessees for extended periods (usually two years) pursuant to lease agreements. For several years prior to July 1,1975 (the effective date of the challenged revisions), Motor Lease had purchased a substantial number of vehicles, paid the required sales tax to the seller, and recouped the cost of the sales tax by incorporating it in the formula used to compute the total rent provided for in the lease agreements to lessees. On January 2, 1974, Motor Lease purchased a 1974 Oldsmobile at the sale price of $5869.97, with a sales tax of $247. A lease was entered into with the lessee, Engineered Sinterings and Plastics Company, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as E.S.P.), a Connecticut corporation engaged in the production and sale of items made of either plastic or sintered metals. E.S.P. executed a twenty-four month lease at the monthly rent of $290. The rent included reimbursement for the sales tax payment originally paid by Motor Lease as part of its cost for the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In October, 1975, Motor Lease remitted to the defendant tax commissioner a check for $1102.51, representing a 7 percent sales tax on all rental payments received by it for the quarter ending on September 1, 1975. The payment was made under protest and accompanied by a letter stating that the payment would be the basis for a refund claim. The remittance included $116.28 which was the 7 percent tax which Motor Lease had collected from E.S.P. The defendant tax commissioner subsequently denied both E.S.P.\u2019s and Motor Lease\u2019s requests for refunds of the 7 percent sales tax paid on the rental payments. Motor Lease subsequently appealed the defendant\u2019s decision to the Court of Common Pleas which in turn reserved the stipulated questions to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>E.S.P. further complains in its separate action that in 1974 it executed two five-year lease agreements for presses with C.I.T. Leasing Corporation (hereinafter referred to as C.I.T.) of New York City. The computed cost of one of the leases was $79,325, to which was added a sales or use tax of $5156.13. Rental payments on the total $84,481.13 were computed to be $1840 per month. E.S.P. was billed by C.I.T. for a sales tax on the rental payments on the two presses for the quarter ending September 30, 1975. E.S.P. paid to C.I.T. a total of $640.59, representing the sales taxes on the rental payments. C.I.T. in turn paid a like amount to the defendant. In November, 1975, E.S.P. requested a refund of this amount which the defendant denied. Upon appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, the questions previously cited in footnote 2 were reserved to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The questions reserved for advice in the <em>Motor Lease </em>case, briefly stated, are whether the provisions of the act which impose a sales tax on \u201cthe total amount of payment or periodic payments received for leasing or rental of tangible personal property for the term of any such lease or rental occurring\u201d after July 1, 1975, on which property a sales tax had been previously paid as a result of the initial pre-July 1, 1975, motor vehicle purchases, yet do not impose a sales tax on post-July 1, 1975, motor vehicle purchases made exclusively for subsequent leasing, are violative of the equal protection clauses of the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 20, or of section 1 of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States. As we have most recently stated in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>1.73 Conn. 506, 509, 378 A.2d 572, citing <em>Horton </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 639, 376 A.2d 359; and <em>State </em>v. Rao, 171 Conn. 600, 601, 370 A.2d 1310: \u201cThese equal protection provisions have often been held to have a like meaning, imposing similar constitutional limitations.\u201d Before discussing the merits of the claims of Motor Lease, we first note the relevant portions of the act which bear on the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Section 15 of the act amended subsection 2 of \u00a7 12-407 by redefining the words \u201csale\u201d and \u201cselling\u201d to include \u201c(k) the leasing or rental of tangible personal property of any kind whatsoever, including but not limited to motor vehicles, linen or towels, machinery or apparatus, office equipment and data processing equipment.\u201d To the extent that Motor Lease rents motor vehicles to lessees, it performs a \u201cselling\u201d function within the purview of this section. Section 17 of the act amended subsection 7 of \u00a7 12-407 by defining the words \u201cpurchase\u201d and \u201cpurchasing\u201d to include \u201c(f) any leasing or rental of tangible personal property.\u201d Section 19 of the act amended subsection 9 of \u00a7 12-407 by redefining the word \u201cgross receipts\u201d to include \u201cthe total amount of payment or periodic payments received for leasing or rental of tangible personal property for the term of any such lease or rental occurring after the effective date of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">These changes became significant as applied to Motor Lease by operation of the sales tax imposition section, \u00a7 12-408, which was amended by \u00a7 23 of the act to read, in part: \u201cFor the privilege of making any sales as defined in subsection (2) of section 12-407, at retail, in this state for a consideration, a tax is hereby imposed on all retailers at the rate of seven per cent of the gross receipts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>of any retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is clearly apparent that the General Assembly thereby expanded the types of transactions to be subjected to sales taxes so that the leasing or renting of tangible personal property became a taxable event after July 1, 1975, the effective date of the act. It is also provided that reimbursement for the sales tax imposed by this section \u201cshall be collected by the retailer [Motor Lease] from the consumer.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 12-408 (2). Also, \u00a7 16 of the act amended subsection 3 of \u00a7 12-407 to exempt any purchaser (including a lessor) from the imposition of a sales tax on a transaction where the property is purchased for resale or leasing, provided that the purchaser obtains the appropriate certificate to the effect that the property is purchased for resale or lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Shortly after the enactment of 1975 Public Acts, No. 75-213, the defendant promulgated \u00a7 12-426-25 of the regulations of Connecticut State Agencies,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> effective December 8, 1975. 37 Conn. L.J., No. 27, p. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>173 Conn. 506, 509, 378 A.2d 572, we recently reaffirmed our adherence to the principle that \u201c[w]here legislation neither containing a suspect classification nor impinging upon a fundamental right is challenged on equal protection grounds, the burden is on the complaining party to establish that the statutory distinction is without rational basis.\u201d We have held this standard to be \u201ceven more stringent where the challenged legislation pertains to taxation.\u201d Ibid. In challenging the act\u2019s validity, the plaintiff has the burden of overcoming the presumption of the legislation\u2019s constitutionality. <em>Wiegand </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>170 Conn. 567, 579, 368 A.2d 103; citing <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>165 Conn. 190, 195, 332 A.2d 78; <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 486, 313 A.2d 53, appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678. As we noted in <em>Kellems </em>(pp. 487-88), quoting from <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>309 U.S. 83, 88, 60 S. Ct. 406, 84 L. Ed 590, \u201c \u2018in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification. Since the members of a legislature necessarily enjoy a familiarity with local conditions which this Court cannot have, the presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>explicit demonstration that a classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes. The burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Motor Lease does not dispute that the power of taxation resides in the legislature; <em>Lublin </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>168 Conn. 212, 227, 362 A.2d 769; nor that the legislature has the power to choose the subject matter of taxation and fix the method and extent of the tax. Id., 221; <em>International Business Machines Corporation </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 355 A.2d 236. It does argue, however, that despite the legitimacy of the act\u2019s objective \u201cto produce tax revenue,\u201d this is not \u201ca justifiable reason for [the act\u2019s alleged] discriminatory treatment among [the class\u2019] members.\u201d It contends that even though \u201cthere might have been a \u2018rational basis\u2019 for the classification\u201d created, i.e., lessees; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-407 (2), (8), (9), (12) (f); there is no such \u201crational basis for discriminating against a portion of this class, i.e., those whose leases antedated the effective date of the Act.\u201d The fact that periodic payments received after July 1, 1975, for the leasing of tangible personal property (irrespective of the date the lease was executed) are taxed is not disputed. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a712-407 (9), 12-408 (1). Motor Lease claims to be aggrieved, however, because purchasers of equipment exclusively for leasing after July 1, 1975, are exempt from paying a sales tax on the initial purchases; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a712-407 (3), 12-410; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-426-25; whereas purchasers (including Motor Lease) of equipment for leasing prior to July 1, 1975, paid a sales tax on the initial purchase (which they in turn passed on to their lessees). Motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Lease argnes that nothing occurred as of July 1, 1975, \u201cto justify discriminatory treatment as between lessees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">It is not for the court to determine whether the prescribed mode of taxation is wise; <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>141 Conn. 129, 104 A.2d 212; but, rather, whether the classification is reasonable, \u201cresting upon \u2018some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\u2019 <em>F. S. Royster Guano Co. </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>253 U.S. 412, 415, 40 S. Ct. 560, 64 L. Ed. 989.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>supra, 510. Keeping in mind the great flexibility afforded legislatures in selecting the subjects of taxation and applying the standard as stated in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>supra, 511, we must conclude that the classification \u201cis neither capricious nor arbitrary\u201d; <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>164 Conn. 497, 507, 325 A.2d 228. Within the particular class selected for payment of the tax, namely, lessees, the members are treated equally and uniformly. We find no denial of equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We find no ambiguity in the language of the statutes in question nor, despite the contrary claims of Motor Lease, do we find that the imposition of the prescribed taxes results in double taxation which, in any event, is not per se unconstitutional. <em>Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>137 Conn. 267, 272, 76 A.2d 9; <em>State </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>90 Conn. 662, 666, 98 A. 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Motor Lease asserts that the act itself and the statutory construction adopted by the defendant, as reflected by \u00a7 12-426-25 of the regulations promulgated by him, subjected it to double taxation. It argues that it paid a sales tax on its initial January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>2, 1974, purchase of an Oldsmobile which it subsequently leased to E.S.P. for two years and was then forced to pay an additional sales tax on rental payments received from E.S.P. for the quarter ending on September 1, 1975. Other courts have found double taxation to exist \u201conly where there is the imposition of the same tax by the same taxing power upon the same subject matter.\u201d <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Snedeker, </em>361 Pa. 234, 238, 64 A.2d 771, cited approvingly by the Supreme Court of Iowa in <em>Ramco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director, Department of Revenue, </em>248 N.W.2d 122, 124 (Iowa). In any event, where there are two separate taxpayers and two separate transactions, even though a single subject matter is involved, any taint of double taxation is removed. <em>Boise Bowling Center </em>v. <em>State, </em>93 Idaho 367, 370, 461 P.2d 262; <em>Lakewood Lanes, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>61 Wash. 2d 751, 380 P.2d 466; <em>Gandy </em>v. <em>State, </em>57 Wash. 2d 690, 359 P.2d 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Prior to the act, a lessor purchasing tangible personal property was subject to either the sales tax if he purchased the property in Connecticut, or to the use tax if he purchased the property out-of-state to lease in Connecticut. The tax imposed was based on either purchasing (sales tax) or using (use tax). The tax imposed by 1975 Public Acts, No. 75-213, is upon the rental of tangible personal property and is a separate and distinct tax imposed upon different taxpayers, lessees, and the events which give rise to it are distinct in kind and time. The fact that Motor Lease passed on to its lessee, E.S.P., the expense of the tax which it had paid in purchasing the vehicle does not make the tax imposed by the act upon the lessees a double tax. Motor Lease was subjected to only one tax as was E.S.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The answer to questions one and two of footnote one is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The questions reserved for advice in the E.S.P. case are whether the provisions of the act which impose a sales tax on \u201cthe total amount of payment or periodic payments received for leasing or rental of tangible personal property for the term of any such lease or rental occurring\u201d after July 1, 1975; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-407 (9), 12-411 (1); on which a use tax had been previously paid because the equipment was brought into Connecticut and leased for use to a Connecticut lessee prior to July 1, 1975, but does not impose a use tax (\u00a7 12-413 [1]) on equipment brought into Connecticut and leased for use to a Connecticut lessee after July 1, 1975, are violative of the same two constitutional provisions as claimed by Motor Lease \u2014 the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 20, or section 1 of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">It is unnecessary to enumerate specifically the extensive revisions of the use tax imposition section (\u00a7 12-411) affected by \u00a7\u00a7 26 through 32 of the act. It is sufficient to note that E.S.P. claims that these changes along with the additional exemptions created by $ 34 of the act (amending subsection 1 of \u00a7 12-413) have subjected it to double taxation and denied it equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The arguments advanced by E.S.P. parallel those raised by Motor Lease, which we have already discussed, and are not persuasive for the same reasons noted in that case. The sales and use tax statutes although distinct are complementary; <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>134 Conn. 295, 299, 57 A.2d 128; and \u201cdesigned to promote equality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>taxation on personal property whether purchased in state or out of state.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>270 F. Sup. 236, 243 (D. Conn.), aff\u2019d, 398 F.2d 672, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 395 U.S. 169, 89 S. Ct. 1648, 23 L. Ed. 2d 182. Previously, if property was purchased out-of-state to lease in Connecticut, the tax imposed was based on using the property in Connecticut. The tax now imposed by 1975 Public Acts, No. 75-213, is upon the rental of such property. The fact that C.I.T. passed on to their lessee, E.S.P., the expense of the tax they paid in bringing the press into Connecticut for leasing does not make the tax imposed on the rental, a double tax. C.I.T. was subject to one tax as was E.S.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We are similarly unpersuaded by E.S.P.\u2019s vigorous argument that certain members of the lessee classification (those whose leases antedated the effective date of the act) are treated \u201cdifferently.\u201d The argument is identical to that raised by Motor Lease. It is similarly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The answer to questions one and two in footnote two is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">No costs will be taxed in this court in favor of any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-6\"> \u201c1.

The application of common sense; <em>Wiegand </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>170 Conn. 567, 582, 368 A.2d 103; leads us to conclude that lessees are consumers within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b86-6\"> The regulation; 37 Conn.
