The preliminary statement of issues in the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment rendered on the verdict included the court\u2019s rulings on his motions for a bill of particulars, to set aside the verdict, and to dismiss. Those claims have not been briefed and are therefore deemed abandoned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>172 Conn. 298, 300, 374 A.2d 239. The remaining issues concern three evidentiary rulings by the court and its charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">At the defendant\u2019s trial the only agreement the state sought to prove was between the defendant and Young. The state\u2019s case rested primarily on the testimony of Young and Michael McLeese. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>was evidence from which the jury could have found the following facts. On February 11, 1974, the defendant asked Young to burn down O\u2019Connell\u2019s bar in New Haven because the competition was hurting the defendant\u2019s own bar business. Young agreed in return for the defendant\u2019s promise to pay him $500. On the night of February 13, Young enlisted the aid of McLeese. They went to the defendant\u2019s bar and discussed the job with the defendant, who advised them of the best way to start a fire. Young and McLeese left to investigate O\u2019Connell\u2019s bar, placed a mattress against the rear of the structure and doused it with lighter fluid. After going back to the defendant\u2019s bar, they returned that night to O\u2019Connell\u2019s. Young lit a flare. He was immediately confronted by police officers who had staked out the location, acting on information supplied by McLeese. Young subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal charges arising from the incident. At his trial the defendant denied any knowledge of or participation in the conspiracy, and sought to impeach the testimony of Young and McLeese.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The defendant first assigns as error the court\u2019s admission into evidence of a statement now claimed to be excludable as hearsay. While the jury was excused, Young\u2019s father, Harold Young, Sr., testified to a conversation with the defendant. Defense counsel objected. No grounds for the objection were specified, no exception was taken to the court\u2019s overruling of the objection, and no objection or exception was made to the court\u2019s allowance of essentially the same testimony before the jury. We have repeatedly held that rulings on evidence will not be reviewed unless there has been compliance with the procedural requirements for raising error. Prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>tice Book \u00a7 652; <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 67, 327 A.2d 576; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferraro, </em>164 Conn. 103, 106, 318 A.2d 80; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>162 Conn. 514, 517, 294 A.2d 584, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 984, 93 S. Ct. 332, 34 L. Ed. 2d 249. Only in the most exceptional circumstances, which are not present here, will this court consider a claim that has not been raised and decided in the trial court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The defendant next contends that in two respects his attempts to impeach the testimony of his coconspirator Young were so severely curtailed by the court that he was denied his constitutional right of confrontation. The defendant\u2019s first claim arises from his counsel\u2019s efforts to show that Young had made prior inconsistent statements in the presence of Ronald Jones, an investigator for the public defender\u2019s office representing Young, and Louis Buonfiglio, an investigator for the defendant. Defense counsel questioned Jones at length about his conversation with Young, which, according to Jones, took place in the morning. Jones could not recall any other conversation with Young that day. Defense counsel requested permission for Jones to examine his notes on Young\u2019s statements in order to refresh his recollection. The court refused on the ground that Jones\u2019 notes, which Young had signed, were within the attorney-client privilege. Only confidential communications between attorney and client are privileged. <em>Rienzo </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>160 Conn. 391, 395, 279 A.2d 565; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanna, </em>150 Conn. 457, 466, 191 A.2d 124; McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 91. Young could not reasonably have expected that his statements to Jones in Buonfiglio\u2019s presence would be kept confidential, since he must have known that Buonfiglio intended to reveal the content of Young\u2019s remarks to the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>ant and the defendant\u2019s attorney. Therefore, Jones should have been allowed to use his notes to refresh his recollection. The defendant bears the burden of establishing that the court\u2019s error was so materially injurious as to constitute a cause for reversal. <em>State </em>v. <em>L\u2019Heureux, </em>166 Conn. 312, 323-24, 348 A.2d 578. Subsequent to the court\u2019s ruling, Jones testified extensively concerning his later conversation with Young. We conclude the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that his attorney should have been allowed to impeach Young by asking him on cross-examination whether he had been adjudicated insane. The state\u2019s objection to this question was sustained and an exception was taken. Then a discussion took place outside the hearing of the jury where it was revealed that at one time Young had been found not guilty by reason of insanity and confined and treated for mental illness pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-47. The court and both counsel reached agreement that the question was improper, but that defense counsel could question Young about his mental condition at the present time or at the time of the conspiracy. Upon the jury\u2019s return defense counsel followed this line of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s acquiescence in the court\u2019s ruling raises a serious question whether his claim of error was distinctly presented at trial as required by Practice Book \u00a7 652. We will review his claim, however, since the fundamental constitutional right of confrontation is involved and the record is adequate to decide the issue. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70-71, 327 A.2d 576. We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s assertion that the verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity was admissible as a prior con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>viction. Section 53a-47 applies to criminal defendants <em>\u201cacquitted </em>on the grounds of mental disease or defect.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We also find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claim that Young\u2019s acquittal under \u00a7 53a-47 was admissible as an adjudication of insanity. His acquittal meant only that it was found that there was at least reasonable doubt as to his sanity at the time he committed a criminal act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>169 Conn. 207, 215, 363 A.2d 91. Young\u2019s confinement and treatment upon judicial hearing subsequent to the verdict of acquittal were proper subjects for impeachment, and defense counsel was in fact permitted to pursue this line of questioning. See <em>Taborsky </em>v. <em>State, </em>142 Conn. 619, 116 A.2d 433; 81 Am. Jur. 2d, Witnesses, \u00a7 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Finally, the defendant contends that the court in its charge should have warned the jury to scrutinize carefully the testimony of Young, the state\u2019s chief witness, who admitted his complicity in the offense and implicated the defendant. The defendant correctly points out that the inherent unreliability of accomplice testimony ordinarily requires a particular caution to the jury. See <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 136, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>494 F.2d 955, 959-60 (D.C. Cir.); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pecciulis, </em>84 Conn. 152, 159, 79 A. 75; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>29 Conn. 463, 473. We cannot agree, however, that the court failed to fulfill its duty. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>76 Conn. 342, 349, 56 A. 632, we stated: \u201cThe conditions of character and interest most inconsistent with a credible witness, very frequently, hut not always, attend an accomplice when he testifies. When those conditions exist, it is the duty of the judge to specially caution the jury.\u201d The relevant \u201cconditions of character and interest\u201d in the present case were Young\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>status' as a self-confessed criminal and Ms possible interest in favorable treatment. The court drew the jury\u2019s attention to both factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The gravamen of the defendant\u2019s complaint, therefore, is the court\u2019s failure to use the words \u201cscrutinize carefully\u201d in its charge. Failure to charge precisely as proposed by a defendant is not error where the point is fairly covered in the charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vennard, </em>159 Conn. 385, 399, 270 A.2d 837, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1011, 91 S. Ct. 576, 27 L. Ed. 2d 625. Moreover, the defendant neither requested the court to include the words \u201cscrutinize carefully\u201d in its charge nor objected to their absence in the charge as given. We conclude that the court adequately instructed the jury on the testimony of the accomplice Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\"> The court charged, in part: \u201cYou may consider, for example, that he [Young] is a self-confessed criminal, and everything else being equal, you would not ordinarily believe the testimony of a man who committed a crime such as this as readily as you would that of a man of good character. ... If you feel that he may in his own mind be looking for or hoping for some favors in the handling of his own situation, and, therefore, his testimony may be colored because of such thoughts, then, of course, you will give such weight to his testimony or no weight to it at all as may appear appropriate to you under all the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
