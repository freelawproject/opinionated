W. Brown Company, hereinafter Brown, the general contractor which had contracted with Regional School District No. 4 for the construction of a school. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-41 Brown furnished a bond in the amount of the contract for the protection of persons supplying labor or materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract. Under the terms of the bond, the defendants, Brown, as principal, and Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, as surety, bound themselves to make payments promptly to all claimants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>furnishing labor and material used or reasonably-required for use in the construction project. Subsequent to the execution of the contract and the furnishing of the bond, Brown entered into a subcontract with B &amp; G to do all the site work for the entire project including the installation of drainage pipes around the exterior of the proposed building. Brown also entered into a subcontract with the Becker and Goldstein Company for the plumbing and heating work which similarly required the installation of drainage pipe in the sewage system. Becker and Goldstein, however, engaged B <em>&amp; </em>G to install this drainage pipe in the sewage system required under the plumbing subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Pursuant to purchase orders issued by B &amp; G, the plaintiff made two deliveries of poroswall pipe to the construction site and billed B &amp; G for the materials in the amount of $3,025.10. Failing to receive payment from B &amp; G, the plaintiff, pursuant to \u00a7 49-42, duly notified the defendants Brown and Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, and demanded payment from Brown. After the expiration of more than five months following the notification to the defendants regarding their delinquency, the plaintiff commenced the present action to recover on the bond. The court <em>(Palmer, J.) </em>overruled the defendants\u2019 demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint which alleged that suit was not commenced within the time limitation prescribed by statute, and upon trial of the matter, the court <em>(Bracken, J.) </em>rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $3,025.10 plus interest, and the defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The defendants raise three issues on appeal: (1) The applicability of a 1969 amendment to \u00a7 49-42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>to this case; (2) the plaintiff\u2019s contractual relationship as within the contemplated coverage of the payment bond required by statute (\u00a749-42); and (3) the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action in opening the case suo motu.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">At the time of the execution of the contract and payment bond in January, 1969, and until October 1,1969, \u00a7 49-42 (b) provided that no suit on the bond \u201cshall be commenced after the expiration of one year after the date of final settlement\u201d of the contract. The time limit for filing suit under \u00a7 49-42 (b) was amended by 1969 Public Acts, No. 192, \u00a7 1, effective October 1, 1969, to provide that no \u201csuit shall be commenced after the expiration of one year after the day on which the last of the labor was performed or material was supplied.\u201d The plaintiff made final delivery of the materials to the construction site on May 5, 1969; it provided notice of the delivery and demanded payment from the defendant Brown on July 3, 1969; and suit was filed on February 9, 1971. The defendants, by letter sent to the trial court and at oral argument, conceded that the present action was commenced within one year of final settlement as required under the provisions of \u00a7 49-42 (b) as it existed prior to the effective date of Public Act No. 192. The defendants argue, however, that the 1969 statutory amendment applies and operates as a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action because suit was not commenced until almost twenty months after the plaintiff\u2019s final delivery of the materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">This court has consistently expressed its reluctance to construe statutes as having retroactive application. <em>East Village Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>173 Conn. 328, 332, 377 A.2d 1092. A statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u201caffecting substantial changes in the law\u201d is not to be given a retrospective effect unless it clearly and unequivocally appears that such was the legislative intent. <em>State ex rel. Rundbaken </em>v. <em>Watrous, </em>135 Conn. 638, 648, 68 A.2d 289; <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>165 Conn. 687, 726, 345 A.2d 563. The test of whether a statute is to be applied retroactively, absent an express legislative intent, \u201cis not a purely mechanical one\u201d and even if it is a procedural statute, which ordinarily will be applied retroactively without a legislative imperative to the contrary, \u201cit will not be applied retroactively if considerations of good sense and justice dictate that it not be so applied. <em>Lavieri </em>v. <em>Ulysses </em>. . . [149 Conn. 396, 401, 180 A.2d 632]; <em>E. M. Lowe\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Alliance, </em>127 Conn. 415, 418, 17 A.2d 525.\u201d <em>Carvette </em>v. <em>Marion Power Shovel Co., </em>157 Conn. 92, 96, 249 A.2d 58; <em>Jones Destruction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Upjohn, </em>161 Conn. 191, 196, 286 A.2d 308. These aids to legislative interpretation apply with equal force to amendatory acts which effectuate changes in existing statutes. See <em>Lavieri </em>v. Ulysses, 149 Conn. 396, 402, 403, 180 A.2d 632; 1A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed.) \u00a7 22.36. The rule that statutes which are, general in their terms and affect matters of procedure can be applied retroactively, however, does not include a statute which, though in form providing but a change in remedy, actually brings about changes in substantive rights. <em>Field </em>v. <em>Witt Tire Co., </em>200 F.2d 74, 77 (2d Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We have concluded that the General Assembly intended General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-41 and 49-42 to operate in general conformity with the federal statute, popularly known as the Miller Act (40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 270a \u2014 270e); <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Dahm, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>159 Conn. 563, 567, 271 A.2d 55; <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>L. G. DeFelice &amp; Son, Inc., </em>151 Conn. 325, 332-33, 197 A.2d 638. The provision of \u00a7 49-42 affected by Public Act No. 192, which sets forth the time limitation within which suit must be commenced under the statute, therefore, is not to be treated as an ordinary statute of limitation, but as a jurisdictional requirement establishing a condition precedent to maintaining an action under that section. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gullard, </em>504 F.2d 466, 468 (9th Cir.); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Home Indemnity Co., </em>489 F.2d 1004 (7th Cir.); <em>United States </em>v. <em>General Ins. Co. of America, </em>339 F.2d 194 (6th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">As a general rule, where a statute gives a right of action which did not exist at common law, the time fixed for bringing the action is a limitation of the liability itself, and not of the remedy alone. <em>DeMartino </em>v. <em>Siemon, </em>90 Conn. 527, 528, 97 A. 765; see <em>Diamond National Corporation </em>v. <em>Dwelle, </em>164 Conn. 540, 543, 325 A.2d 259; 51 Am. Jur. 2d, Limitation of Actions, \u00a7 21. Such is the case regarding the time in which a materialman must bring suit under the statute in question. <em>New Britain Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>American Surety Co., </em>113 Conn. 1, 7-8, 154 A. 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The defendants argue that despite a conclusion that \u00a7 49-42 (b) is not simply a remedial provision ordinarily subject to retroactive application,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> our holding in <em>Diamond National Corporation </em>v. <em>Dwelle, </em>supra, prohibits the retroactive application of the 1969 amendment only to actions pending at the time of the enactment and not to matters not then pend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Diamond </em>dealt, however, with the effect of an amendment upon the statutory requirements under \u00a7 49-39 relating to actions brought to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien. The defendants herein furnished a bond pursuant to the statute as a condition precedent to the execution of the construction contract. The bond and the statute, therefore, are to be construed together, \u201cand the language of the bond is to be interpreted in the light of the statute and with a view to effectuating the legislative intent manifested therein.\u201d <em>New Britain Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>American Surety Co., </em>supra, 5; <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>L. G. DeFelice &amp; Son, Inc., </em>supra; 17 Am. Jur. 2d, Contractors\u2019 Bonds, \u00a7 5; 12 Am. Jur. 2d, Bonds, \u00a7 26. The federal courts have concluded, in construing the Miller Act, that it is the statute in force at the time of the execution of the contract which controls. <em>United States </em>v. <em>General Ins. Co. of America, </em>supra, 195; see <em>Title Guaranty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>228 U.S. 567, 33 S. Ct. 614, 57 L. Ed. 969, and <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>209 U.S. 306, 28 S. Ct. 537, 52 L. Ed. 804 (construing the federal Heard Act); annot., 119 A.L.R. 255, 258-59. Under this interpretation, the 1969 amendment to \u00a749-42 is not given retroactive effect, and thus we need not consider issues concerning the impairment of contracts. See <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>97 Conn. 8, 15, 115 A. 484; <em>Ashwander </em>v. <em>Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 346-48, 56 S. Ct. 466, 80 L. Ed. 688 (concurring opinion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Brand\u00e9is, J.) The court was not in error in overruling the defendants\u2019 demurrer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The second claim of the defendants relates to the status of the plaintiff as one entitled to the full protection of and within the contemplated coverage of the statutory payment bond for the materials which it supplied. As already noted, the plaintiff delivered materials to the construction site pursuant to the purchase orders made out by B &amp; G. B &amp; G used these materials supplied by the plaintiff for work performed in connection with its contract with Brown, the general contractor, and pursuant to its contract with Becker and Goldstein, another subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The gravamen of the defendants\u2019 claim is that \u00a7 49-42 gives a right of action upon the bond only to those persons having a \u201cdirect contractual relationship with a subcontractor,\u201d and affords no protection to those who deal with \u201csubcontractors of subcontractors of a prime contractor.\u201d The defendants claim that since some of the materials supplied by the plaintiff were used in connection with B &amp; G\u2019s subcontract with Becker and Goldstein, the plaintiff has no cause of action against Brown under the bond for that portion of the materials. The defendants have misconstrued the import of this statutory restriction. The question is simply whether B &amp; G was a subcontractor within the meaning of the statute; if it was not, the plaintiff would stand in too remote a relationship to secure the benefits of the bond. <em>MacEvoy Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>322 U.S. 102, 108, 64 S. Ct. 890, 88 L. Ed. 1163. \u201c[A] subcontractor is one who performs for and takes from the prime contractor a specific part of the labor or material requirements of the original contract.\u201d Id., 109. B &amp; G falls within this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The purpose of limiting the right of action upon the bond to only those having a direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor is to prevent the imposition of unlimited liability upon the prime contractor and his surety. Id., 110. While it is easy for the prime contractor to secure himself against loss by requiring the relatively few subcontractors to provide some type of security for the payment of those who contract directly with these subcontractors,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cthis method of protection is generally inadequate to cope with remote and undetermined liabilities incurred by an ordinary materialman, who may be a manufacturer, a wholesaler or a retailer.\u201d Id. Since B &amp; Gr was a subcontractor of Brown, allowing the plaintiff to recover for materials used by B &amp; Gr under its contract with another subcontractor does not thwart the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The statutory requirement of a bond is designed to \u201cprotect and benefit those who furnish materials and labor to the contractor on public work, in that they may be sure of payment of their just claims, without defeat or undue delay\u201d; <em>Pelton &amp; King, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>109 Conn. 547, 556, 147 A. 144; and such statutory provisions are to be liberally construed. <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>L. G. DeFelice &amp; Son, Inc., </em>supra, 333. The plaintiff\u2019s protection under the bond is not limited because some of the materials it supplied were used by B &amp; Gr in connection with its subcontract with Becker and Goldstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The defendants\u2019 final claim of error challenges the propriety of the trial court\u2019s decision to open the case in order to hear additional evidence. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>court, after the trial was concluded, directed the defendants to file a supplemental answer due to the uncertainty that existed as to whether the defendants had filed an answer to certain paragraphs of the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint regarding the date of final settlement of the contract. Thereupon, the defendants pleaded insufficient knowledge as to these matters. The court then advised counsel that it would hear evidence on the issues thereby raised in these paragraphs of the amended complaint. After the defendants\u2019 counsel advised the trial court that they conceded the fact that at the time the plaintiff\u2019s action was instituted there had been no final settlement of the contract, no hearing was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The defendants\u2019 failure to plead timely to these material allegations contained in the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint constituted an admission of the facts contained therein. Practice Book \u00a7 83; <em>Phinney </em>v. <em>Rosgen, </em>162 Conn. 36, 37, 291 A.2d 218. Thus, the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the defendants to file a supplemental answer and to open the case in order to hear additional evidence on this matter would operate only to benefit the defendants. We need not consider a claim of error regarding a ruling which is clearly favorable to the appellant. See Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 39. Furthermore, the claim lacks merit since the scheduled hearing was never held and the defendants do not challenge the court\u2019s finding that they conceded that there had been no final settlement of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> See, for example, <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Scovil Manufacturing Co., </em>77 <em>Conn. 528, 60 </em>A. 132.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-4\"> The present action was commenced more than one year after the effective date of the amendment to \u00a7 49-42, and was therefore not pending at that time. A 1959 amendment to the Miller Act specifically provided that contracts entered into before the effective date of the amendment shall not be affected by the change. Public Law 86-135, \u00a73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\"> The record reveals, that this is precisely what Brown did, at least in its contractual agreement with Becker and Goldstein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
