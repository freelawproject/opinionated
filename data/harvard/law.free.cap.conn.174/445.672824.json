From that judgment, the plaintiff has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Contrary to the recitation in the agreement, the court found that the plaintiff did not expend any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>time or money in investigating the possibility of acting as the defendant\u2019s broker. This finding was supported by the evidence. Further, in response to a motion for a more specific statement, the plaintiff alleged that a previous oral agreement between the parties furnished the basis for his consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>under the written agreement in question.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the determinative issue at trial involved the existence of the alleged oral agreement between the parties giving the plaintiff the right to act as the defendant\u2019s broker.'</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">At the time of trial on June 15,1976, the plaintiff had been a licensed real estate broker for close to twenty years. The defendant corporation was the owner and developer of land located in Branford known as \u201cWoodlands Property\u201d which it intended to develop as a condominium project. Robert W. Bailey and Herbert Small were the officers, directors and stockholders of the defendant corporation which was in the business of owning and developing real estate throughout the state. Small, a real estate broker for the defendant for almost eight years prior to becoming a director and stockholder in the defendant corporation, was apparently brought into the defendant corporation in 1969 in order to provide \u201cin house\u201d brokerage services for the defendant. Prior to May 21, 1971, the plaintiff had also acted as the broker for property of the defendant other than the Woodlands property.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The agreement, executed on May 21, 1971, recites that the plaintiff had periodically discussed with the defendant the possibility of acting as the broker for the proposed condominium property, and, as a result of these discussions, relied upon the defendant\u2019s representations that he would be given an exclusive agency in regard to this property. \u201c[I]n order to avoid any controversy relative to the foregoing,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff the total sum of $30,000 \u201cin full settlement of any claim alleged by the . . . [plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The circumstances leading up to and surrounding the execution of this agreement are not entirely clear from the record presented. It is not disputed, however, that sometime before May 21, 1971, the plaintiff engaged in a number of conversations with the attorney for the defendant, Edward Marcus, concerning the possibility of acting as a broker for the defendant regarding the Woodlands property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not discuss this matter directly with Bailey, Small or any other individual involved in the operations of the defendant corporation. Rather, the basic issue in the controversy concerns the nature and effect of the discussions between the plaintiff and Attorney Marcus. The trial court found there was no oral agreement between Marcus and the plaintiff that the plaintiff was to act as a broker for the defendant corporation regarding the Woodlands property.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The court concluded that the plaintiff never negotiated any agency agreement with the defendant\u2019s attorney or any agent or principal of the corporation. Despite persistent questioning at trial by the defendant\u2019s own counsel, however, Marcus refused to assert that he had never entered into such an agreement with the plaintiff. Rather, Marcus repeatedly stated that he had no authority to enter into such an arrangement. The testimony of Bailey, president of the defendant corporation, who signed and acknowledged the agreement, indicated that he had no knowledge that Marcus ever entered into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>such an agreement on the defendant\u2019s behalf. Nevertheless, in spite of such claimed lack of any oral agreement with the plaintiff, the defendant, through Bailey, agreed to pay the plaintiff in satisfaction of any claim relating to the alleged oral understanding with Marcus.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">On the basis of the testimony of Bailey, the court found that the defendant signed this written agreement because it did not want \u201cany trouble\u201d; it feared negative action on the part of the plaintiff; and it feared his \u201clong reach.\u201d In addition to the above finding, however, the court found that \u201c[t]he plaintiff had been Democratic Town Chairman of New Haven for many years and was an important and powerful political leader in the State of Connecticut.\u201d Since this finding was found without evidence and was not a proper matter of which judicial notice may be taken; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Commerford, </em>168 Conn. 64, 68, 357 A.2d 476; 29 Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence, \u00a7 122; it must be stricken. Practice Book \u00a7 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In its brief, the defendant argues that this finding is immaterial to the essential issue of consideration involved in this case and, therefore, if erroneous, such an error is harmless. It would be difficult, if not impossible, however, to determine if such a finding regarding the reputation of a party to a civil suit influenced the ultimate decision of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u201c \u2018In a civil action the character or reputation of a party is deemed by the law to be irrelevant in determining the merits of the controversy. ... In the eyes of the law, the inferences which might be drawn from evidence of character and reputation of the parties are too vague, uncertain and unreliable to be worthy of consideration in determining the merits, however just and reasonable such inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>may seem to the lay mind.\u2019 1 Jones, Evidence (4th Ed.), \u00a7 148.\u201d <em>Bosworth </em>v. <em>Bosworth, </em>131 Conn. 389, 391, 40 A.2d 186. Unless character has been pnt into issue, in civil proceedings, evidence of character is not admissible. <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>7 Conn. 116, 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We have said that the conclusions reached by a court in a case tried without a jury will be tested by this court only by a review of the subordinate facts found by the trial court as corrected on appeal. <em>Terrace Estates </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>166 Conn. 469, 471, 352 A.2d 303. However, the conclusion of the court below was drawn with the possibly damaging reference to the plaintiff\u2019s reputation as an established fact. Although it may be true that the decision at which the court arrived upon the merits of the ease might have been unaffected by this improper finding, we cannot be certain of it. See <em>Buckingham\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>60 Conn. 143, 160, 22 A. 509. \u201cA judge has not such control over his mental faculties that he can definitely determine whether or not inadmissible evidence he has heard will affect his mind in making his decision.\u201d <em>Kovacs </em>v. <em>Szentes, </em>130 Conn. 229, 232, 33 A.2d 124; <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>63 Conn. 310, 320, 28 A. 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Since we cannot speculate as to the degree of influence which the objectionable finding had in the final result, unless it clearly appeared that no harm could have been done, \u201cthe safer rule is to grant a new trial.\u201d <em>Buckingham\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra; <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Horse R. Co., </em>41 Conn. 61, 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-6\"> The pertinent text of the agreement is set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9k\">\u201cAGREEMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">THIS AGREEMENT, entered into this 21st day of May, 1971, by and between CADILLAC CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Connecticut, having its principal place of business in the Town of West Haven, County of New Haven, State of Connecticut, hereinafter referred to as the Owner, and ARTHUR T.
