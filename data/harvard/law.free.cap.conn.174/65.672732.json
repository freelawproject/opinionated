The following facts are not in dispute. A pond or pool approximately sixty feet long and thirty feet wide which was lined with a concrete liner was located on the northern section of the plaintiffs\u2019 property. It was used for swimming in the summer and as a skating rink in the winter. Water in the pool flowed from two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>springs on neighboring property, and one of the springs was on the defendants\u2019 property, adjoining that of the plaintiffs. On land adjacent to the defendants\u2019 property, there was an old concrete cistern which was filled with water from two springs. Since those properties were located on a higher level than the plaintiffs\u2019 property, water from the cistern ran through a culvert under a wood road on the defendants\u2019 property and traveled downgrade through a swale or swamp to the property of the plaintiffs and down to their pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Intending to develop his property, the defendant, Charles A. Antonelli, organized the defendant, Dory Corporation, to which he quitclaimed his 25.25 acres of land in August of 1969. The defendant Antonelli was advised of possible problems in building on his lots unless some method of controlling ground or surface waters was found; as a result, on December 4, 1969, to determine whether there were additional springs in those lots, diversion ditches were constructed to carry water off the property. Although the plaintiffs\u2019 pool had been adequately filled with water and free of any silt prior to this time, in December of 1969 the flow of water to the pool was cut off by the digging of the interceptor ditch on the defendants\u2019 land which caused the water in the plaintiffs\u2019 pool to become stagnant. Additionally, in the following spring, \u201cexcessive silting took place in the plaintiffs\u2019 pool from excessive runoff of water from the defendants\u2019 land after the spring thaw.\u201d Since the summer of 1970, the plaintiffs have been unable to use their pool because it has been filled with silt.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The plaintiffs allege in the first count of their complaint that the defendants illegally interfered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>with their property rights by changing the course and volume of the water which naturally flowed onto their property and in the remaining counts allege causes of action based on a private nuisance, trespass and negligence. From the evidence presented, the trial referee concluded that the diversion ditches which were constructed by the defendants caused a change in the volume and course of the water which naturally flowed to the plaintiffs\u2019 property and resulted in the plaintiffs\u2019 pool being filled with silt and vegetation; the court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs in the amount of $8000 on the first count of their complaint, from which the defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In their assignment of errors, the defendants attack the judgment claiming that it was erroneously based upon facts found but not raised by the pleadings. The gravamen of this claim is the defendants\u2019 assertion that the basic allegations in the first count of the complaint indicated that the damage was caused by the increased flow of waters onto the plaintiffs\u2019 land, while the memorandum of decision refers to \u201cboth a change of course and a decrease in volume.\u201d In further support of their claim of inconsistency, the defendants also refer to a finding of the trial court which states: \u201cIn December of 1969, the flow of water to the pond was cut off . . . .\u201d From the foregoing, the defendants challenge the judgment claiming that the plaintiffs are limited to the allegations in their complaint and cannot allege one cause of action and recover upon another. We find no material variation in the pleadings and proof as to the basic cause of action alleged in the first count upon which the plaintiffs prevailed. <em>Schaller </em>v. <em>Roadside Inn, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 61, 64-67, 221 A.2d 263. The allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>in that count construed in a manner most favorable to the pleaders sufficiently state a cause of action which would establish that in the development of their adjacent land the defendants had altered the natural flow of water in such a manner as to change the volume of water flowing from their land and to discharge it in a manner different in volume or course upon, and to the detriment of, the plaintiffs\u2019 land. <em>Tide Water Oil Sales Corporation </em>v. <em>Shimelman, </em>114 Conn. 182, 188, 158 A. 229; 78 Am. Jur. 2d, Waters \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Although the trial court found that in December of 1969 the flow of water to the plaintiffs\u2019 land was cut off, it also found that in the spring of 1970 silting occurred in the plaintiffs\u2019 pond as a result of the excessive runoff of water from the defendants\u2019 land after the spring thaw. The complaint specifically alleged that the plaintiffs\u2019 pool was damaged from, inter alia, the excessive accumulation of silt. Any ambiguity in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision is clarified by the finding which explicitly describes the cause of the silting as the increased water flow. \u201cAs between a memorandum of decision and a finding, the latter must always prevail.\u201d <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Adelman, </em>144 Conn. 176, 180, 128 A.2d 534; <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>170 Conn. 305, 307, 365 A.2d 1188. The judgment was based upon essential issues which were reasonably within the scope of the pleadings. <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>138 Conn. 718, 721, 89 A.2d 213; <em>Spitz </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>128 Conn. 121, 123, 20 A.2d 616; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Although the defendants attack a number of the trial court\u2019s findings as being made without evidence, they only brief the claim that the court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>in refusing to find facts contained in their draft finding. Assignments of error which are not briefed are presumed to be abandoned. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Flammia, </em>169 Conn. 491, 498, 363 A.2d 1048. The facts which the defendants seek to have added to the finding are neither admitted nor undisputed material facts which would require such a correction. Practice Book \u00a7 628. Pacts are not admitted or undisputed merely because they are uncontradicted. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Jankura, </em>162 Conn. 482, 484, 294 A.2d 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The defendants also assign error in the ruling of the court admitting the testimony of the witness, Grant Herman, as to the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 property. It is admitted that Herman was a part-time real estate broker in the New Milford area. The defendants, however, challenge his testimony only on the ground that he was incompetent to testify as an expert because he was a former owner of the plaintiffs\u2019 and defendants\u2019 properties which he had sold to them. The plaintiffs\u2019 house had not been built on the property at the time of its purchase from Herman. Reasonable qualifications were established for the admission of the witness\u2019 testimony as to value and the objection raised concerning his former ownership of the property went to its weight rather than its admissibility. <em>Waldron </em>v. <em>Raccio, </em>166 Conn. 608, 614, 353 A.2d 770. The qualification of an expert is in the discretion of the trial court and its decision will not be disturbed unless that discretion is abused or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Castagna, </em>170 Conn. 80, 90, 364 A.2d 200; 31 Am. Jur. 2d, Expert and Opinion Evidence, \u00a731. The defendants, for the first time, raise in their brief the claim that the plaintiff Gary O\u2019Connor, one of the owners, testified as to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>asking price for the property. Since the defendants did not pnrsne an objection or take an exception to this testimony, or specifically assign it as error, it cannot be considered on appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 652; <em>Cottrell </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>168 Conn. 119, 120, 358 A.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The defendants\u2019 final claim of error relates to the trial referee\u2019s failure to view the premises. Before resting his case, counsel for the defendants moved that the court view the premises. There being no objection, the court remarked: \u201cWell, I probably will view it. I will tell you when. Be within the next month.\u201d The court did not view the site, explaining in its finding that \u201cconditions had changed to the extent that such a viewing would serve no useful purpose.\u201d The defendants claim that they had no knowledge of the court\u2019s decision not to inspect the property until the finding was filed, and that its failure to view the site deprived the defendants of \u201cessential evidence in the prosecution of their case.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In late 1969, Dory Corporation dug ditches on its property to determine the presence of springs and the feasibility of development. The plaintiffs brought suit in August, 1970. The case was tried in 1974. Thus the changes made and the damages claimed to have been suffered by the plaintiffs occurred almost four years before trial. \u201cThe test is whether a view is necessary or important in order to obtain a clearer understanding of the issues and to apply the evidence properly. 2 Wigmore, Evidence (3d Ed.) \u00a7 1162 et seq.\u201d <em>Dickson </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>141 Conn. 250, 256, 105 A.2d 463. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>court had full benefit of the testimony of several witnesses as to the condition and location of the property in addition to demonstrative evidence consisting of maps, sketches and photographs. The law is clear, and the defendants agree, that the decision to view the premises rests within the sound discretion of the court. <em>LaVoie </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>141 Conn. 681, 687, 109 A.2d 508; 76 Am. Jur. 2d, Trial, \u00a7 1247. The defendants contend, however, that error was committed when the court indicated that it would make such an inspection. In the course of the colloquy regarding the defendants\u2019 motion, the defendants\u2019 counsel remarked: \u201cAnd I take it, if Your Honor does decide on a view, you\u2019ll communicate with us as to a date.\u201d The defendants now suggest, although the foregoing statement indicates otherwise, that the trial court was understood to have expressly granted the defendants\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The trial court stated that conditions had changed to the extent that a view would serve no useful purpose as the reason for its failure to inspect the premises. We have no way of knowing whether the court had in mind that the changes first started in 1969 which led to the allegations made in the cause of action dated August 5, 1970, and not tried until January and February of 1974, were considered too remote in time to be viewed some four years after the event. Although the defendants in their brief argue that there was no evidence to indicate a change in circumstances, they did not specifically assign as error this determination of the court. Since this court is not bound to consider any claimed errors on appeal which have not been specifically assigned; Practice Book \u00a7 <em>652; Raffile </em>v. <em>Stamford Housewrecking, Inc., </em>168 Conn. 299, 303, 362 A.2d 879; the question of the trial court\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>that conditions had changed is not properly before this court. Under all the circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in failing to view the premises as requested. <em>LaVoie </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"ADq\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\"> The defendants have failed to indicate exactly what \u201cessential evidence\u201d they were deprived of as a result of the court's decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
