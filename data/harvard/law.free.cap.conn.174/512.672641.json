The plaintiff, Evans Products Company, alleged in the first count of its complaint that the defendant Clinton Building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Supply, Inc., hereinafter Clinton, had purchased items pursuant to an open credit account with the plaintiff and owed a balance of $18,737.36, including interest, and that despite repeated demands Clinton had refused to pay the balance due. The second count repleaded the first count and, in addition, alleged that the defendant First Hartford Realty Corporation, hereinafter Realty, had agreed in writing to guarantee payment of Clinton\u2019s indebtedness to the plaintiff in the event of Clinton\u2019s nonpayment, and that despite the plaintiff\u2019s demands Realty had refused to pay. In their answer the defendants admitted the purchase of supplies, denied that the plaintiff had demanded payment, and pleaded insufficient knowledge or information as to the amount of the debt and the existence of the guaranty agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">After the pleadings were closed, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment and submitted three supporting affidavits. The defendants, although granted a continuance, did not file opposing affidavits as required by Practice Book \u00a7 299. The trial court heard the parties and granted summary judgment against both defendants, awarding the plaintiff damages of $17,594.55 and costs. The defendants have appealed from the judgment, assigning error in the court\u2019s admission into evidence over objections by the defendants of two of the plaintiff\u2019s three affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The defendants do not dispute that the proof offered in the plaintiff\u2019s three affidavits was sufficient, if admissible, to entitle the plaintiff to summary judgment. The plaintiff\u2019s affidavits indicated that the amount of Clinton\u2019s debt was $17,594.55, plus interest, that Realty had guaranteed the debt, and that payment had been demanded from Clinton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>and Realty. The existence of the debt having been admitted by the defendants in their answer, no genuine issues of material fact were left. Rather, the defendants contend that two of the plaintiff\u2019s affidavits did not conform to Practice Book \u00a7 300, and that the plaintiff\u2019s remaining proof was insufficient to warrant summary judgment. Since we agree with the latter claim, we find it necessary to consider the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 300 provides in part that \u201c[supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\u201d The defendants urge that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cAffidavit of Debt,\u201d set forth in full below,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not conform to these requirements, chiefly for failure to show personal knowledge. The better practice is to aver personal knowledge. See <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Kielak, </em>160 Conn. 14, 18, 273 A.2d 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The question presented here is whether the lack of such an averment necessarily disqualifies the affidavit. The affidavit states positively, and therefore is distinguishable from affidavits held inadmissible for being made on \u201cinformation and belief\u201d or the equivalent. See <em>Automatic Radio Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Hazeltine Research, Inc., </em>339 U.S. 827, 831, 70 S. Ct. 894, 94 L. Ed. 1312; <em>Applegate </em>v. <em>Top Associates, Inc., </em>425 F.2d 92, 96-97 (2d Cir.); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co., </em>38 F.R.D. 416, 418 (E.D. Pa.). The affidavit on its face does not contain obviously inadmissible hearsay. See <em>Alger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>252 F.2d 519, 521 (5th Cir.); <em>Midland Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>John A. Hall Construction Co., </em>398 F. Sup. 981, 989 (N.D. Ind.); <em>McColl </em>v. <em>Pataky, </em>160 Conn. 457, 460, 280 A.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">On the other hand, there is no affirmative showing of personal knowledge in the affidavit, such as a statement that the affiant is familiar with the Clinton account, or even that he is familiar with or controls the plaintiff\u2019s business records. While there is some authority for the proposition that a corporate officer presumptively has personal knowledge of the matters stated in an affidavit made on behalf of the corporation; <em>United Bonding Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dura-Stress, Inc., </em>243 So. 2d 244, 246 (Fla. App.); annot., 3 A.L.R. 132; 3 Am. Jur. 2d, Affidavits, \u00a7 5; 2A C.J.S., Affidavits, \u00a7 50; in our view the better rule is that followed by the federal courts: in summary judgment proceedings, affidavits made by corporate officers and other parties must aver or affirmatively show personal knowledge of the matters stated therein. See, e.g., <em>Antonio </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>464 F.2d 584, 585 (4th Cir.) (affidavits of assistant prison superintendents held inadmissible because they did not indicate personal knowledge of prison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>er\u2019s circumstances); <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Ross Coal Co., </em>150 P. Sup. 808, 810 (S.D. W.Va.) (affidavit from chief engineer for real estate trust admitted because it averred personal knowledge of the facts); <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Board of Education of Town of Wolcott, </em>65 F.R.D. 641, 648 (D. Conn.) (school superintendent\u2019s affidavit held inadmissible for no showing of personal knowledge of circumstances attending student\u2019s expulsion, but similar affidavit from principal admitted because of principal\u2019s judicially noticed responsibility for day-to-day school operations); <em>Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc. </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>61 F.R.D. 565, 569 (W.D. Ark.) (corporate officer\u2019s affidavit admitted because it showed familiarity with auditors\u2019 reports); <em>Land Title Co. of Alabama </em>v. <em>State ex rel. Porter, </em>292 Ala. 691, 702, 299 So. 2d 289 (concurring opinion of Heflin, C.J.) (corporate officer\u2019s affidavit criticized for reciting details of loan transactions without indicating that the statements were made on personal knowledge); 10 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2738, p. 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">It is especially appropriate to hold an affidavit submitted by a moving party to a stringent standard. Because the burden is on the movant, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and he is given the benefit of all favorable inferences that can be drawn. <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>158 Conn. 364, 380, 260 A.2d 596. We conclude the court erred in admitting the affidavit of Zalmon Wallack into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Whether that ruling was harmful depends on the outcome of the defendants\u2019 attack on the plaintiff\u2019s third affidavit, which also purported to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>amount of the debt. This affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel included a copy of a letter to him from the defendants\u2019 counsel, dated December 28,1976, about four months after the filing of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The critical portion of the letter was the statement: \u201cAs to the Clinton Building Supply, our invoices show the requisitions submitted by Clinton amount to $17,594.55. No payment has been made and the entire amount is due and owing and my client is willing to pay it at this time. Your figure of $18,737.36 probably once again includes interest. Please verify these with your client and get back to me.\u201d The defendants contend that the letter was inadmissible as an offer of settlement, while the plaintiff characterizes the letter as a factual admission by an attorney admissible in evidence against his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The general rule is that relevant and material admissions of fact by an attorney are admissible against the client, if made incidental to the attorney\u2019s general authority to represent the client in connection with and for the purpose of controlling the matter committed to the attorney. <em>Wesson </em>v. <em>F. M. Heritage Co., </em>174 Conn. 236, 243, 386 A.2d 217; <em>Collens </em>v. <em>New Canaan Water Co., </em>155 Conn. 477, 496, 234 A.2d 825; <em>Lickteig </em>v. <em>Buckholz, </em>129 Conn. 399, 402, 28 A.2d 871; 7 Am. Jur. 2d, Attorneys, \u00a7 122. It was also established as long ago as 1822, in <em>Hartford Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Granger, </em>4 Conn. 142, 148, that an offer to compromise or settle a disputed claim is not admissible against the offeror. The test is whether the party making the admission intended to concede a fact hypothetically for the purpose of effecting a compromise, or to declare a fact really to exist. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Sera, </em>112 Conn. 291, 298, 152 A. 148; <em>Riccio </em>v. <em>Montano, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>93 Conn. 289, 293, 105 A. 625; <em>Hartford Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Granger, </em>supra, 148; see annot., 15 A.L.R.3d 13. The statement in question clearly was intended as an outright acknowledgement of an overdue debt of $17,594.55, not as a hypothetical concession. The defendants do not attempt to deny their attorney\u2019s authority to make the statement. Whatever may be the merit of the policy arguments favoring extension of the exclusionary rule to all statements made in compromise negotiations; see McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 724, pp. 663-64; they scarcely apply where, as here, there is little if any indication that an attorney\u2019s letter was written to effect a compromise rather than to verify an account. Cf. <em>Moving Picture Machine Operators Union </em>v. <em>Glasgow Theaters, Inc., </em>6 Cal. App. 3d 395, 404-405, 86 Cal. Rptr. 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The court properly admitted the letter into evidence. The letter, together with the plaintiff\u2019s unchallenged affidavit and the admitted allegations of the complaint, eliminated any genuine issue as to any material fact in the complaint. No harm was done by the court\u2019s admission into evidence of the affidavit of Zalmon Wallack. Since the pleadings and competent affidavits established the plaintiff\u2019s right to summary judgment under Practice Book \u00a7 303, we need not consider the defendants\u2019 attack on the court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law because of the defendants\u2019 failure to submit opposing affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\"> \u00abAFFIDAVIT OF DEBT</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">COMMONWEALTH OF ) MASSACHUSETTS )ss.
