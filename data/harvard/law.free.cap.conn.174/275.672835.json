It was undisputed that on March 3, 1972, the defendant Linda M. Iannucci was driving west on Arctic Street in Bridgeport in an automobile owned by her father, the defendant Benjamin Iannucci, when she struck the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s taxicab. The defendants denied negligence, and pleaded contributory negligence as a special defense. The parties presented widely divergent accounts of the circumstances of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The plaintiff has confined his appeal to an attack upon the charge of the court. He assigns error in the court\u2019s instructions concerning both the defendant operator\u2019s negligence and his contributory negligence. The jury returned a general verdict for the defendants, which imports that the issues of fact on both defenses were found in favor of the defendants. <em>Gennallo </em>v. <em>Mazzacane, </em>144 Conn. 686, 689, 137 A.2d 534. \u201cIn order that there may be a reversal, therefore, it must appear that the charge was erroneous as it related both to the subject of the defendant\u2019s negligence and to the subject of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence. <em>Hasler </em>v. <em>T. H. Canty &amp; Co., </em>138 Conn. 343, 346, 84 A.2d 557; <em>Meglio </em>v. <em>Comeau, </em>137 Conn. 551, 553, 79 A.2d 187. Accordingly, if we find no error in so much of the charge as related to contributory negligence, it will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>necessary to consider any of the claims of error in the instructions concerning the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Ippolito </em>v. <em>Stafford, </em>141 Conn. 372, 374, 106 A.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The plaintiff contends that in two respects the court erred in instructing the jury on the application of motor vehicle statutes to the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence. Quoting relevant portions of General Statutes \u00a7 14-251<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the jury, the court said \u201clane\u201d and \u201cwheel\u201d instead of \u201cside\u201d and \u201cwheels.\u201d These minor misstatements favored the plaintiff and could not possibly have confused the jury. See Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 39. The evidence presented by the parties was definitely conflicting. The plaintiff claimed to have been parked six to seven inches away from the curb when the defendants\u2019 car struck his taxicab. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff made a sudden stop in the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The court also called the jury\u2019s attention to General Statutes \u00a7 14-36 (c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as possibly bearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence. This was an obvious error. There was no allegation or evidence' that the plaintiff was in violation of the statute. Rather, the defendant Linda M. Iannucci admitted that she had a provisional driver\u2019s license with an optical restriction and was not wearing glasses when the accident occurred. Under these circumstances the jury could not have been confused; the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The plaintiff lastly claims that the court imposed an excessively high standard of conduct on him by charging the jury that \u201c[e]ven the <em>slightest degree of contributory negligence </em>on the part of Messina, which is a substantial factor in producing his injuries and losses, bars him from recovering money damage from Linda Versal [Iannucci].\u201d (Emphasis added.) This was a correct statement of the law as it stood at the time of the accident in question and before the statutory adoption of the principles of comparative negligence. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h. See <em>Ippolito </em>v. <em>Stafford, </em>supra, 376-77; <em>Petrillo </em>v. <em>Kolbay, </em>116 Conn. 389, 394, 165 A. 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u201cAlthough a charge may not be exhaustive, perfect or technically accurate, it will ordinarily be sustained if it is correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury. <em>Castaldo </em>v. <em>D\u2019Eramo, </em>140 Conn. 88, 94, 98 A.2d 664; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 76.\u201d <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>155 Conn. 406, 412, 232 A.2d 326. The charge, taken as a whole, fairly presented the subject of contributory negligence to the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>173 Conn. 35, 40, 376 A.2d 391. Especially in view of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to request a charge or to except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>specifically to the elements of the charge now attacked; Practice Book \u00a7 249; <em>Tough </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 274, 286, 294 A.2d 67; we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\"> Section 14-251 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cNo vehicle shall be permitted to remain stationary . . . upon the traveled portion of any highway except upon the right-hand <em>side </em>of such highway in the direction in which such vehicle is headed; and, if such highway is curbed, such vehicle shall be so placed that its right-hand <em>wheels, </em>when stationary, shall, when safety will permit, be within a distance of twelve inches from the curb. . . .
