See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>127 Conn. 543, 549, 18 A.2d 895. The defendant moves to dismiss the state\u2019s appeal challenging the court\u2019s action in setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty and rendering a judgment of acquittal. The pertinent facts of the case are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">On July 20, 1977, the foreman of a jury of twelve announced in open court that a verdict had been reached. After calling the roll of the jury, the clerk, following established procedures, asked, \u201cIs Bernard Avcollie guilty of the crime of murder, in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a of the Connecticut Greneral Statutes, or not guilty?\u201d to which the foreman responded, \u201cHe is guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">At this point, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked that the jury be requested to retire, prior to acceptance of the verdict. After the court had excused the jury, the defense renewed several pending motions including a motion under Practice Book \u00a7 255 that the verdict be set aside, that an order for a judgment of dismissal be entered, and that the defendant be discharged from custody. The court responded, expressing its intention to set aside the verdict, whereupon the state requested permission to appeal to the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u201cMr. McDonald: I am asking for permission to take this matter to the state\u2019s Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">\u201cThe Court: I will rule on that at the proper time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">\u201cMr. McDonald: I would like to ask for a ruling now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">\u201cThe Court: The motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">\u201cMr. McDonald: Then you are not giving me permission to take an appeal to the state\u2019s Supreme Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">\u201cThe Court: Bring in the jury, sheriff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Upon the jury\u2019s return to the courtroom, the court announced: \u201cI am setting aside the verdict of guilty and acquitting the defendant, under the rules, under the prerogatives vested in me as a judge of this court.\u201d The jury were discharged, and, in response to a request by the defendant\u2019s counsel that the accused be discharged from custody and his bond released, the court replied, \u201cHe may be discharged.\u201d When the state\u2019s attorney excepted, the court explained, \u201cThere is no fear that he is going to flee the jurisdiction. The bond may be released.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">On July 22, 1977, the court heard argument on the state\u2019s motion to take an appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counsel for the defendant appeared with the defendant to argue against the motion, but stated, \u201cWe are not here presenting our argument in the case of <em>State of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Bernard Avcollie </em>because that case does not exist any more by virtue of what already happened. We are here as a courtesy to the court.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The court stated that it had called the hearing because the transcripts of the July 20 hearing revealed an ambiguity in the discourse between the court and the state\u2019s attorney. The court, then, proceeded to deny the state permission to appeal. \u201cI have given a great deal of thought to allowing you to appeal this case and I have no reason to not allow you to do it but you will do it by way of a writ of error, which is your right under the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Finally, again on the trial court\u2019s motion, another hearing was held on August 1,1977, for <em>\u201ca </em>rehearing on, the state\u2019s request for permission to appeal.\u201d On August 3, the court \u201crescinded\u201d its previous denial of permission to appeal and granted the requested permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The state has appealed to this court, and the defendant now seeks to have the appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The issues to be determined by the motion to dismiss the appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">1. Whether a valid jury verdict of guilty exists in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">2. Whether the court\u2019s July 20, 1977, \u201cdischarge\u201d of the defendant terminated the court\u2019s in personam jurisdiction, thereby rendering the subsequent hearings invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">3. Whether, by virtue of the trial court\u2019s July 22 \u201cdenial\u201d of permission to appeal, this court has subject-matter jurisdiction under General Statutes \u00a7 54-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">The defendant claims that, since the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty was never formally \u201caccepted\u201d by the court, a valid guilty verdict never existed in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>case. On the basis of this premise, it is argued that any action taken by this court unfavorable to the trial court\u2019s action \u2014 claimed by the defendant to constitute a judgment of acquittal \u2014 would necessitate another trial, in violation of the double jeopardy clause of the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">To substantiate his claim that no valid jury verdict exists, the defendant relies heavily upon <em>State </em>v. <em>DiPietro, </em>120 Conn. 537, 538-39, 181 A. 716, in which the court delineates the \u201csettled practice in this [s]tate\u201d for the establishment of a valid jury verdict: \u201c[T]he course of proceedings upon the return of the jury into court in a criminal case is substantially as follows: The court being in actual session, the clerk calls the roll of the jury and asks if they have agreed upon their verdict. If the foreman answers that they have, the clerk then asks whether they find the accused guilty or not guilty. The foreman answers \u2018guilty\u2019 or \u2018not guilty\u2019 as the case may be. The clerk then says to the jury: \u2018Gentlemen of the Jury, harken to your verdict as accepted and ordered recorded by the court. You upon your oaths do say that the prisoner at the bar is guilty (or not guilty) so say you, Mr. Foreman, and so, gentlemen, say you all.\u2019 The foreman and members of the jury: \u2018We do.\u2019\u201d The apparent purpose of this procedure is to ensure that the court, counsel and the jurors have a common understanding of the verdict, that it is the verdict to which each juror has assented, and that ample opportunity is afforded to cure any misunderstanding. <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Hotel Pick Arms, Inc., </em>147 Conn. 72, 74, 157 A.2d 106; <em>State </em>v. <em>DiPietro, </em>supra. While it is true, as the <em>DiPietro </em>court recognizes (p. 539), that \u201c[ujntil a verdict is accepted by the court, it is not a verdict at all,\u201d it does not follow that a verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>is deficient if the process leading to acceptance does not precisely conform to the nsual, accepted practice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In the present case, the usual practice outlined in <em>DiPietro </em>was begun: the jury returned to the courtroom, in which both counsel and the defendant were present, and the judge asked whether they had reached a verdict; the jury foreman answered, \u201cWe have, Your Honor,\u201d and the clerk called the name and number of each juror, the juror rising in response; the clerk asked, again, if they had reached a verdict, and, again, the foreman answered, \u201cYes, we have\u201d; the clerk asked the accused to stand and face the jury and the jury, having been reminded that they were sworn in, were asked, \u201cWhat say you as to case number 12,468, <em>State of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Bernard Avcollie. </em>Is Bernard Aveollie guilty of the crime of murder, in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a of the Connecticut General Statutes, or not guilty?\u201d to which the foreman responded, \u201cHe is guilty.\u201d At this juncture, the defense counsel intervened, asking that the court excuse the jury \u201cbefore the verdict is accepted.\u201d In the absence of the jury, during the following interaction among both counsel and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>court, the court in response to the defendant\u2019s own motion expressed its intention to \u201cset aside the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion to have the verdict set aside arose under \u00a7 255 of the Practice Book, which provides, in part: <em>\u201cAfter the acceptance of a verdict </em>... a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By interrupting the established procedure for acceptance of the verdict, the defendant effectively waived compliance with that procedure. By setting aside the verdict, the court impliedly accepted the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty, and this acceptance became final upon his subsequent announcement of his action to the jurors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The procedure followed, while not in compliance with the preferred, established form commonly adhered to, provided adequate safeguards to ensure a common understanding of the verdict: the verdict was rendered in open court by the foreman in the presence of the entire jury, the court, and counsel. Further, the defendant makes no claim that the jury did not assent to the verdict as announced by their foreman, and adequate opportunity was afforded the jury to clarify any misunderstanding. Under these circumstances it cannot be said that a valid jury verdict of guilty, subsequently set aside by the court, does not exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Since a valid verdict exists, no double jeopardy bar rises to preclude an appeal in this case. The state\u2019s appeal seeks a reversal of the court\u2019s action in setting aside the verdict. If error is found, no further fact finding, no additional trial, would be necessary, for the jury verdict would simply be reinstated. In a recent opinion, the United States Supreme Court stated: \u201cWhen a case has been tried to a jury, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit an appeal by the Government providing that a retrial would not be required in the event the Government is successful in its appeal. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>. . . [420 U.S. 332, 344-45, 352-53, 95 S. Ct. 1013, 43 L. Ed. 2d 232]. <em>When this principle is applied to the situation where the jury returns a verdict of guilt but the trial court thereafter enters a judgment of acquittal, an appeal is permitted. </em>In that situation a conclusion by an appellate court that the judgment of acquittal was improper does not require a criminal defendant to submit to a second trial; the error can be corrected on remand by the entry of a judgment on the verdict. To be sure, the defendant would prefer that the Government not be permitted to appeal or that the judgment of conviction not be entered, but this interest of the defendant is not one that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to protect.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>420 U.S. 358, 365, 95 S. Ct. 1006, 43 L. Ed. 2d 250. The principle enunciated in that case is clearly applicable to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The defendant claims that his discharge from custody and release from bond by the court, directly after the verdict was set aside, terminated the court\u2019s in personam jurisdiction, rendering the subsequent rehearings on July 22 and August 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>improper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In those cases in which the state, at the time judgment is rendered, expresses an intention to seek an appeal<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant is not entitled to discharge until the state\u2019s motion to appeal is finally determined. \u201cIt is necessary that he [the prosecutor] determine at the time of the judgment that he ought to ask the court for permission to take such appeal, so that the accused shall not be forthwith discharged; to that he is entitled <em>unless the prosecutor shall move for such permission. </em>If permission be granted, he will not be entitled to discharge until the appeal has been determined in his favor, or withdrawn.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carabetta, </em>106 Conn. 114, 119, 137 A. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">It is clear from the transcript that on July 20, 1977, when judgment was rendered setting aside the jury verdict, the state immediately expressed its intention to seek permission to appeal. Unless the court clearly denied the state permission to appeal at that time, the defendant was not then entitled to discharge. No such clear denial is apparent. Indeed, the July 20 transcript reveals that the court,, having stated in response to the state\u2019s motion to appeal, \u201cI will rule on that at the proper time,\u201d failed subsequently to respond to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s direct inquiry as to whether permission had been denied. Recognizing the ambiguity which appears on the face of this transcript as to the status of the state\u2019s appeal, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>called for a full hearing on the state\u2019s motion on July 22. Both counsel argued the motion and it was, finally, denied on that day, the court indicating, \u201cI have given a great deal of thought to allowing you to appeal this case.\u201d Clearly, had the court already denied the state\u2019s motion to appeal, no further consideration would have been necessary. Because no final decision as to the appeal was made on July 20, any discharge granted on that day was ineffective because the defendant was not then entitled to full discharge. The court itself, in ordering a discharge and releasing the defendant from bond, did not intend to release the defendant from the court\u2019s in personam jurisdiction, for, upon the state\u2019s exception, the court assured counsel, \u201cThere is no fear that he [the defendant] is going to flee the jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is therefore evident that the court retained in personam jurisdiction over the defendant until the state\u2019s motion to appeal was finally acted upon by the court on July 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-96 provides: \u201cAppeals from the rulings and decisions of the superior court, upon all questions of law arising on the trial of criminal cases, may he taken by the state, with the permission of the presiding judge, to the supreme court. . . .\u201d The original version of this statute, enacted in 1886, clearly indicates an intention by the legislature to extend the right of appeal in criminal cases to the state. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>65 Conn. 265, 278. 30 A. 1110. The provision that permission from the trial judge he obtained was a limitation on the right of appeal granted the state. This condition is generally considered to be a prerequisite to appeal by the state. <em>State </em>v. <em>Audet, </em>170 Conn. 337, 340-42, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>365 A.2d 1082. However, as the dominant intention of the legislature was to extend the right of appeal to the state, the limitation placed upon that right is one which must be so exercised as to avoid abuse and unreasonable consequences. <em>Tileston </em>v. <em>Ullman, </em>129 Conn. 84, 94, 26 A.2d 582; <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>126 Conn. 412, 11 A.2d 856; <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>106 Conn. 200, 203, 137 A. 749; 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statutes, \u00a7 265. The court\u2019s granting or denial of the state\u2019s motion to appeal constitutes a \u201cjudicial determination\u201d within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carabetta, </em>supra, 118. Ordinarily, this court will not review rulings made in the exercise of a court\u2019s discretion. Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 59. In those cases of manifest abuse, however, where injustice appears to have been done, this court will grant review to determine whether the court\u2019s exercise is \u201cso unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>98 Conn. 374, 382, 119 A. 341; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>169 Conn. 692, 702, 364 A.2d 186. Section 54-96 does not, therefore, preclude an appeal by the state seeking review of the court\u2019s denial of permission to appeal in those unusual cases in which the state has properly and expeditiously expressed its intention to seek appeal at the time of judgment and the court\u2019s denial was so arbitrary as to constitute an extreme abuse of discretion rendering the denial ineffective. In such cases the statute\u2019s condition requiring the court\u2019s permission to appeal cannot serve to insulate a trial court from review by this court; rather, the statute as a whole remains operative to allow appeal by the state. A proviso should be \u201cso interpreted as not to destroy the remedial processes intended to be accomplished by the enactment.\u201d <em>Shilkret </em>v. <em>Musicraft Records, Inc. </em>131 F.2d 929, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>931 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 319 U.S. 742, 63 S. Ct. 1030, 87 L. Ed. 1699; see also 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statutes, \u00a7 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In the present case, just such a clear and extreme abuse of discretion is evident. In denying the state permission to appeal on July 22, 1977, the court, speaking to the state\u2019s attorney, commented, \u201cI have given a great deal of thought to allowing you to appeal this case and I have no reason to not allow you to do it.\u201d Setting aside a verdict rendered by a jury is an extremely serious matter. See <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>160 Conn. 10, 13, 273 A.2d 714. To deny permission to appeal such a ruling cannot be so arbitrarily done. Because it is clear, by the court\u2019s own admission, that there was no considered reason for denying the state the opportunity to appeal, its action is arbitrary and an abuse of its discretion, rendering the refusal invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In those cases in which an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done, reversal is required. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra. Ordinarily, when confronted with such a situation, this court would reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of permission to appeal; see <em>Husted </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>58 Conn. 55, 69, 19 A. 233; remanding the case to the trial court with directions. In this case, we would direct the trial court to enter an order granting the state permission to appeal. In light of both the trial court\u2019s expression of its intention to grant the appeal,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the fact that our directions would, in any case, be binding upon the court below; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 345; we find a remand to be unwarranted. As this court in <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Rocke</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>feller, 134 Conn. 585, 589, 59 A.2d 524, noted, \u201c[t]o return the case to the trial court . . . would necessarily bring about the same result as would come from our determination of the matter now; it would be a useless procedure, for the final result would not be changed.\u201d We therefore find that the state is within its rights in pursuing this appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">On the basis of the foregoing, it is determined that this court has jurisdiction over this appeal, within the meaning of \u00a7 54-96. The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-13\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 54-96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-6\"> None of the eases which affirms the procedure outlined in <em>State </em>v. <em>DiPietro, </em>120 Conn. <em>537, 181 A. 716, </em>requires rigid adherence to it; it is, rather, a practice referred to as \u201capproved procedures in receiving the verdict\u201d; <em>Tough </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 274, 278, 294 A.2d 67; or, \u201c[t]he procedure which has been followed in our courts for many years.\u201d <em>Perris </em>v. <em>Hotel Pick Arms, Inc., </em>147 Conn. 72, 74, 157 A.2d 106. As the court in <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>18 Conn. 81, 90, stressed, \u201c[a] 11 that is required is, that the verdict should be rendered in open court by the whole jury. The only convenient and proper form to do this, is that which is usually practiced in our superior and county courts; but it does not follow that there may not be other less convenient and less proper modes by which a verdict may be received.\u201d See also 4 Wharton, Criminal Procedure (12th Ed. 1976) \u00a7 <em>583.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\"> In order for a verdict to be set aside, a verdict must exist.
