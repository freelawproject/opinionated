Covell, a year and a half earlier. At that time Helen\u2019s mother had been disabled by her pregnancy from assisting her husband at his general store in Boumedale, and Helen, after school hours, was helping out. According to Helen, when the store closed Helen and Covell would sit together and watch television. On three or four occasions, Helen said, Covell fondled her breasts and put his hand down her pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">Upon a G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, report of October 14, 1993, the Department of Social Services (DSS) detailed a social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>worker as investigator to look into these allegations. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5IB. The investigator interviewed Helen and Helen\u2019s mother. The investigator also interviewed Covell. Covell denied the allegations and said that his occasional nonsexual embracing of Helen might have been exaggerated or misunderstood; he also suggested that his wife, with whom he was having difficulties, might have encouraged Helen\u2019s allegations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 19, 1993, the investigator supported the \u00a7 51A report, finding reasonable cause to believe that Helen had been sexually abused. Thereupon Covell was listed on the department\u2019s registry of alleged perpetrators, to remain for a period of seventy-five years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Notified of the investigator\u2019s finding on December 13, 1993, Covell requested administrative review. The administrative hearing occurred on March 17, 1994, see 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 10.06(8)-(9) (1993). It evidently consisted of direct and cross questioning of Covell; neither Helen nor her mother was present. The hearing officer in a report of May 13, 1994, ruled against Covell.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The report was received by Covell on May 16, 1994. In response he commenced an action in Superior Court, Barnstable County, seeking judicial review of the departmental decision under the Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. His complaint was \u201centered\u201d on the docket on June 17, 1994, and stamped \u201cFiled June 17, 1994.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As its answer, the department submitted the administrative record. The judge, upon consideration of the record, entered a judgment on findings by the court on June 1, 1995, holding that the allegations of wrongdoing were supported by substantial evidence. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e). Covell appealed to this court from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The allegations against Covell had been reported to the district attorney of Barnstable County pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51(B)(4). Trial in District Court on three counts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B) took place on July 27-28, 1995. Helen and her mother testified for the Commonwealth, Covell for the defense. The jury of six acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In his brief as appellant in this court, Covell referred to the acquittal. Reacting to this fact, counsel for DSS wrote to Coveil\u2019s counsel on April 30, 1996, \u201coffering, on behalf of the agency, to reopen the administrative hearing so that your client may present evidence regarding his acquittal.\u201d Following is the relevant passage of the letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">\u201cMy main purpose in calling, however, was to discuss the representation in your brief that Mr. Covell was acquitted of the criminal charges after a trial at which the child testified. As a practitioner with many years of experience, you must know that that information, which was not presented to the agency at the administrative hearing (or to the superior court), is hot properly put before the Appeals Court in your brief. At the same time, as a lawyer with much experience in the Appeals Court, I know the information will be of interest to the Court and vety well may motivate the panel to remand the case to the agency for consideration of additional evidence regarding the acquittal. See, e.g. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(6). Accordingly, I am offering, on behalf of the agency, to reopen the administrative hearing so that your client may present evidence regarding his acquittal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Counsel for DSS added that meantime she was requesting an enlargement of time to file her brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Rather surprisingly, counsel for DSS a month later, on May 30, 1996, moved in this court to dismiss the appeal on jurisdictional grounds and stated that DSS would not file a brief on the merits. Apparently someone in DSS had been counting days. If one accepts that the Superior Court action was \u201ccommenced\u201d by \u201cfiling such complaint . . . with such clerk\u201d on June 17, then thirty-two days had passed after Cov-ell\u2019s receipt of the final decision of the department, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>exceeded by two days the thirty days prescribed for starting such an action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">On August 26, 1996, Coveil\u2019s counsel wrote to DSS counsel \u201cprior to filing in Court\u201d (i.e., before filing his motion in this court to remand to the department under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14[6]), asking that the department \u201creopen its Administrative Hearing so that Mr. Covell may present this additional evidence [the acquittal] to the Department.\u201d The response of DSS counsel, September 12, 1996, was far from counsel\u2019s sunny earlier offer to reopen the administrative hearing. Counsel said the Superior Court had acted without \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d so there was no valid c. 30A, \u00a7 14, proceeding pending and the department could not accept additional evidence under \u00a7 14(6). But, said counsel, if the department were in a position to evaluate the information, \u201cthe \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 standard employed in a criminal proceeding far exceeds the \u2018reasonable cause to believe\u2019 standard employed by the agency.\u201d Subjoined was a gratuitous statement expounding the values of the registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Thus rebuffed, Covell on October 22, 1996, filed in this court an opposition to DSS\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal and a motion under \u00a7 14(6) to remand the matter to the department to receive additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">1. <em>On the motion to dismiss the appeal in this court. </em>Although Covell may not agree,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we accept that the Superior Court action came two days late. DSS says the slip left the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Superior Court without \u201csubject matter jurisdiction,\u201d and this rendered nugatory all that followed including the judge\u2019s decision and the appeal therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">There was no failure of \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d if that term is used with its basic and well recognized signification, as reflected in Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 11 (1982): <em>\u201cSubject Matter Jurisdiction. A </em>judgment may properly be rendered against a party only if the court has authority to adjudicate the type of controversy involved in the action.\u201d The first Restatement illustrated such lack of authority in a homely way: \u201c[A] judgment rendered by a justice of the peace is void if under the law of the State such justices are not empowered to deal with the subject matter of the action; as, for example, where the action is one for tort and justices of the peace are given no power except in actions of contract.\u201d Restatement of Judgments \u00a7 7 comment b (1942). Our case of an untimely complaint in a type of action committed to the Superior Court does not conform to the \u00a7 11 model.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">This, however, does not take us to the end of the fine, for courts might choose to visit the dire consequences that attach to lack of subject matter jurisdiction upon situations distant from the model. Have our courts meant to do so in the present situation of late filing?</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The following speaks for an affirmative answer. The cases assert with emphasis that compliance with the time provision at bar is important for the health of the system: the \u201cattempted institution of an appeal seeking judicial review of an administrative decision after expiration of the period limited by statute or rule\u201d has been cited as \u201c[a] prime example\u201d of \u201csome errors or omissions . . . seen on their face to be so repugnant to the procedural scheme ... as to call for dismissal of the appeal.\u201d <em>Schulte </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>369 Mass. 74, 79 (1975). .</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">So also there are repeated statements in the books that commencing the c. 30A, \u00a7 14, action on time is a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d requirement. See <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>414 Mass. 663, 666 (1993); <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 668, 669 (1984); <em>Wolbach </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 302, 308 (1985); <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport </em>v. <em>DeCarolis, </em>32 Mass. Ap. Ct. 348, 352 (1992); <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Bologna, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 615 n.7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>(1992), <em>S.C., </em>415 Mass. 20 (1993). On occasion the statement has been associated with a reference to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3), 365 Mass. 757 (1974).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Flynn, supra </em>at 670 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">On the other hand, there is reason to doubt that there is really a purpose absolutely to equate in consequences a delay in filing with an absence of authority in a court. What has come about is explained shortly thus: \u201cThere is a strong tendency in procedural law to treat various kinds of serious procedural errors as defects in subject matter jurisdiction. This is because characterizing a court\u2019s departure in exercising authority as \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 permits an objection to the departure to be taken belatedly. This, in turn, permits a serious blunder to be remedied despite tardy objection.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 11 comment e.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Considering this likely provenience of the invocation of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in cases having nothing to do with the authority of a court to adjudicate, we may find some ground for suggesting that the time bar herein should not be held absolute but should rather admit of rare, exceptional instances in which a c. 30A, \u00a7 14, complaint may survive a delayed filing. And the present case may possibly qualify as such an instance. DSS awoke to Covell\u2019s late commencement of the court action only after the judge had dealt with it and concluded it by judgment and after an appeal to this court was under way. It may be fairly said that DSS\u2019s delayed reaction matched or overmatched Covell\u2019s delay. Through dismissal of the appeal DSS would bar consideration of Covell\u2019s acquittal of the criminal charges which DSS had frankly and commendably invited for administrative consideration in a reopened hearing. A further special aspect: although the procedure starting with a \u00a7 51A report is classified nominally as civil, it verges toward the criminal, and especially so in regard to the registry. In criminal matters there is an understandable reluctance to abort defendants\u2019 recourse to remedies because of missteps in meeting prescriptions of time.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Happily, as we think, the question arising upon the motion to dismiss the appeal in this court need not be decided here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>and now.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An avenue is open to Coveil and DSS, free of the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d tangle, through which the administrative proceeding may be renewed and decision perhaps attained on the merits. This seems to us peculiarly appropriate to the occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">2. <em>A preferred route. </em>The case of <em>Aronson </em>v. <em>Brookline Rent Control Bd., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 700, 703-706 (1985), teaches that agencies have inherent power to reopen their concluded proceedings in compelling situations as justice may require. <em>Aronson </em>was a case where the agency acted to consider an allegation that a party had committed a fraud affecting the earlier agency decision, but <em>Aronson </em>acknowledges, as do later cases, that other kinds of claims might rightly impel an agency to allow reopening. See <em>Aronson </em>at 704 n.10; <em>Stowe, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 616; <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commn., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 149, 152 n.ll (1995). It is evident that the power to reopen should be exercised by an agency with due circumspection \u2014 \u201csparingly\u201d as the cases say. <em>Stowe </em>at 616; <em>Malone </em>at 152. So also applications for such relief can hardly be entertained without limit of time. Analogy to Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), has been proposed. See <em>Stowe </em>at 618. The particular basis for reopening in the present case appears to fit only category (6) of rule 60(b) which looks to a \u201creasonable\u201d time. The department may well accept that Coveil\u2019s letter of August 26, 1996, taken in the light of DSS\u2019s offer, was in effect an application for reopening, and that, all things considered, it came within a reasonable time. There is comfort in the thought that this approach would conform to DSS\u2019s own wish as expressed before it was transfixed by jurisdictional temptations.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">DSS referred latterly to a difference in burdens of proof as between an agency proceeding and a criminal prosecution. The difference does not necessarily foretell a negative result for Coveil upon reopening (DSS must have agreed with this proposition when it made the offer). Granting the difference, the department would still be interested in the circumstances and content of the criminal prosecution, including the fact, pressed by Covell, that it was the one occasion when the accusers faced the accused on the issue of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Finally, we have no opinion or ground for an opinion whether Covell deserves to have his name struck from the registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Action upon the appeal herein will be deferred to allow the department to deal as it may be advised with Covell\u2019s application to reopen the administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-14\"> Pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\"> The wife secured an order under G.

Compare <em>Standard Register Co. </em>v. <em>Bolton-Emerson, Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 570, 572 (1993).
