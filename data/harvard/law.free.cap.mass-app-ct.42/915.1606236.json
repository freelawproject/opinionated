See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). On the night in question, the victim, Steven Anderson, stole the defendant\u2019s gold necklace and ran away. The defendant gave chase. He asked Anderson to give back the necklace, but Anderson attacked him. The defendant fought back. He hit Anderson with his closed hands and kicked him in the head more than once for at least five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">When the police arrived at the scene, the defendant was straddling Anderson, who was unconscious and bleeding from his face. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>was also shaking and yelling at Anderson, whose blood was on his shoes, pant legs, and his right hand. Due to the considerable force of the blows, Anderson sustained a fracture to the bone around one of his eyes. His eye was set back three millimeters into its socket, and he experienced double vision.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b864-8\"><em>Daniel W. Rice </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b864-9\"><em>Alison M. Takacs, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Mayhem requires proof of specific intent to maim or disfigure another person. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 244, <em>S.C., </em>379 Mass. 190 (1979). Specific intent may be inferred from the nature of the injuries as well as evidence that \u201cthe injuries arose from a sustained or atrocious attack.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 214, 217 (1996) (a single blow with an ax handle was insufficient to infer intent). See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>322 Mass. 606, 618-619 (1948) (victim repeatedly slashed with a razor, and the defendant\u2019s initials burned into her skin); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 844, 845 (1980) (victim\u2019s face struck, and handfuls of dirt rubbed into her eyes); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamm, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 72, 80 (1984) (victim \u201cstomped\u201d in the head and face); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 391, 393-395 (1987) (repeated beating with a baseball bat); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lazarevich, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 147, 154-155 (1989) (abusive treatment over time).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Here, the evidence, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt. The jury could infer the defendant\u2019s intent to maim from his <em>prolonged </em>attack and the nature of Anderson\u2019s eye injuries. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamm, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lazarovich, supra. </em>Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cleary, supra </em>(where the defendant struck a <em>single </em>blow to the victim in anger \u201con the spur of the moment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
