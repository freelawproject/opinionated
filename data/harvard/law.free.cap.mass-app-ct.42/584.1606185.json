L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, to Robert Coggin. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Coggin had worked for the parole board since September, 1966, first as a parole officer and later as a supervisor of nine officers and 1,000 parolees. He suffered a heart attack on May 12, 1986, and was temporarily out of work. On September 4, 1987, shortly after returning to work, Coggin suffered another episode of chest pain. He has not worked since that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Coggin received temporary total incapacity benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, for the statutory maximum of 260 weeks and subsequently filed a claim for permanent and total benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A. Following a conference before an administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA), Coggin was awarded permanent and total incapacity benefits. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The employer appealed the award, and a de novo hearing was held pursuant to \u00a7 11 of c. 152.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The administrative judge subsequently issued a hearing decision, affirming his earlier award. The employer appealed to the reviewing board of the DIA, which summarily affirmed the decision of the administrative judge. A single justice of this court entered a judgment affirming the decision of the board. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Prior to his medical hearing, Coggin was examined by an impartial medical examiner (IME). pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), which provides for the appointment of an impartial physician when a workers\u2019 compensation claim involves a dispute over medical issues. Pursuant to the statute, the physician examines the employee and submits a report on the extent and permanence of his incapacity. <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 257 (1994). Here, the IME concluded, in part, that Coggin was not permanently and totally disabled from employment. Coggin filed a motion to submit additional medical testimony pursuant to \u00a7 11A(2), arguing that the report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>was \u201cinadequate\u201d because the IME had also expressed the opinion that his heart condition was not work related, an issue that was not contested by the employer. Goggin maintained that the IME\u2019s obvious misunderstanding of the proper scope of his examination and subsequent conclusion that Cog-gin\u2019s heart condition was not work related, were indicative of the over-all inadequacy of the report, and that the admission of additional medical evidence was therefore warranted under the statute. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The administrative judge granted Coggin\u2019s motion, and Charles Haffajee, Coggin\u2019s treating physician was deposed. Doctor Haffajee testified that Coggin was, indeed, \u201cdisabled for practical purposes for the rest of his functional life.\u201d The administrative judge subsequently issued a hearing decision, \u201cadopting the persuasive opinions of [Dr. Haffajee] relative to impairment and causal relationship\u201d and awarding Coggin total and permanent incapacity benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The employer first argues that the administrative judge improperly admitted the testimony of Dr. Haffajee pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, because the report of the impartial physician was adequate, and the medical issues under consideration were not complex.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We begin by noting that \u201c[t]he interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>primary responsibility for administering it is entitled to substantial deference.\u201d <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993). The party appealing an administrative decision bears the burden of demonstrating the decision\u2019s invalidity. <em>Merisme </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 470, 474 (1989). Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2), a decision of the DIA reviewing board is scrutinized in accordance with the standards expressed in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(a)-(d), <em>(f), </em>and (g).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Scheffer\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass, at 258. Moreover, where, as here, the reviewing board summarily affirms and adopts without change the findings and decision of an administrative judge, a reviewing court \u201cmust look to that decision to determine whether the action of the board [was] correct.\u201d <em>Nowak\u2019s Case, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 498, 499 (1974). See <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 679-680 (1970); <em>McElroy\u2019s Case, </em>397 Mass. 743, 745 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">We review the single justice\u2019s order \u201cin the same manner as if the single justice were a lower court.\u201d Appeals Court Rule 2:04 (1990). Because this court is conducting \u201can analysis of the same agency record . . . there is no reason why the view of the [single justice] should be given any special weight.\u201d <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational Sch. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>377 Mass. 897, 903 (1979). The question we must consider, therefore, is whether the administrative judge abused his discretion, committed an error of law or \u201cotherwise [failed] the test [set out in] G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2),\u201d in admitting the deposition of Coggin\u2019s treating physician pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A. <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In addition to requiring that an IME be appointed in certain workers\u2019 compensation cases, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, also provides that the administrative judge may \u201cauthorize the submission of additional medical testimony when such judge finds that said testimony is required due to the complexity of the medical issues involved or the inadequacy of the report submitted by the impartial examiner.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 30. Here, the administrative judge concluded that additional medical evidence was warranted due to the inadequacy of the IME\u2019s report. Specifically, the administrative judge concluded that \u201c[g]iven the complexity of the issues involved and the standards applied, the subject report for purposes of section 11A of the Act is found inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">While the reasons underlying the administrative judge\u2019s finding of inadequacy may not be entirely clear from reading the endorsement, our review of the record leads us to conclude that there was no abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The single justice adequately dealt with the employer\u2019s arguments to the contrary and there is no reason for us to repeat his analysis here. We note briefly, however, that we agree with the single justice\u2019s conclusion that the administrative judge properly determined that the IME\u2019s report was inadequate due to the possibility that it was tainted by his misunderstanding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>proper scope and purpose of his examination. See <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass, at 259 (IME\u2019s opinion not afforded status of prima facie evidence where it was based on inaccurate assumptions). We add that the importance of affording a workers\u2019 compensation claimant the opportunity fairly to present the medical issues he considers favorable to his claim, see <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 16, 22 (1996), further supports our concluson that the administrative judge acted properly in admitting the deposition testimony of Dr. Haffajee. \u201c[I]f the judge performs [his] function correctly [under \u00a7 11A(2)] the parties will be granted the [opportunity to present additional medical testimony] where this . . . testimony would serve some legitimate function.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The employer next argues that the administrative judge erroneously accepted Dr. Haffajee\u2019s conclusion that Coggin was permanently and totally disabled, completely ignoring the IME\u2019s opinion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, provides that the impartial physician\u2019s report \u201cshall constitute prima facie evidence of the matters contained therein.\u201d \u201cPrima facie evidence, in the absence of contradictory evidence, requires a finding that the evidence is true.\u201d <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>373 Mass. 813, 817 (1977). See <em>Thornes </em>v. <em>Meyer Store, Inc., </em>268 Mass. 587, 588 (1929). Nothing in \u00a7 11 A, however, requires the administrative judge to adopt the conclusions of the report or precludes him from considering additional medical evidence once it becomes part of the record. Indeed, \u201cprima facie evidence may be met and overcome by evidence sufficient to warrant a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 817. Once properly admitted, the probative value of medical testimony is to be weighed by the fact finder, in this case, the. administrative judge. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 634, 639 (1985). <em>Barbieri </em>v. <em>Johnson Equip., </em>8 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 90, 93 (1994). Thus, it is \u201cwithin the province of the [administrative judge] to accept the medical testimony of one expert and to discount that of another.\u201d <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass. 633, 636 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The record in this case included not only the IME report and the deposition testimony of Dr. Haffajee, but the deposition of Coggin\u2019s own psychologist, a report submitted by a psychiatrist who examined Coggin on behalf of the employer, and Coggin\u2019s own testimony regarding the limitations on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>daily activities. Moreover, the administrative judge also considered Coggin\u2019s age (he was 60 at the time of the de novo hearing before the administrative judge), educational background, and prior employment history in reaching his decision. There was no abuse of discretion. Moreover, the reviewing board\u2019s decision, which was based on the administrative judge\u2019s report, was not arbitrary or capricious, based on an error of law, or otherwise not in accordance with law. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-15\"> General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 12(2), provides that appeals from decisions of the Department of Industrial Accidents reviewing board shall be filed with the Appeals Court.

At that time, testimony was taken, and the matter was continued to allow time for the filing of a medical report prepared by an independent medical examiner appointed pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2). On June 10, 1993, the hearing was reconvened and the report admitted into the record.
