The motion judge found that the police officer reasonably was in apprehension of danger sufficient to make a pat frisk, but, based on the judge\u2019s own \u201cfeel\u201d of the wad of money taken from the defendant, concluded that the officer was not constitutionally permitted to examine what the defendant had concealed in his pants pocket. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-15\">The following facts were found by the motion judge. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>a robbery of a Malden supermarket by masked intruders, Officer James O\u2019Brien received a radio transmission that three suspects were heading toward Lodgen Court and that at least one of them was armed. Arriving at Lodgen Court in his cruiser, O\u2019Brien saw a man, subsequently identified as the defendant, walking in one direction and then in the other. Despite the mildness of the weather, he was sweating profusely, appeared nervous, and, when asked by O\u2019Brien what he was doing, gave an explanation which did not accord with the geography of the neighborhood. O\u2019Brien suspected that the defendant had participated in the robbery, and, seeing a bulge in the defendant\u2019s pants, was reasonably concerned for his own safety. Shrubbery prevented O\u2019Brien from seeing whether any other persons were on the street, he knew that at least three people had been involved in the robbery, and he knew that one of them had a weapon. O\u2019Brien was justified, the judge ruled, in making a <em>Terry </em>stop <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 [1968]) and in conducting a pat-frisk of the defendant. The defendant does not contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The additional inquiry required in stop and frisk cases, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. 367, 369, 371-372 (1996), is whether the scope of the search was within constitutional limits. While patting down the defendant, O\u2019Brien felt an object which he characterized as \u201chard.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He then inserted his thumb in the defendant\u2019s pocket, stretching it open to ascertain its contents. Recognizing the object to be a wad of bills, O\u2019Brien called for a backup and a witness to the robbery. After a representative from the store stated that the defendant had the same build as the robber and that the money taken was mostly ones and fives, O\u2019Brien concluded that the bills were the proceeds of the robbery and arrested the defendant. He then took the money out of the defendant\u2019s pocket and saw that it was a stack of 200 five-dollar bills, folded over.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">At the hearing on the motion to suppress, after O\u2019Brien, on cross-examination at defense counsel\u2019s request, was asked to put the wad of bills in the defendant\u2019s pocket, the judge, at counsel\u2019s request, also felt the money. In his written findings allowing the motion to suppress, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u201cIn the area of the right front pocket, O\u2019Brien ran his hand over the bulge. Although he characterized it as \u2018hard\u2019, I do not credit the testimony. I find that the bulge was not hard, and was in any event palpably not a weapon. In making this finding, I have in mind that at the request of counsel, the contents of Defendant\u2019s pocket at the time of the frisk were placed in the pocket of the clothes he was wearing during the hearing on this motion, and I was asked to run my hand over the outside of the pocket, the same way O\u2019Brien did. Although one could not tell exactly what the contents were, they were unmistakably softer than a pistol, revolver, knife, blackjack, or anything else that a reasonable person would believe to be a weapon or source of potential bodily harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The judge went on to conclude that \u201c[ojnce O\u2019Brien knew or reasonably should have known that he was feeling something other than a weapon, any justification for intrusion into the pocket ended.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>410 Mass. 611, 614-615 (1991). See 4 LaFave, Search &amp; Seizure \u00a7 9.5(c) (3d ed. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the judge erred because he based his finding on his own \u201cfrisk\u201d under circumstances which were distinguishable from the actual pat-down of the defendant conducted by the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The credibility of Officer O\u2019Brien is not at issue in this case. Although the judge stated that he did not \u201ccredit the testimony\u201d that the bulge when felt was \u201chard,\u201d a reading of the transcript of the hearing on the motion to suppress shows that the judge did not mean that he thought O\u2019Brien was not truthful. To the contrary, on two separate occasions the judge referred to O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony as truthful and went so far as to point out that \u201cOfficer O\u2019Brien was very, very candid, and I want to put that right on the record now, that is going to be part of my finding. He was a very candid, and honest, and truthful witness.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Having found the officer credible, the judge was not war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ranted in considering his own \u201cfeel\u201d of the wad of money in the defendant\u2019s pocket to counter the other evidence before him. Although there was no objection by the Commonwealth, we conclude that the judge should, on his own, have refused the defendant\u2019s request that he feel the bills. Cf. <em>Schaffner </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; N.W. Transp. Co., </em>129 Ill;. 2d 1, 29 (1989). The question to-be decided was whether the search for a weapon was reasonable in the circumstances confronting the officer in the field, <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S at 27, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>407 Mass. 147, 151 (1990), not those facing the judge in the tranquility of the courtroom. Wholly apart from the fact that the judge knew beforehand that the bulge was a bundle of bills, and apart from questions such as whether the defendant was standing in the same position, or whether the difference in his clothing and depth of his pockets caused the wad to rest against a different part of his body (bone or flesh) or whether the money had been separated (as stolen, it was in tight wads), two important considerations were absent from the judge\u2019s courtroom examination. First, to all the facts confronting him O\u2019Brien was entitled to apply his nineteen years of police experience, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass. 598, 601 (1992), and second, he \u201chad no more than a few seconds in which to assess the extent, if any, of the danger, and to ascertain the most effective and least intrusive means of protecting himself.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Summerlin, 393 </em>Mass. 127, 129-130 (1984), cert, denied, 469 U.S. 1193 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Not only were the conditions of the pat-down significantly different in the courtroom than in the field,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but, perhaps even more important, the use of the fact finder in a demonstration of evidence poses a serious problem. It \u201cmay have the effect of converting the participant into a witness for the party conducting the test.\u201d <em>Schaffner </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; N.W. Transp. Co., </em>129 Ill. 2d at 30. As pointed out in that case where a juror took part in a demonstration, \u201cThe juror may acquire knowledge that is not directly available to the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>jurors, <em>and opposing counsel is unable to cross-examine him on his experience. </em>These concerns militate against the involvement of jurors in evidentiary demonstrations.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Ibid. </em>We consider that permitting the judge to participate in a demonstration where he is the. fact finder, particularly where the question before him, such as hardness, involves subjective elements, is equally improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Without the inappropriate evidence from the judge\u2019s \u201cfeel,\u201d there was no evidence supporting the judge\u2019s conclusion that Officer O\u2019Brien knew or should reasonably have known that what he felt was not a weapon which could be used against him. We reach this conclusion because of the judge\u2019s statements as to the credibility of O\u2019Brien, and because of other evidence before the judge. O\u2019Brien described the money when he took it out as \u201crolled into a ball, folded in half.\u201d He consistently stated that the package was hard, that he thought it \u201ccould have been a weapon . . . something rolled or wrapped in something.\u201d Other evidence adduced at the hearing was consistent with a firm object. The money stolen from the supermarket included two packages each containing one hundred five dollar bills and each was one to one and one-half inches thick and was wrapped tightly by the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In considering the reasonableness of the search, the facts of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass, at 600-602, are instructive. After frisking the defendant in that case, the police withdrew from the defendant\u2019s pants a plastic bag containing a lump of white powder and six small paper folds. The defendant argued that the Commonwealth had failed to show that the officer believed the package he had felt was a weapon. The court held that the dangerous circumstances facing the officer, his police experience, and the need for taking \u201cswift measures to discover the true facts and neutralize the threat of harm if it materialized,\u201d <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 30, permitted the police to find out what the defendant had concealed inside his pants. \u201cIn these circumstances it was not necessary for the judge to have specifically found that the officer believed that the bulge inside the defendant\u2019s pants was a weapon.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass, at 601. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>407 Mass, at 152, where the Supreme Judicial Court rejected the finding of the motion judge that at the time of the search the danger had ceased, saying, \u201cThe trooper [was] not required to gamble with [his] personal safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Having determined that without the evidence occasioned by the judge\u2019s participation the ultimate finding cannot stand, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bookman, </em>386 Mass. 657, 661, n.6 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thinh Van Cao, </em>419 Mass. 383, 384, cert, denied, 515 U.S. 1146 (1995), we conclude that the evidence should not have been suppressed. The order suppressing the evidence is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\"> O\u2019Brien stated that he did not know what the object was. Its \u201ccontour or mass [did not make] its identity immediately apparent\u201d so as to justify its seizure as contraband. <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 375 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\"> In his written findings, the judge stated, \u201cOne cannot overemphasize that O\u2019Brien\u2019s good faith is not in issue .... The record does not permit the slightest doubt that throughout the episode he acted honestly and fairly toward Defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b111-6\"> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 472, 476 (1995), where this court rejected a finding by the judge based on her own observation of a building for which a search warrant had issued and pointed to the different circumstances of the officers\u2019 observation. Had the police ascertained the exact entrance to the apartment by going to the premises before applying for the warrant, they might have risked disclosure of their surveillance and jeopardized the investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
