L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11 (count VIII).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In answer to special questions, a Superior Court jury found, among other things, that the plaintiff performed its obligations under the lease agreement, that the defendant repudiated its obligations thereunder, and that the plaintiff sustained damages of $175,000. Having reserved the c. 93A claim, the trial judge made findings for the defendant. Subsequently, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both parties have appealed. We affirm the judgment notwithstanding the verdict, although not on the grounds relied upon by the judge. See <em>Ezekial </em>v. <em>Jones Motor Co., </em>374 Mass. 382, 390 (1978); <em>Service Publications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Goverman, </em>396 Mass. 567, 572 (1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We also affirm the judgment on the c. 93A count.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">In reviewing the propriety of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we consider facts in the record in the light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>favorable to the plaintiff and to the verdict which it obtained. See <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Norwood Country Club, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 126, 127 (1996). From 1978 to 1982, the defendant operated a function hall business for its union membership under the name of King\u2019s Hill, located at 120 Bay State Drive in Braintree (the \u201cpremises\u201d). The primary source of revenue for the business was the sale of alcoholic beverages, which was conducted pursuant to a club license which the defendant had obtained pursuant to G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1982, the defendant offered two employees, Janet Donahue, a cocktail waitress, and Edward Hastings, a bartender, the opportunity to take over the business. Pursuant to a preliminary agreement with the defendant in August, 1982, Donahue and Hastings assumed full control of the business on a trial basis, ostensibly operating pursuant to the defendant\u2019s club liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Donahue and Hastings incorporated the plaintiff for the purpose of running the business. In April, 1983, the plaintiff, as lessee, and the defendant, as lessor, entered into a fully negotiated written agreement concerning the premises for a term of seven years, beginning April 1, 1983. Pursuant to the agreement, the rent was $48,000 per year and the plaintiff agreed to pay the defendant five percent of all gross liquor receipts on sales in excess of $200,000 per year. The defendant also agreed to sell to the plaintiff for $70,000 \u201cthe trade furnishings and fixtures associated with King\u2019s Hill\u201d as set forth in an attached schedule, and the parties agreed that the plaintiff would have exclusive use of the \u201cKing\u2019s Hill\u201d name.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>The agreement also contained a severability clause and a \u201crenewal provision,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">37. <em>RENEWAL NEGOTIATIONS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Both parties agree to discuss renewal of this Lease at the end of five (5) years. If either party does not intend to renew this Lease, then that party shall give two (2) years written notice of its intention to the other. If the parties decide not to renew the Lease, then at the conclusion of the Lease, the LESSEE will be reimbursed for the enhanced value of King\u2019s Hill, including investment and goodwill, based upon a formula acceptable to both parties. If the parties cannot agree on a mutually acceptable formula, then a third party, acceptable to both . . . [parties], will determine the formula and enhanced value of King\u2019s Hill. That formula will be binding on both parties.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The plaintiff operated the King\u2019s Hill business from April, 1983, through December, 1990.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> During that period, the gross sales of the business increased from approximately $200,000 to a high of $640,000 in 1988, ending at. $528,000 in 1990. The plaintiff applied for a public liquor license which the town of Braintree denied in June, 1983. The plaintiff\u2019s principals were told by the defendant\u2019s principal, Donald Wightman, that he had checked with the defendant\u2019s attorneys and that the plaintiff could continue to use the defendant\u2019s club license, which the plaintiff did.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In 1988, the parties commenced negotiations for renewal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>the lease. These negotiations continued until 1990 and were ultimately unsuccessful. In August, 1990, the plaintiff requested reimbursement of $250,000 under the renewal provision. The defendant did not respond orally or in writing with a counterproposal, in part because Wightman felt that the plaintiff\u2019s request was outrageous and because he thought that the lease agreement had lapsed. The defendant did not make a determination in 1990 of the value of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The plaintiff continued to occupy the leased premises and run the business until December, 1990. By letter to the ABCC dated December 17, 1990, counsel for the plaintiff requested that the ABCC schedule a hearing concerning the defendant\u2019s club license \u201cto allow . . . [the plaintiff] to present serious concerns about the ability of . . . [the defendant] to operate under said license given its pattern of alleged deception before the ABCC and with my client.\u201d As grounds therefor, plaintiff\u2019s counsel referred to the backdating of the management agreement and the defendant\u2019s failure to reimburse the plaintiff under the renewal provision. The defendant then gave notice to the plaintiff that the defendant would not renew the lease agreement and that the lease agreement was terminated. This action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">At trial, each party offered the testimony of a certified public accountant on the issue of valuation. The plaintiff\u2019s expert witness testified that he interpreted \u201cenhanced value of King\u2019s Hill, including investment and goodwill,\u201d as used in the renewal provision, to mean the value of the business as of December 31, 1990, based upon the plaintiff\u2019s total investment and a calculation of goodwill. As the basis for his opinion, the witness included the plaintiff\u2019s original investment of $70,000, its additional investment of approximately $44,000 for fixed assets, and a calculation of goodwill of $45,690, concluding that the value of the business was $160,000. The defendant\u2019s expert witness focused upon cash flow and earnings (which showed that the plaintiff lost money during each year of its operation), goodwill, and the value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>other assets of the business. He gave his opinion that, as of December 31, 1990, the plaintiff\u2019s business had no value. In addition to the experts\u2019 testimony, the jury heard testimony from one of the plaintiff\u2019s principals, elicited by counsel for the defendant on recross-examination, that the plaintiff\u2019s business was worth approximately $90,000 more than plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion of $160,000 (i.e., $250,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In a charge conference, the judge indicated that he was going to instruct the jury that the term \u201cenhanced value\u201d meant \u201cthe value over and above such value as the business had . . . [when the] lease commenced.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected, asserting that \u201cenhanced value\u201d meant \u201cwhatever the increased value of the business was,\u201d i.e., the total value as enhanced or increased, and stating that she did not want the jury to get the impression that \u201cyou have to deduct out what the value was to begin with.\u201d The judge overruled the objection, essentially ruling that the agreement was unambiguous. Subsequently, in her closing argument, plaintiff\u2019s counsel urged an alternative theory of damages based upon the methodology, including gross sales, which the parties had used in establishing a value of the business prior to the lease. Consistent with the judge\u2019s ruling that \u201cenhanced value\u201d meant only the increase in value, plaintiff\u2019s counsel argued that the value of the business in 1990 was $250,000, that it had been worth $70,000 in 1982-1983, and thus that the jury could find that the increase in value was $180,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In answer to special questions, the jury found that the parties did not intend the management agreement to supersede their obligations under the lease, that the plaintiff performed its obligations under the lease, that the defendant repudiated its obligations under the lease, and that the plaintiff sustained damages of $175,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">On the c. 93A count, the judge found that the plaintiff\u2019s initial payment of $70,000 had not been made for \u201cthe business,\u201d but rather was solely for specific fixtures and furnishings as set forth in the lease agreement. The judge found that the plaintiff did not run the King\u2019s Hill business well, that the plaintiff chronically paid its rent and income and meals taxes late, and that it lost money in each year of the lease. The judge also found that the precipitating event for termination of the renewal negotiations was plaintiffs counsel\u2019s letter to the ABCC, and that prior thereto, the plaintiff never called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>upon the defendant to select a third party to determine the formula for \u201cenhanced value\u201d under the renewal provision. The judge found that the plaintiffs expert witness was not credible, credited the testimony of the defendant\u2019s expert witness to the effect that the business was insolvent, and found that the business had no enhanced value.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, the judge found that nothing that the defendant did rose to the level of a c. 93A violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the contract count, the judge concluded (1) that the renewal provision was unenforceable as an agreement to agree, (2) that it was too vague to enforce insofar as it called for payment of \u201cenhanced value,\u201d (3) that the plaintiff never invoked so much of the renewal provision as required the defendant to select a third party to value the business, and (4) that there was insufficient evidence that King\u2019s Hill had any \u201cenhanced value\u201d at the end of the lease, and thus no basis for the jury\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The plaintiff argues that the judge erred in allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. We address in turn each of the grounds relied upon by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">1. <em>Agreement to agree. </em>Relying upon <em>Rosenfield </em>v. <em>United States Trust Co., </em>290 Mass. 210, 216-217 (1935), the judge first concluded that the renewal provision constitutes an unenforceable agreement to agree. As grounds therefor, the judge asserted that the defendant had no obligation to accept any third party to determine a formula to calculate \u201cenhanced value\u201d under the renewal provision. While this may be so, we disagree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that this renders the agreement unenforceable. Pursuant to the renewal provision, the parties essentially had agreed that, in the event of a dispute, a neutral third party would determine the requisite formula, the only element having been left undetermined being the identity of a third party who was mutually agreeable to both parties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Compare <em>Cataldo </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, 20 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 731, 737-738 (1985). Contrast <em>Bell </em>v. <em>B. F. Goodrich </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Co., </em>359 Mass. 763 (1971); <em>Schwanbeck </em>v. <em>Federal-Mogul Corp., </em>412 Mass. 703, 705-707 (1992). We do not think this such an element of uncertainty so as to defeat the plaintiffs claim, particularly where it is evident that the parties otherwise intended to be bound, and commonly employed practices exist for selecting a neutral third party to determine value.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even were this not the case, however, we think it clear that the parties did not intend that the plaintiffs entitlement to reimbursement, if any, should be left entirely to the defendant\u2019s willingness to agree upon an impartial third party. See <em>Eno </em>v. <em>Prime Mfg. Co., </em>314 Mass. 686, 690 (1943). \u201cWe are not here concerned with the future enforcement of this agreement. What [the defendant] claims by [arguing that the agreement is unenforceable] is a right to avoid [its] obligation under the agreement after having accepted its benefits. The law recognizes no such right. To the contrary, \u2018[w]hen a contract has been executed on one side, the law will not permit the injustice of the other party retaining the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>without paying <em>unless compelled by some inexorable rule.\u2019 \u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> Coz Chem. Corp. </em>v. <em>Riley, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 564, 568 (1980), quoting from <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>210 Mass. 26, 30 (1911) (emphasis supplied). See <em>Cygan </em>v. <em>Megathlin, </em>326 Mass. 732, 735 (1951). While the parties may not have foreseen their extended negotiations pursuant to the renewal provision, it is altogether implausible that the parties contemplated that, after seven years, the defendant would be able to reacquire the King\u2019s Hill business for nothing because the parties at the time of contracting had not worked out a proper formula for a buy-back. Compare <em>Eno </em>v. <em>Prime Mfg. Co., supra </em>at 690-691.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">2. <em>Vagueness of \u201cenhanced value.\u201d </em>\u201cAll the essential terms of a contract must be sufficiently definite so that the nature and extent of the obligations of the parties can be ascertained. [Citation omitted.] However, a contract is not to be held unenforceable \u2018if, when applied to the transaction and construed in the light of the attending circumstances,\u2019 the meaning can be ascertained with reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Si-mons </em>v. <em>American Dry Ginger Ale Co., </em>335 Mass. 521, 523 (1957), quoting from <em>Cygan </em>v. <em>Megathlin, supra </em>at 734. \u201cEven if an aspect of an agreement is informal, obscure, difficult of satisfactoiy interpretation, and the subject of dispute by the parties as to its meaning, a court should \u2018[s]o far as reasonably practicable . . . give[ ] a construction which will make it a rational business instrument and will effectuate what appears to have been the intention of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Finn </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 372 (1987), quoting from <em>Bray </em>v. <em>Hickman, </em>263 Mass. 409, 412 (1928). Notwithstanding the parties\u2019 varying interpretations of the meaning of \u201cenhanced value,\u201d we think that \u201cthis is not a case where \u2018the promise given and relied on was so vague that it can be given no effect.\u2019 \u201d, <em>Simons </em>v. <em>American Dry Ginger Ale Co., supra </em>at 524. Compare <em>Delorafano </em>v. <em>Delafano, </em>333 Mass. 684, 687 (1956), where the court held that an agreement to increase wages if business should improve did not fail for indefiniteness. Cf. <em>Finn </em>v. <em>McNeil, supra </em>at 372-373 (interpretation of \u201ccapital improvements\u201d). The judge\u2019s reliance upon <em>Held </em>v. <em>Zam-parelli, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 957, 958 (1982), is misplaced. In that case, among other things, the parties did not agree to the purchase price, which was to be based upon \u201cone-fourth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the profits from the operation of the premises,\u201d and, unlike the case at bar, had not agreed that a third party was to determine how the profits were to be computed in the event that the parties disputed the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">3. <em>Failure to invoke renewal provision. </em>The judge also ruled that, even if the defendant had an obligation to negotiate and select a third party in good faith to determine the formula for valuing the business, the plaintiff never invoked this portion of the renewal provision and could not rely upon it. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">A material breach of contract by one party excuses the other party from performance as matter of law. <em>G.M. Abodeely Ins. Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 274, 278 (1996). Whether there is such a material breach is a question for the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 279. Here, the jury found that the plaintiff performed its obligations under the lease agreement and that the defendant repudiated its obligations. These findings, while not compelled, are supported by the evidence and are thus dispositive. Once the defendant indicated to the plaintiff that the defendant would not fulfil its obligations, the defendant was in default and the plaintiff was not obliged to go through the \u201cempty ceremony\u201d of selecting a third party to determine the formula for valuing the business. <em>Penta </em>v. <em>Concord Auto Auction, Inc., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 635, 641 (1987), quoting from <em>Schilling </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>328 Mass. 2, 5 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">4. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>In ruling that there was insufficient evidence that King\u2019s Hill had any \u201cenhanced value\u201d at the end of the lease, the judge focused upon the plaintiff\u2019s failure to introduce any evidence of the value of the business at the time the parties entered into the lease, concluding that \u201c[wjithout that evidence, there was no basis whatsoever for the jury to determine whether the value of the business had, in fact, been enhanced under any formula.\u201d We disagree with the judge\u2019s analysis in several respects.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">As a threshold matter, notwithstanding his ruling that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>term was too vague to enforce, the judge ruled that \u201cenhanced value\u201d was unambiguous. The interpretation of a written contract is a question of law, <em>Lexington Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>All Regions Chem. Labs, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 712, 713 (1995), \u201cexcept to the extent disputed facts bear upon such interpretation [,]\u201d <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Arthur D. Little Syss., Inc., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 108, 116 (1989), and the conclusion in a particular case turns largely on the particular language used when viewed against the background of other indicia of the parties\u2019 intent. <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Fordham, </em>420 Mass. 178, 190 (1995). The judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cenhanced value\u201d meant \u201cthe value over and above such value as the business had when the lease commenced\u201d is not compelled as matter of law. Here, there was ample extrinsic evidence, which the jury could have credited, that the parties contemplated that the defendant would reimburse the plaintiff for the plaintiff\u2019s entire investment, including its original investment of $70,000, and that the amount of reimbursement was to be the <em>total </em>value of the business as enhanced at the end of the lease term, rather than just the amount of the enhancement. This interpretation, which the plaintiff advanced below, is not inconsistent with the language of the renewal provision: \u201cthe Lessee will be reimbursed for the enhanced value of King\u2019s Hill, including investment and good will.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The defendant argues, however, that the plaintiff failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>preserve for appellate review the issue whether it was entitled to the return of its original $70,000 investment. We need not decide the point. The plaintiff does not press the argument on appeal and, in any event, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict apart from the plaintiff\u2019s $70,000 original investment. It is settled law that \u201c[a]n owner of real estate or personal property having adequate knowledge of his property may express an opinion as to its value.\u201d <em>Southwick </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authy., </em>339 Mass. 666, 668 (1959). See <em>Menici </em>v. <em>Orton Crane &amp; Shovel Co., </em>285 Mass. 499, 503-504 (1934), and cases cited; <em>CBI Partners Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Chatham, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 924 (1996). The same rule applies to corporate officers testifying as to corporate property. See <em>Winthrop Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Elroth Co., </em>331 Mass. 83, 85 (1954); <em>Blais-Porter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Simboli, </em>402 Mass. 269, 273 (1988); <em>CBI Partners Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Chatham, supra </em>at 925. Nothing of record suggests that Janet Donahue, as a principal of the plaintiff, lacked sufficient knowledge of or familiarity with the business so as to prevent her from giving her opinion of its value as elicited by defendant\u2019s counsel, and indeed, quite the contrary appears. Even were this not the case, however, the defendant did not move to strike Donahue\u2019s testimony as being without foundation. The evidence thus was probative, and the jury properly could have considered it. See <em>Pataskas </em>v. <em>Judeikis, </em>327 Mass. 258, 260 (1951); <em>Nancy P. </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amato, </em>401 Mass. 516, 524-525 (1988). See also Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 93 (6th ed. 1994). The jury\u2019s verdict fell within the range of the probative evidence offered by the parties and cannot be said to be without evidentiary foundation. See <em>Moriarty </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 155 n.3 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">5. <em>Illegality. </em>The defendant presses on appeal the additional argument that the plaintiffs contract claim is barred because the lease agreement was predicated upon an illegal transfer of the defendant\u2019s liquor license. The burden of establishing the illegality of the lease agreement is upon the defendant. <em>Town Planning &amp; Engr. Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Amesbury Specialty Co., </em>369 Mass. 737, 744 (1976). On the evidence at trial, we conclude that the defendant met its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Licenses to sell alcoholic beverages are a special privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>subject to public regulation and control, <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>334 Mass. 613, 619 (1956), for which States have especially wide latitude pursuant to the Twenty-First Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>368 Mass. 857, 861 (1975). The procedure for the issuance of licenses to sell alcoholic beverages is set out in G. L. c. 138. Licenses must be approved by both local licensing authorities and the ABCC. G. L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 67. See <em>Beacon Hill Civic Assn. </em>v. <em>Ristorante Toscano, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 318, 321 (1996). Section 23 of c. 138 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny license under this chapter held by an individual, partnership, or corporation may be transferred to any individual, partnership or corporation qualified to receive such a license in the first instance, if, in the opinion of the licensing authorities, such transfer is in the public interest.\u201d Section 2 of c. 138 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall . . . sell . . . alcoholic beverages or alcohol, except as authorized by this chapter[.] . . . Violation of any provision of this section shall be punished except as provided in section twenty-two [for unlawful transportation of alcoholic beverages] by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.\u201d The plaintiff does not seriously dispute that the parties\u2019 actions undertaken pursuant to the lease agreement at issue effectively resulted in an illegal transfer of the defendant\u2019s liquor license to the plaintiff in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u201c[A] transfer of a license occurs when there is a sale of a liquor business and the license is inseparable from the purchase price. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>196 Mass. 592, 595 (1907). A transfer of a business takes place when the person introduced to it runs the business for his own account.\u201d <em>Griffin\u2019s Brant Rock Package Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 768, 771 (1981). Both of these elements are present here. Although the lease agreement did not expressly identify any consideration paid for transfer of the defendant\u2019s club license, - the plaintiff has consistently maintained that it purchased the defendant\u2019s business \u2014 predominantly the sale of alcoholic beverages \u2014 and, indeed, part of the consideration paid under the agreement was a percentage of profits derived from gross sales of alcoholic beverages above a certain threshold. See <em>Fairview Auditorium Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>v. <em>Fairview Auditorium Club, Inc., </em>331 Mass. 594, 596 (1954). In seeking reimbursement for the \u201cenhanced value\u201d of the business under the renewal provision, the plaintiff advances a theoiy based largely upon an increase in the gross sales of liquor. In the present circumstances, we think the conclusion that there was a de facto transfer of the liquor license as part of the purchase of the business is compelled, and there is no dispute that the plaintiff operated the business for its own account.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s performance under the lease agreement called for illegal conduct.

See <em>Hawes Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Angell, </em>332 Mass. 190, 191-192 (1955). As such, we perceive no basis for concluding that the renewal provision is severable. Even though the renewal provision essentially provides for a buyout to restore the parties to a semblance of the status quo ante, its basis lies in the illegal performance. \u201c[A] promise <em>to </em>do anything as a compromise or satisfaction of an illegal bargain itself is illegal. . . . Were the rule otherwise, the parties could, by their private agreement, waive the illegality and evade the prohibition against the original contract.\u201d 5 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 12.2, at 672 (Lord 4th ed. 1993).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We think this element so permeates the parties\u2019 transaction as to be controlling, and that the plaintiff cannot establish its case without developing the illegality in the transaction.

Here, where the plaintiffs application for its own license was denied, the parties by their arrangement effectively substituted their own judgment for that of the local licensing authority. To permit ;he plaintiff to recover under its illegal arrangement would reward it for its illegal conduct and would contravene public policy by elevating the plaintiff\u2019s private interests over those of the public. Although we are cognizant of the \u201cheavy forfeiture\u201d our decision works upon the plaintiff, Corbin, <em>supra,</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that such a harsh result favors an undeserving and equally culpable defendant, we nonetheless conclude that the range of considerations weighs in favor of this result on grounds of the strong public policy favoring enforcement of our licensing laws regarding the selling of alcoholic beverages.

Having elected to reserve all aspects of the c. 93A claim, the judge was not bound by the jury\u2019s answers to special questions on the common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>contract claim. <em>Poly </em>v. <em>Moylan, </em>423 Mass. 141, 151 (1996). <em>Ravosa </em>v. <em>Zais, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 47, 54 (1996). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s groundless contention that the management agreement was controlling, on which point the judge agreed with the jury, the judge found that the defendant nonetheless continued to negotiate the issue of reimbursement under the lease agreement until the plaintiff challenged the defendant\u2019s operation of its license by letter to the ABCC. The judge also found that there was no \u201cenhanced value\u201d entitling the plaintiff to reimbursement in any event. These findings are supported by evidence which the judge properly could have credited and are not clearly erroneous. Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). See <em>Turnpike Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Newbury Group, Inc., </em>413 Mass, at 130-131. Notwithstanding the jury\u2019s contrary conclusion, we cannot rightly say that the judge erred in finding that the defendant did not repudiate the renewal provision contained in the lease agreement, or in ruling that the plaintiff failed to establish its claim under c. 93A. The plaintiff does not argue that other findings by the judge on the c. 93A count were error, and thus we deem the issues waived.

In view of our decision, we need not reach the propriety of this ruling. But see note 18, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b195-11\"> Where, as here, a judge allows both a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and conditionally allows a motion for a new trial, the party who obtained the favorable verdict may appeal both the judge\u2019s actions, as the latter is contingent upon appellate reversal of the judgment notwithstanding the verdict; the party whose motion for a new trial was conditionally allowed is not aggrieved for purposes of appeal unless and until the party who obtained the verdict accepts a remittitur, if any, or until final disposition after the new trial. See <em>Okongwu </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>396 Mass. 724, 728-729 &amp; n.7 (1986). Thus, the defendant\u2019s appeal from the order conditionally allowing its motion for new trial is premature, and must be dismissed. See, e.g., <em>DiCicco </em>v. <em>Berwick, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 312, 315 (1989). Although the defendant also purports to appeal the judge\u2019s failure to consider an additional ground for allowance of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, no appeal is necessary. We shall affirm the allowance of such a motion if any valid basis exists, even if the judge\u2019s decision was predicated upon incorrect grounds. <em>Ezekial </em>v. <em>Jones Motor Co., supra.
