As will be seen, after this curious journey, all we are left with is the uncomfortable sense that the ultimate result is not \u201cinconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d Mass.R.Civ.P. 61, 365 Mass. 829 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">After being discharged from his position as a quality control inspector with H.B. Smith Company, Inc. (Smith), the plaintiff, Robert C. Powers, filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) alleging age discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On February 3, 1994, the plaintiff, with the MCAD\u2019s assent, filed this action in Superior Court. In the complaint, the plaintiff, for the first time, named Mestek, Inc. (Mestek), as a defendant. Prior to trial, Mestek moved for summary judgment contending that, since it was not named in the MCAD complaint, the plaintiff\u2019s claim against it was barred. The motion judge agreed and entered judgment for Mestek.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">Returning a verdict on special questions, a Superior Court jury found the plaintiff was discharged \u201cby reason of age discrimination\u201d and awarded him $750,000 in damages. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>defendant then filed a motion for a new trial. The trial judge denied Smith\u2019s motion, but reduced the damage award to $350,000. Both parties appeal from the ensuing judgment. The defendant argues that: (a) it was error to allow the plaintiffs motion for relief from a default judgment; (b) the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination and the jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of the evidence; (c) certain evidence was improperly admitted or excluded; (d) the damages were excessive; and (e) the trial judge abused his discretion in denying its posttrial motions. The plaintiff, in turn, contends that the trial judge erred in denying his request for attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff also argues that summary judgment was improperly entered for Mestek.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury would have been warranted in finding the following facts. Smith is a manufacturer of boilers. The plaintiff began working for Smith in January, 1982, as a quality control inspector.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs duties included the processing of returned parts. When defective parts were returned, the plaintiff would check to see if they were still under warranty and then arrange for the parts to be returned to the vendors. The plaintiff also inspected parts purchased from vendors to ensure that they met company specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In 1986 or 1987, Smith opened a new plant approximately five miles away from its main facility and moved the assembly line for residential boilers to the new plant. Prior to that time, the assembly work had been performed at the main plant. Initially, the plaintiff assisted in monitoring the new assembly line, as Smith had not yet hired an inspector for the new facility. Marianne Fortier was later hired as quality control inspector for the new plant. The plaintiff, however, filled in for Fortier when she was on vacation, performing Fortier\u2019s duties with the exception of the \u201c100th boiler test.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff had not been trained to perform that test. The plaintiff also performed several quality control functions that Fortier had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Sometime prior to 1990, Smith began to experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>financial difficulty. In February, 1990, Mestek made a tender offer for approximately forty-eight percent of Smith\u2019s shares. Thereafter, a Mestek official, John Kaddaras, at the behest of .Smith\u2019s board of directors, conducted an analysis of Smith\u2019s organizational structure. The board had concluded that \u201cmajor restructuring\u201d was necessary in order for Smith to stay afloat. Another Mestek official (Walter Markowski) met with Smith employees, including the plaintiff. At that time, there were three inspectors in the quality control division: the plaintiff, Fortier, and Ray Deso. Markowski recommended that the number of quality control inspectors be reduced from three to one. Markowski conveyed his opinion to Kaddaras that Fortier possessed the most \u201ctechnical ability.\u201d A few days later, Kaddoras spoke with Donald F. Schmidt, the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor, who, when asked, opined that Fortier was the \u201cmost capable\u201d of the three. At the time of the layoffs, Schmidt and Fortier were romantically involved. Kadd-aras recommended that Fortier be retained, and the plaintiff and Deso were subsequently laid off.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">1. <em>Defendant\u2019s appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">a. <em>Rule 60(b) motion. </em>Before moving on to the other issues in this case, we pause briefly to dispose of Smith\u2019s claim that the judge abused his discretion in vacating the default judgment entered earlier against the plaintiff for failure to appear at a pretrial conference. See in this regard <em>Berube </em>v. <em>McKesson Wine &amp; Spirits Co., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 426, 433-434 (1979). Upon review of the record, we conclude that the judge, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), 365 Mass. 829 (1974), reasonably could have found extraordinary circumstances warranting relief from the judgment. See <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. 809, 814-815 (1983). See generally 11 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2864 (2d ed. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">b. <em>Age discrimination claim. </em>The alleged discriminatory act arises in the context of a reduction in force decision by the plaintiff\u2019s employer. In analyzing claims of discrimination brought under the Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute (G. L. c. 15 IB, \u00a7 4) we look to the familiar three-stage order of proof paradigm articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-804 (1973). See <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 134-136 &amp; n.5 (1976). In stage one, the plaintiff bears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>Tardanico </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 443, 447 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In stage two, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, in stage three, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer\u2019s articulated reason is not the true reason, but rather a pretext. <em>Ibid. </em>As \u201cMassachusetts is a pretext only jurisdiction\u201d <em>(Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 443 [1995]), if successful in stage three,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cthe plaintiff is entitled to recovery for illegal discrimination under G. L. c. 15 IB.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444-445.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Contrary to Smith\u2019s contention, our review of the record indicates that the plaintiff met his initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination. The plaintiff showed that: (1) he is a member of a class protected by G. L. c. 15 IB (he was over the age of 40); (2) he was qualified for the position of quality control inspector; (3) he was terminated; and (4) a similarly or less qualified younger person was retained.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Tardanico, supra </em>at 447 n.4; <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Co., 6 </em>F.3d 836, 842 (1st Cir. 1993). See also <em>Finney </em>v. <em>Madico, Inc., ante </em>46, 50 (1997). \u201cThe exact prima facie proof required can vary depending on the factual situation.\u201d <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Boston Financial Data Servs., Inc., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 137 (1994). See <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., supra </em>at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">It is uncontroverted that Smith articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its conduct. According to Smith, the plaintiff was laid off as a result of corporate restructuring. Based on Mestek\u2019s recommendations, Smith decided to reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the number of quality control inspectors from three to one. Smith stated that after comparing the qualifications and duties of Fortier and the plaintiff, it concluded that Fortier possessed better qualifications. See and compare <em>Finney </em>v. <em>Madico, Inc., supra </em>at 50-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Thus, the pivotal phase is stage three. On appeal, Smith maintains that there was no reasonable basis for the jury to conclude that its asserted reason was a pretext. We disagree. At trial, Smith emphasized the fact that the plaintiff was unable to perform the \u201c100th boiler test.\u201d However, Richard A. Lemelin, a former employee of Smith, testified that depending on the number of boilers produced, only one or two were tested a week and that each test took approximately one or two hours. Moreover, Lemelin indicated that the test was not that difficult to perform and that no outside training was required. It was Lemelin who trained Fortier to perform the test. In addition, Schmidt, the plaintiffs supervisor, indicated that the only job that the plaintiff had not performed was the \u201c100th boiler test,\u201d and that Fortier had not performed some of the plaintiffs duties. Moreover, given the romantic relationship between Schmidt and Fortier, a finder of fact would be entitled to discredit some or all of Schmidt\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In these circumstances, the juty reasonably could have concluded that Smith\u2019s asserted reason was a pretext,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u201cnot the real reason[] for the action.\u201d <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass, at 443, quoting from <em>Brunner </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engr. Corp., </em>413 Mass. 698, 700 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">c. <em>Evidentiary rulings. </em>At trial, the plaintiff, without objection, introduced in evidence two written evaluations of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>work performance. Later, Smith sought to introduce a written assessment of Fortier\u2019s work. The plaintiff objected, claiming that Fortier\u2019s evaluation was irrelevant. In its offer of proof, Smith argued that, since the qualifications of both the plaintiff and Fortier were at issue, the evaluations were relevant. The judge then asked the Smith representative whether he considered that evaluation in making his decision. He indicated that he had not. The judge then excluded the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">On appeal, Smith maintains that it was error for the judge to exclude the evaluation because (a) it was relevant, and (b) in its absence, the jury could not properly evaluate the defendant\u2019s decision to retain Fortier over the plaintiff. \u201cThe decision whether evidence is relevant remains within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Vinios, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 5, 8 (1995). \u201cA trial judge will not be reversed on review except for palpable error.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, given that the defendant appears to have conceded that the evaluation played no role in its decision, we find no abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, even if the evaluations were relevant, we discern no prejudice to Smith\u2019s case, as evidence of the quality of Fortier\u2019s work was introduced during Schmidt\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Pina </em>v. <em>McGill Dev. Corp., </em>388 Mass. 159, 164 (1983) (no prejudice found where excluded evidence was merely cumulative of other evidence pointing to the same fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The defendant further argues that the judge erred in failing to admit in evidence two disciplinary letters concerning the plaintiff. The record indicates, however, that the judge\u2019s ruling was not final. The judge clearly indicated that he would admit at least one of the letters if Smith could demonstrate that it had relied on the letter in making its determination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Smith did not mention the matter again during the course of the trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cSuch an omission fatally \u2018dispose[s] of [an] exception to a ruling which expressly was not final and which related to the order of proof, a matter [well within] the discretion of the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Walter Kidde &amp; Co., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 902, 904 (1979), quoting from <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>330 Mass. 9, 12 (1953). Thus, the defendant cannot now contend that the letters were improperly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The defendant also argues that the judge erred in permitting evidence of a romantic relationship between Fortier and Schmidt. However, the defendant\u2019s argument with respect to this matter \u2014 consisting of five sentences \u2014 is inadequate, and provides us little assistance in evaluating the merits of the claim: The defendant fails to cite any authority in support of its contention and, taken all in all, the defendant\u2019s treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ment of the issue does not rise to the level of acceptable appellate argument within the meaning of Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">d. <em>Damages-Remittitur. </em>Smith claims that the damage award, despite the remittitur, is excessive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Compare <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. 813, 823-826 (1997); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Walent, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 83, 96 (1983). \u201cThe field of discretion of the trial judge in these matters is very broad. Only in rare instances can it be ruled that there has been an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Walent, supra </em>at 96-97. Smith first argues that to the extent the damages award represents compensation for front pay, they are excessive. Specifically, Smith contends that, since Fortier testified that she was laid off in 1992, the plaintiff is not entitled to compensation beyond that date. However, the precise circumstances attending Fortier\u2019s termination are not clear from the record. What is clear is that the plaintiff had intended to work for Smith until age sixty-five. Therefore, even if Smith\u2019s assertion is correct, absent a showing that the plaintiff would not have been able to transfer to another position (or branch of the company), there is no basis for disturbing the judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Contrary to Smith\u2019s contention, there was sufficient evidence of emotional distress. The plaintiff, who at that time was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), testified that he attended more AA meetings as a result of his layoff. Although he did not seek independent counseling as a result of his termination, the plaintiff indicated that he availed himself of the counseling services provided by A A. \u201c[I]n c. 15 IB cases an award of emotional distress damages can be sustained even in the absence of . . . psychiatric consultation\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Labonte </em>v. <em>Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, </em>424 Mass. at 824. We conclude there is not sufficient record support to find an abuse of discretion. See <em>Bartley </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>317 Mass. 35, 43-44 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>e. <em>Posttrial motions. </em>With regard to the defendant\u2019s several posttrial motions we are obliged at the outset to point out that the defendant\u2019s failure to renew its motion for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence is a critical misstep. See, e.g., <em>Martin y. Hall,369 </em>Mass. 884-885 (1976). But see Mass.R.Civ.P. 61, 365 Mass. 829 (1974). We address each motion in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">As grounds for a motion for a new trial, Smith attacks, among other things, the plaintiffs prima facie case, the damages award, and the weight of the evidence. The standard that a trial judge is to apply on a motion for a new trial in a civil case is too well known to be restated. See, e.g., <em>W. Oliver Tripp Co. </em>v. <em>American Hoechst Corp., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 748 (1993), and cases cited therein. See also <em>Bartley </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>317 Mass, at 42. In light of the above discussion, we do not think the judge abused his discretion in denying Smith\u2019s motion for a new trial. In addition, the judge stated in his memorandum and order denying the motion that \u201cthere were inconsistencies in some of the evidence\u201d rebutting the plaintiffs prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">As to the defendant\u2019s claim that the damages were excessive, as has already been mentioned above, the judge, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 59(a), 365 Mass. 827 (1974), ordered, we think properly so, that $400,000 of the verdict be remitted. Compare <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Walent, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. at 96. We likewise reject Smith\u2019s collateral contention that the excessive nature of the verdict demonstrates that it was the result of juror prejudice or bias. Smith\u2019s argument consists entirely of conjecture and is not supported by the record.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The judge did not abuse his discretion or commit an error of law by denying Smith\u2019s Mass.R.Civ.P. 50(b), 365 Mass. 814 (1974), motion for judgment n.o.v., for the reason, if no other, that Smith failed to renew its motion for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence. See <em>Michnik-Zilberman </em>v. <em>Gordon\u2019s Liquor, Inc., </em>390 Mass. 6, 9 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">2. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>a. <em>Summary judgment. </em>The plaintiff contends that the motion judge erred in allowing Mestek\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The motion judge concluded that, since the plaintiff did not name Mestek in his MCAD complaint, his claim against Mestek was barred. There was no error. \u201cResort to judicial process is not available to a party claiming age discrimination . . . unless that party has first lodged a complaint of unlawful discrimination with the MCAD within six months of the occurrence of the discriminatory event.\u201d <em>Tar-danico </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 444. See <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 580, 583 (1994). At the time the plaintiff filed his complaint with the MCAD, he was aware of Mestek\u2019s involvement in his layoff. The plaintiff could have moved to amend his MCAD complaint, but failed to do so. Thus, we conclude that Mestek was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">b. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>We agree with the plaintiff that he is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. In denying the plaintiff\u2019s request, the trial judge reasoned that, since a contingency agreement existed between the plaintiff and his attorney, the plaintiff was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. However, we find no such limitation in the statute. General Laws c. 15 IB, \u00a7 9, as inserted by St. 1974, c. 478, in pertinent part, provides that \u201c[i]f the court finds for the petitioner it <em>shall . . . </em>award the petitioner reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust\u201d (emphasis supplied). Since the trial judge did not indicate that the award of attorney\u2019s fees, in the circumstances, would be unjust, we conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. Cf. <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 324 (1993). We, however, believe that based on the. complexity of the case and on our evaluation of counsel\u2019s over-all performance, particularly the time reasonably spent on this case, the award should be modest in comparison to the $14,430 requested. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for the purpose of awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff in accordance with this opinion. The judgment is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-14\"> The plaintiff did not pursue a claim under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\"> Prior to that time, the plaintiff worked in a quality control department for another company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b691-9\"> This test was performed on every hundredth boiler coming off the assembly line to ensure that it was made to specification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b693-8\"> In <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502 (1993), the United States Supreme Court adopted for use in the Federal courts the \u201cpretext plus\u201d third stage order of proof.

The retained employee is female and also over forty years of age. (At the time of the trial, Powers was 65, and Fortier was 52.) The question whether there is a hierarchy or priorities within or between protected categories was not raised at trial, and we thus have no occasion to address it. Nor was it argued at trial that if Fortier had been terminated, she might have had a valid claim of employment discrimination based on gender, one arguably stronger than the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> It is not disputed that prior to making his recommendation as to which employees should be retained, Kaddaras sought and received Schmidt\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\"> Smith argues that, since this is not a classic discharge case, but rather is a so-called \u201creduction-in-force firing\u201d case (see <em>Finney </em>v. <em>Madico, Inc., supra </em>at 50), the plaintiff was required to show that Smith failed to treat age neutrally in reducing its payroll. However, Smith did not raise this contention in its motion for a directed verdict. Nor did it object to the jury charge on this basis. See <em>Kinchla </em>v. <em>Welsh, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 373-374 (1979). To the contrary, Smith indicated that it was satisfied with the charge. Although Smith correctly points out that the plaintiff failed to introduce evidence of Fortier\u2019s age in its case in chief, this apparent oversight does not provide a basis for granting relief from the judgment, as Smith did not move for a directed verdict on this basis. Moreover, evidence of Fortier\u2019s age was put before the jury during Smith\u2019s defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\"> We are unimpressed with the defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence should have been admitted because the judge had earlier allowed the plaintiffs job evaluations to come in.

They said none of the personnel files were looked at.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">THE JUDGE: \u201cWell, \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: \u201c(Interposing) If you want we can wait for Mr. Kaddaras.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">THE JUDGE: \u201cI will admit it for identification and later if somebody gets on and testifies this was relevant or considered it in anyway you can put it in at that point.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b696-15\"> Moreover, it does not appear that a foundation was ever laid.
