The plaintiff, Leominster Materials Corporation (LMC), appeals from a decision of the city\u2019s zoning board of appeals (board), issued pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 8, upholding the interpretation of the zoning ordinance of the city made by the director of inspections (director). The director\u2019s interpretation of the ordinance led to a determination that the plaintiff\u2019s use of its land for excavation and removal of stone and general quarrying activity was not a permitted use.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">LMC owns approximately fifty-seven acres of land located on Jungle Road in Leominster. The land consists, in large part, of an outcropping of rock. LMC had been using the property to excavate and remove stone and to perform other general quarrying activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">On April 4, 1995, Liberty Commons Realty Trust (Liberty Commons), the owner of nearby land, wrote to the director to complain about LMC\u2019s stone removal activities. In its letter, Liberty Commons contended that LMC\u2019s activities are not a permitted use; are not incidental to the excavation or grading necessary for construction permitted under a valid building permit or in connection with an approved subdivision; are extremely hazardous; and present significant risks to the neighborhood in general and, in particular, to children playing in the area. In response, the director issued a determination on April 24, 1995, stating that LMC\u2019s activities were not permitted in the planned development district in which the subject land is located. On May 5, 1995, pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 14, and article IV, \u00a7 22-23 of the city\u2019s zoning ordinance, LMC appealed from this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">On May 31, 1995, the board held a public hearing to consider LMC\u2019s appeal from the director\u2019s interpretation. After public comment, the board discussed the appeal and voted. The board\u2019s vote upheld the director\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff then filed an appeal in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Prior to trial, both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and, after oral argument, the motion judge issued a written memorandum of decision and order denying LMC\u2019s motion and allowing that of the board. The motion judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ruled that \u00a7 22-17(d) of the zoning ordinance does not permit the removal of stone and rock in any zoning district and that the absence of an ordinance or by-law forbidding stone and rock removal does not imply that such removal constitutes an allowable use. The motion judge entered a judgment dismissing LMC\u2019s complaint, with costs, on April 12, 1996. LMC now appeals from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">During the pendency of this action, on December 29, 1995, Liberty Commons, Wildwood Realty Trust, and John K. Tupper, owners of land that abut or are in the immediate vicinity of the LMC site, filed a motion to intervene as of right. A second judge of the Superior Court heard oral argument on this motion on March 15, 1996, and on March 21, 1996, denied the abutters\u2019 motion to intervene. The judge ruled that the abutters\u2019 \u201cinterests are not shown to be unprotected by the defendants\u2019 efforts in this litigation.\u201d The abutters\u2019 subsequent motion for reconsideration was likewise denied on April 23, 1996. The abutters now appeal from this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">1. <em>Summary judgment. </em>On appeal, LMC argues that the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants was in error because, as a matter of law, the removal of stone and rock is a permitted use under \u00a7 22-17(d) of the zoning ordinance. The granting of summary judgment will be upheld on appeal where the moving party has met its burden of demonstrating that there are no material facts in dispute and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). <em>John B. Deary, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crane, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 719, 722 (1976). We conclude that the award of summary judgment was proper in this case because there are no material facts in dispute and the defendants have shown that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In \u00a7 22-17(d) of the zoning ordinance, entitled \u201cGenerally Permitted Uses,\u201d the removal of sand, gravel, or loam is an explicitly permitted use of land in all zoning districts of the city, subject to the provisions of city ordinances regulating such removal. LMC contends that a fair reading of this section of the zoning ordinance should be that removal of earth products in general is a permitted use in all zoning districts of the city, subject to any general ordinances regulating such removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">LMC first argues that G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21(17), has generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>been assumed to give municipalities a mechanism to regulate the removal of all earth products, including rock, and, by extension, the zoning ordinance in this case should be similarly construed. G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21(17), as amended through St. 1973, c. 317, enables municipalities to adopt restrictions on the removal of \u201csoil, loam, sand or gravel\u201d to address the deleterious effects brought about by unrestrained earth removal. <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Salisbury, </em>378 Mass. 435, 439 (1979). Contrary to LMC\u2019s assertion as to the broad reach of this statute, it is in fact as yet unsettled whether this statute provides sufficient authority to regulate the extraction of rock. See <em>Toda </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Manchester, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 317, 320 n.6 (1984) (\u201cWe note in passing that, while the earth removal by-law [art. XII of the Manchester general bylaws] was explicitly drafted to govern the extraction of rock, the enabling legislation [G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21(17)] speaks only in terms of \u2018the removal of soil, loam, sand or gravel\u2019 \u201d). We need not linger on this point since the city has not adopted any general by-law under G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21(17), governing how earth removal is to be carried out in the city. It has instead enacted a zoning ordinance pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, permitting the removal of sand, loam, and gravel in any zoning district in the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">It is a familiar principle of interpretation that express mention of one matter excludes by implication other similar matters not mentioned. <em>Selectmen of Hatfield </em>v. <em>Garvey, </em>362 Mass. 821, 824 (1973). Since the removal of sand, loam, and gravel is an expressly permitted use in all zoning districts, the exclusion of rock and stone removal from the list of permissible uses was presumably deliberate and not an oversight. See <em>ibid. </em>The court cannot read into the ordinance an unexpressed exception. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Mayor of Beverly, </em>315 Mass. 567, 570 (1944). Thus, where the only earth product removal listed under permissible uses in the zoning ordinance is the removal of sand, loam, and gravel, we decline to read into the ordinance permission for the removal of other earth products. Compare <em>Livoli </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeal of Southborough, post </em>921, 923 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">LMC also contends that \u00a7 22-43(c)(12) of the zoning ordinance governing water supply protection districts, which prohibits the \u201cmining of land except as incidental to a permitted use,\u201d implies that the mining of land outside of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>district is permitted. LMC misconstrues the language of this provision. Section 22-43(c)( 12) provides that otherwise permitted mining uses, i.e., sand, loam, and gravel removal, are prohibited in the water supply protection district except as incidental to a permitted use. This provision does not expand the scope of permissible mining activities in the city: instead, it further restricts such activities when conducted in a water supply protection district.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Finally, LMC contends that the absence of a general ordinance prohibiting the excavation or removal of stone and general quarrying activity, where the municipality is authorized to enact such a prohibition under both G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21(17), and G. L. c. 40A, indicates that LMC is free to remove stone from its property without restriction or regulation. We disagree. Municipalities wishing to regulate earth removal have the option of proceeding under either c. 40A or c. 40, \u00a7 21(17), or both. <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Hopkinton, </em>358 Mass. 164, 170 (1970). \u201cThese two modes of regulation need not be mutually exclusive.\u201d <em>Toda </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Manchester, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. at 320. There is certainly nothing, however, which requires a municipality wishing to regulate earth removal to enact both general and zoning ordinances in order to do so. Here, the city proceeded under c. 40A only, and its zoning ordinance prescribes certain permitted uses with respect to earth removal. \u201cThere is no requirement that zoning by-laws or ordinances follow any particular pattern or structure. They may take the form of prescribing uses permitted or prescribing uses prohibited, or a combination of the two.\u201d <em>Harvard </em>v. <em>Maxant, </em>360 Mass. 432, 436 (1971). The excavation and removal of stone and general quarrying activity are not made lawful solely because such activities are not expressly prohibited either by \u00a7 22-17(d) of the zoning ordinance or by a general municipal ordinance regarding removal or quarrying. See <em>ibid, </em>(defendant\u2019s use of private airplane landing strip not made lawful because not prohibited by one section of zoning by-law where use as landing strip was not one of the permitted uses listed for subject land in another section of by-law).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">2. <em>Costs awarded against LMC. </em>In the judgment dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>LMC\u2019s appeal, the judge assessed costs against LMC. LMC claims error in this ruling. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, as inserted by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, provides that \u201c[cjosts shall not be allowed against a party appealing from the decision of the board or special permit granting authority unless it shall appear to the court that said appellant or appellants acted in bad faith or with malice in making the appeal to the court.\u201d Where the trial judge made no finding that LMC acted in bad faith or with malice in appealing the board\u2019s decision, the assessment of costs against LMC was erroneous. <em>S. Volpe &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wareham, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 357, 362 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">3. <em>Intervention. </em>Because the interests of the abutters are adequately represented and protected by the defendants, we need not reach the question whether intervention should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment is to be modified to delete the award of costs against LMC, and, as so modified, the judgment is affirmed. The order denying the motion to intervene is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\"> In order to overturn the director\u2019s interpretation, four out of five of the board members would have to have voted to overturn. Here, only three out of five of the board members voted to reverse the director\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> We note that the director suggests that, as an incidental use, the excavation and removal of stone would be permitted. If LMC\u2019s rock removal activities were \u201csimply incidental to the excavation or grading necessary for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>permitted construction,\u201d the director would consider these activities differently. Although LMC\u2019s \u201cstated intention has been to remove the rock from the site and bring the property down to the level of Jungle Road in the hope of making the parcel more desirable for a purchaser to construct a building,\u201d the director concluded that LMC\u2019s stone removal was a \u201cprimary manufacturing operation\u201d and therefore a prohibited use. LMC did not challenge the director\u2019s determination of this issue either before the motion judge or here on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
