L. c. 265, \u00a7 18[6]), assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A[6]), possession without a license of a firearm on his person or in a motor vehicle (G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10[\u00edz]), and possession of ammunition without an I.D. card (G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10[/z]). When the Commonwealth rested, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty, which was denied. Thereupon the defendant rested. The jury found the defendant guilty of all four offenses. The sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>imposed are noted in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commonwealth sought to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt on a theory of his participation in a joint venture as well as upon his direct responsibility. It will appear that the defendant\u2019s contention on this appeal is that the judge erred in failing to put to the jury the question whether the defendant had seasonably withdrawn from the joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">SUMMARY OF TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\"><em>Lorenzo Jones testified: </em>About noon, August 4, 1994, Lorenzo Jones encountered Rasheed Fountain, whom he had known for some eight years. Fountain was, looking for a lift to Dudley Street (in the Roxbury section of Boston) where he might buy sneakers. Jones did not accommodate Fountain at that time, but around six o\u2019clock th\u00e1t evening Fountain, now accompanied by Kevin Branch (the defendant), only slightly known to Jones, met Jones at the comer of Fayston and Mas-coma Streets. The two boarded Jones\u2019s rental car, a Ford Tempo. As the party set out, Fountain said the money was at his house, and Jones accordingly drove to Fountain\u2019s place on Magnolia Street. Fountain and the defendant left the car, entered the apartment building, emerged in five minutes, and got into the car. As before, Fountain took the front passenger seat, the defendant the rear passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Very soon, as the car was headed to the corner of Mas-coma and Greenheys Streets, Fountain with his right hand drew a revolver from his waist and held it to Jones\u2019s right side. At the same time he ordered Jones to \u201crun him off\u201d Jones\u2019s jewelry. Jones refused. Instantly the defendant from the rear seat shouted, \u201cShoot that motherfucker, shoot that motherfucker.\u201d Fountain told Jones to stop the car; Jones did so near the corner. The defendant stepped out, and after some abusive argument Fountain also left the car. Jones started to drive toward Fayston Street. In his rear mirror he saw Fountain pointing the gun at the car. With the car still moving, Fountain fired four shots. Severally these struck the trunk of the car, shattered the rear window, grazed Jones\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>shoulder, and hit him in the back but without penetrating his body \u2014 the slug was caught in his shirt. The defendant was on the comer of Mascoma walking away toward Greenheys as Fountain fired the weapon. In shock, Jones continued to drive and on Fayston Street jumped from the car and ran some paces up that street. Thereafter an ambulance came and he was taken to a hospital from the site of his damaged car.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><em>Gary C. Yancey. </em>Yancey and Robert Ventullo of the New World Security force (special police officers) were idling on Greenheys Street, Yancy outside their vehicle, Ventullo within. They heard the gunshots and within seconds saw the defendant and Fountain running toward them. The defendant \u2014 identified as the shorter of the two, lean, with a big Afro hairdo, wearing all black<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 held a gun in his hand. Yancy drew his weapon, as did Ventullo, who had come up; Yancy called on the men to freeze. Stopping for a moment, the defendant put his gun down his waistband, then the two suspects changed direction and, moving to their right across Green-heys, entered an empty lot there. Ventullo pursued the men on foot. Yancey made for Lawrence Avenue intending to intercept the men there. As he ran he radioed his dispatcher, which would inform all nearby units. The men were not on Lawrence Avenue. Yancey went on to Intervale Avenue, where he was picked up by a security car.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\"><em>Robert </em>Ventullo: Ventullo heard the gunshots, saw the men running up Greenheys Street toward Yancey and himself, and drew his weapon, with the result also observed by Yancey. He described the man with the gun as the shorter and leaner of the two, Afro hair style, clothed all in black \u2014 the defendant now in court. Ventullo followed the pair through the field off Greenheys Street and then through backyards and over a couple of fences. The defendant threw his gun as he went over the second fence. Finally the men, with Ventullo still in pursuit, reached and came to a halt in the Ceylon Street park. As Ventullo came abreast, he saw that security officers had apprehended the men and had them against a fence near the baseball field. Ventullo took part by frisking Fountain: no weapon found. Boston police took the defendant and Fountain in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\"><em>Other testimony </em>by sundry witnesses described the finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>by police after short search of the abandoned weapon, a rusted .38 calibre handgun. According to ballistics analysis this was the gun used in the firing at Jones\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">QUESTION OF WITHDRAWAL FROM JOINT VENTURE</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty and the defendant does not contend that that was a mistake. Such a contention would be vain, for the record as made supports the convictions on the bases mentioned of both accessorial<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and direct responsibility. The defendant argues, instead, that the judge was mistaken when he denied a request for a jury instruction about the defendant\u2019s claimed \u201cwithdrawal\u201d from the enterprise before its outcome in the commission of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The evidence the defendant pointed to as fastening a duty on the judge to give the instruction consisted of Jones\u2019s observation that the defendant was moving away from the car toward Greenheys Street when Fountain fired the weapon. Let us suppose that the walking began before the shots were fired, as the defendant wants us to imagine. Centering attention on the charge of armed assault with intent to murder, the defendant says the crime was consummated when the shots were fired, and so the \u201cwithdrawal\u201d was timely. To the contrary, the Commonwealth says that the crime was completed inside the car when Fountain with the defendant\u2019s enthusiastic encouragement assaulted Jones with the weapon; the firing would then appear merely as additional proof of the necessary criminal intent, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slaney, </em>345 Mass. 135, 138 (1962), <em>Salemme </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>370 Mass. 421, 424 (1976), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>383 Mass. 497, 500 (1981). But on the defendant\u2019s own hypothesis of the sequence of events, the so-called withdrawal or abandonment still conformed not at all with the standard definition of the term (or its grounding in reason and policy) as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>set out recently in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>419 Mass. 192, 202 (1994):<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cIn order to support a theory of withdrawal or abandonment of a joint venture, \u2018there must be at least an appreciable interval between the alleged termination and [the commission of the crime], a detachment from the enterprise before the [crime] has become so probable that it cannot reasonably be stayed, and such notice or definite act of detachment that other principals in the attempted crime have opportunity also to abandon it.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In no view of the present case was there an \u201cappreciable interval\u201d with reasonable opportunity for Fountain to abandon the venture; the defendant\u2019s steps toward Greenheys Street rather figured as the start of a flight from the scene of the crime, in which Fountain promptly joined. The defendant, having in the car urged Fountain to \u201cshoot the motherfucker,\u201d gave no \u201cnotice\u201d by word of mouth to his coven-turer of his \u201cdetachment\u201d from the scheme, and the \u201cact\u201d of walking could hardly serve as such notice. The defendant\u2019s claim of withdrawal is an unreal construct. The judge was not bound to give an instruction, for there was no basis in the record for it: the evidence did not \u201craiseQ a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant continued to be part of a joint venture,\u201d which would cast on the Commonwealth \u201cthe burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of abandonment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fickett, </em>403 Mass. 194, 201 n.7 (1988).
