He was offered a ride by the defendant, James E. Lavigne, and entered the front passenger seat of the defendant\u2019s car. After a brief conversation about Erik\u2019s studies and plans to become an electrician, the defendant asked Erik if he \u201cwanted to make some money.\u201d Assuming that the defendant was interested in having some electrical work done, Erik inquired \u201cdoing what?\u201d At that point, the defendant put his right hand on Erik\u2019s upper left thigh, within a few inches of the genitals, reached down into the inner area of the thigh, and massaged the area in a manner Erik later testified \u201cwas like I\u2019d give my girlfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Erik pushed the defendant\u2019s hand away, saying, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t do that.\u201d The defendant then asked Erik if he \u201chad ever tried it before.\u201d In response to Erik\u2019s repeated protest that \u201cI don\u2019t do that,\u201d the defendant asked if Erik \u201chad ever like thought about it.\u201d Shortly thereafter, upon Erik\u2019s request, the defendant let him out of the car. Erik soon contacted the police regarding the incident, and the defendant was eventually charged with a nonconsensual \u201cindecent assault and battery on a person who has attained age fourteen,\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H, as inserted by St. 1980, c. 459, \u00a7 2, and \u201coffer[ing] to pay another person to engage in sexual conduct,\u201d contrary to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53A, as inserted by St. 1983, c. 66, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The defendant was convicted of both charges after a District Court bench trial, at which the facts described above were presented through Erik\u2019s testimony and a courtroom demonstration by Erik of where and how the defendant had touched him. The defendant\u2019s appeal postulates the insufficiency of evidence to establish the essential elements of either crime. He contends that what he did was not indecent as matter of law because it did not involve a commonly understood \u201cprivate part\u201d; and that the \u201cmomentar[y] touch-png] of [Erik\u2019s] thigh and . . . general comments about making some money\u201d could not be construed as soliciting any type of sexual conduct involving commonly understood private parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s arguments, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">1. <em>Indecent assault and battery. </em>The test for indecent assault and battery \u2014 a statutory crime without distinct common law antecedent or relevant legislative history \u2014 is an objective one that is bounded by \u201c \u2018contemporary moral values\u2019 .... The measure of indecency is \u2018common understanding and practices.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 300 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>420 Mass. 508 (1995), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 52, 59 (1982). A touching is indecent when, judged by the \u201cnormative standard\u201d of societal mores, it is \u201cviolative of social and behavioral expectations,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 580-581, 589 (1977), in a manner \u201cwhich [is] fundamentally offensive to contemporary moral values . . . [and] which the common sense of society would regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>as immodest, immoral and improper.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 181, 184 (1991), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perretti, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 36, 43 (1985). So defined, the term \u201cindecent\u201d affords a \u201creasonable opportunity for a person of ordinary intelligence to know what is prohibited.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 302, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jasmin, </em>396 Mass. 653, 655 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Under this standard, the Commonwealth satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201ccommitted an intentional, unprivileged and indecent touching of the victim.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 184, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perretti, 20 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 43. The judge found \u2014 a determination not claimed by the defendant to be legally erroneous or factually unwarranted \u2014 that the defendant had, deliberately and intentionally, touched Erik \u201cfairly high up on his thigh. It was over the top of his thigh and it reached down ... as [Erik] demonstrated it, into the inner area of the thigh and . . . the defendant\u2019s hands or fingers were within three inches of [Erik\u2019s] genitals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The \u201cinner thigh\u201d is, under our contemporary views of personal integrity and privacy \u2014 whether clothed or unclothed \u2014 a body part that our law views as requiring protection from improper touching. See G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11L, as inserted by St. 1994, c. 360 (penalizing various forms of undesirable \u201csexual contact\u201d with patients by health care professionals, including the \u201cintentional touching ... of the patient\u2019s . . . genital area, groin, [or] inner thigh ... or the clothing covering any of these body parts\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 184 (construing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 59, as holding that \u201cthe intentional, unjustified touching of private areas such as \u2018the breasts, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, and pubic area . . .\u2019 constitutes an indecent assault and battery\u201d); Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court, Instruction 5.403 (1995) (an unjustified touching of another person is indecent \u201cif it involves touching portions of the anatomy commonly thought private, such as a person\u2019s genital area or buttocks, or . . . breasts\u201d). Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Samson, </em>388 A.2d 60, 63 (Me. 1978) (indecent touching of young girl\u2019s \u201ccrotch\u201d by placing hand on the outside of her pants is as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u201cabhorrent to society\u201d as a touching of the flesh and is not insulated from the reach of the criminal statute); <em>People </em>v. <em>Graydon, </em>129 Misc. 2d 265 (N.Y. Crina. Ct. 1985) (the leg is an \u201cintimate\u201d body part, the unconsented-to rubbing of which is statutory \u201csexual abuse in the second degree\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The judge was entitled to find, on the evidence he heard and viewed, that the defendant\u2019s touching had not merely involved the inner thigh but, because of the proximity of the defendant\u2019s fingers to Erik\u2019s genitals, had actually extended to the \u201cgenital area,\u201d the \u201cpubic area,\u201d or the \u201cgroin\u201d area, as commonly understood. See The American Heritage Dictionary of The English Language 798 (\u201cgroin .... The crease or hollow at the juncture of the inner part of each thigh with the trunk, together with the adjacent region and often including the external genitals\u201d) and 1464 (3d ed. 1992) (\u201cpubic .... Of, relating to, or located in the region of the pubis .... The forward portion of either of the hipbones, at the juncture forming the front arch of the pelvis .... Short for New Latin [os] <em>pubis, </em>[bone] of the groin\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Had the judge entertained any doubt that the defendant\u2019s touching of Erik\u2019s inner thigh violated community values, it was plainly dispelled by his consideration of all the circumstances of the act. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 185 (touching of buttocks together with simultaneous verbal proposition with \u201cdistinctly sexual overtones\u201d warranted finding of indecent assault and battery). See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Graydon, </em>129 Misc. 2d at 268-269 (to determine if a body part is an \u201cintimate\u201d part, the nonconsensual touching of which is a crime, the entire context of the offensive touching must be examined). The judge weighed both the manner of the physical contact \u2014 a pressing of the thigh with the defendant\u2019s entire hand that felt to Erik like an intimate massage rather than a fleeting, casual, innocuous brush or bump \u2014 and the defendant\u2019s sexually suggestive inquiries accompanying the contact, which were immediately understood by Erik to be an invitation to a sexual encounter. The judge factored those incidents into his conclusion that the totality of the particular acts by the defendant, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perretti, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 44, constituted assaultive conduct which society deems indecent. His analysis was unimpeachable.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">2. <em>Offering to pay for engaging in sexual conduct. </em>The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>fendant acknowledges that the evidence showed an offer to pay for some sort of conduct and that the test of \u201csexual conduct\u201d under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53A, is a broad one coextensive with common understanding. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>388 Mass. 460, 463-464 (1983). He contends, however, that the Commonwealth failed to prove exactly what sort of conduct he was soliciting and suggests that it could as easily have been inoffensive activity, such as a simple massage, rather than conduct of a sexual nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The strict evidentiary standard urged by the defendant is not one the Commonwealth is compelled to satisfy in a \u00a7 53A case. Like virtually all crimes, a violation of that statute may be established by entirely circumstantial evidence of, and inferences based on, a defendant\u2019s observed conduct. Proof of specific or express acts of solicitation is not required. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 935, 936 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The judge could properly evaluate the challenged conduct in light of the entirety of the circumstances; apply common understanding reflecting contemporary mores to that evaluation; and, like all fact finders deciding issues of guilt or innocence, draw inferences and conclusions based on common sense and life experience. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>412 Mass. 172, 178 (1992). Having done so, he could appropriately reach two conclusions on this record, both inculpatory. He could reasonably infer that the defendant\u2019s proposal, in conjunction with his massaging of the inner thigh next to Erik\u2019s genitals, indicated a solicitation of either receiving or administering a manual massage or other manipulation of genitals, either his or Erik\u2019s. Such an act is unquestionably sexual conduct violative of \u00a7 53A when offered or requested for a fee. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>388 Mass, at 463-463.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The judge could also base a finding of guilt on the indecent nature of the sexually intimate contact coupled with the defendant\u2019s offer to pay for a form of sexual activity unmis-takenly communicated by that contact, which represented the defendant\u2019s unhesitating response to Erik\u2019s inquiry about what he had to do to earn the money being offered. In context, the \u201cit\u201d discussed by the defendant with Erik was not at all ambiguous, as the defendant contends. \u201cIt\u201d was, rather, a distinctly suggestive euphemism for a sexual act between males. Erik clearly understood it as such. The judge rationally concluded that the inference that the defendant sought to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>for such sexual conduct was \u201ccompelling.\u201d For our part, we find it improbable that any competent adult, informed by common sense, life experience, and contemporary values, would reach any different conclusion, or would be surprised to learn that the defendant\u2019s words and deeds amounted to an offer to pay for a type of sexual conduct which \u00a7 53A proscribes. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nuby, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 363 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
