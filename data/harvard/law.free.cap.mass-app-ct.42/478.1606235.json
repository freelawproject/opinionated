That investigation led the social worker to conclude that there was reasonable cause to believe that the child had been sexually abused, and the department determined that the allegations were \u201csupported.\u201d See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.32(2) (1994). Consequently, the matter was referred to the district attorney, and the father\u2019s name was listed on the department\u2019s registry of alleged perpetrators (see G. L. c. 18B, \u00a7 7[6]), where it would remain for seventy-five years in the absence of reversal of the department\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>sion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The father unsuccessfully sought review of the department\u2019s decision at an administrative \u201cfair hearing.\u201d See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.08 (1994). He then sought judicial review of the decision under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. A Superior Court judge found and concluded that the allegations against the father were supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal is from that judgment, which we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">1. <em>The administrative decision. </em>At the conclusion of the fair hearing, the hearing officer found that the child had stated to three different people (the mandated reporter, a social worker for the department, and a therapist) that her father touched her genital area, that her use of the phrase \u201cprivate parts\u201d was not an uncommon term for a child of her age to use in referring to the genital area, that she indicated that the touchings had occurred in the bathroom, that she had not retracted the allegations, and that she remained in psychotherapy. Based upon his findings that the father, who was divorced from the child\u2019s mother, had \u201cvisitation with the child and therefore was entrusted with a degree of responsibility for the child as well as having access to the child,\u201d the hearing officer also found that the father was a \u201ccaretaker\u201d of the child within the meaning of 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.00(7) (1993) .<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Concluding that the child\u2019s disclosures to three different individuals constituted substantial evidence, the hearing officer ruled that the father had failed to meet his burden of proving that the department\u2019s decision was erroneous. See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.06(8)(c) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">2. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>Both G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6), as inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1, and 110 Code Mass. Regs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>\u00a7 4.37 (1993), define \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Three witnesses testified at the fair hearing: the father, his present wife, and the child\u2019s on-going social worker for the department, Deborah Sullivan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition to the testimony, the hearing officer had before him the report of the investigation conducted by the department after receipt of the mandated report. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 51A and 51B.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Except for Sullivan\u2019s testimony, all the evidence tending to show that the father had sexually abused his daughter was multi-level hearsay, admissible at the fair hearing under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(2), G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 21, and 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.21 (1993). Relying exclusively upon <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>331 Mass. 101, 103 (1954), the father argues that a decision based solely upon uncorroborated hearsay cannot constitute substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\"><em>Sinclair </em>was explicated and limited in <em>Embers of Salisbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 526, 530 (1988): \u201cAlthough in that case we said that \u2018[i]f the pertinent evidence is exclusively hearsay, that does not constitute \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d even before an administrative tribunal,\u2019 <em>Sinclair, supra </em>at 103, the line we were drawing was not between evidence admissible in a court and evidence that is inadmissible because of the rules of evidence observed by courts, but between evidence having indicia of reliability and probative value and that which does not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The question before us is not whether the administrative decision was based exclusively upon uncorroborated hearsay but whether the hearsay presented at the fair hearing was rehable. Even then, our review does not end. \u201cSignificantly, we are not required to affirm the board merely on a finding that the record contains evidence from which a rational mind might draw the desired inference. Our determination must be made \u2018upon consideration of the entire record.\u2019 <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 253 (1966), quoting from G.

After receiving a mandated report on April 19, 1994, a social worker for the department assigned the case for investigation to another department social worker, Cherry Rooney. Rooney commenced her investigation the next day and filed her report within the week. As recounted in her report, Rooney met first with Sullivan, the child\u2019s social worker. According to Rooney\u2019s account of the meeting, Sullivan told her that an extensive sexual abuse evaluation had been done on the child by a Felicia Hagberg. At that time, the child made no disclosure of abuse. Sometime subsequent to the evaluation, again we are not advised when, but during a regularly scheduled visit between Sullivan and the child, the child told Sullivan that \u201cmy daddy touched my private parts.\u201d The child was then referred to Hagberg for therapy during which, at some undisclosed time, she talked about, according to Rooney from Sullivan from Hagberg, \u201cbad dreams about her dad.\u201d Sullivan also told Rooney that there were \u201cadditional disclosures to Hag-berg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">As part of her investigation, Rooney had a telephone conversation with Hagberg. Hagberg confirmed that a sexual abuse evaluation of the child had been done about five months earlier, and that the child had made no disclosure at that time. Therapy with the child began two months after the evaluation, and during therapy, the child told Hagberg that her father had touched her private parts and had hurt her. According to Rooney\u2019s account of her conversation with Hag-berg, \u201c[the child] has not been able to talk about specifics but she has stated that \u2018she has scary dreams of daddy.\u2019 \u201d Hag-berg also told Rooney that the child\u2019s mother told her (Hag-berg) that the child has trouble sleeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>In addition, Hagberg related to Rooney an incident with the child which occurred a month after therapy began. Rooney records that incident as follows: \u201c[The child] stated to Felicia [Hagberg] that daddy kissed my private parts. When asked where this happened . . . [the child] stated on the couch, my couch at home. When pressed for more information . . . [the child] became silly and spoke in .gibberish which her mother stated to Felicia is . . . [the child\u2019s] way of avoiding talking about things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">It appears from Rooney\u2019s report that Hagberg told her that the term \u201cprivate parts\u201d came up with the child several times. As relayed by Rooney from Hagberg: \u201cDuring the sexual abuse evaluation, using the anatomical dolls, the term was used and she [Hagberg] feels that . . . the child has a clear understanding of what it means.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rooney reported that Hag-berg was of the view that the child cannot be ignored in her statements, that the child, notwithstanding many opportunities to do so, has never mentioned being touched by anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Rooney also spoke on the telephone with the mandated reporter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The identity of the mandated reporter was redacted from Rooney\u2019s account of the conversation. According to Rooney, the mandated reporter stated the child disclosed on two separate occasions that her father had touched her \u201cprivates.\u201d The reporter told Rooney that the child said the touchings occurred at the home of her aunt who was at that time supervising the father\u2019s visitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rooney noted that the reporter stated that when the child made the disclosure, she appeared withdrawn and that she regressed and put her thumb in her mouth and her head in her mother\u2019s lap.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Although we do not know when the child made these disclosures, the mandated reporter told Rooney that the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>made the second disclosure just before a visit with the father and his present wife who was then supervising visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Rooney also spoke with the father on the telephone. He denied ever touching his daughter and expressed his concern that someone may have abused her. He told Rooney that three weeks earlier the child asked him, \u201cdaddy did you touch my private parts?\u201d The father asked the child if she knew the meaning of the term \u201cprivate parts.\u201d When the child responded that she did not, he explained to her what the term meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The investigation was completed with a meeting between the child\u2019s mother and Rooney during which the mother told Rooney that no one but the father has had access to the child to abuse her and that the child has never made statements about anyone else. The mother reported to Rooney that a month earlier the child told her that her father had kissed her private parts and she his. In response to inquiry from her mother, the child described her father\u2019s genitals in terms which could be deemed as generally accurate for a three year old child. The mother also showed Rooney a calendar in which she chroni ied her concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The o,,ly additional facts presented to the hearing officer are those set out in a \u201cStipulation Of Facts In Lieu of Transcript\u201d entered into by the department and the father for purposes o\u00ed the father\u2019s appeal to this court. According to the parties\u2019 stipulation, Sullivan testified that there was contentious litigation between the mother and the father, that there was a possibility that the mother prompted the child to make the allegations against him, and that in view of the litigation between the child\u2019s parents, that possibility \u201cwas investigated and was stiF nder investigation but no result or conclusion had been reac Aed.\u201d Sullivan also stated that a physical examination of the child had been conducted by the child\u2019s therapist \u201cwho found insufficient data to warrant any finding of abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The father testified that he had never touched or kissed the child\u2019s private parts nor had he ever exposed his genitals to her. He further related that, by order of the Probate Court, all his visits with the child were supervised and that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>never alone with her.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He stated that about four months prior to the hearing, he was visiting the child at the home of her mother\u2019s brother. During that visit, the child told the father that he had never touched her private parts. When her mother came into the room and asked the child whether her father had ever touched her private parts, the child replied that she was not going to tell \u201cfibs\u201d anymore.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The father\u2019s present wife, a captain in the United States Army who had received a medical discharge as a result of a parachute accident, testified that the father was never alone with the child and that, had she ever seen him abuse the child, she would have taken the child from him immediately and would have left him.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">4. <em>The substantiality of the evidence. </em>The reliability of the multi-level hearsay statements at a fair hearing is not established by the mere fact that they are made admissible as evidence by statute and regulation. Rather, to determine the reliability of the multi-level hearsay statements, we look to the circumstances under which they were they made. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, 399 </em>Mass. 678, 683 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colin C., </em>419 Mass. 54, 65 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joubert, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 943, 945 (1995); G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 82(c)(i)-(iv).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">There are few reasonable indicia of reliability in the evidence to support the child\u2019s statements. In arguing that its evidence was substantial, the department claims that the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u201cspontaneously disclosed to three different adults that it was . . . [the father] who had touched and kissed her private parts.\u201d There is nothing in the evidence, however, which shows the circumstances of the child\u2019s statements to the mandated reporter, to Hagberg, or to Sullivan from which one would infer that they were spontaneously made.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">There is nothing about the circumstances of the child\u2019s statement to Hagberg, that her father kissed her private parts, that drapes them with the quality of reliability. Hagberg related to Rooney that the child stated that the kissing episode happened \u201con . . . my couch at home.\u201d When \u201cpressed\u201d for more information, the child became \u201csilly and spoke in gibberish.\u201d Moreover, the record indicates that the father\u2019s visitation was first supervised by the child\u2019s aunt in the aunt\u2019s home and then by the father\u2019s present wife. If, as Sullivan had testified at the fair hearing, there was contentious litigation between the child\u2019s parents, we think it unlikely that the father\u2019s present wife would supervise visitation in the child\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The only person to whom the child made the statement that she had kissed her father\u2019s private parts, in addition to Hagberg, was her mother, who did not testify at the fair hearing. However, Sullivan did testify that in light of the litigation between the parents, there was a possibility that the mother had prompted the child to make her allegations, that possibility was under investigation, and that no result or conclusion had been reached as of the time of the hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Hagberg also told Rooney that the child \u201chas scary dreams of daddy\u201d and that the mother told her that the child was having trouble sleeping. Again, there is nothing to show the circumstances in which that statement was made nor is there any information concerning the details of the dreams.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The department also argues that the child\u2019s statements were \u201cclear, detailed, and consistent over time.\u201d Although the child\u2019s statements can be understood readily, it is not at all clear from Rooney\u2019s account of her conversation with Hagberg whether, in using the anatomical dolls, the term \u201cprivate parts\u201d was spoken by the child or usage of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>phrase was suggested to the child by Hagberg. While Rooney also related that Hagberg \u201cfeels that the child has a clear understanding of the term,\u201d there is nothing in Rooney\u2019s report which shows the basis for the feeling expressed by Hagberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Additionally, we do not agree with the department\u2019s view that the details in the child\u2019s statements bespeak reliability. The only detail offered by the child concerning the alleged touchings is that they took place at the home of the aunt who was supervising the visits at the time of the touchings. Although the hearing officer stated in his decision that the child \u201cindicated that the touchings had occurred in the bathroom,\u201d we found no such indication by the child anywhere in the record. Indeed, Hagberg informed Rooney that the child \u201chas not been able to talk about specifics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Although it appears from the department\u2019s account of the mandated report that the child \u201crepeatedly\u201d stated that her father had touched her private parts, Rooney\u2019s conversation with the mandated reporter reflects that the child at most made the statements on two separate occasions, one of which was in the presence of the mother. As for the statements to Hagberg and Sullivan, there is no information concerning when or how often the statements were made. We note also that the child\u2019s statements all appear to have been made several months after completion of the inconclusive sexual abuse evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Even if one accepted the department\u2019s assertion that the evidence showed the child\u2019s statements had been made \u201cconsistently,\u201d statements supported with little, if any, indicia of reliability do not attain trustworthiness through a process of repetition.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Not only is there an absence of evidence to show the time and circumstances of the child\u2019s statements, there is no evidence to corroborate that the touchings occurred or that the child could even appreciate, what she was expressing. The department\u2019s evidence showed, at best, that subsequent to a contentious divorce between the parents and an inconclusive sexual abuse evaluation, the three year old child made and repeated allegations of sexual touchings of her by the noncustodial parent during supervised visits, that there existed the possibility that the mother prompted the child to make the allegations, and that possibility was still under investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>tion. On this state of the record, we think the evidence upon which the department relied was so persistently encumbered by unreliability that it fails to have the character of substantiality which would support the department\u2019s decision to place the father\u2019s name on its registry of alleged perpetrators for a period of seventy-five years. That was a decision, we may add, of more than ordinary gravity in that it places a permanent mark on a person.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of a new judgment reversing the decision of the department and ordering that the father\u2019s name be removed from the registry of alleged perpetrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-9\"> See G.
