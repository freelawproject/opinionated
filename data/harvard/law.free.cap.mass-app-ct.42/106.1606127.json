Lee, the plaintiff, Carol M. Nickerson, appeals. A medical malpractice tribunal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> found her offer of proof deficient because a letter from a podiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey R. Coen, did not provide an explicit statement that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>dant departed from the applicable standard of care. The plaintiffs motions for reconsideration and to supplement the offer of proof were denied. We conclude that the plaintiffs offer of proof, if substantiated at trial, is sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The tribunal, without passing on the weight or credibility of any of the evidence, see <em>Gugino </em>v. <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, </em>380 Mass. 464, 468 (1980), could have found the following facts. On August 8, 1990, the plaintiff went to the East Boston Neighborhood Community Health Center (Center),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for treatment of a painful foot. When she first consulted with the defendant, a podiatrist, he took a medical histoiy from her in which she mentioned that several weeks before \u2014 while she was having her toe nails cut \u2014 another podiatrist scraped a piece of skin underneath the third toe of her right foot. She also told the defendant that she was diabetic. Physical examination of her toe revealed that it was red and swollen. The defendant noted that she had \u201can infected lesion over the tip\u201d and that pus was draining from the toe. He diagnosed the plaintiff\u2019s condition as cellulitis, prescribed medication, and instructed her to soak her toe in a quarter strength Betadine solution followed by application of Bacitracin ointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The plaintiff continued to receive treatment of the infected toe at the Center from the defendant and other staff members. On August 16, 1990, a wound culture was ordered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On August 29, the defendant\u2019s examination revealed that the plaintiff had no drainage from the toe and lacked sensation. The defendant ordered an X-ray of the plaintiff\u2019s toe, which the radiologist reported as showing \u201cno radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis but if that is a clinical concern, bone scan is advised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>On October 8, 1990, the plaintiff returned to the Center complaining of a sore on her right lower leg. She was seen by a physician who noted a sore on her right lower leg that was warm to the touch. She then began to receive fairly regular treatment for the wound on her leg. On her final visit to the Center, October 16, 1990, the defendant made a note in the plaintiff\u2019s record that the wound on the right lower leg had decreased substantially and that it appeared as a superficial ulceration with no cellulitis and no lymphangitis. Notes from an earlier office visit on October 11 made by another physician, available to the defendant, suggest that the defendant perhaps ought to have been less certain about whether the infection was clearing up.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Less than a month later, the plaintiff was hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital with a diagnosis of diabetic septic foot. A button toe amputation of the third toe of her right foot was performed on the day of her admission. She remained in the hospital for seventeen days and was discharged on November 28, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Now we bear down on matters related to arguments about the tribunal\u2019s decision. During the hearing, the judicial member of the panel suggested that the report of the plaintiffs expert medical witness, Dr. Coen, did not recite, \u201cmagic words or a sufficient statement of liability, i.e., the failure to conform to the standard of care.\u201d Then, he added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be overly formalistic, but that\u2019s exactly what this Tribunal is obliged to [do] and the purpose is to see whether the expert has stated enough in an appropriate fashion to get over the rail, so to speak, and without an opinion that the standard of care was not complied with, you don\u2019t get over the rail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">In response, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested the opportunity to submit a supplemental affidavit of Dr. Coen; however, the judge refused this request saying,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">\u201c[Y]ou get one shot at it. You just can\u2019t go over it and over it and over it again and it\u2019s up to you to make sure that the doctor gets in his report about the magic words and if they aren\u2019t there, then there isn\u2019t much I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>for one, may do for you or can do or that I believe I\u2019m in power to do, so I think that\u2019s that.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Under \u00a7 60B of G. L. c. 231, a plaintiff is required to adduce an \u201coffer of proof\u2019 that persuades the tribunal \u201cthat a legitimate question of liability ha[s] been raised.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass. 573, 578-579 (1978). The standard governing the tribunal's determination is the same as that applicable to a motion for a directed verdict, <em>ibid., </em>that is, the offer of proof is viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Avedikian, </em>412 Mass. 481, 484 (1992), <em>S.C., </em>424 Mass. 172 (1997). The statute specifies a wide range of possible sources of admissible evidence to determine whether the defendant failed to conform to good medical practice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the critical allegations are usually set forth in an opinion letter describing a \u201cfailure to conform to good medical practice.\u201d <em>Gugino </em>v. <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, </em>380 Mass, at 468. See <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass. 186, 190 n.4 (1980). Cf. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 1101, 1102 (1989) (plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof which did not contain an expert opinion on appropriate dental practice was insufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The only question presented by the plaintiff\u2019s appeal is whether the plaintiff\u2019s expert opinion letter was sufficient to show that the defendant\u2019s failure to diagnose the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s diabetic neuropathy fell below the applicable standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Dr. Coen\u2019s opinion letter states that on the plaintiffs visit to the Center on August 8, 1990, she was treated by the defendant. He then notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">\u201cOn this initial visit there was an inadequate past medical history taken and a poor evaluation regarding the status of [the plaintiff\u2019s] podiatric physical exam. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>was noted that there was pus on physical exam yet no culture was taken and no X-ray was taken at this point. . . . No CBC was taken. [The plaintiffs] blood sugar was not evaluated even though she was noted to be diabetic and was diagnosed with an infected toe. Po-diatric physical exam neglected to evaluate her neurological status which much later was documented to be significantly neuropathic. Consequently the severity of the infection, in this patient, had been underestimated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The defendant asserts that Dr. Coen\u2019s letter did not state that the defendant failed to adhere to accepted medical practice or establish a reference point by which to evaluate the defendant\u2019s performance. We do not agree. Parts of Dr. Coen\u2019s letter which are reproduced in the margin, show that the defendant\u2019s conservative treatment of the plaintiffs infected toe, in light of her diabetic condition, fell below the applicable standard of care.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Baystate Medical Center, </em>415 Mass. 202 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>(1993), the Supreme Judicial Court found that although the opinion letter of the plaintiffs expert did not provide a direct statement on the standard of care, the expert\u2019s statements concerning treatment that should have been rendered constituted an \u201copinion on the course of action that one reasonably exercising the care and skill of an average vascular surgeon should have followed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207 n.6. This was held sufficient to meet the directed verdict standard on the issue of that doctor\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">We added gloss to the <em>Bradford </em>court\u2019s formulation in <em>Rahilly </em>v. <em>North Adams Regional Hosp., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 718 n.6 (1994), holding that a plaintiffs expert need not state his opinion in formulaic terms. Moreover, the tribunal may not refuse to accept an expert\u2019s opinion unless the plaintiffs offer of proof is so deficient that as a matter of law it would be improper for any judge to admit it. See <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass, at 192. The wrongs to which the language of the expert opinion letter speaks implicitly show how the defendant committed a breach of the standard of care owed to his patient. Although one might imagine an unfortunate result in this case, under the <em>Little </em>standard, see 376 Mass, at 578, the content of Dr. Coen\u2019s letter passes muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">As a final point, the defendant argues that the plaintiffs offer of proof failed to explain how the plaintiffs injury was caused by the defendant\u2019s breach. The defendant contends that Dr. Coen\u2019s opinion letter only offers conclusory statements and thereby fails to meet the standard because it fails to produce \u201cevidence\u201d of a causal connection between the negligence of the defendant and the damages suffered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate \u201cthat there was greater likelihood or probability that the harm complained of was due to causes for which the defendant was responsible than from any other cause.\u201d <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>Bixon, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 639, 643 (1987) (citations omitted). As we have observed, Dr. Coen\u2019s letter establishes the link necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>between the conduct of the defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s injury. He specifically notes that \u00e1s a consequence of the defendant\u2019s failure to evaluate properly the plaintiff\u2019s presenting condition, the \u201cseverity of the [infection]\u201d was \u201cunderestimated.\u201d He further opines that had \u201ca thorough evaluation and appropriate treatment [been] rendered immediately, then it is very likely the septic foot and consequent amputation could have been avoided.\u201d Thus, the report offers more than just a conclusory statement and, under a directed verdict standard, adequately addresses the issue of causal relationship. <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Lea, </em>403 Mass. 430, 434 (1988). See also <em>Cusher </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 498 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendant is vacated. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court where the tribunal\u2019s decision is to be struck and in substitution therefor, a determination shall be entered that the offer of proof by the plaintiff is sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-15\"> General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 60B, inserted by St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 5, provides that the malpractice tribunal, composed of a lawyer, a medical representative, and a judge \u201cshall determine if the evidence presented if properly substantiated is sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry or whether the plaintiff\u2019s case is merely an unfortunate medical result.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\"> The plaintiffs amended complaint contained counts against Dr. Lee and East Boston Neighborhood Health Center Corporation.

Wound cultures should have been taken especially when a mixed infection is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>likely. Initially, at least a blood sugar, X-ray and CBC should have been taken.
