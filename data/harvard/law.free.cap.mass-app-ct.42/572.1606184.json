L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, added by St. 1994, c. 283, \u00a7 1, commonly referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>as the anti-SLAPP<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> statute (statute), the material provisions of which we set out in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, a single justice of this court granted leave to appeal the judge\u2019s ruling to a full panel of this court. The appeal raises, for the first time, issues regarding the scope and application of the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Certain material facts that provide the background for this controversy are undisputed. From 1987 to July, 1990, the defendant Marino was employed as an engineer for the defendant Holmes Products Corporation (Holmes). In July, 1990, Marino left Holmes to work for the plaintiff Duracraft Corporation (Duracraft), where he was employed until August, 1994. From August, 1994, to 1995, Marino was employed by a third company, Accutek. In December, 1995, Marino returned to Holmes, where he is currently employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Shortly after joining Duracraft in 1990, Marino entered into a \u201cNondisclosure and Non-Competition Agreement\u201d (Agreement) in which he agreed not to disclose any confidential information to third parties. The Agreement also contained a provision stating that Marino is not precluded from disclosing confidential information \u201cupon the lawful demand of any governmental agency (including court process).\u201d Upon such a lawful demand, Duracraft was to have the opportunity to review and comment on the confidential information sought, and to discuss with Marino and the agency the scope and content of the requested information.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In 1992, while Marino was working for Duracraft, Holmes commenced an opposition proceeding against Duracraft before the Federal Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB), alleging that Duracraft had improperly registered the word \u201cturbo\u201d as a trademark. In November, 1995, Holmes noticed Marino\u2019s deposition in the TTAB proceeding. Marino was then working for Accutek. The deposition was postponed, re-noticed in January of 1996, and taken on February 7, 1996, by which time Marino was again employed by Holmes. Present at the deposition were four attorneys for Holmes, two attorneys for Duracraft, and Marino.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Duracraft, in an unverified complaint filed in March, 1996, alleges that during Marino\u2019s deposition, counsel for Holmes elicited, and Marino disclosed, confidential information concerning the \u201cturbo\u201d trademark litigation and related intellectual property matters. Duracraft also alleges that Marino met with attorneys for Holmes prior to the deposition and offered to provide such deposition testimony. The claims against Marino and Holmes are for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, intentional interference with contractual relations, misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition, and unfair and deceptive acts and practices. Holmes and Marino then moved to dismiss these claims under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The judge, relying on what she reasonably perceived to be the objective of anti-SLAPP statutes enacted in other jurisdictions, viz., \u201cto protect citizens from lawsuits designed to silence their opposition concerning a matter of public concern,\u201d as well as the public reports of House floor debates, ruled that the mischief the statute was designed to remedy were \u201cincidents involving citizens sued for speaking out on issues of <em>public </em>concern\u201d (emphasis in original). Applying that standard, the judge found that Marino\u2019s testimony during his deposition was not protected by the statute because a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>trademark dispute is not a matter of public concern. Although acknowledging that \u201c[o]n its face, the language of the statute would appear broad enough to apply here,\u201d the judge held that the statute was not applicable to this case. To construe the statute as being applicable would, the judge wrote, \u201csubstantially alter procedural and substantive law,\u201d which a judge should not do \u201c[ajbsent a clear legislative intent to abrogate the existing law.\u201d The judge denied the special motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">1. <em>Matters of public concern. </em>We look first to the words of the statute to determine whether, as Duracraft argues, the statute is confined to claims against persons exercising their right of petition in a matter of public concern. \u201cIt is elementary that the meaning of a statute must, in the first instance, be sought in the language in which the act is framed, and if that is plain, . . . the sole function of the court is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Community College Council </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>402 Mass. 352, 354 (1988). See also Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.01, at 81 (5th ed. 1992), quoting from <em>Caminetti </em>v. <em>United States, </em>242 U.S. 470, 485 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The statute grants to any party against whom a claim is brought by reason of that party\u2019s exercise of his \u201cright of petition under the constitution of the United States or of the commonwealth,\u201d the right to file a special motion to dismiss the claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The \u201cright of petition\u201d referred to in the statute is the right protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the . . . right of the people ... to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\u201d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and by the Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The statute makes explicit that the protected right of petition extends to five kinds of statements. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>Statements [1], [2] and [3] do not necessarily involve issues of public concern or public participation in the consideration of an issue. Statement [4] does contemplate public participation designed to affect the consideration of an issue. Statement [5] is a catch-all which brings in any statement not previously mentioned and which falls within the constitutional protection of the right of petition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nowhere does the statute state that the special motion to dismiss is available only where the covered statements are those involving issues of public concern.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The focus of Duracraft\u2019s argument is that, aside from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>words of the statute, the <em>purpose </em>of the statute is self-evident. Like similar statutes elsewhere, the Duracraft argument runs, the Massachusetts statute is intended only to protect people who speak out on matters of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">It is true that similar statutes passed elsewhere reveal a general legislative purpose to protect activity designed to affect or influence governmental action regarding issues arguably of public concern or significance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And it is at least arguable that the controversy in this case does not involve speaking out, or taking any other action, regarding an issue of public concern or significance. Yet the principal point remains: the Massachusetts statute is silent as to any requirement that the action to be protected must, to qualify for that protection, involve an issue of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Duracraft\u2019s argument overlooks the fact that the Massachusetts statute is fundamentally different from the anti-SLAPP statutes passed in other jurisdictions; that is to say, the legislative history of the Massachusetts statute reveals an intentional omission of any requirement that the defendant\u2019s conduct arise in connection with an issue of public concern. See <em>Hunters Brook Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Bourne, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 81 (1982) (legislative history may decide disputes regarding the interpretation of a statute).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The bill was originally introduced on January 7, 1993, as House No. 3033. It was captioned, \u201cAn Act Limiting Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation.\u201d Section 1 of the bill inserted \u00a7 59H, the first sentence of which reads as follows: \u201cIn any case in which a party asserts that the civil claims, counterclaims, or cross claims against said party are based on said party\u2019s lawful exercise of its right of petition or of free speech under the constitution of the United States or of the commonwealth [szc] <em>in connection with a matter of public concern, </em>said party may bring a special motion to dismiss\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">On December 7, 1993, the House changed the title of the bill to read, \u201cAn Act Protecting the Public\u2019s Right to Petition Government.\u201d On December 21, 1993, the bill was amended in the Senate by <em>striking </em>from the first paragraph of \u00a7 59H (following a reference to a party\u2019s \u201clawful exercise of its right of petition\u201d) the phrase \u201cin connection with a matter of public concern,\u201d and by <em>striking </em>from the definition of \u201ca party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition or of free speech,\u201d the phrase \u201cor any written or oral statement made in connection with an issue of public concern.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See Journal of the Senate, Tuesday, December 21, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">On December 30, 1993, the House approved the amendments adopted in the Senate. The bill as amended was passed by both chambers on January 3, 1994. The Governor vetoed the legislation on January 14, 1994. House No. 3033, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>amended in the Senate, was reintroduced as House No. 1520<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and eventually passed, over a second veto by the Governor, in December of 1994. See Legislative Record, 85H-86H (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Given the legislative history just recited, there is no basis for this court to reinsert the rejected condition that the moving party\u2019s activity must involve a matter of public concern. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.38, at 290-291 (5th ed. 1992). <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914) (\u201cwe have no right to . . . read into the statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there, whether the omission came from inadvertence or of set purpose\u201d). <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 706 (1984) (reiterating the language just quoted from <em>King). Callahan </em>v. <em>A.J. Welch Equip. Corp., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 611-612 (1994). Compare <em>Cranberry Realty &amp; Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Ackerley Communications, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 255, 257 (1983). We conclude that the statute imposes no condition that the defendants\u2019 statements involve issues of public concern.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Bratcher </em>v. <em>Galusha, </em>417 Mass. 28, 30-31 (1994) (we may not \u201crewrite or ignore the plain language of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ute. [We also may not] intrude on the Legislature\u2019s function or . . . disregard the plain meaning of the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">It does not follow, however, that the defendants must prevail on their special motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">2. <em>The immunity issue. </em>Following arguments in this case, we asked the parties to file supplementary briefs on the question set out in the margin.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In response, Holmes and Marino argue that the statute created a qualified immunity from all \u201ccivil claims, counterclaims and cross-claims\u201d based on their exercise of their right of petition.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The qualification is that Duracraft may defeat the immunity by demonstrating, in its pleadings, affidavits and discovery specially permitted by the judge, see \u00a7 59H, par. third, that the defendants\u2019 claimed exercise of the right of petition is \u201cdevoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law,\u201d and that the exercise caused the plaintiff actual injury. The defendants state accurately that Duracraft made no such showing in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The result, say the defendants, is that Dura-craft\u2019s claims are merely \u201ccivil claims\u201d barred by operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u00a7 59H, and their special motion to dismiss should have been allowed. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">If we take the language of the statute literally, it might be said that the legislative intention was to immunize non-sham petitioning activity<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> from <em>all </em>claims based on such activities. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>Such a construction would create grave constitutional problems where, as here, the plaintiff\u2019s action asserts a legitimate, cognizable claim based on a pre-existing contract between the parties. See <em>1010 Memorial Drive Tenants Corp. </em>v. <em>Fire Chief of Cambridge, </em>424 Mass. 661, 663 (1997) (\u201cIt is fundamental that issues of statutory interpretation should be resolved prior to reaching any constitutional issue\u201d). The plaintiff, after all, is simply exercising its right of petition. <em>Bill Johnson\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd., </em>461 U.S. at 744-747, while not entirely congruent with this case, is nevertheless instructive. In that case, as we describe in note 9, <em>supra, </em>the defendant commenced a State court action in response to allegedly unlawful union activity. The National Labor Relations Board (Board), finding the action an unfair labor practice, ordered the defendant to withdraw the action, and the Court of Appeals enforced the Board\u2019s order. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings. The Court reasoned, see <em>id. </em>at 745-746, that if there is a genuine issue of material fact in the state court action, the action cannot be enjoined by the Board. \u201cWhen a suit presents genuine factual issues, the state plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment interest in petitioning the state court for redress of his grievance . . . lead[s] us to construe the [National Labor Relations] Act as not permitting the Board to usurp the traditional fact-finding function of the state-court jury or judge. Hence we conclude that if a state plaintiff is able to present to the Board with evidence that shows his lawsuit raises genuine issues of material fact, the Board should proceed no further . . . until the state-court suit has been concluded.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Similarly, we conclude that \u00a7 59H must be construed to recognize Duracraft\u2019s First Amendment right of petition by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>permitting it to litigate its claims based on its non-disclosure agreement with Marino.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Stated differently, \u00a7 59H cannot be constitutionally construed to mean that non-sham petitioning activities immunizes the defendant from all Federal and State statutory and common law causes of action based on the defendant\u2019s petitioning activities.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> What is at issue here is the individualized petitioning right of Duracraft to seek enforcement of an alleged violation of its pre-existing agreement with Marino. While this area of the law is far from settled, we have found no case, and none has been brought to our attention, holding that a defendant\u2019s non-sham petitioning activity is immunized from a plaintiffs petitioning right to seek enforcement of alleged violations of a valid pre-existing contract between the parties. Compare <em>Whelan </em>v. <em>Abell, </em>48 F.3d 1247 (D.C. Cir. 1995), where the Court of Appeals was faced with a similar problem: the conflict between the right of petition and a common law tort. The court concluded, \u201cWe see no reason to believe that the right of petition includes a right to file deliberately false complaints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1254. See <em>Florida Fern Growers Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Concerned Citizens of Putnam County, Inc. </em>616 So. 2d 562, 570 (Fla. 1993) (petitioning activities do not provide immunity from claims of malicious interference with advantageous relationship). But see <em>Video Inti. Prod. Inc. </em>v. <em>Warner-Amex Cable Communications, Inc., </em>858 F.2d 1075, 1084 (5th Cir. 1988) (the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine has been \u201cexpanded ... to protect first amendment petitioning of the government from claims brought under federal and state laws, including section 1983 and common-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>law tortious interference with contractual relations\u201d); <em>Suburban Restoration Co. </em>v. <em>ACMAT Corp., </em>700 F.2d 98, 102 (2d Cir. 1983) (non-sham petitioning activities immunized defendants from alleged violations of State statute regulating unfair trade practices and common law claims of tortious interference with a business expectancy); <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Fury, </em>167 W.Va. 434, 448 (1981) (the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine \u201cbars litigation arising from injuries received as a consequence of First Amendment petitioning activity, regardless of the underlying cause of action asserted by the plaintiffs\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">To sum up, \u00a7 59H, although not limited to matters of public concern, must be construed, for constitutional reasons, not to preclude Duracraft\u2019s action alleging a violation of its preexisting agreement of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judge\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 special motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-5\"> \u201cSLAPP\u201d is an acronym for \u201cStrategic Litigation Against Public Participation.\u201d The acronym was coined by Professors Penelope Canaan and George Pring of the University of Denver.

App. Ct. at 81 n.7, \u201cIt would have advanced consideration of this case substantially, both here and below, if . . . [both] parties had investigated and briefed the applicable legislative history.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b610-9\"> Other changes, not material to this controversy, were made in the Senate on December 21, 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b611-6\"> The preamble to House No. 1520 states that the \u201cLegislature finds and declares that full participation by persons and organizations and robust discussion of issues before legislative, judicial, and administrative bodies and in other public fora are essential to the democratic process . . . .\u201d The earlier House No. 3033 had inserted the words \u201cof public concern\u201d immediately after the words \u201cdiscussion of issues.\u201d Both House No. 3033 and House No. 1520 conclude with a reference to \u201ccitizens who have participated in matters of public concern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In this case, where we conclude that the enacting part of the statute, seen in the light of its legislative history, is plain, we attach no interpretive significance to the content of the preamble. See <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>405 Mass. 390, 395 ? 76 (1989) (\u201cStatements regarding the scope or purpose of an act that appear in its preamble may aid the construction of doubtful clauses, but they cannot control the plain provisions of the statute\u201d); Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.04, at 146-147 (5th ed. 1992) (\u201c[T]he settled principle of law is that the preamble cannot control the enacting part of the statute in cases where the enacting part is expressed in clear, unambiguous terms\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\"> Given the legislative history of \u00a7 59H, we attach no importance \u2014 as Duracraft would have us do \u2014 to public statements attributed to the principal proponent of the legislation in the House. Those statements purport to identify the concern of the Legislature: \u201ca person or group who has expressed an opinion on a matter of public concern.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\"> The elimination from \u00a7 59H of any requirement that the petitioning activities involve \u201cissues of public concern\u201d had the effect of broadening the statute as compared to the original draft in House No. 3033. Section 59H as it now stands is as extensive as the full'.reach of the petitioning clause of the First Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\"> \u201cAssuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the availability of c. 231, \u00a7 59H, is not limited to issues of public concern, to what extent, if at all, does the defendants\u2019 assertion of the right of petition under \u00a7 59H defeat, as matter of law, the plaintiff\u2019s asserted claims arising from its pre-existing confidentiality agreement with the defendant Marino?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b612-9\"> The defendants\u2019 immunity argument is based on the so-called <em>NoerrPennington </em>doctrine. That doctrine grew from two Supreme Court cases, <em>Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference </em>v. <em>Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., </em>365 U.S. 127 (1961), and <em>United Mine Workers </em>v. <em>Pennington, </em>381 U.S. 657 (1965). \u201cThe essence of the doctrine is that parties who petition the government for governmental action favorable to them cannot be prosecuted under the antitrust laws even though their petitions are motivated by anticompetitive intent.\u201d <em>Video Intl. Prod., Inc. </em>v. <em>Warner-Amex Cable Communications, Inc., </em>858 F.2d 1075, 1082 (5th Cir. 1988). Exceptions to the doctrine have to do with sham petitioning activities. See note 19, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b612-10\"> While the judge permitted limited discovery (i.e., the depositions of Marino and the president of Duracraft), the record appendix does not include evidence of that work, if there was any. The record appendix does include various affidavits, but none was filed in opposition to the defendants\u2019 special motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\"> It is settled law that petitioning activity which is nothing more than \u201cbaseless litigation\u201d is not protected by the First Amendment. See <em>Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., </em>508 U.S. 49, 60-61 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b614-5\"> We reject the defendants\u2019 argument that a judge <em>must </em>allow their special motion where the plaintiff fails to make any showing in response to the defendants\u2019 special motion. It is true, as the defendants emphasize, that the statute provides that the court \u201cshall grant . . . [the] special motion\u201d unless a showing is made by the plaintiff. \u201cHowever, the word \u2018shall\u2019 as used in statutes ... is not of inflexible signification and not infrequently is construed as permissive or directory in order to effectuate a legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 846 (1973). See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1375 (6th ed. 1990) (shall \u201cmay be construed as merely permissive or directory [as equivalent to \u2018may\u2019], to carry out the legislative intention . . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b614-6\"> Whether, or the extent to which, that assumption may be valid in cases involving petitioning activities which <em>also </em>implicate First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech or association, see <em>California Motor Transport Co. </em>v. <em>Trucking Unlimited., </em>404 U.S. at 510-511, we need not consider, for no such rights of the defendants are involved in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\"> Finally, Duracraft argues that Marino and Holmes are not \u201clegitimate petitioners\u201d and that they do not meet the threshold requirement for application of the statute. Both contentions rest on the same foundation: TTAB ruled that Holmes\u2019s deposition of Marino, its own employee, was not appropriate. \u201cA party cannot take discovery of itself. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">The TTAB decision, however, did not rule that Marino\u2019s deposition was not a statement made in connection with an issue being considered before them. The TTAB ruling merely limited the use of Marino\u2019s deposition, specifically noting that the deposition may still be used for impeachment purposes. The use of depositions in civil cases is generally so limited. See Mass. R.Civ.P.32(a)(l), 365 Mass. 787 (1974). Deposition testimony is, in our view, a statement made in connection with a judicial proceeding regardless of how the deposition itself is ultimately used. Compare <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>27 Cal. App. 4th 809, 821-822 (1994) (memorandum sent to fellow court reporters notifying them of the plaintiffs lawsuit, and seeking their support, held to be statement in connection with the underlying judicial proceeding); <em>Dove Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rosenfeld, Meyer &amp; Susman, </em>47 Cal. App. 4th 777, 784 (1996) (letter seeking endorsements for complaint to the State Attorney General found to be a statement made in connection with an official proceeding and covered by the anti-SLAPP statute). There is no merit to this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b615-10\"> Duracraft\u2019s complaint alleges claims sounding in tort as well as contract. The tort claims appear to depend upon the validity of the contract claim. If the contract claim fails, the remaining counts may fail with it. If the contract claim survives, the parties will be required to consider whether, on the authorities cited in the text, the tort claims are entitled to survive Duracraft\u2019s petitioning rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
