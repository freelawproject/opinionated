Porgue then started down the stairs. When Porgue was half-way down the stairs, the defendant, after a brief conversation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>fired a shot which hit the wall near Forgue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Charged with armed assault with intent to murder and with unlawful possession of a firearm not being present in his residence or place of business, the defendant was convicted of the lesser included offense of assault and of the unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">This appeal relates only to the latter conviction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant contending that he fell within a statutory exemption of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, and, in addition, that the trial judge, in responding to a question from the deliberating jury, impermis-sibly answered a question which should have been decided by the jury. We agree with the second contention and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">1. The defendant claims he was entitled to an acquittal on the ground that, as the owner of a three-family house, he was \u201cpresent in or on his residence or place of business\u201d and hence within the statutory exception of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10, as appearing in St. 1990, c. 511, \u00a7 2. That statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">\u201cWhoever, except as provided or exempted by statute, knowingly has in his possession ... a firearm, loaded or unloaded . . . without . . . being present in or on his residence or place of business . . . shall be punished .... The sentence imposed on such person shall not be reduced to less than one year, nor suspended . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The evidence was contradictory as to the position of the defendant when he fired the shot. He claimed that he opened his door but did not go into the hallway, while Forgue testified that the defendant was in the hall when he took aim at Forgue. The significance of the defendant\u2019s location is that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seay, </em>376 Mass. 735, 742-743 (1978), and its progeny, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunphy, </em>377 Mass. 453, 458-459 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Statham, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>582 (1995), establish that a firearm may, under the statutory framework, be legally kept in a home or place of business for self-protection if the possessor has a firearm identification card, but the home or business exemption is inapplicable to common areas over which the possessor lacks exclusive control.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In distinguishing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seay, </em>the defendant, acknowledging that the distinction was proffered \u201cat the risk of splitting hairs,\u201d points to the following language in <em>Seay, 376 </em>Mass, at 743:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201c[W]e hold that G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), prohibits the unlicensed carrying of a firearm in a foyer or other common area of an apartment building by one who merely happens to rent an apartment therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The defendant argues that neither an apartment house nor a tenant is involved in the present case, that the defendant-owner had exclusive control over the premises, and the tenants merely had a right of access to the common areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The argument is not persuasive. The focal point of our cases is not ownership, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Statham, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 583 (house had been purchased by the defendant, with his mother and aunt), but rather exclusivity of control, that is, that possession be in an area not used in common with others. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>391 Mass. 853, 862 (1984) (\u201cdwelling\u201d in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A [\u201ccastle\u201d statute], does not extend beyond person\u2019s own apartment and perhaps any separate areas subject to his exclusive control; court also cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seay, supra, </em>to show that its definition of \u201cdwelling\u201d under c. 278, \u00a7 8A, accords with the interpretation of analogous statutes); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>Jefferson, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 687 (1994) (\u201cdwelling\u201d in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A, is apartment itself and does not comprise the nonexclusive hallway outside the apartment).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We reject the defendant\u2019s additional contention that the defendant was at his place of business. Even if we were to accept the dubious proposition that the defendant\u2019s apartment could be viewed as his place of business merely because he was the landlord, we reject the notion that a landlord residing in one apartment can, without more, claim the whole house, or the common areas, as his place of business. The defendant relies on <em>Roumel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>261 A.2d 240, 242 (D.C. 1970), where a dangerous weapon was used in a hallway. The statute in that case differs from G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court considered the defendant, a cotrustee and beneficiary of a trust owning the building, a part owner, and in possession of the building, and also stated, \u201cIn fact, under the circumstances, the building could reasonably be regarded as his place of business.\u201d 261 A.2d at 242. If and to the extent that <em>Roumel </em>differs from our interpretation of c. 269, \u00a7 10, we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The rationale for our statute was expressed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seay, 376 </em>Mass. at 742-743: \u201cThe interest of an apartment dweller in defending himself \u2014 the only apparent reason for allowing him to carry a firearm in his own dwelling in the first place \u2014 is clearly attenuated when he passes his doorway to enter a common area offering easy retreat.\u201d This rationale applies with equal force to the exemption for a person\u2019s place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">2. During deliberations, the jury sent the judge the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\u201cYour Honor: We request a clarification concerning the law on the charge of possession of a firearm outside a residence. If a person\u2019s arm extended beyond the threshold of his residence, if his arm extends into the common area, does that constitute the person\u2019s being outside his residence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Before answering the question the judge considered and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that: \u201c[T]he person is the whole body. This is just a part of the body.\u201d Over his objection, the judge in writing answered the jury\u2019s question, \u201cMadam Foreperson: The answer is yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">As indicated earlier, there was a dispute as to the crucial question whether the defendant was in the hall or whether he was in his apartment when he fired his gun. The statute does not define \u201cpresent in or on his residence or place of business.\u201d Based on cases holding that other questions under the statute, not dissimilar from the one asked by the jury, are questions for the fact finder, we agree with the defendant that the question was one to be decided by the jury. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>326 Mass. 218 (1950), the defendant argued that the question whether a gun without a firing pin, and, in that condition incapable of discharging a bullet, was a \u201cmachine gun\u201d was a question of law. The court disagreed, holding it was a question of fact for the jury on appropriate instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 222. Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sperrazza, </em>372 Mass. 667, 670 (1977), the court stated, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, supra, </em>\u201cWhether a gun is a \u2018firearm\u2019 as defined is a question of fact for the jury.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 518 (1980), the question was whether the defendant fell within the exemption of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, fourth par. <em>(h), </em>as amended through St. 1973, c. 892, \u00a7 4, which makes \u00a7 129C inapplicable to nonresidents traveling in or through the Commonwealth, \u201cprovid[ed] that any rifles or shotguns are unloaded and <em>enclosed in a case\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). We held that \u201c[wjhether a case is sufficient to establish the existence of the exemption ... is a question of fact to be answered by a fact finder under appropriate instructions . . . .\u201d 10 Mass. App. Ct. at 524. We also held the trial judge was in error in asking the jury, \u201cDo you think that the cardboard box is a case or do you think that the statute calls for a container that is in fact a case for a gun?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522. As matter of law, we construed the statute as not requiring that a rifle be enclosed in a case that is specifically manufactured as a gun case. <em>Ibid. </em>Again, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Statham, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 584 n.3, we indicated that the question whether a defendant had exclusive control of a backyard was a factual determination for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Penal statutes must be strictly construed. <em>Commonwealth</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>v. <em>Perry, </em>391 Mass. 808, 813 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>405 Mass. 200, 205 (1989). The statute does not state, and judicial construction has not established, that a person is not \u201cpresent in or on his residence or place of business\u201d if his or her arm is extended into a common hallway. As we said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 522, quoting from <em>Libby </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R.R., </em>273 Mass. 522, 525-526 (1930), \u201cjjpjenal statutes must be construed strictly\u201d and not extended \u201cby the probable or supposed intention of the legislature as derived from doubtful words .... [I]n order to charge a party with a penalty, he must be brought within [a statute\u2019s] operation, as manifested by express words or necessary implication.\u201d The defendant, if he extended his arm within the hallway, was not as matter of law brought within the statute. See <em>Yoon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>594 A.2d 1056, 1065 (D.C. 1991). The question was one for the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Our construction of the statute makes it unnecessary to discuss the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506 (1995), upon which the defendant relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The judgment on the indictment charging the defendant with violating G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), is reversed, and the verdict is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\"> Forgue and the defendant presented different accounts of the incident. Forgue claimed that as he came down the stairs, the defendant started to swear at him, said he would kill him, pulled a gun, aimed it at Forgue\u2019s head, and fired. The defendant\u2019s version was that he told Forgue to stop, that Forgue looked at the gun and said, \u201cThat\u2019s a starter\u2019s pistol\u201d (i.e., not a real gun), whereupon the defendant said, \u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d and shot against the wall.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b468-10\"> The defendant received a suspended sentence on the assault, and a mandatory one-year imprisonment sentence on the unlawful possession charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\"> The statute was amended (St. 1990, c. 511, \u00a7 2) to include specifically the exemption for a person present in his or her residence or place of business. As appears in 1990 House Doc. No. 1291, the amendment as originally drafted stated: \u201cThe purpose and intent of this act is to impose a minimum one year mandatory jail sentence without exception for any person who is unlicensed to possess a firearm, rifle or shotgun away from his home or place of business and does so.\u201d Although the words \u201caway from\u201d might connote a somewhat broader exception, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Statham, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 584, we \u201cpresumed\u201d that the Legislature in amending the act was aware of the judicial decisions and \u201cmerely put in statutory form what already had been declared by judicial exposition\u201d (internal citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\"> That statute provided: \u201cNo person shall within the District of Columbia carry either openly or concealed on or about his person, except in his dwelling house or place of business <em>or on other land possessed by him.\u201d </em>D.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 22-3204 (1967) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b472-8\"> An appropriate answer to the jury\u2019s question in this case, see <em>supra </em>at 438, could have been: This is not a question of law. It is for you to determine under the facts as you decide them whether the defendant was present in or on his residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
