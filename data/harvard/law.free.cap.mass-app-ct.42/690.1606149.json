The arbitrator declared that the committee had violated Article XIX<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the collective bargaining agreement by refusing to honor the successful bid of a school custodian for a vacancy at another school and directed the committee to award the job to him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The committee had argued that it could not make the transfer because the Education Reform Act had given that power to the school\u2019s principal and the superintendent. Although the Superior Court judge determined that the arbitrator had erred in concluding that the committee, rather than the school\u2019s principal and the superintendent, possessed the power to approve the transfer under the Education Reform Act\u2019s amendment of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, the judge ruled that the arbitrator had not acted beyond his powers and affirmed the award. On appeal, the committee argues that the arbitrator\u2019s ruling infringes upon the exclusive managerial powers of the school\u2019s principal and the superintendent under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, and was beyond his power to make. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">We summarize the facts, which are not in dispute, in this case. On September 1, 1993, the committee posted a notice for a job vacancy at the Reilly School for the position of a day shift custodian. The posting was conducted in accordance with Article XIX of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. The bid was won by David LeToumeau who was then working for the committee as a custodian at the Butler School. The committee advised the union that LeToumeau was the successful bidder on September 9, 1993, but later on the same date notified the union that the job would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>awarded to LeToumeau because the Education Reform Bill, approved as an emergency act on June 18, 1993, rendered such contracts null and void. As a result, LeTomeau did not transfer to the Reilly School.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The union filed a grievance, and the matter proceeded to arbitration by agreement of the parties on the question whether the committee had violated Article XIX of the collective bargaining agreement when it failed to honor the bid of LeToumeau to transfer to the Reilly School.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">There is no question that the Education Reform Act shifted the responsibility for the hiring and firing of teachers and \u201cother personnel assigned to the school\u201d from the committee to school principals subject to the supervision of school superintendents. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, as amended by St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 53; <em>Higher Educ. Coordinating Council </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Assn., </em>423 Mass. 23, 29 n.6 (1996). Section 59B specifically provides: \u201cPrincipals employed under this section shall be responsible, consistent with district personnel policies and budgetary restrictions and subject to the approval of the superintendent, for hiring all teachers, instructional or administrative aides, and other personnel assigned to the school, and for terminating all such personnel, subject to review and prior approval by the superintendent and subject to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d Although the word \u201chire\u201d is not specifically defined, we see no reason why it should not be given its ordinary meaning, \u201cemploy.\u201d See <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>392 Mass. 407, 415 (1984). Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 1072 (1993). Because it is apparent that the Legislature sought to give to school principals the power to select all teachers and staff assigned to their school, subject to the approval of the school superintendent, we conclude \u00a7 59B embraces transfers as well as new hires; otherwise, the principal\u2019s power of selection would be thwarted. We conclude, therefore, that the provision of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement which vests the ultimate approval of the selection of a custodian to fill a vacancy in the school committee is in conflict with \u00a7 59B as amended by the Education Reform Act. Because G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 59B, is not one of the statutes specifically enumerated in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>1(d), </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>over which collective bargaining agreements prevail, this provision must yield to \u00a7 59B. <em>School Comm. of Natick </em>v. <em>Education Assn. of Natick, </em>423 Mass. 34, 39 (1996). Accordingly, the arbitrator\u2019s ruling which directs a result contrary to \u00a7 59B was beyond his power to make and must be vacated. <em>Massachusetts Hy. Dept. </em>v. <em>American Fedn. of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, Council 93, </em>420 Mass. 13, 16 (1995). G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>1(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">In so ruling we do not, however, invalidate those provisions of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement which establish the process for filling vacancies by bidding and seniority so long as the prior approval which was vested in the school committee rests now with the principal and superintendent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We see nothing in the Education Reform Act which in any way changed the collective bargaining rights of school custodians relating to the terms and conditions of their employment. In fact, at the time of the enactment of the Education Reform Act, the Legislature was cognizant that the school committee remained the exclusive bargaining agent for the school district, St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 62, and that the principal\u2019s and superintendent\u2019s powers of appointment must be exercised in a manner consistent with district personnel policies, St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 53. We do not perceive the procedures for filling vacancies to infringe upon the powers of the principal and superintendent so long as they retain the right of approval of the employee selected pursuant to those procedures. See <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>373 Mass. 53, 56-58 (1977) (arbitrator had the authority to determine if school committee had violated collective bargaining agreement in disapproving the transfer requests of school principals where right of transfer construed to be condition of employment and where the committee had the right to disapprove any inappropriate request for transfer).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Similarly, we conclude that there is nothing in the Education Reform Act to suggest that \u00a7 59B was intended to supersede or supplant any rights that school custodians have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>under G. L. c. 31, the civil service law. While the power of appointment of staff for a school has now been vested in school principals and superintendents, their power, like that of the school committee before them, remains subject to the provisions of G. L. c. 31, if applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, and a new judgment shall enter vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-14\"> The pertinent provisions of Article XIX provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">\u201cA.
