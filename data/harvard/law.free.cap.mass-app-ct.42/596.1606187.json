(together referred to as the appellees).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">The appellees are each organized as business corporations under the provisions of G. L. c. 156B. The ATB ruled (I) that to qualify for the charitable exemption under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a corporation need not be organized under G. L. c. 180 and (ii) that \u201cfor purposes of qualification for exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>tion under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, [Third], a functional test is applied, and reference is made to the language of its charter or articles of organization, its by-laws, the objects which it serves, and its declared purposes and the work performed by it.\u201d We take these rulings to mean that the operative corporate documents and the actual operations of the appellees were determined by the ATB to have qualified as a \u201ccharitable organization\u201d for purposes of c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The town challenges these rulings, arguing that the appel-lees are not entitled to the charitable exemption from local property taxes because of their incorporation under G. L. c. 156B which, inter alia, permits the distribution of assets to stockholders. The issues presented do not appear to have been the subject of any previously reported appellate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We summarize the facts, none of which is challenged by the town in its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">H-C Health Services, Inc., owns and operates a 120-bed licensed nursing home in South Hadley. The population at the nursing home is predominantly Medicaid patients. All the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock are owned by a charitable corporation organized and existing under the provisions of G. L. c. 180. The primary purpose of the corporation, as stated in its \u201cRestated Articles of Organization,\u201d is to operate, and provide services to, residential or day-care facilities for elderly or infirm persons. Its articles also provide that the corporation intends that it be entitled to an exemption from Federal income taxes by qualifying as a charitable corporation under the provisions of \u00a7 501(c)(3) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended. Thus, the articles also provide that no part of its assets or earnings may enure to the private benefit of any individual or legal entity, and that upon liquidation or dissolution its assets shall be distributed only to a \u00a7 501(c)(3) organization. The corporation has been granted \u00a7 501(c)(3) status by the Internal Revenue Service, and it has received a sales tax exemption certificate from the Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The corporate characteristics of Falls Nursing Home, Inc., are identical to those of H-C Health Services, Inc. Prior to its present inactive status, it also operated a nursing home in South Hadley predominantly for medicare and medicaid patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The text of the third clause of \u00a7 5 does not support the town\u2019s appeal. The exemption from the local tax on personal property is available to a \u201ccharitable organization\u201d if it is \u201cincorporated in the commonwealth.\u201d The exemption for the local tax on real estate is available where the real estate is either \u201cowned by or held in trust for a charitable organization.\u201d Nowhere does the statute provide that, in order to qualify as a charitable organization, the taxpayer must be incorporated under c. 180. Further, the ATB found, as we have said, that the corporate documents, and the actual operations of the appellees, were such as to qualify the appellees as \u201ccharitable organizations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">There is no reason to import the provisions of c. 180 to identify the circumstances under which the exemption provided in G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third, is not available. Subparagraph (a), quoted in note 2, <em>supra, </em>performs that task: any distribution of assets for private benefit is a disqualifying event. No such disqualification is present in this case; see note 5, <em>infra. </em>Moreover, \u201can entity may be treated as charitable for one purpose and not for another.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Wey-mouth Agrie. &amp; Indus. Soc., </em>400 Mass. 475, <em>All </em>n.3 (1987) (citing cases holding that Boston Symphony Orchestra is subject to local property tax but is entitled to the charitable immunity). The issue is solely whether the appellees are \u201ccharitable organizations\u201d for the purpose of the exemption from local property taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The ATB\u2019s \u201cfunctional test\u201d for the determination of the availability of the third clause\u2019s exemption has been approved by the Supreme Judicial Court. In <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Vin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>cent Club, </em>351 Mass. 10, 12 (1966), the court held that whether a taxpayer is a charitable organization qualified under the third clause depends upon \u201cthe language of its charter or articles of association, constitution and by-laws, and upon the objects which it serves and the method of its administration . . . [o]r, as otherwise expressed, upon the declared purposes and the actual work performed.\u201d Nowhere is there any intimation in this passage that what matters is the chapter of the General Laws under which the taxpayer was organized.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See also <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Cambridge, </em>384 Mass. 536, 541 (1981) (\u201cExemption is extended to the real property of a corporation with charitable purposes, provided it is occupied by the corporation for such purposes\u201d). Moreover, the fact that the appellees have been granted exemption from Federal taxation by reason of its status as a charitable corporation is relevant to this inquiry. This is because \u201c[t]he requirements for exemption under I.R.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) are virtually identical to those under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">What does matter, as the court has repeatedly emphasized, is how the organization describes itself, and what in fact it does. The language of the charter of the appellees \u2014 dedication to the care of the elderly and the infirm, with no financial benefit permissibly flowing to private investors \u2014 is the language of a charitable organization, and the operation of a nursing home for the elderly and the infirm is the work of a charitable corporation. It is substance, not form, that counts, see <em>Brown, Rudnick, Freed &amp; Gesmer </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>389 Mass. 298, 302-303 (1983), but it is form only that the town would find dispositive of the issue before us.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we find no error in the decision of the ATB.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-15\"> The third clause, as amended through St. 1969, c. 129, exempts personal property \u201cof a charitable organization . . . incorporated in the commonwealth,\u201d and it exempts \u201creal estate owned by or held in trust for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>charitable organization and occupied by it or its officers for the purposes for which it is organized . . . provided, however, that: \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">\u201c(a) If any of the income or profits of the business of the charitable organization is divided among the stockholders, the trustees or the members, or is used or appropriated for other than literary, benevolent, charitable, scientific or temperance purposes or if upon dissolution of such organization a distribution of the profits, income or assets may be made to any stockholder, trustee or member, its property shall not be exempt. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-10\"> The town did not request the ATB to make findings of fact, and it made none. Only \u201cpure questions of law\u201d are preserved on appeal. <em>Supermarkets Gen. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>402 Mass. 679, 681-682 (1988). The town is also foreclosed from arguing that the evidence did not warrant findings that are implicit in the ATB\u2019s decision. See <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Assessors of Foxborough, </em>369 Mass. 855, 856 n.3 (1976). This leaves the material facts presented by the appellees, and necessary to the decision of the ATB, the governing facts for this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\"> The fact that the Vincent Club was incorporated under c. 180 does not defeat the relevance of the decision. The fact of incorporation under c. 180 is recited among the historical facts set out in the opinion. Thereafter it is not mentioned in the context of the issue of the claimed exemption under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\"> The town also argues that each of the appellees has a stockholder, and the assets of each of the appellees may be distributed to the stockholder, thereby disqualifying the exemption by reason of subparagraph (a) of the third clause. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Where, as here, the stockholder is organized under c. 180, and the restated articles of the appellees expressly prohibit any distribution of assets for private benefit, there is no loss of the exemption. Of course, as the town points out, the appellees may change their articles of organization to permit the distribution of their assets to private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>individuals for their private benefit. That may be so, and, if and when that occurs, the appellees may lose their exemption. As matters now stand, such a distribution is not permissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
