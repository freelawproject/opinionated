After a four-day jury trial, the defendant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. She appeals, claiming that the judge erred in denying her motion for a required finding of not guilty and that the prosecutor\u2019s summation prejudiced her right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>We summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. The victim and the defendant were involved in a sexual relationship for more than a year. The victim saw the defendant about once a week. On the night of December 7, 1993, the victim went off duty about 11:30 p.m. He and other police officers went to Tim\u2019s Tavern where the victim telephoned the defendant. Sometime after midnight, following the departure of his companions, the victim left the tavern and went to the defendant\u2019s apartment in Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">At 1:51 a.m. on December 8, the defendant made a \u201c911\u201d call. She said, \u201cOh, my God, someone just got shot.\u201d She identified the victim as the person who was shot, and she added, \u201cGet here right away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">At about 2:00 a.m. three police officers \u2014 Officers Cud-dyer, Magoon, and Clark \u2014 received a radio dispatch directing them to the defendant\u2019s apartment. They arrived a few minutes later, and, as they went up in the elevator, Cuddyer heard a woman yelling, \u201cOh, my God. Oh, my God.\u201d Officer Cuddyer was the first one to speak to the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response to his questions the defendant said, \u201cWe were playing with the gun and the gun went off.\u201d Officer Cuddyer, now joined by Officers Magoon, Clark, and Willis (who had just arrived), pressed for more details. The defendant added, \u201cWe were playing with the gun, he handed me the gun, and the gun went off.\u201d Officer Cuddyer asked for the gun. The defendant said, \u201cI dropped it.\u201d Where did she drop it?, he asked. The officers looked around the living room and saw the gun against the exterior wall. Later, the defendant told Officer Magoon, \u201cOh my God. Oh my God. It was an accident.\u201d Officer Clark also talked with the defendant. The defendant told him that it was an accident, that she and the victim were playing with the gun and it went off, that she was holding the gun when it went off, and that she and the victim were both standing in the living room when the gun went off.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The defendant told Officer Willis that she and the victim were \u201cembracing . . . just playing\u201d and then the victim said, \u201cDo you want to kill me?\u201d He removed the gun from his holster and the gun went off, she said.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">About 2:35 a.m., Sergeant Detective Keeler of the Boston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Police homicide unit arrived. The defendant told the detective about the arrival of the victim, their preliminary conversation regarding the victim\u2019s duty that evening, how they embraced one another, and that, after embracing, the victim took his gun out of the holster and said to the defendant, \u201cGail, do you want to kill me?\u201d as he handed the gun to the defendant. The gun went off, and the victim stumbled toward the hallway where he was found. Sergeant Keeler continued to press for a more detailed explanation of what had occurred. At Sergeant Keeler\u2019s request, the defendant reenacted the scene with Sergeant Keeler acting as the victim. Sergeant Keeler observed, \u201cShe couldn\u2019t go any further. She couldn\u2019t demonstrate as to the mechanics, the actuality of [the victim] handing her the gun, of how the gun got into her hand, of how the gun went off.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cShe just kept her hands to her side . . . and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The gun was found to the right of where the victim would have been standing. An autopsy disclosed that a single bullet went through the victim\u2019s chest from front to back, passing through the aorta, the largest artery in the body. The weapon that fired the bullet was within inches of the victim\u2019s chest. The autopsy also disclosed that the victim\u2019s blood contained .12 grams of ethanol \u2014 equivalent to the consumption of approximately five ounces of straight whisky within approximately forty minutes to one and one-half hours before death, or sixty ounces of beer in the same period, according to the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness who performed the autopsy. The victim was five feet, nine inches, tall, and weighed about one hundred seventy-five pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Sergeant Spillane arrived at about 2:16 a.m. He was present while the defendant was being questioned by Sergeant Keeler in the living room. He acknowledged that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>dant never said she pulled the trigger, but he did see her gesticulate while she was answering Sergeant Keeler\u2019s questions. Sergeant Spillane reenacted the gestures, which counsel described for the record: \u201c[Y]ou just took your right hand and stuck out your index finger and had your thumb in the air and were pressing it back and forth . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Officer Dennis Harris arrived about 2:50 a.m. While the defendant was answering Sergeant Keeler\u2019s questions, he saw her \u201csqueezing her right index finger repeatedly while making the statements to Sergeant Keeler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">An expert witness for the Commonwealth testified that it took eight to eight and one-half pounds of pressure to pull the trigger of the gun. A police fingerprint expert was unable to make a print identification from the gun or any of the ammunition recovered from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">A ballistics expert testified that a nine-millimeter Glock firearm \u2014 the weapon in this case \u2014 contains three internal safety mechanisms: the trigger guard, the firing pin safety, and the drop safety. The trigger guard, which is \u201clocated in the trigger\u201d and protrudes from the trigger, prevents the trigger from being pulled back. The only way the trigger can be moved from a rigid position is by depressing the protruding safety lever; when the lever is depressed, the trigger may be pulled and the weapon fired. The firing pin safety prevents the firing pin from striking the cartridge until the trigger is pulled. The drop safety prevents the weapon from firing by any occurrence or accident other than by pulling the trigger. Thus, even with a live round in the chamber, the weapon cannot, under any circumstances, be fired except by first releasing the trigger guard. The expert also testified that Boston police officers are required to carry their weapons with a round in the chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The ammunition clip for the Glock had a capacity of seventeen rounds of ammunition. Fourteen rounds were found in the victim\u2019s clip. The spent cartridge of a fifteenth round was found in the chamber; it had not been ejected properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The defendant did not testify. At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, and at the close of all the evidence, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty. Each motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">The judge\u2019s charge was thorough, lucid, and accurate. The judge described voluntary manslaughter, involuntary man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>slaughter, the words \u201creckless or wanton,\u201d and the subjective and objective components of reckless or wanton conduct. The judge instructed the jury that \u201cthe Commonwealth must show that grave dangers to others were apparent and the defendant chose to run the risk rather than alter her conduct so as to avoid the act or omission which cause the harm. The standard of wanton and reckless conduct depends both on what the defendant knew and how a reasonable person would have acted knowing these facts.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 398-399 (1944). He emphasized that, if the unintentional killing was the result of an accident which the Commonwealth did not disprove beyond a reasonable doubt, or of ordinary negligence or gross negligence, the jury could not find the defendant guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In this manner the case went to the jury to choose between an accident or manslaughter (voluntary or involuntary). It is also significant that, after beginning their deliberations, the jury returned to the court room twice with requests to be re-instructed: first, on the elements of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter and, second, on the definition of \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">1. <em>The defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty. </em>The Commonwealth, as we have said, had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim\u2019s death did not come about as the result of an accident. The pivotal issue is whether, as matter of law, the Commonwealth carried that burden. More particularly, \u201cthe crucial point [is] that proof of. . . [wanton or reckless conduct] depended on proof of the absence of accident.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zezima, </em>387 Mass. 748, 756 (1982), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. 189, 207 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The jury could have found these undisputed and critical facts. First, the defendant admitted being in possession, and thus control, of the firearm of the victim when it \u201cwent off.\u201d Second, the defendant and the victim were close to each other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>when the gun went off. Third, the victim was shot at very close range directly in the chest, and there were only two people in the room. Fourth, the victim\u2019s weapon could not have been fired without pulling the trigger. Expert testimony had established that the drop safety and -the firing pin safety prevented the firing pin from striking the cartridge under any circumstances other than by pulling the trigger with approximately eight pounds of pressure after the trigger safety had been released. The victim\u2019s claim that the gun inadvertently \u201cwent off\u201d conflicted with these uncontested facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The critical test for involuntary manslaughter is whether, in the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonable person would recognize that the conduct under scrutiny \u201cinvolves a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 303 n.14 (1992). \u201cBut even if a particular defendant is so stupid [or] so heedless . . . that in fact he did not realize the grave danger, he cannot escape the imputation of wanton or reckless conduct in his dangerous act or omission, if an ordinary normal man under the same circumstances would have realized the gravity of the danger.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass, at 398-399.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The jury rejected the theory \u2014 clearly permitted under the judge\u2019s forceful instructions \u2014 that what occurred was an accident, and we are of the opinion that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find the defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The fact that there was no direct evidence that the defendant pulled the trigger, or that the defendant knew there was a live round in the chamber,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or that the defendant knew that the ammunition clip contained live rounds, is not dispositive. The jury could have inferred that the gun \u201cwent off\u201d because the trigger was pulled, and that it was the defendant who, being in possession of the weapon, pulled the trigger when the forward end of the barrel of the gun was inches away from the victim\u2019s chest and the two were, as the defendant said, \u201cembracing.\u201d The trigger-pulling gestures of the defendant, which the jury could have taken as self-incriminating, would reinforce these inferences. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>423 Mass. 863, 868 (1996) (\u201cAn infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>ence drawn from circumstantial evidence \u2018need only be reasonable and possible; it need not be necessary or inescapable\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">From this, the jury were warranted in concluding that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances would have reason to know that a police officer\u2019s firearm would not be without live ammunition capable of being fired, and such a person would also recognize the gravity of the danger in pulling the trigger of a police officer\u2019s weapon when that weapon was pointed directly at a person\u2019s chest. Regardless of whether the defendant knew that the gun was ready to be fired when the trigger was pulled, the defendant should have known, as would any reasonable person, that the danger involved \u2014 the risk created by pulling the trigger of a police officer\u2019s weapon \u2014 was at least serious bodily injury to the victim. The victim\u2019s statement \u2014 \u201cGail, do you want to kill me?\u201d \u2014 however construed, would not negate (and might emphasize) the danger of pulling the trigger. It was that danger, that risk of serious harm, which the defendant assumed. It is of no consequence that the defendant may have meant no harm to the victim. \u201cWanton or reckless conduct does not involve a wilful intention to cause the resulting harm.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Twitchell, </em>416 Mass. 114, 122 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCauley, </em>355 Mass. 554 (1969), bears on the facts of this case. In <em>McCauley </em>there was sufficient evidence to warrant the verdict of guilty of murder, but the court held that the judge erred in withdrawing the issue of involuntary manslaughter from the jury for the evidence did not require a finding of an intent to kill on either of two theories. Even if the jury in that case concluded from the evidence, as they might, that the defendant had reason to know that there was five ammunition in the clip, but did not know that drawing back the slide and releasing it would insert a live round in the chamber with the result that squeezing the trigger would discharge the weapon, then the evidence would warrant a verdict of involuntary manslaughter. <em>Id. </em>at 561. Alternatively, if the jury concluded that the defendant believed that the firearm was not loaded with live ammunition, or was ignorant of whether the gun was loaded, or was recklessly indifferent to whether the gun was loaded with live ammunition or not, then evidence that the defendant placed the gun at a person\u2019s head, pulled back the hammer, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>squeezed the trigger would support the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201ctended to show . . . utter recklessness.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The evidence in this case justified the jury\u2019s verdict on either theory described in <em>McCauley. </em>Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bouvier, </em>316 Mass. 489, 496 (1944) (manslaughter judgment reversed where \u201cpertinent evidence would not warrant the jury in finding that the defendant knew or ought to have known that the gun was loaded,\u201d and the evidence would not support a finding that the discharge of the gun was other than accidental). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>346 Mass. 9, 12-13 (1963) (sufficient evidence of wanton or reckless conduct where the safety of the firearm was off, the gun was ready to fire, and \u201cthe defendant knew this . . .\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the finding that the victim\u2019s death was not the result of an accident and the jury were warranted in returning a verdict of guilty of involuntary manslaughter. There was no error in the denial of the motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">2. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>We comment briefly on the defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the prosecutor\u2019s summation. First, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly commented on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. This claim turns on Sergeant Keeler\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s response to his questions immediately following the shooting. See note 2, <em>supra, </em>and related text. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were not improper. The comments were directed to the defendant\u2019s conduct \u2014 her lack of responsiveness \u2014 immediately following the shooting and not on her failure to testify at the trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>418 Mass. 76, 83 (1994). Moreover, the judge repeatedly emphasized the presumption of innocence, the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof, and that no unfavorable infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>ence could be drawn from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on these comments of the prosecutor was well within the discretion of the judge. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were inflammatory. The prosecutor referred to the fact that the victim \u201cis dead. He\u2019s gone. He\u2019s not coming back. . . [The victim] bleeds like any of us . . . his family grieves like anyone else\u2019s family .... I wish I could portray to you in this courtroom on that stand, but it\u2019s impossible to, what [the victim] went through for the last twenty-five feet[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] of his Ufe.\u201d We agree. These remarks did cross the line of permissibihty even taking into account the jury\u2019s capacity to \u201cdiscount hyperbole.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>411 Mass. 279, 287 (1991). The judge\u2019s instructions emphasized, however, that the jury were to determine the facts \u201cwithout prejudice and without fear and solely from a fair consideration of the evidence that was admitted during the course of the trial. . . .\u201d And he pointed out that the arguments of counsel did not constitute evidence. In the context of the judge\u2019s instructions and the jury\u2019s focus on the pertinent issues, indicated by their requests for reinstruction, the prosecutor\u2019s regrettable remarks were not so prejudicial as to merit reversal, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viriyahiranpaiboon, </em>412 Mass. 224, 232 (1992), and there was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We have reviewed additional remarks by the prosecutor, none of which were objected to at the trial but which the defendant now identifies as requiring reversal of the judgment. While the prosecutor on several other occasions did make additional inappropriate remarks \u2014 such as exalting the credibility of the police officers because they were the police \u2014 we do not conclude that what the prosecutor said was so extreme as to constitute a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s summation, considered as a whole and in light of the strength of the judge\u2019s charge, was not improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>411 Mass, at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-9\"> At the commencement of the trial, the defendant waived objection to the admission in evidence of most of the statements made by the defendant to the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\"> After this portion of Sergeant Keeler\u2019s testimony, the defendant objected to his characterization of what the defendant did or could not do. There was a bench conference at the conclusion of which the judge noted the defendant\u2019s objection. There was no motion to strike this portion of Sergeant Keeler\u2019s testimony. See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 3.8.1, at 87 (6th ed. 1994) (\u201cA motion to strike is . . . the proper means of eliminating an answer that is objectionable either on substantive grounds ... or on the ground that it is non-responsive\u201d). The defendant\u2019s brief does not argue the objection except to the extent the prosecutor made use of this portion of Keeler\u2019s testimony in his closing argument, discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\"> The defendant, having fairly raised the possibility of accident through the officers\u2019 testimony of the defendant\u2019s statements, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>391 Mass. 97, 108, cert, denied, 469 U.S. 840 (1984), <em>S.C., </em>405 Mass. 1104 (1989), was entitled to an instruction that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the shooting was not accidental. See <em>ibid., </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zezima, </em>387 Mass. 748, 756-757 (1982). The judge so instructed the jury; he defined an \u201caccident\u201d and discussed it in detail \u2014 \u201can unexpected happening that occurs without intention or design on a person\u2019s part.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\"> The trigger guard at some point had been released, obviously.
