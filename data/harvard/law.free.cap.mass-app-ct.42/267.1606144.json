(NEBS), discharge her from her job. As a result, Franclemont applied for unemployment compensation benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 151 A. Her claim was allowed and NEBS filed a timely appeal. After hearing, a review examiner of the Department of Employment and Training (department), relying on G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>reversed the allowance of benefits. The department\u2019s board of review (board) denied Franclemont\u2019s application for further review, rendering the review examiner\u2019s decision the final decision of the board. A judge of the District Court reversed the decision, and NEBS appeals. Because substantial evidence supports the review examiner\u2019s decision to deny unemployment benefits based upon Franclemont\u2019s violation of company rules, we affirm his decision. <em>Quintal </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Department of Employment and Training, </em>418 Mass. 855, 858-859 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">We summarize the review examiner\u2019s findings of fact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Franclemont worked for NEBS for over four years as a marketing manager until her termination on July 27, 1993. During the course of her employment she was informed of two company policies: one dealt with conflicts of interest and the other with preservation of proprietary information.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>January 25, 1993, Franclemont signed the acknowledgment form pertaining to the conflict of interest policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">On Monday, July 26, 1993, a fellow employee found a letter and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 from Franclemont to a competitor of NEBS left on a copy machine. The letter indicated that Franclemont had initiated a new marketing program at NEBS, and suggested that she could help the competitor company develop a similar program. When the documents reached her supervisor, Franclemont was told to stop working and go home. On route, she telephoned her secretary with instructions to delete certain files from her personal computer. His response was to erase the files and report the whole incident to the human resources department of NEBS. NEBS\u2019s officials managed to retrieve some of the files. The files revealed that Franclemont had sent the \u201cOffice Depot\u201d proposal, a sales proposal that contained pricing information, to a marketing company operated by a former NEBS employee. Upon being confronted by her managers, Franclemont admitted to sending both pieces of information. She declared, however, that she did not believe that either the offer to implement a marketing program or the sales proposal violated either of the company\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">As to the company rules, the review examiner found as follows:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201cThe policies were reasonable in that they served to protect the employer\u2019s confidential information and market competitiveness. The claimant knew she could be discharged for violating the policies and the employer enforced the policies uniformly by discharging the claimant in compliance with the language of the policies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Franclemont explained that the letter offering to implement a marketing program was a sham to help a personal friend who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>worked at the competitor\u2019s business. The review examiner found that excuse incredible in light of Franclemont\u2019s other testimony that she was actively seeking other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Franclemont challenges the decision on several grounds. First, she claims that she did not violate the conflict of interest policy by offering to implement a marketing program for another company because that company did not compete with NEBS. Second, she contends that the \u201cOffice Depot\u201d presentation did not contain any proprietary information. Therefore, she argues, the materials she transmitted were not confidential. She also claims the decision was improper because the board failed to make subsidiary findings as to her state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">As to the competition issue, neither party disputes the legal concept of competition. \u201cCompetition exists only where both parties are soliciting purchasers of similar goods in the same territory at the same time.\u201d <em>Silbert </em>v. <em>Kerstein, </em>318 Mass. 476, 479 (1945). See <em>Ar-Ex Products Co. </em>v. <em>Capital Vitamin &amp; Cosmetic Corp., </em>351 F.2d 938, 940 (1st Cir. 1965) (defining \u201ccompetition\u201d as seeking the same customers). In an earlier case, <em>Esso Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Secatore\u2019s, Inc., </em>246 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1957), the First Circuit analyzed the concept under the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act. There the issue was whether a gasoline retailer, and a corporation that supplied gasoline to both retailers and ultimate consumers (operators of fleets of vehicles, such as trucks and taxi cabs), were in competition with each other. <em>Id. </em>at 19. The court recognized that both parties sold a certain percentage of gasoline to ultimate consumers. <em>Id. </em>at 20. The court found the parties to be in competition, regardless of the fact that ultimate consumers represented a large portion of one company\u2019s sales and a small portion of the other\u2019s; both companies were actively soliciting business in the same market. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Brown Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>370 U.S. 294, 325, 336-337 (1962) (emphasizing the importance of commercial realities and reasonable interchangeability of product use in determining the existence of competition).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The finding that the two companies were competitors was a finding of fact. Whether businesses engage in commercial competitive conduct brings into play the \u201cexperience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge\u201d of the depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ment, and its finding on that question is entitled to considerable weight. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7) (1992 ed.). <em>Olechnicky </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>325 Mass. 660, 663 (1950). NEBS argues that the companies occupy the same market niches, while Franclemont claims the contrary. The review examiner\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence that the two companies occupy overlapping marketing niches. Here, the board made no subsidiary findings that Franclem-ont\u2019s disclosures were to a competitor, but the record amply supports that proposition. The record of the hearing suggests that both companies are engaged in similar, though not entirely consonant, lines of business. While the product is not identical, each engages in the business of selling checks. The competitor manufactures and sells bank checks; NEBS sells software-compatible \u201cpinfeed\u201d checks. The focus of NEBS\u2019s business is the manufacturing of continuous business forms, but the competitor markets certain types of such forms. The companies, then, do seek to sell similar goods to the same customers. See <em>Brown Shoe Co., supra. </em>In addition, as the court pointed out in Esso, as long as the volume of sales of the relevant product is not de minimis, the fact that one company may not engage in large-volume sales, while the other does, is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The review examiner also found that, in the course of her job search, Franclemont disseminated confidential pricing information in violation of the proprietary information policy. NEBS\u2019s policy defines proprietary information as information such as \u201cfacts, plans, and concepts connected to its financial operations or business strategy, commonly referred to as \u2018insider information.\u2019 \u201d The policy also prohibits NEBS employees from discussing \u201ccompany procedures, operations, research findings, sales results, or strategies.\u201d Franclemont transmitted a copy of the company\u2019s \u201cOffice Depot\u201d presentation to a person at Janus Marketing. This presentation detailed the structure of NEBS\u2019s shipping and handling charges. Because the structure of such charges varies among companies, such information can be considered \u201ccompany procedures\u201d within the meaning of the policy. This evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>supports the examiner\u2019s finding that the claimant disseminated proprietary information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The inquiry does not end there. According to the statute, conduct in violation of company policy must also be \u201cknowing.\u201d The review examiner found that the claimant knew of the policies, within the meaning of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e)(2). This presents a mixed question of law and fact. Cf. <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>364 Mass. 593, 595 (1974) (mixed question of law and fact whether claimant \u201cvoluntarily\u201d left work within the meaning of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25[e][l]). First, as a matter of law, what constitutes a \u201cknowing\u201d violation of a company policy for purposes of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e)(2)? Second, as a factual matter, did the employee know of the policies? \u201cTo the extent that an agency finding is one of fact, it must stand unless \u2018unsupported by substantial evidence.\u2019 [G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(8)(e)]. . . . On the other hand, to the extent that an agency determination involves a question of law, it is subject to de novo judicial review. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14(8)(c).\u201d <em>Raytheon, </em>364 Mass, at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">As a matter of law, an employee can only be deemed to have committed a \u201cknowing\u201d violation of an employer\u2019s rule or policy within the meaning of \u00a7 25(e)(2) if the employee acted intentionally. It is not sufficient that the employee merely be informed of the rule or policy. <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept, of Employment and Training, </em>423 Mass. 805, 808, 814-815 (1996) (court found review examiner committed error of law where examiner based \u201cknowing violation\u201d on fact that employee \u201cknew of the rule or policy by having been issued a copy of them [sic] and having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>instructed regarding them and avoidance of violations thereof\u2019). A mere violation of an employer\u2019s rule does not automatically justify a denial of benefits. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, 376 </em>Mass. 563, 566 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In interpreting the phrase \u201cknowing violation,\u201d we have stressed that the use of the term mandates investigation of the employee\u2019s state of mind. <em>Still, </em>423 Mass, at 810, and cases cited. To prove a \u201cknowing violation\u201d the employer must prove: \u201c(a) consciousness on the part of the employee of what it is she is doing and (b) awareness that she is in the process of violating a rule or policy of the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 813, quoting <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment and Training, 39 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 502, 510 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Here, the examiner made factual findings that Franclemont admitted distributing a copy of the \u201cOffice Depot\u201d presentation to Janus Marketing. In addition, she testified to having sent her resume and cover letter to another company while offering to establish a new marketing program for that company.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Whether the claimant can, in fact, be charged with awareness that she was in the process of violating NEBS\u2019s policy warrants a closer look. The record supports NEBS\u2019s position on this point. Mr. Whalen, the human resource manager of NEBS, testified that Franclemont was given a copy of the policies. In addition, she signed a form acknowledging her status as \u201cin compliance\u201d with the conflict of interest policy. It remains, however, that according to <em>Still, </em>an employer cannot satisfy its burden merely by showing that the employee was aware of the rule or policy. In regard to the \u201cOfiice Depot\u201d presentation, she testified that: (1) she did not believe the presentation contained proprietary information; and (2) when she forwarded the presentation, she claimed she was not aware that she was offending NEBS in any way. At the hearing, she testified that she understood the policies. She further testified that her interpretation of the policies merely differed from that of the employer. The examiner specifically found her testimony on this aspect of the claim \u201cnot credible\u201d because it was \u201cself-serving and . . . controverted by the considerable evidence of the claimant\u2019s job search activ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>ity.\u201d The examiner\u2019s finding on the factual issue is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The judgment is reversed and a new judgment is to enter affirming the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b299-14\"> General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(2), as amended through St. 1992, c. 26, \u00a7 19, reads in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">\u201c[N]o benefits shall be paid to an individual under this chapter . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201c(e) . . . after the individual has left work ...

See <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security,, </em>377 Mass. 94, 95-96 (1979). Here, the board based its decision on the fact that Franclemont was discharged for having violated company rules, and that such violation was not a result of her incompetence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\"> The District Court judge disputed the review examiner\u2019s findings that Franclemont violated NEBS\u2019s confidential information policy.

In this respect, the District Court judge exceeded his role and made findings unsupported by evidence in the record. \u201c[A] reviewing court is not empowered to determine the facts anew, or to judge credibility or to draw different inferences from the facts found.\u201d <em>Gnerre </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn.
