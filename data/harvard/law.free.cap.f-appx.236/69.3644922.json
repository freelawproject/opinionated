Smith now appeals her 51-month sentence, arguing that the sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-21\">The district court properly calculated Smith\u2019s advisory range of imprisonment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2)(C), at 33 to 41 months, which reflected a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. The district court then departed upwardly two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1, comment, (n.5), because the offense involved substantially more than 100 documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-22\">A sentencing court does not abuse its discretion in deciding to upwardly depart when its reasons for doing so (1) advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2); (2) are authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b); and (3) are justified by the facts of the case. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 416 n. 21 (5th Cir. 2005) (finding that a district court \u201cabuses its discretion if it departs on the basis of legally unacceptable reasons or if the degree of the departure is unreasonable\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>The upward departure imposed by the district court meets those criteria. Further, the extent of the departure, 10 months longer than the high end of the guidelines range, is also reasonable. <em>See e.g., United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492-93 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1025, 126 S.Ct. 713, 163 L.Ed.2d 543 (2005). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b94-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
