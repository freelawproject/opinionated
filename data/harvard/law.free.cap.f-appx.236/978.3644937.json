Castillo argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by characterizing his state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">Because Castillo has completed the confinement portion of his sentence, any argument that the term of incarceration should be reduced is moot, and the only portion of the sentence remaining for consideration is his term of supervised release. Castillo, however, has been removed from the United States. Because Castillo is barred from returning to the United States, and there is no indication that he has waived his right to be present for resentencing, Castillo\u2019s challenge to the validity of his sentence is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007). Therefore, the appeal is DISMISSED as to Castillo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">For the first time on appeal, Castillo also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Castillo\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Castillo contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Castillo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Castillo\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1003-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
