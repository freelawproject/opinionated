He contends that the district court judge was biased, that Schrempp has perjured himself, that the Texas Tech defendants are not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and that his RICO claims were not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-21\">However, Stephens does not brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s alternative grounds for dismissing the lawsuit against each of the defendants, specifically, that he failed to state a legally cognizable RICO claim against the Texas Tech defendants, that the claims against Chrysler were barred by res judicata, or that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over Schrempp. He has thus waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s alternate bases for dismissal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Stephens\u2019s conclusional assertion that these grounds for dismissal were error, raised for the first time in his reply brief, will not be considered. <em>See United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379, 1386 (5th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-22\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Chrysler and Schrempp\u2019s motion to strike exhibits attached to Stephens\u2019s reply brief, which are not part of the record on appeal, is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>AFFIRMED; MOTION TO STRIKE GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b169-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
