The district court determined that Craig had been previously convicted of three serious drug offenses or violent felonies and therefore qualified as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000). On appeal, Craig contends that the district court erred in determining that his Virginia conviction for burning a motor vehicle with intent to defraud, pursuant to Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-81 (Michie 2004),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> qualified as \u201carson\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 924(e). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), \u201c[i]n the case of a person who violates section 922(g) ... and has three prior convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be ... imprisoned not less than fifteen years.\u201d Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), a violent felony is a crime that is punishable by more than a year in prison and that has as one of its elements \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another ... or is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for purposes of \u00a7 924(e) is a legal question reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Haynes, </em>961 F.2d 50, 51 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">In applying the armed career criminal statute, this court uses a formal \u201ccategorical approach,\u201d looking only to the statutory definition of the predicate offense and not to the particular circumstances underlying the conviction. <em>United States v. Hairston, </em>71 F.3d 115, 117 (4th Cir.1995); <em>see generally James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1593-94, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the term \u201carson\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>is applied in \u201cthe generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most states.\u201d Therefore, the relevant issue is whether the crime of burning or destroying personal property under Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-81 corresponds to a modern generic definition of arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Craig contends that under Virginia law, arson is limited to the malicious burning of a dwelling house; however, Craig\u2019s support for this proposition is based on the common law definition of the crime in Virginia, which is not controlling on this issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 594, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (rejecting the use of common law definitions for defining terms under 924(e)). Rather, for the armed career criminal enhancement to apply, the Virginia statute must substantially correspond to the generic definition of arson as it is currently used and understood. <em>Id. </em>at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143. We find that the burning of personal property with intent to defraud as defined under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-81 substantially corresponds to the generic definition of arson for the purposes of \u00a7 924(e). <em>See United States v. Hathaway, </em>949 F.2d 609, 610 (2d Cir.1991) (holding that Vermont conviction for third-degree arson, defined as the willful and malicious burning of personal property, qualified as \u201carson\u201d under 924(e)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Craig\u2019s conviction under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-81 qualified as a predicate conviction for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Craig\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-12\">. Under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-81, it is a Class 4 felony for an individual to \u201cmaliciously, or with intent to defraud an insurance company or other person, set fire to or bum or destroy by any explosive device or substance, or cause to be burned, or destroyed by any explosive device or substance, or aid, counsel, or procure the burning or destroying by any explosive device or substance, of any personal property, standing grain or other crop ... if the thing burnt or destroyed, be of the value of $200 or more.\u201d A Class 4 felony in Virginia is punishable by a term of imprisonment of not less than two years nor more than 10 years. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-10(d) (Michie 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-6\">. The common law definition of arson is embodied in Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-77 (Michie 2004), which .makes it a felony to burn a \u201cdwelling house\u201d or other building where \"persons usually dwell or lodge.\u201d However, pursuant to \u00a7 18.2-81, Virginia has expanded the definition of the crime of arson to also include the burning of personal property. <em>See Schwartz v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 751, 594 S.E.2d 925, 927 (2004) (\"In separate statutes, the legislature has criminalized the arson of an occupied dwelling, on the one hand, and the arson of personal property, on the other.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">. Craig notes that in <em>Hathaway, </em>the Vermont statute defined third-degree arson as the \"malicious\u201d burning of personal property, but that Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-81 does not necessarily require malice, as a conviction can also be for \"intent to defraud.\u201d However, the Virginia courts have held that \u201cmalice\u201d is defined as a purposeful intent to do a wrongful act; therefore, in the case of arson, malice can be inferred from the fact that a person intentionally burned property to defraud an insurance carrier. <em>Hamm v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 150, 428 S.E.2d 517, 520 (1993) (\u201cThe fact that Code \u00a7 18.2-81 includes a separate provision for 'burning with intent to defraud an insurance company\u2019 does not exclude that wrongful act as being an act of malicious burning.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
