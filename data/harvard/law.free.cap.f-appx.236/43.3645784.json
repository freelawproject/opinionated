Cano-Lopez argues that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level based on his prior Texas drug conviction being a drug-trafficking offense within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). He contends that he was convicted under a statute that provides that a \u201cdelivery\u201d of drugs includes an \u201coffering to sell,\u201d which is not included in the guidelines definition of drug-trafficking activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Cano-Lopez did not make this specific argument in the district court. Thus, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). The court has determined that a district court plainly erred in enhancing a defendant\u2019s offense level based on a prior conviction under a similar Texas statute that also included an offer to sell a controlled substance within the meaning of a delivery. <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714-16 (5th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The error affected Cano-Lopez\u2019s substantial rights and the fairness of the proceeding because, in the absence of the error, his sentencing guidelines range would have been significantly lower than the sentence that he received. <em>Id. </em>at 716-17. Cano-Lopez\u2019s sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">Cano-Lopez argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 70-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">Cano-Lopez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Cano-Lopez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED, SENTENCE VACATED. REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b68-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
