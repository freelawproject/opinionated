Because the appellant did not appeal the BIA\u2019s decision upholding the immigration judge\u2019s deportation order, the only decision before us is the BIA\u2019s denial of the appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Thus, rather than reviewing the BIA\u2019s legal findings <em>de novo, </em>we review its decision to not reconsider its earlier determination under the highly deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). We must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision unless it is \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA adhered to precedent that it reasonably believed to be valid. Therefore, regardless of the actual status of <em>Renteria-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>322 F.3d 804, 814 (5th Cir.2002), the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">Second, Okoronkwo argues that the immigration judge erred in denying his request for a hardship waiver under \u00a7 216(c)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(c)(4)(B). Our Court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to grant reconsideration of its decision that Okoronkwo was not entitled to a waiver under \u00a7 1186a(c)(4)(B). <em>See Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 474-75 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
