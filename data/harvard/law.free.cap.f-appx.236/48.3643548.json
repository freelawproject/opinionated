Gallo appeals his conviction and sentence. He argues that the appellate waiver in his plea agreement is invalid. He also argues that his counsel was ineffective at sentencing and that his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government seeks to enforce the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-27\">The record reflects that Gallo knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty and waived his appellate rights. <em>See United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567-68 (5th Cir. 1992). Therefore, the appeal waiver is valid and bars Gallo\u2019s claims on appeal. <em>See id.; United States v. White, </em>307 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>336, 340-43 (5th Cir.2002). Although Gallo makes a claim of ineffective assistance for his lawyer\u2019s rescission of the <em>Booker </em>objection at sentencing, that claim does not go to the plea or waiver itself and, hence, the waiver bars it. <em>White, </em>307 F.3d at 340-43. Relatedly, Gallo\u2019s plea waiver \u2014 which waived \u201cclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d on habeas but allowed challenge to \u201cthe voluntariness of his plea of guilty of this waiver\u201d on direct appeal \u2014 was not overly broad because allowing challenge to the plea or waiver itself is what matters, and such a challenge, which can have as its predicate ineffective assistance, was not barred by the waiver of ineffective assistance claims on habeas here.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b72-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
