He argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>that his sentence is unreasonable as a matter of law because this court\u2019s use of a presumption of reasonableness for sentences imposed within the properly calculated guidelines range effectively reinstates the mandatory guidelines regime struck down in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent, but he raises it to preserve it for further review. The argument fails as the Supreme Court has since affirmed the use of a presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Belmontes\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Belmontes contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006); <em>United States v. Pinedas-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624 (5th Cir.2007). Belmontes properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b183-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
