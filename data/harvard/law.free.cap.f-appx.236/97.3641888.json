We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">Hamad, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a lawsuit against the United States on February 1, 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He complained about, <em>inter alia, </em>being harassed at airports and public places and the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s alleged misplacement of his tax returns. The case was initially delayed until Hamad paid outstanding court sanctions. On May 31, 2006, Hamad obtained a summons from the district court. He then sent a copy of the complaint and summons by certified mail to the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(i). The mailing was postmarked June 6, 2006, which was after the 120-day deadline for timely service. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crv. P. 4(m).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-16\">On July 25, 2006, the district court dismissed Hamad\u2019s suit without prejudice for failure to timely serve the defendants and for failure to duly prosecute the lawsuit. In its order of dismissal, the district court noted that Hamad was well known to the court for filing frivolous lawsuits and that \u201cMr. Hamad is well versed in the filing of lawsuits and knows he must serve the defendants that he makes outrageous allegations against within the 120 days following the filing of his complaint.\u201d Hamad did not file a motion for reconsideration but appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-17\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal for want of prosecution for abuse of discretion. <em>Larson v. Scott, </em>157 F.3d 1030, 1031 (5th Cir.1998). Dismissal for failure to effect timely service of process is also reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Lindsey v. U.S. R.R. Retirement Bd., </em>101 F.3d 444, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>445 (5th </em>Gir.1996). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m) governs the time limits for service. It provides: \u201cIf service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the court, upon motion or on its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff, shall dismiss the action without prejudice.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Hamad\u2019s service was untimely, and he offers no justification for the untimeliness. The government also notes that, to the extent that Hamad is bringing suit against the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Homeland Security, he has not served those agencies. In addition, the record does not indicate any attempt to pursue the suit. The district court was within its discretion to dismiss the complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b122-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-14\">. The suit was also filed against Joseph Nicholas, who, according to Hamad's complaint, is an \"illegal alien from Lebanon\u201d and whom Hamad sued for failure to comply with immigration laws. Hamad served an attorney named Jimmy Nassour on behalf of Nicholas, but Nassour notified the district court that he did not have authority to accept service as he did not represent Nicholas. Hamad does not specifically discuss his service of Nicholas on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
