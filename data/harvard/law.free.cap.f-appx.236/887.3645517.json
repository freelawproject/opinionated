We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">In April 2003, the <em>Clarion Ledger </em>reported that an internal memorandum from the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics (MBN) alleged that Pierce had engaged in some inappropriate and unethical activities while working at the MBN. The allegations in the memo were unfounded. In March 2005, Pierce sued the Clarion Ledger and the other defendants, alleging libel, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of privacy. Pierce subsequently amended his complaint to add a breach of contract claim. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment as to all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-18\">Pierce\u2019s breach of contract claim is based on his alleged status as a third party beneficiary to a contract between Frank Melton, director of the MBN, and Ana Radelat, a reporter for the <em>Clarion Ledger. </em>Pierce claims that Melton and Radelat had an oral contract wherein Melton promised to \u201cleak\u201d to Radelat a copy of the MBN internal memo implicating Pierce, and Radelat promised to keep the memo confidential and not print the information in the memo until the allegations had been thoroughly \u201cchecked out.\u201d Assuming without deciding that this would constitute a legally binding contract under Mississippi law, we hold that the record does not show the existence of such an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-19\">Pierce directs us to a portion of Melton\u2019s deposition where Melton states that he faxed a copy of the memo to Radelat. This evidence does not show that Radelat promised anything with regards to printing the information. There are other parts of Melton\u2019s deposition where he indicates that he had an \u201cexpectation\u201d and an \u201cunderstanding\u201d that the allegations were \u201cnot for print.\u201d But Melton never says that Radelat promised not to print the allegations before substantiating them. For her part, Radelat indicated in her deposition that she did not make any such promise. Because the record is devoid of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>any evidence that Radelat provided adequate consideration, Pierce cannot establish the existence of a contract between Melton and Radelat. The district court therefore properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Pierce\u2019s breach of contract claim because the contract fails for lack of consideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Summary judgment is also appropriate for Pierce\u2019s negligent infliction of emotional distress claim. As we noted in <em>Mitchell v. Random House, Inc., </em>there is no Mississippi precedent to support a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress based upon a written, noncommercial publication.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pierce has presented no authority indicating that our holding in <em>Mitchell </em>regarding Mississippi law is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Finally, summary judgment is appropriate for Pierce\u2019s invasion of privacy claim because the claim is barred by the one-year statute of limitations. Pierce argues that his claim is subject to a three-year limitation period. But section 15-1-35 of the Mississippi Code provides that a one-year statute of limitations applies to \u201c[a]ll actions for ... slanderous words concerning the person or title ... and for libels____\u201d Although a claim for invasion of privacy is not specifically enumerated in section 15-1-35, Pierce\u2019s claim is still subject to the one-year period because it is the same type of tort as those that are enumerated in the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pierce argues that Mississippi law is unsettled and that the question should be certified to the Mississippi Supreme Court. We disagree that the law is unsettled. Pierce cites one federal district court case that held that a three-year period applied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since that case was decided, however, numerous district courts have concluded that a one-year period applies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This court has likewise reached the same conclusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Most importantly, the Mississippi Supreme Court agrees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because he brought his claim outside the one-year period of limitations, his claim is barred as a matter of law and summary judgment is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">We AFFIRM. The motion to certify is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b912-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
