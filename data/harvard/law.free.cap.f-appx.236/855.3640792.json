He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment. McManus appeals, challenging the length of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-24\">\u201cThe ACA provides that in the absence of a governing federal statute, a person who commits a state crime on a federal enclave \u2018shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>75 F.3d 173, 176 (4th Cir.1996) (quoting 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 13(a)). Accordingly, a defendant prosecuted under the ACA \u201cmay be sentenced only in the way and to the extent that the person could have been sentenced in state court. For instance, a term of imprisonment imposed for an assimilated crime may not exceed the maximum term established by state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>We agree with McManus that for purposes of this case, the state maximum sentence was the maximum sentence that could have been imposed on him by a state-court judge. Under North Carolina\u2019s structured sentencing scheme, a defendant with McManus\u2019s criminal history could have been sentenced to a maximum of 10 months. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(d) (2005). The government, however, contends that the state statutory maximum for purposes of the ACA is 30 months, not 10 months, because the relevant North Carolina statute permits a 30-month sentence for a defendant in the highest criminal history category. We disagree. Even if Blakely\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sixth Amendment requirements were satisfied, a North Carolina sentencing court would have <em>no discretion </em>to sentence a defendant with McManus\u2019s criminal history score to anything above the aggravated maximum sentence of 10 months. <em>See </em>N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 15A-1340.13(e) (2005) (\u201cThe court may deviate from the presumptive range of minimum sentences of imprisonment specified for a class of offense and prior record level if it finds ... that aggravating or mitigating circumstances support such a deviation. <em>The amount of the deviation is in the court\u2019s discretion, subject to the limits specified in the class of offense and prior record level for mitigated and aggravated punishment. \u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Because 10 months is the maximum that <em>McManus </em>could have received under state law, we believe 10 months is the maximum state sentence for purposes of sentencing under the ACA. <em>See Pierce, </em>75 F.3d at 176 (explaining that a defendant prosecuted under the ACA \u201cmay be sentenced only in the way and to the extent that <em>the person </em>could have been sentenced in state court\u201d (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">We recognize, of course, that federal courts are not required to assimilate \u201cevery incident of a state\u2019s sentencing policy,\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>27 F.3d 111, 115 (4th Cir.1994), and that state sentencing provisions that conflict with federal sentencing policy will not be assimilated, <em>see Pierce, </em>75 F.3d at 176. Contrary to the government\u2019s suggestion, however, we cannot conclude that North Carolina\u2019s method for calculating criminal history points conflicts with federal sentencing policy simply because McManus would have received a higher criminal history score under the federal guidelines. Both the federal and state schemes recognize that repeat offenders should receive more severe sentences; that the federal and state schemes calculate the scores differently does not mean that the state scheme conflicts with a federal sentencing policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Under North Carolina\u2019s sentencing scheme, the maximum sentence in any given case is dependent upon the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors and the defendant\u2019s criminal history score. If we are not required to assimilate those portions of the North Carolina scheme, then federal courts could impose sentences that <em>could not </em>be imposed in state court. The ACA does not require a federal sentence to be identical to the sentence that would be imposed under state law, but it must be similar. <em>See Pierce, </em>75 F.3d at 176. We cannot conclude that a sentence that would be illegal under state law is nonetheless a \u201clike sentence\u201d within the meaning of the ACA. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>916 F.2d 147, 150 (4th Cir.1990) (explaining that \u201cthe \u2018like punishment\u2019 requirement of the [ACA] mandates that federal court sentences for assimilated crimes must fall within the minimum and maximum terms established by state law, and <em>that within this range of discretion </em>federal judges should apply the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Guidelines to the extent possible\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>893 F.2d 250, 254 (10th Cir.1989) (\u201c[T]he [ACA] requires courts to impose sentences for assimilative crimes that fall within the maximum and minimum terms established by state law. However, <em>within the range of discretion permitted to a state judge, </em>a federal judge should apply the federal sentencing guidelines to the extent possible.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the maximum sentence under North Carolina law was 10 months. Because the sentence imposed by the district court exceeded the maximum sentence available under state law, we reverse McManus\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-4\">. <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b881-10\">. We reject the government\u2019s contention that this issue was not raised below and must therefore be reviewed for plain error only. The PSR calculated McManus\u2019s sentence under the North Carolina Structured Sentencing Act, counsel for McManus argued for a sentence within the presumptive range of the Structured Sentencing Act, and counsel for the government argued that the court was bound only by the maximum sentence (30 months) that could be imposed on any defendant under North Carolina law. We believe this is sufficient to preserve the issue of what the maximum sentence is under North Carolina law and thus the maximum to which McManus could be sentenced under the ACA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b881-7\">ELLIS, Senior District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A_c\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">I am pleased to concur in the result reached in the <em>per curiam </em>opinion, but I nonetheless consider it necessary to write separately to underscore the narrow range of circumstances in which this holding would govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Analysis must begin with the settled principle, acknowledged in the <em>per curiam </em>opinion, that \u201cthe term \u2018like punishment,\u2019 as used in the ACA, requires only that the punishment be similar, not identical.\u201d <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>75 F.3d 173, 176 (4th Cir.1996). Moreover, \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018like punishment,\u2019 does not encompass every incident of a state\u2019s sentencing policy.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>27 F.3d 111, 115 (4th Cir.1994). Thus, federal courts acting pursuant to the ACA are not bound by state rules of evidence or state law regarding parole, probation, good time credits, or special assessments. <em>United States v. Slatkin, </em>984 F.Supp. 916, 918 (D.Md.1995); <em>see e.g., Kay v. United States, </em>255 F.2d 476 (4th Cir.1958); <em>Harris, </em>27 F.3d 111. This is so because \u201cthe Sentencing Guidelines apply to convictions under \u00a7 13 [the ACA].\u201d <em>Harris, </em>27 F.3d at 115. Therefore, to give proper effect to federal sentencing policies and to satisfy the \u201clike punishment\u201d requirement of the ACA, we have held that a federal court imposing an ACA sentence must adhere to the state\u2019s statutorily prescribed minimum and maximum sentence, but within this range, the court must apply the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Young, </em>916 F.2d 147, 150 (4th Cir.1990). This means that \u201c[t]he court is required to determine if there is a sufficiently analogous offense guideline, and, if so, to apply the guideline that is most analogous.\u201d U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 2X5.1 comment. On the other hand, where \u201cthere is no sufficiently analogous guideline, the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 control.\u201d <em>Id., see Harris, </em>27 F.3d at 115. Significantly, in applying the Guidelines to determine the appropriate sentence within the state\u2019s statutorily prescribed range, a federal court \u201cwill not assimilate a state sentencing provision that conflicts with federal sentencing policy.\u201d <em>Pierce, </em>75 F.3d at 176. Put simply, \u201cwhen state law provisions conflict with federal policy, federal policy controls.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>It follows from these well-settled principles that where a district court, acting pursuant to the ACA, finds that there is a sufficiently analogous offense guideline, which is higher than the state sentencing guidelines\u2019 presumptive sentence, and thus in conflict with the state\u2019s presumptive sentence, the federal Guidelines control and the federal court may impose a sentence within the state statutory maximum for the offense charged, but higher than the state sentencing guidelines\u2019 presumptive sentence. <em>See Pierce, </em>75 F.3d 173.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For example, in this case had the district court applied the Guidelines and found that an analogous offense guideline advised a sentence of 10 to 15 months, the court would not have been bound by the 10 month maximum required by the state\u2019s sentencing guidelines. On the other hand, where, as here, no sufficiently analogous offense guideline applies, it is appropriate for a federal court, acting pursuant to the ACA, to follow the state\u2019s guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">In sum, where, as is not here the case, an applicable federal Guidelines range conflicts with the state sentencing guidelines range, I would conclude that the Guidelines, including its criminal history calculation, would trump the state\u2019s sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-13\">. Such conflicts arise where, as here, the state's criminal history calculation differs markedly from that of the Guidelines. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>example, in this case, under the North Carolina Structured Sentencing Act, defendant had zero criminal history points, and thus, was within criminal history category I, while under the Guidelines defendant\u2019s prior criminal offenses amounted to 4 criminal history points, placing him in criminal history category III. This significant disparity reflects the difference between federal sentencing policies and state sentencing policies, and underscores the importance of not assimilating state sentencing guidelines <em>in toto </em>because of the potential for conflict with federal sentencing policies. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>361 F.Supp.2d 502, 508 (E.D.Va.2005) (holding that \u201cstatutes expressing [state] sentencing policies do not override the clearly expressed federal policies contained in the United States Sentencing Guidelines\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b882-6\">. <em>See also United States v.
