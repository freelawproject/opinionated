He argues that the district court erroneously calculated the drag quantity attributable to him when determining his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s calculation of drug quantity is a factual finding that is entitled to considerable deference and is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-15\">Testimony at trial showed that Banda was involved in numerous drug transactions as both a supplier and receiver of methamphetamine. For example, Banda supplied drugs to Michael Fletcher weekly from March 2004 to June 2004 in varying amounts. Banda concedes that a conservative estimate of one ounce per week would equate to one pound of methamphetamine. He also supplied drugs to Fletcher on four or five subsequent occasions in amounts of one to two ounces. Banda was connected to at least two other transactions involving pound quantities, was involved in multiple transactions of lesser amounts, and engaged in bartering his dogs for drugs. The district court is permitted to make reasonable estimates of drug quantities and may make reasonable inferences from the facts. <em>Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 246. In light of this and the wide latitude afforded the district court\u2019s findings, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Banda was involved with at least 1.5 kilograms of methamphetamine was not clearly erroneous based on the record as a whole. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-16\">Banda also argues that the district court\u2019s determination of facts relevant to determining the guideline range violates his Sixth Amendment rights and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Banda correctly concedes that this argument is fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>closed. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"AM0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b980-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
