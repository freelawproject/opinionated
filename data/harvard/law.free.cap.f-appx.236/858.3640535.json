Scott asserts she should now be permitted to withdraw her guilty plea because the Government allegedly breached a promise it would not use her co-conspirator\u2019s debriefing statement in determining the amount of relevant conduct it would attribute to her at sentencing. Scott also claims that without the debriefing statement, her sentence is unsupported. We affirm Scott\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-17\">Because Scott never moved to withdraw her guilty plea in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>112 F.3d 163,166 (4th Cir.1997). To demonstrate plain error, Scott must establish that error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected her substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547-48 (4th Cir.2005). Scott has failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-18\">First, Scott failed to present evidence the Government ever made a promise it would not use information obtained from the debriefing statement in determining her relevant conduct. Moreover, the record reveals Scott\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary and that the district court sentenced Scott below the mandatory minimum statutory sentence after properly determining her guidelines range and thoroughly considering the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-19\">Accordingly, we affirm Scott\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
