He argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He also argues that the district court erroneously characterized his prior state conviction for transportation/sale of a controlled substance as an aggravated felony, which increased his offense level by eight pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Contreras\u2019s challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Contreras contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Contreras properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">We review Contreras\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359-61 (5th Cir. 2005). As the Government conc\u00e9des, Contreras\u2019s argument has merit in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). <em>See United States v. Estrada-Mendoza, </em>475 F.3d 258, 259-61 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1845, 167 L.Ed.2d 340 (2007). Accordingly, Contreras\u2019s sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
