Gen. Laws ch. 265, \u00a7 13A. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A)(iii). In his motions to reopen, Remy contended that he is entitled to another review of whether his prior conviction qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), which allegedly constituted intervening changes in the law. Remy also argued that changed country conditions in Haiti \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ousting of Jean-Bertrand Aristide\u2019s government in 2004 \u2014 warranted reopening of his proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen under a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). Motions to reopen removal proceedings are \u201cdisfavored,\u201d and \u201cthe moving party bears a heavy burden.\u201d <em>Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Nonetheless, \u201ca denial based on an error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion, and [we] review the BIA\u2019s resolution of questions of law de novo.\u201d <em>Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 461 (5th Cir.2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Remy\u2019s motions to reopen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Remy\u2019s primary contention is that the \u201cassault and beat\u201d language from the charging instrument to which he pleaded guilty in Massachusetts was insufficient by itself to show that the conviction was for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d so as to qualify as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d The courts of appeals that have addressed such an argument differ as to whether it is correct. <em>Cf. United States v. Jones, </em>235 F.3d 342, 347 (7th Cir.2000), and <em>United States v. Estevez, </em>419 F.3d 77, 82 (1st Cir.2005). Moreover, contrary to Remy\u2019s contention, <em>Leo-cal </em>and <em>Shepard </em>have not changed this analysis, but instead have reinforced the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d established in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Remy has not established that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen on the ground that intervening changes in the law have altered the conclusion that his Massachusetts assault conviction qualified as an aggravated felony. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 303. Similarly, even if we assume arguendo that we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s factual determination regarding changed country conditions, Remy has not made a prima facie case that the change in government in Haiti subjects him to a well-founded fear of future prosecution. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">Remy has abandoned any challenge to the order denying his motion to reconsider. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">Remy\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b135-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-22\">. Remy has filed petitions for review from both the BIA's May 5, 2006 decision denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings and the BIA\u2019s July 25, 2006 decision denying his motion to reconsider the May 5, 2006 decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\">. The Attorney General's contention that Remy\u2019s current argument is res judicata is unavailing because Remy's prior petitions for review were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, rather than \"on the merits.\u201d <em>See Ellis v. Amex Life Ins. Co., </em>211 F.3d 935, 937 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Nilsen v. City of Moss Point, Miss., </em>701 F.2d 556, 562 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
