For the reasons that follow, we deny Tofade\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">Tofade is a Nigerian citizen who moved to Brazil in 1996. He falsely represented himself as a U.S. citizen to gain entry into the United States on July 1, 2000. He received from the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a Notice to Appear, which charged that he was removable as an alien who falsely represented his citizenship for personal benefit under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-21\">Tofade applied for asylum, withholding of removal under the INA, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d). On August 3, 2001, the immigration judge (IJ) denied Tofade\u2019s application on all counts and ordered that Tofade be removed either to Brazil or Nigeria. Tofade appealed. On July 30, 2002, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-22\">On April 4, 2006, Tofade moved to reopen and remand the case. He asserted that: (1) he had applied for class membership and legalization under <em>Newman v. U.S. Citizen and Immigration Serv., </em>No. 87-4757-WDK (C.D.Cal. Feb.18, 2004) (order approving settlement of class action); (2) he should not be removed or detained because he was prima facie eligible for class membership; and (3) his case with the INS should be reopened pending his application for class membership and legalization. Tofade based his claim for class membership on the following grounds: (1) he, a parent, or a spouse visited an INS office to apply for legalization between May 5, 1987, and May 4, 1988, but was denied legalization; (2) he entered the United States before January 1, 1982 and remained in the country until the date he, a parent, or a spouse was denied legalization; and (3) he was continually present, except for brief and innocent departures, in the United States from November 6, 1986, until the date he, a parent, or a spouse was denied legalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>On October 23, 2006, the BIA denied Tofade\u2019s motion to reopen the order of removal because it was untimely. The BIA also declined to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Tofade then timely petitioned this Court to review the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">We have jurisdiction to review \u201cfinal order[s] of removal\u201d from the IJ or BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). We have held that \u00a7 1252(a)(1) also implicitly grants us the authority to review orders denying motions to reopen final orders of removal. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 809 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006). Since the BIA affirmed Tofade\u2019s final order of removal, we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\n<em>BIA\u2019s Denial of Tofade\u2019s Motion to Reopen</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The BIA may reopen proceedings in cases in which it has rendered a decision if a party affected by the decision so moves in writing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). The party may file one motion \u201cno later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. ...\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The statutory ninety-day period \u201cis mandatory and jurisdictional, and, therefore, it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir. 2005). We review for abuse of discretion a BIA decision to deny a motion to reopen. <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1150. \u201cOur review is limited to determining \u2018whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion [that] has been arbitrary or capricious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1149 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">We do not find arbitrary or capricious the BIA\u2019s denial of Tofade\u2019s motion to reopen. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s order to deport Tofade on July 30, 2002. Tofade waited nearly four years after that date, well beyond the statutory ninety-day period, to move to reopen the proceedings. Accordingly, we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying as untimely Tofade\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">\n<em>BIA\u2019s Refusal to Reopen Sua Sponte</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">The BIA may also sua sponte reopen proceedings in a case in which it rendered a decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). We have held that the BIA\u2019s discretion is \u201cvery broad\u201d and \u201cnon-reviewable.\u201d <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1279 (11th Cir. 1999). Accordingly, we hold that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to exercise its sua sponte authority and reopen Tofade\u2019s case. <em>See id. </em>at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-15\">. On November 25, 2002, the President signed into law the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135. The Act created the new DHS, abolished the Immigration and Naturalization Services (\"INS\u201d), and transferred the INS\u2019 functions to the DHS. Although Tofade\u2019s removal proceedings occurred while the INS still existed, we refer here to the DHS because Tofade moved to reopen after the INS was abolished.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
