Ramos-Barahona argues that the district court erred in assigning a 16-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) for a prior California conviction for assault with a deadly weapon. Because Ramos-Barahona raised this issue below, this court reviews the issue de novo. <em>United States v. Calderon-Pe\u00f1a, </em>383 F.3d 254, 256 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-24\">In <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409, 412-14 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 315, 166 L.Ed.2d 237 (2006), we examined the identical California statute at issue in RamosBarahona\u2019s case and held that the California statute was sufficiently similar to the generic contemporary definition of aggravated assault to qualify as an enumerated crime of violence offense. The district court did not err in assigning a 16-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>increase for Ramos-Barahona\u2019s prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Ramos-Barahona challenges 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Ramos-Barahona\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Ramos-Barahona contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006); <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624 (5th Cir.2007). RamosBarahona properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b165-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
