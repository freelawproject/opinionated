The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice after it determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>Simmonds had three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The district court identified three lawsuits filed by Simmonds that were dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim. Simmonds contends that one of the identified dismissals, specifically <em>Simmonds v. United States Court of Appeals, </em>No. 2:04-CV-3000 (E.D.La. Nov. 19, 2004), should not have been considered as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g) because it was in the nature of a \u201chabeas petition.\u201d He also contends that the case should not have been counted as a strike because he is currently appealing to this court the district court\u2019s dismissal of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">In <em>Simmonds v. United States Court of Appeals, </em>No. 2:04-CV-3000 (E.D.La. Nov. 19, 2004), the district court dismissed Simmonds\u2019s complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2), and denied him leave to proceed IFP on appeal. In <em>Simmonds v. United States Court of Appeals, </em>178 Fed.Appx. 375 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished), this court denied Simmonds leave to proceed IFP and dismissed his appeal as frivolous. However, the appellate process in that case was not exhausted prior to Simmonds filing of his notice of appeal in the instant case. Accordingly, the district court erred in counting that case as a strike and in determining that Simmonds was barred under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Simmonds\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is GRANTED. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b997-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
