The district court imposed a non-guidelines sentence of thirty months after finding that Reed had \u201cstuffed\u201d twenty-three illegal aliens in the cramped sleeper compartment of his tractor-trailer. The court calculated Reed\u2019s guideline range between 18-24 months after deducting two points for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Reed argues, and the government concedes, that the district court erred by deducting only two points for Reed\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.l(a) \u2014 (i). Had the district court correctly deducted three points, Reed\u2019s guideline range would have been 15-21 months. Reed further contends that the district court erred by imposing an upward variance based on factors already considered by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Andrews, </em>390 F.3d 840, 847 (5th Cir.2004). He notes that the guidelines already increased his base offense level because of the number of aliens involved and for creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-15\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court reviews Reed\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Perrin, </em>478 F.3d 672, 675-76 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cA non-Guideline sentence unreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors where it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-16\">Because Reed failed to object below, we review for plain error. Under this standard of review, Reed must establish (1) an error; (2) that is clear and obvious; and (3) that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 273 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). \u201cIf these conditions are met, this court can exercise its discretion to notice the forfeited error only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-17\">Reed cannot prove that the error affected his substantial rights. Expressing its disbelief that Reed was able to fit more than eight persons in such a small space, the district court stated at sentencing that the maximum amount of twenty-four months did not adequately cover Reed\u2019s conduct. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>S.Ct. at 1778 (error must affect outcome of the proceeding). The district court reasonably concluded that stuffing twenty-three illegal aliens in the sleeper compartment of a tractor trader exhibits a kind and degree of conduct not considered by the guidelines. Reed thus cannot meet his burden to show that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings or that the district court would have imposed a sentence lower than thirty months. <em>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 81-82, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2339-40, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). Even assuming that this error affected Reed\u2019s substantial rights, the district court\u2019s failure to correct it does not \u201caffect[ ] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation\u201d of the proceeding. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
