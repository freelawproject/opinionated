Colatos-Rivas, </em>146 Fed.Appx. 723 (5th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Lopez v.

He therefore would not legally be able to attend any resentencing, as is required by Fed. R.Crim. P. 43, should this court remand his case. We are unable to grant Colatos relief. His appeal is moot and is dismissed. <em>See United States v.
