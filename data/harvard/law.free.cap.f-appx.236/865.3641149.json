Fields appeals, contending that his predicate state conviction did not satisfy \u00a7 922(g)(1) as a matter of law. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-16\">Fields asserts that, under North Carolina\u2019s structured sentencing scheme, his maximum sentence was less than twelve months because no aggravating factors were either admitted by him or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. However, as Fields concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246-47 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Thus, because it is undisputed that a sentence of over twelve months could be imposed on a defendant convicted of possession of cocaine in North Carolina, the district court properly considered Fields\u2019 prior conviction as a predicate felony for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-17\">Accordingly, we affirm Fields\u2019 conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b890-10\"> Fields urges us to reexamine <em>Harp </em>in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 856, 860, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007) (holding that California's determinate sentencing law violated Sixth Amendment by \"assignfing] to the trial judge, not to the jury, authority to find the facts that expose a defendant to an elevated 'upper term\u2019 sentence\"). However, \"a panel of this court cannot overrule, explicitly or implicitly, the precedent set by a prior panel of this court. Only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can do that.\" <em>Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., </em>315 F.3d 264, 271-72 n. 2 (4th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
