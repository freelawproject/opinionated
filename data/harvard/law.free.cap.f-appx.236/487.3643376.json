On appeal, Sanchez argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it exceeds the Sentencing Guidelines advisory range of 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment. We review the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Bohannon, </em>476 F.3d 1246, 1248 (11th Cir.2007). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-22\">The relevant facts are these. On July 6, 2005, Sanchez was indicted for illegal reentry into the United States of an alien previously convicted of an aggravated felony (gross sexual imposition). He pled guilty and proceeded to sentencing. According to his Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), in April 2004, Sanchez was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>arrested in Naples, Florida for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, tampering with a victim/witness, and violation of a domestic violence \u201cno-contact order.\u201d While awaiting trial, Sanchez admitted to being a citizen and national of Mexico who had previously been deported from the United States and had illegally reentered without permission. Immigration records confirmed that in August 1999, Sanchez had been deported to Mexico after being convicted of sexual imposition and gross sexual imposition (the sexual molestation of an 11-year-old girl), a crime defined by Ohio state law as an aggravated felony. Sanchez had not received permission from the Attorney General or the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to reenter the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The PSI determined that the base offense level for an individual convicted of illegally entering the United States was 8 and recommended a 16-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), because Sanchez previously had been deported after a conviction for a crime of violence. After determining that Sanchez was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the PSI recommended an adjusted offense level of 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">As for Sanchez\u2019s criminal history, the PSI noted that Sanchez\u2019s 1999 deportation followed his convictions on charges of gross sexual imposition and sexual imposition, which stemmed from instances of sexual molestation of an 11-year-old girl and a 13-year-old girl. After being deported (and reentering illegally), between 2000 and 2004, Sanchez committed six instances of driving-related offenses, such as driving under the influence and driving without a license or with a suspended license. In March and April 2004, Sanchez committed three separate episodes of domestic violence to which he pled \u201cno contest\u201d and was adjudicated guilty. Finally, in April 2005, Sanchez molested his wife\u2019s juvenile daughter and later pled \u201cno contest\u201d and was adjudicated guilty. With a criminal history category VI (based on 20 criminal history points) and an adjusted offense level of 21, Sanchez faced an advisory Guideline range of 77 to 96 months\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the findings of the PSI and then heard Sanchez\u2019s argument in support of a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, based on the PSI\u2019s over-representation of his criminal history. Specifically, Sanchez argued the PSI\u2019s calculations overstated his criminal history because half of the criminal-history points stemmed from traffic offenses, such as driving with a suspended license, while almost all the other points resulted from incidents involving his former wife which occurred within a short span of time of each other. The district judge was unpersuaded, observing that Sanchez\u2019s criminal record \u201cjustly deserves\u201d a criminal history category VI because it contained offenses \u201ccontinuing, almost unabated\u201d since 1999 and \u201ca series of violent offenses against his wife.\u201d The court then heard the parties\u2019 arguments on the ultimate sentence to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">In support of mitigation, Sanchez reiterated the argument he unsuccessfully asserted in support of a \u00a7 4A1.3 downward departure. He urged that there had been no corroboration of the allegations underlying the incidents involving his former wife. He highlighted his \u201cno contest\u201d pleas, maintaining that he was innocent of the crimes to which he had pled. The district court also heard Sanchez\u2019s statement of remorse. The government responded that a sentence at the high end of the Guidelines range was warranted, in light of Sanchez\u2019s criminal history, noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>that the record contained no evidence of any mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Before imposing sentence, the district court noted that the Guidelines range was advisory and that the court had the discretion to impose a sentence either within, or above or below, the range, after consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors so long as the sentence was \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to satisfy the purposes of sentencing.\u201d The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">It doesn\u2019t take a great mind to figure out that this defendant\u2019s problem is his criminal history and what it says about him. In a relatively short period of time, from 1999 to 2005, it\u2019s amazing the record that he\u2019s accumulated, particularly when you keep in mind that he wasn\u2019t supposed to be here in the first place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">The [PSI] indicates that he\u2019s violent, that he doesn\u2019t follow the instructions of the Court either with regard to the deportation order or the domestic violence injunction. I think it\u2019s fair to say that his conduct is that of a sexual predator. Starts in 1999, with a rape charge that is pled down to grotesque sexual imposition, as they call it in Ohio. The victim \u2014 one victim there was 11. I think the other was 13, as I recall. The facts alleged there are similar to the 2005 case that he pled no contest to here, in Fort Myers, on his wife\u2019s minor daughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">He\u2019s been placed on probation and violated probation. He\u2019s given false names to law enforcement officers. There\u2019s simply nothing good, under all the factors set forth in this statute, that I can find from his pre-sentence report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVH\">The district court then imposed a 120-month term of imprisonment. Sanchez objected to the reasonableness of the sentence, arguing that the sentence imposed exceeded the advisory Guidelines range, and that the court had not given him notice that it was considering a sentence above the Guidelines range. The district court noted that Sanchez\u2019s objections were preserved for appeal, but that after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a defendant is always on notice that a sentence above the Guideline range may be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">The district court issued a final written judgment imposing a sentence of 120 months\u2019 incarceration, as well as a written statement of reasons for imposing a sentence in excess of the advisory Guideline range. In the written statement, the court noted that it had considered \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d and the need for the sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense,\u201d \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d and \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Sanchez argues that the sentence imposed was unreasonable because it exceeded the upper end of the advisory Guidelines range by two years. He suggests that the district court was <em>required </em>to find extraordinary circumstances, which he contends do not exist here, in order to depart from the advisory range to such an extent. On this record, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Congress has directed that a sentencing court \u201cshall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In our reasonableness review, we examine \u201conly the <em>final </em>sentence for reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d rather than \u201ceach individual decision made during the sentencing process.\u201d <em>Bohannon, </em>476 F.3d at 1248. The review \u201cis highly deferential\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>burden rests with the party challenging the sentence to prove that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1248,1253. \u201cWe recognize that there is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and will affirm as long as the sentence imposed by the district court achieves the purposes of sentencing as stated in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The sentencing factors that the court must consider include the circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to promote respect for the law, just punishment for the offense, deterrence to criminal conduct, and to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, and the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A-C), (a)(3), (a)(4). We have held that \u201cnothing ... requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (internal quotation omitted). Rather, the district need only acknowledge that it has considered the defendant\u2019s mitigating arguments in light of the sentencing factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Here, in selecting Sanchez\u2019s sentence, the district court considered his criminal history and determined that it needed to impose a sentence that would promote respect for the law, deter future criminal conduct, and protect the public from further crimes that Sanchez could commit. The court also noted Sanchez\u2019s repeated violations of court orders, including the deportation order and the domestic violence injunction. Moreover, the court considered the advisory Guidelines range that it had adopted from the PSI and the sentences available, including the government\u2019s recommendation for a sentence at the upper end of the Guideline range. After evaluating all of these circumstances, and making both oral and written findings on many of the \u00a7 3553 factors, the district court concluded that a sentence in excess of the Guideline range was <em>necessary </em>to achieve the purposes of sentencing. Finally, we observe that the ultimate sentence imposed is exactly half of the statutory maximum of <em>twenty years </em>that may be assigned to an individual convicted of illegal reentry following removal subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). On this record, Sanchez has not met his burden to establish that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
