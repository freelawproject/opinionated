Esparza argues that the district court erred in not advising him that he had a constitutional right against self-incrimination at the rearraignment hearing. Because Esparza did not raise this issue in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-22\">The district court advised Esparza that he would not be required to testify unless he voluntarily chose to do so in his defense. Esparza concedes that this statement complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(E). There is no requirement that the district court advise a defendant that he has a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at the guilty plea hearing. Esparza has not shown that there was any error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s Rule 11 proceeding or that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. <em>See Vonn, </em>535 U.S. at 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b157-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
