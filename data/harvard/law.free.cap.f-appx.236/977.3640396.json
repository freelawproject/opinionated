The Government contends Adams\u2019 petition for review is timely <em>only </em>as to the denial of his motion to reconsider, while his brief challenges <em>only </em>the denial of his motion to reopen. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Because Adams\u2019 petition for review was <em>not </em>filed within 30 days of the denial of the motion to reopen, it is dismissed as to that denial. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 111 (5th Cir.1993). Adams\u2019 petition is timely as to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider. Adams has waived review of that denial, however, by failing to challenge it in his brief. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986). Therefore, his petition is denied as to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
