Murray\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>vietion and sentence were affirmed on appeal. <em>United States v. Murray, </em>35 Fed. Appx. 125, 128 (6th Cir.2002). Murray subsequently filed a motion in the Eastern District of Tennessee to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, based on ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">In January 2006, Murray filed an application for habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the Southern District of Mississippi, the district in which he is incarcerated. He appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The district court, as the place of Murray\u2019s incarceration, can exercise jurisdiction only over a properly filed \u00a7 2241 petition that challenges the manner in which a sentence is executed. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). This court has held that \u201ca \u00a7 2241 petition that seeks to challenge the validity of a federal sentence must either be dismissed or construed as a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). However, a petitioner can attack the validity of his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition, but only if he can meet the requirements of the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255. <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 901. To meet the requirements of the \u201csavings clause,\u201d the petitioner must show that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255; <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Murray\u2019s \u00a7 2241 challenges the validity of the sentence itself, not the manner in which the sentence was executed. Consequently, the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain Murray\u2019s claims unless Murray could demonstrate that they fell within the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255. Murray\u2019s claim based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not fall within \u00a7 2255 savings clause. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court dismissing Murray\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for want of jurisdiction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b45-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
