He argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minor role adjustment to his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-17\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court continues to review for clear error claims of erroneous fact-finding with respect to the application of Sentencing Guideline adjustments. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Section 3B1.2(b) allows for a two-level reduction in a defendant\u2019s offense level if the defendant was a \u201cminor participant in any criminal activity.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-22\">Delgado contends that he was less culpable than the other participants in the scheme to smuggle undocumented aliens into the United States. Notwithstanding that Delgado\u2019s role in transporting the aliens from El Paso, Texas, to Dallas, Texas, may have been only part of a larger smuggling scheme, Delgado was charged with transporting aliens for private financial gain, and the record demonstrates that Delgado agreed to personally transport people that he knew were undocumented aliens more than 600 miles across Texas for personal financial gain. Delgado\u2019s participation was central to the transportation of the undocumented aliens and clearly \u201ccoextensive with the conduct for which he was held accountable.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Marmolejo, </em>106 F.3d 1213, 1217 (5th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-23\">Because Delgado\u2019s role in the offense was not minor, the district court did not clearly err in denying him a role adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See United States v. Atanda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995). The conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b180-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
