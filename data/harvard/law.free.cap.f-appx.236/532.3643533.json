We deny the petition in part and dismiss the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Negrette-Valbuena was admitted to the United States on June 6,1999, as a nonimmigrant visitor to remain for a period not to exceed six months. Negrette-Valbuena applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT on April 7, 2004. Negrette-Valbuena was the only witness at the hearing before the IJ. In addition to her testimony, Negrette-Valbuena submitted the following evidence: (1) interrogatories answered by two neighbors regarding threats and harassment suffered by her family in Venezuela; (2) a Venezuelan hospital record for a patient admitted on June 3, 2000, due to a serious head wound; (3) an arrest warrant issued by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for Jesus Del Carmen Segovia, for assaulting Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s father; and (4) a news article noting that Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s father had contacted the press to denounce his political persecution and complain that the authorities had not acted efficiently in clearing up the events surrounding his attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">Negrette-Valbuena testified that she left Venezuela and came to the United States in June 1999 because of problems related to her father\u2019s involvement with a political party named COPEI. Her family had received telephone threats and a burglary had occurred at their house. Negrette-Valbuena testified that in June 2000 her father suffered a head injury from an assault by a man named Segovia, a member of the \u201cother party.\u201d Negrette-Valbuena acknowledged that the Venezuelan government attempted to locate and arrest Segovia after the attack. During cross-examination, Negrette-Valbuena admitted that: (1) throughout her father\u2019s participation in COPEI, she, her mother, and her sisters were never physically harmed; (2) she had not personally participated in any political organization and had not experienced a direct threat; (3) her mother and two sisters remain in the family home; and (4) after her father went into hiding, no members of her family have been physically harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">The IJ determined that Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s asylum application was time-barred, and there were no changed country conditions or exceptional circumstances to excuse the late filing. The IJ also found that, even if Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s asylum application had been timely, she failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution on account of one of the five protected grounds. The IJ made an adverse credibility finding on the ground that Negrette-Valbuena gave inconsistent and uncorroborated testimony on essential aspects of the asylum application. The IJ found that Negrette-Valbuena failed to meet her burden of establishing past persecution or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>well-founded fear of future persecution, based on her father\u2019s imputed political opinion, and denied her request for withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Negrette-Valbuena appealed to the BIA, which adopted and affirmed the decision of the IJ. The BIA also held that, even if Negrette-Valbuena was credible, she failed to prove that she had suffered past persecution or that her fear of future persecution was well-founded. The BIA found that even if a threat of persecution exists, Negrette-Valbuena failed to establish that the threat was country-wide.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the opinion of the IJ. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning and briefly articulated its own reasons for affirming the IJ\u2019s decision. We review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">We review factual determinations of the BIA under the substantial evidence test. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAdministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). \u201cThe trier of fact must determine credibility, and this [C]ourt may not substitute its judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Negrette-Valbuena contends that the IJ and BIA erroneously denied her application for asylum, request for withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. We are without jurisdiction to review the denial of Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s application for asylum as untimely. Because substantial evidence supports the decision of the IJ and BIA decision that Negrette-Valbuena is not entitled to withholding of removal or relief under CAT, Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s petition fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">\n<em>A. We Lack Jurisdiction to Review Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s Application for Asylum.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Negrette-Valbuena argues that the IJ erroneously concluded that she failed to establish \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d to excuse her untimely application for asylum. The government contends that we lack jurisdiction to consider Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s petition. We agree with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">An application for asylum must be \u201cfiled within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An untimely application \u201cmay be considered ... if the alien demonstrates ... either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Section 1158(a)(3) provides that \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination\u201d that the application was untimely or that there were changed or extraordinary circumstances that excused the delay. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(3). Accordingly, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the findings of the IJ and BIA that Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s asylum application was untimely and there were no changed circumstances to excuse her delay. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\n<em>B. Substantial Evidence Supports the Finding of the IJ and BIA That Negrette-Valbuena Is Not Entitled to Withholding of Removal or CAT Relief.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Negrette-Valbuena argues that she is entitled to withholding of removal and CAT relief. To qualify for withholding of removal, Negrette-Valbuena had to establish that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if returned to Venezuela. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). An alien is entitled to withholding of removal if she can establish, with specific and credible evidence (1) a past threat to life or freedom through proof of past persecution on account of a protected ground; or (2) a future threat to life or freedom if it \u201cis more likely than not\u201d that the protected ground will cause future persecution. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.16(b)(1), (2). An alien is entitled to relief under CAT if she can \u201cestablish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). For purposes of CAT relief, \u201ctorture\u201d refers to \u201cany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person ... by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Substantial evidence supports the decision of the IJ and BIA that Negrette-Valbuena faded to meet her burden of proof for withholding of removal and CAT relief for at least three reasons. First, Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s evidence that her family was threatened, a burglary occurred at their home, their car was damaged by vandals, and her father was assaulted did not compel a finding that Negrette-Valbuena experienced past persecution. Second, Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s evidence that her mother and two sisters were able to remain in the country for several years after the harassing events supports the finding that Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s fear of future persecution was not well-founded and the alleged persecution was not country-wide. Third, Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s evidence that the government issued an arrest warrant for her father\u2019s attacker undermined her CAT claim, and Negrette-Valbuena offered no evidence that a government official would be inclined to torture her.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Negrette-Valbuena\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
