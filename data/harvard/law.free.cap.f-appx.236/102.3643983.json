This argument is unavailing. The regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>tion allows for another officer, such as the Interim District Director in Fateh\u2019s case, to act in the \u201ccapacity\u201d of the District Director until the position is permanently filled. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 239.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b126-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
