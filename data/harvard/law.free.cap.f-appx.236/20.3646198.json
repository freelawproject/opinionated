Saunders contends that there was no factual basis for his plea because the facts set out in the written factual basis, which was recited at his rearraignment, indicated that he used a firearm at the bank president\u2019s home before he robbed the bank, and not during the actual robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-26\">Any possible deficiency in the factual basis supporting Saunders\u2019s plea did not affect his substantial rights. The presen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>tenee report indicated that Saunders pointed a firearm at the face of a bank employee during the robbery. <em>See United States v.
