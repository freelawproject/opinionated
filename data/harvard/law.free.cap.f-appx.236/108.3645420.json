The Government has moved for summary affirmance. Alternatively, the Government seeks an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Mendez asserts that his 46-month guideline sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and is unreasonable. The presumption of reasonableness afforded a sentence within a properly calculated advisory guideline range is consistent with <em>Booker. See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The record reflects that the district court considered Mendez\u2019s arguments, the recommendation of the presentence report, and the applicable guideline range. Because the district court exercised its discretion to impose a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range, the sentence is presumptively reasonable and we may infer that the district court considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462-70; <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">Mendez also argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to properly assess the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). The district court\u2019s sentence was imposed with sufficient consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">Mendez also argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 46-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-17\">Mendez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Mendez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-18\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, its alternative request for an extension of time is DENIED as unnecessary, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b133-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
