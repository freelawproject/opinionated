The Guidries sued Apache and Chevron for the resulting damages, and the district court dismissed, granting both defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The Guidries appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">To establish liability the Guidries must prove that the pipe was owned, maintained, controlled, or placed in position by either Apache or Chevron. <em>Creppel v. Shell Oil Co., </em>738 F.2d 699 (5th Cir.1984). They have presented no summary judgment evidence linking the pipe to either defendant. Undisputed evidence shows that the pipe was long-abandoned, submerged near an active public waterway. Moreover, it was cut at both ends and was not connected to any equipment owned by either Chevron or Apache. Faced with similar facts in <em>Creppel, </em>we explained that the plaintiff could not survive summary judgment without some evidence linking the defendant to the submerged pipe. It is not enough that the defendants\u2019 operations were closest to the allision site. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">The Guidries rely on <em>Gele v. Chevron, </em>574 F.2d 243 (5th Cir.1978), where Chief Judge John Brown, writing for the panel, affirmed liability against Chevron in a similar maritime dispute. Yet the differences are crucial. In <em>Gele </em>the plaintiffs vessel struck an active flare pipe, located in a area where Chevron was the exclusive operator. Chevron\u2019s control of the pipe was obvious to the district court, a finding-of-fact further shielded from appellate inquisitiveness by the clear-error standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>review in that case. Here, on summary judgment, plaintiffs provided no evidence, except for speculation, linking the pipe to the defendants.
