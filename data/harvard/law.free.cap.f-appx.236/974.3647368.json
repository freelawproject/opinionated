Genualdo, a police officer with the Fort Worth Police Department; and the denial of his motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">A summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Guillory v. Domtar Indus., Inc., </em>95 F.3d 1320, 1326 (5th Cir.1996). Such judgment is appropriate when the record demonstrates \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\u201d. FedR.CivP. 56(c); <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.l994)(en <em>banc). </em>If the movant meets this burden, the nonmovant must show, <em>inter alia, </em>a genuine material-fact issue for trial. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The nonmovant cannot do so with conclusional allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or only a scintilla of evidence. <em>Little, </em>37 F.3d at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Summary judgment was proper because no record evidence shows Genualdo committed the assault alleged by Cortez. To the contrary, Cortez testified he did <em>not </em>see Genualdo assault him and failed to present any evidence identifying Genualdo as the officer who allegedly did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to appoint counsel to represent Cortez. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
