The Government argues that the claims should not now be considered. Because these arguments could have been but were not raised in the original appeal of this ease, they will not now be considered. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 321 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>312 F.3d 652, 657 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Marmolejo, </em>139 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.1998). Mata argues that the miscarriage-of-justice exception to the mandate rule applies such that we should consider his claims, particularly his challenge to counts 7 and 8, which the Government concedes has merit. Because the argument is raised for the first time in his reply brief, we will not ordinarily consider it. <em>United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379, 1386 (5th Cir.1989). Moreover, our refusal to address the claim, which may be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, will not result in a miscarriage of justice because the sentences imposed on counts 7 and 8 run concurrently with each other and with the longer 188-month sentence imposed on count 5, meaning that any error did not affect Mata\u2019s ultimate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Mata\u2019s challenge to the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 career-offender enhancement he received is unavailing. No error arises from the fact that the enhancement was based on judicially determined facts. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); see <em>also United States v. Guevara, 408 </em>F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1080, 163 L.Ed.2d 898 (2006); <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 797 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2884, 165 L.Ed.2d 908 (2006). The judgment of conviction was sufficient evidence to establish the fact of his prior conviction, and his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Cortez, </em>988 F.2d 1408, 1411-12 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Hornsby, </em>88 F.3d 336, 339 (5th Cir.1996); <em>cf. United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">Mata\u2019s assertion that the sentences imposed on counts 5 and 7 are unreasonable is without <em>merit. </em>The sentences imposed on those counts fell within the properly calculated guidelines range and were therefore presumptively reasonable, and Mata has pointed to nothing to overcome that presumption. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3Dl.l(a)(l) and 3D1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">Mata additionally argues that the district court\u2019s judgment is internally inconsistent, and he moves, pursuant to Fed. R.Crim. P. 36, for correction of the judgment. We find no clerical error in the judgment that requires correction. <em>See id.; See United States v. Steen, 55 </em>F.3d 1022, 1025-26 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b32-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
