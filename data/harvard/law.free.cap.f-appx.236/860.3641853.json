After granting the Government\u2019s <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5K1.1 (2000) motion for a downward departure based on Little\u2019s substantial assistance, the district court sentenced Little to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-21\">Appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal but requesting we review whether a sentencing enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon was proper. In his informal brief, Little argues the enhancement, which applied a two-level increase to his offense level pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government declined to file a responding brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Under <em>Booker, </em>when a defendant is sentenced under a mandatory guidelines scheme, \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 224, 125 S.Ct. 738. Little contested the dangerous weapon enhancement at sentencing, and treating the sentencing guidelines as mandatory, the district court found the enhancement was warranted based on a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">We conclude the enhancement does not amount to Sixth Amendment error under <em>Booker} </em>\u201cTo establish that a Sixth Amendment error occurred in his sentencing, [an appellant] must show that the district court imposed a sentence exceeding the maximum allowed based only on the facts that he admitted.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 (4th Cir.2005). In the plea agreement, Little stipulated he was responsible for at least 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base for sentencing purposes, creating a base offense level of thirty-eight. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (drug quantity table). Little did not contest his criminal history category of V at sentencing. As a consequence, the maximum allowable sentence based only on the facts Little admitted was life imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table). The USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement was accordingly permissible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm. Little\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Little, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Little requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Little.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. Although the district court sentenced Little in accordance with the law and procedures then in effect, it committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error by treating the guidelines as mandatory, <em>see United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 414 (4th Cir.2006). However, there is no indication the district court wished to sentence Little below the sentencing guidelines range but was prevented from doing so by a mandatory application of the guidelines. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223-24 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1023, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). Thus, there is \u201cno nonspeculative basis\u201d for finding prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 223.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-15\">. Furthermore, the district court's finding an adequate factual basis supported the enhancement was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 (b)(1), comment, (n.3) (\"[This] adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d). It was not clearly improbable the weapon was connected with the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
