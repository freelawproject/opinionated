Gutierrez\u2019s brief fails to address the basis of the district court\u2019s dismissal. Although this court liberally construes pro se briefs, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). By failing to address the legal basis of the district court\u2019s decision, Gutierrez has effectively failed to appeal the judgment. <em>See Matchett v. Dretke, </em>380 F.3d 844, 848 (5th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">As Gutierrez\u2019s appeal lacks any arguable merit, we dismiss it as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Gutierrez is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). The motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b172-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
