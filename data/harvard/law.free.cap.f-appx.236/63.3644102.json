Napoleon appealed to the district court, which affirmed the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-19\">Napoleon argues that his sentence must be vacated because it is above the advisory sentencing Guidelines range, the magistrate judge stated in writing that the sentence was within the advisory Guidelines range, and the magistrate judge offered no reasons for selecting the sentence. Napoleon argues that the district court erred on appeal by supplying sentencing reasons for the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-20\">As Napoleon did not object to the lack of sentencing reasons, the erroneous statement that the sentence was within the advisory Guidelines range, or the imposition of a non-Guideline sentence, we review his contentions for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>see United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 378 (5th Cir.2005). The magistrate judge plainly erred by failing to supply reasons for its selection of Napoleon\u2019s sentence and in stating that the sentence imposed was within the advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-21\">In determining whether a sentence should be vacated and the case remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>for re-sentencing, this court has at times applied an objective test-whether \u201cthe trial judge could reinstate the same sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ravitch, </em>128 F.3d 865, 869 (5th Cir.1997) (quotations omitted). At other times, this court has applied a subjective test \u2014 \u201cwhether the defendant can show a reasonable probability that, but for the district court\u2019s misapplication of the Guidelines, he would have received a lesser sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 364 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 436-38 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2958, 165 L.Ed.2d 970 (2006). Regardless of which analysis is the appropriate one, Napoleon\u2019s sentence should not be vacated. The magistrate judge could reasonably enter the same sentence on remand, and there is no indication in the record that had the magistrate judge been apprised that the sentence imposed was above the advisory Guideline range, the magistrate would have chosen a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b88-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
