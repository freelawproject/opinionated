Galusha (\u201cGalusha\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s decision to deny her application for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-23\">In 1998, Galusha filed an application for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits with the Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cCommissioner\u201d). Her application was denied. Galusha subsequently requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). Based on a review of the administrative record, the ALJ determined that Galusha was not disabled nor entitled to benefits because she did not have a \u201csevere\u201d impairment. On Galusha\u2019s request for review, the Appeals Council for the Social Security Administration (\u201cAppeals Council\u201d) issued an order vacating the hearing decision and remanding for further proceedings. On remand, the ALJ conducted a supplemental hearing and again issued a decision adverse to Galusha, determining that even though she had \u201csevere\u201d impairments, none of the impairments were severe enough to meet or equal in severity any impairment in the Listing of Impairments and further, Galusha retained the residual functional capacity to perform her past relevant work. On Galusha\u2019s second request for review, the Appeals Council determined that there was no basis for changing the ALJ\u2019s decision and denied Galusha\u2019s request. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Commissioner. Galusha appealed this final decision to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge, who found that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and applied the proper legal standards. The district court adopted the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge and dismissed Galusha\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Galusha argues on appeal that the district court erred in determining that the ALJ\u2019s decision was based on the proper legal standard and supported by substantial evidence. According to Galusha, the ALJ improperly rejected a treating doctor\u2019s opinion and did not properly consider Galusha\u2019s residual functional capacity. Our review is limited to determining whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision and whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision comports with relevant legal standards. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>174 F.3d 692, 693 (5th Cir.1999). Having carefully reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the relevant portions of the record, we affirm the decision of the district court for essentially the reasons stated in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b134-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
