When, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">Galvez-Colindres argues the BIA erred in upholding his removal because the cancellation of his prior removal order waived his prior convictions and that his current conviction for simple possession of less than 30 grams of marijuana did not satisfy the requirements for removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. This court reviews the BIA\u2019s rulings of law de novo. <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). In <em>Molenda v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 291, 294 (5th Cir.1993), the court held that the grant of relief from deportation \u201cmerely waives the finding of deportability rather than the basis for deportability itself. Therefore the crimes alleged for deportability do not disappear from the alien\u2019s record for immigration purposes.\u201d Galvez-Colindres\u2019s petition for review based on this issue is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-16\">Galvez-Colindres raises two issues in his petition for review that were not presented to the BIA. First, he asserts that the IJ erred in considering his motion for withholding of removal as a request for withholding of removal rather than a request for cancellation of removal. Second, he asserts that his counsel was ineffective during the proceedings before the IJ. This portion of Galvez-Colindres\u2019s petition for review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Galvez-Colindres failed to pursue these issues before the BIA. <em>See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 389-90 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1012-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
