Ball argued that he was entitled to federal sentencing credit for time he spent on the street between his release from a state sentence on December 29, 2004, and his arrest on a federal parole violator\u2019s warrant on June 15, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-17\">In 1983, Ball was convicted of bank robbery in federal district court in Maryland and was sentenced to 22 years in prison. He was paroled from this sentence in November 2002 with 781 days to be served on his federal sentence. Ball was taken into custody in 2003 and was convicted in 2004 of a Texas state offense. In May 2003, the Parole Commission issued a parole violator\u2019s warrant for Ball\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-18\">Ball has not established that the Parole Commission\u2019s refusal to credit his federal sentence with \u201cstreet\u201d time between his release from state prison and his arrest on the federal violator\u2019s warrant was \u201c \u2018flagrant, unwarranted, or unauthorized.\u2019 \u201d <em>Van Etten v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>96 F.3d 144, 145 (5th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). Under 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.44(d), the issuance of the violator\u2019s warrant in 2003 \u201coperate[d] to bar the expiration of [Ball\u2019s federal] sentence.\u201d Under 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.52(c)(2), Ball\u2019s conviction of the new state offense resulted in a \u201cforfeiture of time from the date of [his] release [from his federal sentence] to the date of execution of the [violator\u2019s] warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-19\">Ball also argues that the Parole Commission violated his due process rights by denying him the review options under 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.47(c). The record, however, reflects that the Commission chose, as permitted by \u00a7 2.47(c)(3), to \u201c[l]et the detain-er stand and order further review\u201d when Ball returned to federal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b995-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
