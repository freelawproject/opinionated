Smith has filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-24\">Smith argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Fed. R.CivP. 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. Smith contends that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>court should have granted his motion based on the loss of his mail, referring to the amended complaint he allegedly mailed on September 15, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Smith does not explain in his brief or IFP motion what was in his amended complaint that would have prevented the district court from dismissing his complaint as frivolous. The district court considered the additional allegations that Smith made in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, in effect considering them as an amended complaint. The district court determined that, given Smith\u2019s admission that he could not prove a physical injury, any attempt to amend the complaint would be futile. Smith\u2019s motion and brief do not mention this ruling by the district court. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Smith\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enterprises, Inc., </em>38 F.3d 1404, 1408 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The district court\u2019s certification that Smith\u2019s appeal is not taken in good faith is upheld, Smith\u2019s motion for IFP is denied, and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Smith is hereby informed that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Smith that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b184-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
