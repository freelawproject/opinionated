This court reviews sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). This court has held that, \u201c[i]n reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1237. (internal quotation and citations omitted). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need to protect the public; and (5) the Guidelines range, as well as (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the need to avoid sentencing disparities among similar defendants who have been found guilty, and (8) the need to provide restitution to victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1236 (internal quotations and citations omitted). However, we also have held that the district court need not state on the record that it explicitly has considered each factor and need not discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). An acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, although a sentence within the Sentencing Guidelines range will not be considered <em>per se </em>reasonable, the Guidelines remain central to the sentencing process. <em>Id. </em>at 787. Therefore, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">Because the district court imposed a low-end sentence after considering the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory only, as well as considering Hales\u2019s personal characteristics and his need for rehabilitative treatment, we conclude that the court did not impose an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">Next, Hales argues that his designation as a career offender, based on two prior felony drug convictions, violated his Sixth Amendment and due process rights to have all facts relevant to sentencing be alleged and proven beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>doubt before a jury. In <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246 (11th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2911, 165 L.Ed.2d 931 (2006), we held that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments do not require that a defendant\u2019s prior convictions be alleged in the indictment or proven to a jury before they are used to designate the defendant as a career offender. We noted that we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that the indictment need not charge a sentence-enhancing factor if that factor was not an element of the charged offense. <em>Gibson, </em>434 F.3d at 1244-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Because our precedent does not require that prior convictions used to enhance a sentence be alleged in the indictment or proven to a jury, we hold that the district court did not err by designating Hales a career offender based on his two prior drug convictions. Accordingly, we affirm Hales\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b531-9\">BARKETT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AV-\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">I dissent because I believe that Timothy Letord Hales\u2019 sentence of 360 <em>months </em>\u2014 30 <em>years </em>\u2014 imprisonment for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of cocaine base, and possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of cocaine base was unreasonable on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">The record indicates that Hales was convicted of selling less than one ounce of cocaine base. His sentencing enhancement to <em>30 years </em>imprisonment is based on two Florida felony convictions. The first offense dates back to April 1995, when Hales was arrested, and a baggie containing 28 pieces of cocaine base fell from his pants. He was sentenced to 15 months \u2014 a little over one year \u2014 imprisonment. The second offense dates to May 1996, when Hales was pulled over by a highway patrol trooper, who found 41 pieces of cocaine base. Hales was again sentenced to a little over one year of imprisonment. These two offenses occurred approximately ten years prior to the instant offense, and, as in this offense, involved relatively small amounts of drugs. A <em>30 year </em>sentence for these three offenses is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">Moreover, the mitigating evidence here likewise supports a lesser sentence. Hales suffered a traumatic childhood, resulting in part from a fire at his home that killed his father and brother and left him severely burned. Hales has also suffered problems with drug and alcohol abuse and was hospitalized once after he attempted suicide. Further, Hales was employed at the time of the instant offense and his employer indicated that he was a good employee and would be considered for rehire. As the district court noted, Hales is \u201csomebody who certainly ... has the potential to succeed.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">The Supreme Court ruled in <em>United States v. Booker </em>that we must review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Our review for unreasonableness requires us to evaluate the sentence imposed in light of each defendant\u2019s individual circumstances, rather than simply rubber-stamping as \u201creasonable\u201d any sentence that falls within the guidelines range. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), a district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to serve the purposes set forth in the statute, including the nature and circumstances of the offense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the history and characteristics of the defendant, among other things. A <em>SO year </em>term of imprisonment for Hales does not meet the requirements of Section 3553(a), and is clearly unreasonable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-12\">. However, this conclusion is nowhere reflected in the <em>30 year </em>sentence imposed upon Hales. The district court did not give any reasons for its imposition of a thirty year term of imprisonment. The court merely stated that it \"impos[ed] the selected sentence ... [because] [t]he Court finds the sentence at the low end would not appear to undermine the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d I believe that more is required to justify a sentence\u2014 any sentence \u2014 though particularly one when, as here, the defendant was sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment, for a relatively minor crime, with a relatively minor criminal history and compelling personal characteristics which explain, in part, his conduct. I worry that, in light of current circuit precedent, a district court may be able to justify <em>any </em>length of imprisonment <em>merely by </em>evoking the magic words \u2014 that the judge has considered the applicable guidelines, the factors set forth in Section 3553(a), and the argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ments of the defendant \u2014 -that entitle the district court to great deference and often preclude any meaningful review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-13\">. This is especially so when one considers that if he had been convicted of commercial bribery, with a criminal history category of 6 (for his two prior drug convictions), his sentence under the guidelines would have been six to twelve months \u2014 or half-a-year to a year. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a7 2B4.1, 4A1.1, 5A. If he had bribed an elected public official, a crime that reaches into the very heart of our government, his guideline sentencing range would be a mere 33-41 months \u2014 a maximum of approximately three- and-a-half years.
