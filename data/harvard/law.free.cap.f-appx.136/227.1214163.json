After the district court denied his motion to suppress certain statements he had made to law enforcement, White pleaded guilty to all charges. White did not at any time reserve a right to appeal 'the denial of the motion to suppress. On appeal, White raises three issues, which will be discussed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">First, White argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress his statements because the statements were obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. He contends that, after he invoked his right to remain silent, law enforcement resumed interrogation without \u201cscrupulously honoring\u201d his previous exercise of his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">When a defendant knowingly and voluntarily enters an unconditional guilty plea, he waives all non-jurisdictional defects in his court proceedings. <em>United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1149, 124 S.Ct. 1146, 157 L.Ed.2d 1042 (2004). A district court\u2019s refusal to suppress evidence is non-jurisdictional and is waived by a guilty plea. <em>United States v. McCoy, 477 </em>F.2d 550, 551 (5th Cir.1973). The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that: \u201cWith the consent of the court and the government, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing the right to have an appellate court review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial motion.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2); see <em>also United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>States v. Pierre, </em>120 F.3d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that a defendant who wishes to preserve appellate review of a non-jurisdictional defect while at the same time pleading guilty can do so only by entering a \u201cconditional plea\u201d in accordance with Rule 11(a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">White has waived his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress by entering into an unconditional guilty plea, without reserving in writing the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. White, moreover, has no argument in his brief that his guilty plea was not knowing or voluntary. Thus, we will not review the denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Second, White argues that the district court erred in assessing a two-level sentencing enhancement for possession of a weapon because, pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the fact of possession of a weapon was not decided by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt nor admitted by him. White did not raise this issue below.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">When a defendant fails to make an objection or argument in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>381 F.3d 1070, 1073 (11th Cir.2004). \u2018We have discretion to correct an error under the plain error standard where (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, (3) the error affected substantial rights, and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1073-74 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Two important cases have been issued since the time that White submitted his briefs. The first is <em>United States v. Booker, </em>542 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in which the Supreme Court held that the use of a mandatory sentencing guidelines system in which sentences are increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge but not admitted by the defendant or found by the jury violated the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. The second case is <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.2005), in which this court applied the plain error test to an appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>challenge. There, the court determined that the error committed by the sentencing judge was \u201cthe use of extra-verdict enhancements to reach a guidelines result that is binding on the sentencing judge; the error is the mandatory nature of the guidelines once the guidelines range has been determined.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301. Under the third prong of the plain error test, the court continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-12\">where the effect of an error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate \u2014 where we would have to speculate \u2014 the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error; he has not met his burden of showing prejudice; he has not met his burden of showing that his substantial rights have been affected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1301 (citing <em>Jones v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 394-95, 119 S.Ct. 2090 2105, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">Like the appellant in <em>Rodriguez, </em>White cannot meet his burden of showing that his substantial rights have been affected. He has not produced any evidence that the district court felt constrained by the mandatory nature of the guidelines and only because of those constraints sentenced him to 87 months on Counts 1 and 2 and 60 months on Count 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Third, White argues that the district court erred in fading to apply a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6) when he satisfied all the criteria set forth in \u00a7 5C1.2 (listing criteria for safety valve relief as found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">We review sentencing claims raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). Section 2Dl.l(b)(6) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides a two-level reduction for a defendant who meets the five requirements of the safety valve relief set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. One criteria requires in pertinent part that the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The district court did not commit plain error in failing to apply a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6) pursuant to \u00a7 5C1.2 where White did not dispute that he possessed firearms in connection with his offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Accordingly, we affirm White\u2019s conviction and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-15\">. Moreover, White\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>challenge is focused solely on the two-level enhancement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>possession of a weapon. However, at sentencing, White expressly withdrew his objection to this enhancement, in effect admitting that he did in fact possess the weapon and the enhancement was in fact appropriate. Thus, no judicial fact-finding was involved, and there would have been no Sixth Amendment or <em>Blakely </em>error even in the context of mandatory guidelines because of White\u2019s admission. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (finding no Sixth Amendment error in similar circumstances). Even though there was no Sixth Amendment error, there was <em>Booker </em>error in that the sentencing judge considered the Guidelines as binding rather than advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. However, as explained in the text, White cannot satisfy the plain error analysis with respect to this error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-22\">.
