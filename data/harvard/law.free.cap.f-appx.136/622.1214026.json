Shed first argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. \u201c[A] district court may, in its discretion, permit withdrawal before sentencing if the defendant can show a \u2018fair and just reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 370 (5th Cir.2003). A review of the seven relevant factors reveals that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Shed\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Shed argues that the district court erred by calculating his offense level and criminal history on the basis of facts not admitted by him or found beyond a reasonable doubt. After briefing was completed, the Supreme Court held in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014,\u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker </em>also struck down 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) and thus rendered the Guidelines advisory only. <em>Id. </em>at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-20\">The district court enhanced Shed\u2019s sentence based on several factual findings not admitted by Shed, and Shed objected to these enhancements on <em>Blakely </em>grounds. Shed\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment thus exceeded the maximum sentence that could have been imposed based solely on his plea and constituted a Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker. See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769. When, as here, the defendant has preserved his error, we will ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless we can say that the error is harmless under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a). <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 374-75 (5th Cir.2005). Under this standard, the Government bears the burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the constitutional error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 377. Were we to review Shed\u2019s sentence for harmless error, we would find that the error here was harmful; we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that the mandatory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines at the time of Shed\u2019s sentence did not contribute to the sentence that he received. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Shed\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tence must be vacated and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
