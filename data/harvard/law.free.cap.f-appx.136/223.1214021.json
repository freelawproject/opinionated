First, Cabezas argues that the sentencing judge committed plain error by considering the Federal Guidelines to be mandatory and making enhancements based on judicial fact-finding in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Second, he argues that the district court erred when it enhanced his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B) for being a \u201ccaptain\u201d of the drug-carrying vessel. Lastly, Cabezas argues that the MDLEA is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000,) because it incorporates by reference the penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 and allows a judge to decide \u201csentencing factors\u201d that are more properly submitted to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">I. Cabezas\u2019 <em>Booker </em>Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Cabezas failed to object to judicial fact-finding used to enhance his sentence or to the mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines in the district court. In his initial brief on appeal, Cabezas alleged that his sentence was unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1245-47 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining what is required to preserve a <em>Booker </em>error and reviewing the defendant\u2019s claim for plain error because it was first raised in the initial brief on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">We have discretion to correct an error under the plain error standard where (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, (3) the error affected substantial rights, and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777-79, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>542 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court announced that sentencing enhancements made pursuant to mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines and based on judicially found facts violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 747-50. Accordingly, the Court struck the statute provisions making the Federal Sentencing Guidelines mandatory, and rendered the guidelines effectively advisory. <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 756-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-20\">In <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.2005), we applied plain error analysis to a claim that the defendant\u2019s sentence violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights in light of <em>Booker. </em>The <em>Rodriguez </em>opinion stated that a sentence enhancement based on a fact, other than a prior conviction, found solely by the judge in a mandatory guideline system met the first and second prongs of the plain error test. <em>Id. </em>at 1298-99. Applying the third prong, the court in <em>Rodriguez </em>then asked \u201c[wjhether there is a reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion by the sentencing judge in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301. Emphasizing that the defendant bore the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice, the court in <em>Rodriguez </em>found that the defendant could not meet his burden because the record provided no indication that advisory guidelines would have resulted in a lesser sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-21\">Similarly, Cabezas cannot show that his sentence would be any lower if the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory. Cabezas argues that because he was sentenced at the lowest end of the guidelines range and because the judge refused to depart downward in order to achieve sentencing parity with his co-defendants, he has met his burden and demonstrated that the mandatory guidelines resulted in an increased sentence. However, it simply does not follow that a judge\u2019s refusal to depart downward based on sentencing parity somehow indicates a reasonable probability that the judge would depart in an advisory regime. A sentence at the lowest end of the guidelines range, by itself, is insufficient to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the judge would depart from the guidelines altogether in an advisory system. <em>See United States v. Fields, </em>408 F.3d 1356, 1360-61 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe agree with the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits that the fact that the district court sentenced the defendant to the bottom of the applicable guidelines range establishes only that the court felt that sentence was appropriate under the mandatory guidelines system. It does not establish a reasonable probability that the court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory regime.\u201d). Thus, Cabezas cannot satisfy the third prong of the plain error test because he cannot show that the <em>Booker </em>error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">II. Cabezas\u2019s Challenge to Being Found a \u201cCaptain\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Cabezas argues that he was a captain in name only, not in the functions he actually performed on the boat, making the sentencing court\u2019s enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B) inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1329 (11th Cir. 2003). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B), a defendant\u2019s sentence is increased two levels if he \u201cacted as a pilot, copilot, captain, navigator, flight officer, or any other operation officer aboard any craft or vessel.\u201d The guidelines do not define \u201ccaptain,\u201d although in <em>Rendon </em>we noted that decisions interpreting it have \u201cdeclined to adopt a rigid definition.\u201d <em>Rendon, </em>354 F.3d at 1329. We also cited two decisions from other circuits holding that a defendant need only \u201cact as\u201d a captain to warrant an enhancement, and need not possess any \u201cspecial navigational rank or skills.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The evidence showed that Cabezas had been serving as the captain of ships since he was 26, admitted he recruited the personnel, slept in one of the two state rooms, and initially told the Coast Guard that he was the captain, well before he tried to recant or explain away his statement. Furthermore, even if \u201cnavigational rank or skills\u201d are not required, Cabezas\u2019s ability to navigate a ship, and skills as a captain, whether or not he knew how to use a sophisticated GPS device, could only serve to bolster the district court\u2019s ultimate determination that he was a \u201ccaptain\u201d of the boat within the meaning of \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">III. Constitutionality of the MDLEA</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Finally, Cabezas argues that the penalty provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960, referenced by the MDLEA, are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi, </em>and because those provisions are not severable from the crimes they penalize, both Cabezas\u2019 sentence and conviction are void. However, Cabezas waived his.right to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 960 and the MDLEA under <em>Apprendi </em>because he unconditionally pled guilty to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">We have held that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s unconditional plea of guilty, made knowingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>voluntarily, and with the benefit of competent counsel, waives all non-jurisdictional defects in that defendant\u2019s court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Pierre, </em>120 F.3d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation and citation omitted). Furthermore, we have held that <em>\u201c[Apprendi </em>] claims are not jurisdictional.\u201d <em>United States v. Ford, </em>270 F.3d 1346, 1347 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Here, the lynehpin of Cabezas\u2019 constitutional argument is that <em>Apprendi </em>renders unconstitutional the penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b). Because <em>Apprendi </em>claims are not jurisdictional, and Cabezas\u2019s unconditional guilty plea waived his right to challenge all non-jurisdictional defects, we decline to address the merits of his challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, Cabezas\u2019 135-month sentence and conviction are</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-10\">. Because <em>Booker </em>was decided after briefing in this case was completed, we requested and received supplemental briefing on Cabezas\u2019 <em>Booker </em>claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
