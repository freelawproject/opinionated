Arriyaga-Perez first argues that the district court erred when it held him responsible, as \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d for marijuana transported by other individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s relevant conduct for sentencing purposes is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 238 (5th Cir.2001); see <em>also United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). The base offense level for a defendant convicted of a drug offense is determined by the amount of drugs involved, including the amount that can be attributed to him as relevant conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(1), 2D1.1(a)(3). Relevant conduct includes \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">Arriyaga-Perez was recruited along with sixteen other recruitees and taken to warehouses in Mexico where he and the others picked up marijuana to import into the United States. After picking up the marijuana, Arriyaga-Perez and the others were transported together to the Rio Grande River. Together, they smuggled the marijuana across the river. Based on the record in this case, the district court\u2019s decision that the facts were more appropriately viewed as showing jointly undertaken criminal activity was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Coronado, </em>39 F.3d 573-74 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">Second, Arriyaga-Perez argues that the district court erred when it denied his request for a two-level reduction to his offense level based on his minor role. This court reviews for clear error a district court\u2019s findings on whether a defendant is entitled to a mitigating role reduction. <em>United States v. Virgen-Moreno, </em>265 F.3d 276, 296 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>To qualify as a minor participant, a defendant \u201cmust have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 446-47 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cA downward adjustment is appropriate only where a defendant was <em>substantially less culpable </em>than the average participant.\u201d <em>United States v. Valencia-Gonzales, </em>172 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant has the burden of proving that his role in the offense was minimal or minor. <em>United States v. Atonda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 198 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Arriyaga-Perez is equally culpable as the sixteen other men who were recruited to bring bundles of marijuana into the United States. Furthermore, ArriyagaPerez\u2019s conduct was not peripheral to the offense; his involvement began at the warehouses and continued until he was found with a large quantity of marijuana in the United States. He also expected to be paid for his participation in the offense. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s determination that Arriyaga-Perez was not a minor participant was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Valencia-Gonzales, </em>172 F.3d 344, 346-47 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Third, Arriyaga-Perez argues that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court sentenced him based on 509 kilograms of marijuana when he admitted only to \u201cin excess of 100 kilograms\u201d of marijuana. Because Arriyaga-Perez did not raise this issue in the district court, we review this claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Under the plain-error standard applied in <em>Mares, </em>the pertinent question is whether \u201cthe sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The record does not contain anything to reflect what the district court would have done had it sentenced him under an advisory scheme. Arriyaga-Perez has not sustained his burden of showing that the court would have reached a \u201csignificantly different result\u201d under an advisory scheme and has consequently failed to show plain error as to his Sixth Amendment argument. <em>See id.; United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Last, Arriyaga-Perez argues that the statute under which he was convicted, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and (b) is unconstitutional on its face, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We have specifically rejected the argument that <em>Apprendi </em>rendered 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\u2019s sentencing provisions facially unconstitutional. <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir. 2000); <em>see also United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>-F.3d-, 407 F.3d 728, 731 (5th Cir.2005). We are bound by our prior precedent on this issue. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>310 F.3d 787, 789 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
