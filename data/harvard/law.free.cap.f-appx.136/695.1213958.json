R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2). De Mino, who proceeded <em>pro se </em>in the district court, argues that he is entitled to fees under federal and Texas law. Alternatively, he avers he is entitled to recover paralegal fees for the legal work he performed on his case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-24\">De Mino claims attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. \u201c[T]he purpose of section 1988 is not to compensate a worthy advocate but to enable and encourage a wronged person to retain a lawyer.\u201d <em>Cofield v. City of Atlanta, </em>648 F.2d 986, 988 (5th Cir. Unit B June 1981). As a <em>pro se </em>litigant, de Mino is not entitled to recover under \u00a7 1988. <em>See id. </em>at 987-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-25\">To the extent that de Mino suggests that he should recover attorney\u2019s fees because he has a Texas bar card and because the district court treated him as an attorney, his claim fails. <em>See Kay v. Ehrler, </em>499 U.S. 432, 437-38, 111 S.Ct. 1435, 113 L.Ed.2d 486 (1991) (stating that an individual attorney cannot recover attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 for representing himself in a civil rights suit). Because we are bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, <em>see Johnson v. Uncle Ben\u2019s, Inc., </em>657 F.2d 750, 753 (5th Cir. Sept.1981), we decline de Mino\u2019s suggestion that we revisit the statutory construction of \u00a7 1988. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988. <em>See Dean v. Riser, </em>240 F.3d 505, 507 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-26\">De Mino also contends he is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees under chapters 37 and 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. He has not plainly shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for attorney\u2019s fees under chapter 37. <em>See Oake v. Collin County, </em>692 S.W.2d 454, 455 (Tex. 1985). Because de Mino was not represented by an attorney in the district court, he has not established an entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees under chapter 38. <em>See </em>Tex. Crv. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 38.002(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>De Mino\u2019s alternative argument that he should be entitled to recover \u201cparalegal fees\u201d for his legal work, while creative, is unpersuasive. As this court has stated, \u201c[t]he relief sought, that to be granted, or within the power of the court to grant, should be determined by substance, not a label.\u201d <em>Effjohn Int\u2019l Cruise Holdings, Inc. v. A &amp; L Sales, Inc., </em>346 F.3d 552, 560 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation and citation omitted). De Mino may not overcome the deficiencies in his claim for attorney\u2019s fees by pursuing compensation under a different label. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b720-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
