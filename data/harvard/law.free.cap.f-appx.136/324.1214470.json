R. Cri. P. 35(b)(2), to compel the Government to perform its obligations under a cooperation agreement he entered into with the office of the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Florida (the \u201cUSAO\u201d). According to Lehder-Rivas, the agreement provided that if he substantially assisted the USAO\u2019s investigation, the USAO would file a Rule 35 motion to reduce his sentence. He represents that he gave the United States Attorney\u2019s Office in Houston, Texas, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Joint Drug Intelligence Group assistance on a case, and they told him that they would recommend to the USAO that it file a Rule 35 motion on his behalf. The recommendation was forthcoming, he says; nonetheless, the USAO refuses to honor the agreement and file such a motion. He contends that an unconstitutional reason motivated the USAO\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Lehder-Rivas asked the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing on his motion to compel. The court considered an evidentiary hearing unnecessary and therefore declined to hold one. The court then denied his motion to compel, stating, in relevant part, that his claim that the USAO\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35 motion was based on an unconstitutional motive failed because he neither alleged, nor proffered evidence, that the USAO\u2019s refusal was based on his race.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Rule 35 allows the government to move the district court to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence when the defendant provides substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(b). The Supreme Court has stated in the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 context, which is akin to Rule 35, that the government has the power, but not the duty, to file a motion to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence for providing substantial assistance. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">[Fjederal district courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive. Thus, a defendant would be entitled to relief if a prosecutor refused to file a substantial-assistance motion, say, because of the defendant\u2019s race or religion.... [A] claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Nor would additional but generalized allegations of improper motive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">ld at 185-186, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-1844. We have said that a Rule 35 movant is only entitled to an evidentiary hearing when \u201che offers facts which, if proven, would establish ... a gross abuse of discretion in failing to reduce the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Winfield, </em>960 F.2d 970, 972 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">In the case at hand, the court was precluded from holding an evidentiary hearing because Lehder-Rivas failed to demonstrate \u2014 by allegation or proffer of evidence \u2014 that the USAO\u2019s decision not to file a Rule 35 motion was based on an unconstitutional motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">. Lehder-Rivas does assert that the USAO discriminated against him on account of his race, \"Latino,\u201d prior to his trial by refusing to offer him a plea bargain while at the same time offering a plea bargain to his 13 co-conspirators who are white. He has not alleged, however, that such discrimination somehow motived the USAO's decision not to file a Rule 35 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
