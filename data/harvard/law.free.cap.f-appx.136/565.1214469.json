Pope (\u201cPope\u201d) pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, pursuant to a written plea agreement. On April 19, 2004, the district court sentenced Pope to 262 months imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release. On appeal, Pope objects to the district court\u2019s finding that he is a career offender and argues that the district court erred in treating the sentencing guidelines as mandatory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the district court did not err in finding Pope to be a career offender and did not commit plain error that actually prejudiced Pope in treating the sentencing guidelines as mandatory. We thus affirm Pope\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Pursuant to Pope\u2019s plea agreement, he agreed that he was responsible for more than 150 grams but less than 500 grams of cocaine base. He further agreed that his base level offense should be increased by two levels for the possession of a dangerous weapon. The Government agreed not to oppose a three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The plea did not contain an agreement as to Pope\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">At sentencing, the district court found that Pope was a career offender pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guideline Manual \u00a7 4B1.1, based upon his prior felony convictions for robbery with a deadly weapon and unlawful possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Pope\u2019s counsel conceded that Pope had \u201ctwo prior predicate offenses. The one is robbery and the second one is for possession with intent to distribute.\u201d J.A. 21. Pope\u2019s counsel then moved for a downward departure arguing that categorizing Pope as a career offender overrepresented his criminal history. The district court judge rejected this argument, noting that Pope had \u201cbeen involved in crimes since he was 15 years old, reportedly], involving assaults, thefts, drug activities\u201d and finding that Pope \u201cis very much in the heartland of the career offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30-31. Pope waived certain appellate rights in his plea agreement but reserved the right to appeal the district court\u2019s decision on whether he was a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">We first address Pope\u2019s argument that under <em>United States v. Booker,</em>\u2014U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court erred by treating the sentencing guidelines as mandatory in determining his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Pope did not raise this issue below, our review is for plain error. To establish plain error, Pope must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even if Pope makes this showing, we may only correct the error if it \u201cseriously affeet[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">We recently addressed the proper analysis for evaluating a defendant\u2019s claim that the district court erred in failing to treat the guidelines as advisory. In <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208 (4th Cir. 2005), we held with regard to a defendant whose appeal was pending when <em>Booker </em>was decided, that it was error, which was plain, for the district court to treat the guidelines as mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 217. However, to satisfy the third prong of plain error analysis a defendant must show that he was actually prejudiced. <em>Id. </em>at 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">Pope has not met his burden of demonstrating that the error of sentencing him under the mandatory guidelines regime affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. The district court judge made no statements at sentencing indicating that he wished to sentence Pope below the guideline range but that the guidelines prevented him from doing so. In addition, the district court judge specifically noted after denying Pope\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on overrepresentation of criminal history that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-15\">There is no indication that he has learned any lessons about anything, quite candidly. He has had a life of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>crime. Perhaps with his being out of circulation for an extended period of time, he won\u2019t come back to a life of crime, but the community can\u2019t take a chance on that right now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">J.A. 31. The district court judge went on to give Pope a sentence at the lower end of the guidelines range but did not give any indication that this sentence was too harsh. Given these comments at sentencing, it is apparent that the district court felt that Pope\u2019s sentence was entirely appropriate for him, especially considering his criminal history. Thus, Pope cannot demonstrate that he was actually prejudiced by the district court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Second, Pope challenges his career offender status. Pope concedes that he has two prior qualifying convictions but argues that the prior conviction exception laid out in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), may no longer be good law. This argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s reaffirmation of the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>prior conviction exception in <em>Booker. See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (\u201cAny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Likewise, the application of the pri- or conviction exception to Pope does not raise any of the problems outlined in <em>Shepard v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). In <em>Shepard, </em>the Supreme Court instructed that Sixth Amendment protections apply to disputed facts about a prior conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63. Because no facts related to Pope\u2019s prior convictions are disputed, the district court judge\u2019s application of the career offender designation to Pope did not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>Cf. United States v. Washington, </em>404 F.3d 834, 843 (4th Cir.2005) (finding that district court\u2019s reliance on disputed facts about the defendant\u2019s prior conviction violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Pope\u2019s sentence and deny his motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-13\">. Pope filed a motion to remand his case for resentencing after he filed his initial appeal. We reserved judgment on that motion until we ruled on the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-11\">. Pope does not argue that the district court judge imposed a sentence greater than the maximum authorized solely by the facts that he admitted and thus does not claim a Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\">. While Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence in <em>Shepard v. United States,</em>-U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1263-64, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), expressed doubt on the future viability of the exception, the exception is still good law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
