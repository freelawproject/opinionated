Because we find no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Osahar filed an employment discrimination complaint against the USPS, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq., </em>alleging that he was subjected to racial discrimination, retaliation for filing grievances, and a hostile work environment. The USPS moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted, and we affirmed. The USPS, as the prevailing party, then filed the instant motion for award of costs, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d), in the amount of $3,784.08, plus interest. This amount reflected costs related to obtaining copies of Osahar\u2019s deposition transcript and photocopying discovery documents, pleadings, and other necessary papers. The district court granted the USPS\u2019s costs motion, and the USPS moved for entry of final costs judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In response, Osahar filed a \u201cmotion for stay without filing of supersedeas bond,\u201d asking that the court stay execution of the order granting the USPS award of costs and any final costs judgment. The USPS filed a motion for enlargement of time to respond to Osahar\u2019s motion. After the district court granted the USPS\u2019s time enlargement, Osahar filed a reply, arguing that the district court was precluded from granting any time enlargement because the response time had already elapsed before the enlargement request was filed. The USPS then responded to Osahar\u2019s motion for stay within the enlarged time frame. The district court ultimately granted the USPS\u2019s motion for entry of final costs judgment, and denied Osahar\u2019s motion for stay without filing of supersede-as bond. Oshar then filed a supersedeas bond and brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">Osahar first argues that the district court erred by granting the USPS\u2019s motion for enlargement of time to respond to his motion for stay without filing of supersedeas bond because the USPS\u2019s motion for enlargement of time was untimely filed, in violation of Local Rule 7.1 and Fed. R.Civ.P. 6. Second, Osahar argues that the USPS overcharged him for pages of his deposition transcript that were not submitted to the court, as only 67 pages of his deposition transcript were \u201cadmitted as necessary.\u201d He further contends that the USPS improperly included its half of their mediation bill in its verified bill of costs. Finally, Osahar argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for stay without filing of supersedeas bond because (1) a bond is not always required, and (2) in his case, the requirement of a bond is \u201cnot in the interest of justice and is an unjust imposition of cost that provides the [USPS] ... no additional security.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of an enlargement of time, pursuant to Rule 6(b), for an abuse of discretion. <em>Useden v. Acker, </em>947 F.2d 1563, 1571 (11th Cir.1991). Similarly, in addressing Osahar\u2019s contentions regarding the district court\u2019s grant of costs judgment, we \u201cwill not disturb a costs award in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>U.S. E.E.O.C. v. W &amp; O, Inc., </em>213 F.3d 600, 619-20 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">ENLARGEMENT OF TIME</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">According to Rule 6(b), a court may enlarge the time period in which a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>has to act, even upon a motion made after the expiration of the specified time period, where the failure to act was the result of \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b). As Rule 6(b) expressly permits an extension of time where the motion to extend was filed after the original time frame had expired, we can perceive no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s grant of the USPS\u2019s motion to expand its response time.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">AWARD OF COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"AuZ\">Rule 54(d)(1) allows prevailing parties to recover costs other than attorneys\u2019 fees. Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1). Taxable costs include: (i) court reporter fees for transcripts \u201cnecessarily obtained for use in the case\u201d; and (ii) fees for \u201ccopies of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920; <em>see also W &amp; 0, </em>213 F.3d at 620-21 (\u201cTaxation of deposition costs is authorized by \u00a7 1920(2) ... [and a] district court may tax costs associated with the depositions submitted by the parties in support of their summary judgment motions.\u201d (internal quotations and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">. [2] We agree with the district court that the costs relating both to photocopying and Osahar\u2019s deposition transcript were \u201cnecessarily obtained for use in the case.\u201d The entirety of Osahar\u2019s deposition transcript was filed in support of the USPS\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See W &amp; O, </em>213 F.3d at 621 (\u201cA district court may tax costs associated with the depositions submitted by the parties in support of their summary judgment motions.\u201d) (internal citations and quotation omitted). Moreover, our review of the record does not support Osahar\u2019s contentions that the USPS\u2019s bill of costs improperly included the costs of mediation. We find no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s taxation of costs against Osahar on the merits, we need not address Osahar\u2019s now-moot arguments regarding the district court's denial of his motion for a stay of judgment pending appeal without bond.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
