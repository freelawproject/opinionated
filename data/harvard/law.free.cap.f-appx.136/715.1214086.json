Blanton, Texas prisoner number 750531, filed the instant 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit to seek redress for the defendant prison officials\u2019 alleged wrongdoing. Blanton appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his suit as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. Blanton also moves this court for the appointment of counsel. Blanton\u2019s motion for counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Blanton argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims that the defendants retaliated against him for exercising his right of access to courts and his right to file grievances. However, Blanton has not alleged a series of events from which a plausible retaliation claim could be gleaned, nor has he offered direct evidence of a retaliatory motive. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir.1995). Rather, his retaliation claims are based on his own personal beliefs and conclusional assertions, which are insufficient to raise a viable retaliation claim. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 310 (5th Cir.1997); Woods, 60 F.3d at 1166. Blanton has not demonstrated that the district court erred in dismissing his retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">Blanton also contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claims that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. This argument is likewise unavailing. Blanton has not established that the defendants purposefully ignored a serious illness or injury and that he suffered as a result of their actions or lack thereof. <em>See Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). Rather, his arguments in support of these claims amount to no more than allegations of negligence or malpractice, which are insufficient to raise a plausible claim of deliberate indifference. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Blanton has not demonstrated that the district court erred in dismissing his deliberate-indifference claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-15\">Blanton\u2019s argument that the magistrate judge was biased against him is unavailing. Blanton\u2019s allegations are insufficient to show that a reasonable person who was aware of all the circumstances surrounding this case would harbor doubts concerning the magistrate judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>160 F.3d 231, 233 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-16\">Blanton has shown no error in the judgment of the district court. Accordingly, that judgment is AFFIRMED. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Blanton\u2019s suit and this court\u2019s affirmance of that dismissal count as a single strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Blanton is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Moreover, he should review any pending appeals or district court actions to ensure that they are not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">MOTION DENIED; JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
