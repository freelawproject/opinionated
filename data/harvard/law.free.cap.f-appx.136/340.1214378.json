Upon being notified that he was a removable alien, Davilmar filed a claim for asylum, sought withholding of removal under the Immigration and Naturalization Act, and requested relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The IJ denied Davilmar relief and entered an order directing that he be removed to Haiti. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">Through counsel, Davilmar petitions this Court for review of his claim for asylum. On appeal, he has not argued that he is entitled to withholding of removal or CAT relief and, accordingly, he has abandoned those claims. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-19\">Davilmar first argues that his appeal to the BIA warranted a three-member panel review. The regulations governing the BIA\u2019s case management system provide that a case be heard by a single Board member unless the case involves one of six enumerated circumstances. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The initial determination of whether a case should be heard by a single Board member or a three-member panel is made by a screening panel comprised of Board members. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(1);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Once the screening panel decides that a case should be heard by a single Board member, that Board member has the authority to determine that the case should be instead referred to a three-member panel. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(3);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.1(e)(5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The six circumstances for which \u201c[c]ases may ... be assigned for review by a three-member panel\u201d are enumerated in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6). One of those circumstances is \u201c[t]he need to settle inconsistencies among the rulings of different immigration judges.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6)\u00ae. Davilmar contends that a three-member panel was warranted here because a precedent-setting case was needed to resolve inconsistent decisions on the issue of whether street youths in Haiti constitute a cognizable social group. Davilmar has partially cited two unpublished BIA decisions in support of his contention that various Immigration Judges have been resolving the issue differently. He, however, has not attached the decisions for our review, nor has he provided full citations that would allow us to find them. Accordingly, Davilmar has not demonstrated that review by a three-member panel was required \u201cto settle inconsistencies among the rulings of different immigration judges.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6)\u00ae.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Davilmar also contends that a three-member panel was required because the IJ was biased against him. Davilmar apparently thinks that a three-judge panel would be more likely to reverse the IJ than a single judge would be. Generously assuming that bias might fall within one of the enumerated circumstances, Davilmar\u2019s claim still fails because he has not demonstrated that the IJ was biased against him. Davilmar offers a single comment made by the IJ as an example of bias. Out of context and without more, the comment appears to be merely a question or comment; it is not clear evidence of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">In light of Davilmar\u2019s failure to establish that his case presents any of the enumerated circumstances in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6), we need not \u2014 and we do not \u2014 reach the question of whether review of a three-member panel is required when those circumstances are established. Nor do we decide whether the failure of the BIA to use a three-member panel in circumstances in which the regulations call for one would require reversal of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Davilmar next argues that the IJ\u2019s refusal to allow expert testimony on Haiti street youth constituted \u201charmful error.\u201d Davilmar conceded that he failed to timely list the expert as a witness. He contends, however, that the expert would have provided testimony establishing Haiti street youth as a cognizable, persecuted social group. The government assumed that this is a Due Process challenge and, absent any guidance from Davilmar, we will too.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">\u201cTo prevail ... on a due process challenge to a deportation proceeding, an alien must show substantial prejudice,\u201d which means that the result would have been different if not for the violation. <em>Patel v. Attorney Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Ibrahim v. I.N.S., </em>821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1987). To show substantial prejudice in this case, Davilmar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>must show that if his expert witness had been allowed to testify that testimony would have led to a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Davilmar contends that the expert would have provided testimony establishing Haiti street youth as a cognizable, persecuted social group, in that they are targeted by police for persecution and criminalized by the Haitian general public. This information, however, was presented in the evidence in the form of an article by the expert and an affidavit from that expert. The IJ explicitly stated that he had considered this evidence. Moreover, as discussed below, the IJ concluded that even if Haiti street youth are a cognizable, persecuted social group, Davilmar is not a member of that group. Hence, Davilmar has not shown that allowing his expert to testify would have led to a different result, and thus he cannot prevail on his due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Lastly, Davilmar argues that the IJ erred in finding that Haitian street youth do not constitute a distinct social group and that Davilmar failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on his membership in that group.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u201cTo the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, this Court\u2019s review is <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and this Court must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817-18 (internal marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to an alien who meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-11\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ..., and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of <em>persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of </em>race, religion, nationality, <em>membership in a particular social group, </em>or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1287 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">Even assuming, without deciding, that Haitian street youth constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s findings that Davilmar failed to establish his membership in that group. First, Davilmar testified that he was 19 years old at the time of his hearing before the IJ and was, thus, an adult. The evidence in the record indicates that Haitian street youth are comprised of youth between the ages of 6 and 18 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">Second, Davilmar failed to prove he would be living on the street upon his return to Haiti. The record contains no evidence that Davilmar had ever been homeless while in Haiti. Rather, the record reflects that he had lived in his grandmother\u2019s house in Haiti, and that he had not inquired into whether other members of his family might be able to take him in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>upon his return. Moreover, while Davilmar testified that there was \u201cno work\u201d in Haiti, he also testified that he had not explored employment opportunities in Haiti and he had a better education than most people in Haiti and spoke some English. Thus, while evidence indicates job opportunities in Haiti are scarce, Davilmar has not proven that he could not get a job upon his return and as a result might be left homeless.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">For these reasons, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Davilmar failed to establish his membership in the group of Haiti street youth. As a consequence, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Davilmar failed to establish his eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-12\">. In pertinent part, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e) provides: \"Unless a case meets the standards for assignment to a three-member panel under paragraph (e)(6) of this section, all cases shall be assigned to a single Board member for disposition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-13\">.

We recognize that the IJ said in his oral decision that there \"apparently\u201d are conflicting decisions. Record at 194.
