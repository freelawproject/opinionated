Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He acknowledges that the argument is reviewed for plain error but contends that he does not have to demonstrate any effect on his substantial rights because the error is structural and because prejudice should be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-25\">Plain error is the correct standard of review. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>- F.3d -, No. 03-41618, 2005 WL 1320362 at *1 n. 9 (5th Cir. Apr.11, 2005). The district court committed error that is plain when it sentenced Gomez under a mandatory sentencing guidelines regime. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Gomez, however, fails to meet his burden of showing that the district court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Valenzeuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733-34; <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521. His argument that <em>Mares </em>was wrongly decided is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-28\">As he concedes, Gomez\u2019s argument that the sentencing provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) are unconstitutional is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except' under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b689-29\"> Gomez does not appeal the revocation of his supervised release or the sentence imposed following revocation based on this offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
