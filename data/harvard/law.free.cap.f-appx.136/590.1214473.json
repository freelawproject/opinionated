In that litigation, the plaintiffs, purchasers of Summit Development lots and homes (herein referenced as the third-party claimants), have alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellants failed to disclose that the Summit Development had previously been used by the Department of Defense as a training site for aerial bombing and, as a result, contained Ordinance and Explosive Wastes (OEW). J.A.256.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">At the time appellees instigated the instant declaratory judgment action, the operative complaint in the state court proceedings alleged that appellants\u2019 tortious conduct resulted <em>only </em>in <em>economic damages </em>to their property. <em>See </em>J.A. 12 (\u201cAs a result of the existence of OEW within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Summit Development the value of Plaintiffs\u2019 property ... is substantially less than the value it was represented to be.\u201d). The district court, before resolving any of the issues in the case, certified the following question to the South Carolina Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">Do the subject CGL policies obligate the plaintiffs to indemnify and defend the corporate defendants for the claims of the claimants which are economic in nature and based solely on the diminution in value of the claimants\u2019 respective properties?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\"><em>Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Carl Brazell Builders, Inc., </em>356 S.C. 156, 588 S.E.2d 112, 115 (2003). The South Carolina Supreme Court answered this question in the negative. It noted that the subject CGL policies defined \u201cproperty damage\u201d as <em>either </em>\u201cphysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property\u201d or \u201closs of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that <em>only </em>the former definition (physical injury) was at issue here as the operative complaint did \u201cnot contain a claim for loss of use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then concluded that the complaint did not \u201callege any physical injury ... but solely economic damages,\u201d which are not covered by the policies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">After this ruling, the third-party claimants amended their state court complaint to include an allegation that \u201c[plaintiffs ... <em>can not enjoy the full use </em>of their property without first conducting geographical surveys to determine the extent of OEW contamination on their property and taking steps to remove such materials.\u201d J.A. 66. Plaintiff-appellees subsequently sought a declaration from the district court that they were not obligated to defend against the \u201closs of use\u201d claims. The district court granted Plaintiff-appellees\u2019 summary judgment motion and the instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The CGL policies at issue in this appeal provide, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">1. a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend any \u201csuit\u201d seeking those damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-11\">^ ^ ^ ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">b. This insurance applies to \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-13\">(1) The \u201cbodily injury\u201d or <em>\u201cproperty damage\u201d is caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d </em>that takes place in the \u201ccoverage territory\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-14\">(2) The \u201cbodily injury\u201d or <em>\u201cproperty damage\u201d occurs during the policy period.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-15\"># * * # # N*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-16\">\u201cOccurrence\u201d means an accident, including a continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-17\">\u201cProperty damage\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-18\">a. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-19\">\n<em>b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss shall be deemed to occur at the time of the \u201coccurrence\u201d that caused it.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-20\">J.A. 17-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-21\">In this diversity case, we apply South Carolina law to the question of whether the foregoing policy terms require appellee-insurance companies to defend appellants against the claims of the third-party claimants. Under South Carolina law, \u201c[qjuestions of coverage and the duty of a liability insurance company to defend a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>claim brought against its insured are <em>determined by the allegations of the third party\u2019s complaint </em>.... <em>If the underlying complaint creates a possibility of coverage under an insurance policy, the insurer is obligated to defend. \u201d Isle of Palms Pest Control Co. v. Monticello Ins. Co., </em>319 S.C. 12, 459 S.E.2d 318, 319 (1995) (emphasis added). Accordingly, consistent with the foregoing CGL policy terms, we must examine the third-party claimants\u2019 complaint to determine whether it alleges an occurrence that occurred during the policy period that caused the loss of use of the third-party claimants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The district court held that the complaints in the underlying litigation did not allege an occurrence during the policy period that <em>caused </em>property damage as defined in the policy, i.e., loss of use. The district court reasoned that there were two possible occurrences, either the bombing or the appellants\u2019 \u201calleged negligent misrepresentation and negligent failure to inform the Claimants of the contamination.\u201d J.A. 258. According to the district court, neither of these occurrences triggered coverage; the bombing occurred before the policy period and appellants\u2019 negligence \u201cdid not \u2018cause\u2019 the property damage.\u201d J.A. 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The district court erred. Whether appellants\u2019 negligence <em>caused </em>the third-party claimants\u2019 loss of use is a question of fact that will ultimately be resolved in the underlying state court litigation. This factual determination has no bearing under South Carolina law on the question relevant to appellees\u2019 duty to defend, namely whether the third-party claimants have <em>alleged </em>an occurrence that caused their loss of use. Here, the underlying complaint alleges that appellants\u2019 negligence <em>\u201ccaused </em>Plaintiffs and members of Plaintiff Class to suffer ... <em>interference with the full use and enjoyment of their property.\u201d </em>J.A. 67-68 (emphasis added); <em>id. </em>at 66, 459 S.E.2d 318 (\u201cPlaintiffs ... can not enjoy the <em>fall use of their property ...\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). While the district court may be correct that the third-party claimants\u2019 lawsuit is meritless as to the loss of use damages, such a conclusion does not relieve appellees of their duty to defend appellants. The duty to defend is triggered by frivolous and non-frivolous allegations alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Appellees nonetheless maintain that the underlying complaint does not trigger a duty to defend because appellants\u2019 alleged negligence does not satisfy the policies\u2019 definition of \u201coccurrence.\u201d But the South Carolina Supreme Court has held that negligence is an occurrence as that term is defined in the instant CGL policies. <em>See Boggs v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., </em>272 S.C. 460, 252 S.E.2d 565 (1979) (holding that \u201cBoggs\u2019 negligent decision to place the house on that particular portion of the lot was an \u2018occurrence\u2019 within the meaning of the policy,\u201d where occurrence was defined as it is in the instant policies); <em>see also Isle of Palms, </em>459 S.E.2d at 319 (holding that a negligent termite inspection was an \u201coccurrence\u201d as that term is defined in a CGL policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Although the district court erred when it determined that the complaint did not allege an occurrence that caused loss of use, it nonetheless reached the correct result. Appellees\u2019 duty to defend is relieved by the policy\u2019s exclusion \u201cm,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aui\">This insurance does not apply to \u201cproperty damage\u201d to \u201cimpaired property\u201d or property that has not been physically injured, arising out of: (1) a defect, deficiency, inadequacy or dangerous condition in \u201cyour product\u201d or \u201cyour work\u201d; or (2) a delay or failure by you or anyone acting on your behalf to perform a contract or agreement in accordance with its terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The policy goes on to define \u201cyour work\u201d as \u201cwork or operations performed by you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>or on your behalf,\u201d including \u201cwarranties or representations made at any time with respect to the fitness, quality, durability, performance or use of \u2018yo^ work,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthe providing or failure to provide warnings or instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">By its terms, exclusion \u201cm\u201d is applicable to the allegations in the underlying complaint. As noted above, any duty to defend can only be based on the third-party claimants\u2019 alleged loss of use; the South Carolina Supreme Court has already determined that appellees do not have a duty to defend against claims pertaining to physical property damage. <em>See Auto-Owners, </em>588 S.E.2d at 115-16. Thus, the damaged property in this case is, as the exclusion requires, \u201cproperty not physically injured.\u201d And, according to the allegations in the underlying complaint, all of the property damage was caused by defects, deficiencies, or inadequacies in appellants\u2019 work. As an initial matter, any representations or misrepresentations pertaining to the presence of OEW are covered because \u201cyour work\u201d includes \u201crepresentations\u201d and the \u201cfailure to provide warnings.\u201d Additionally, appellants\u2019 decision to \u201cdesign[ ] and construct ]\u201d the Summit Development on a \u201cformer bombing site\u201d is work performed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Appellants nonetheless maintain that the exclusion does not apply to the allegations that appellants failed to conduct geographic and environmental surveys and failed to remove the OEW, <em>see </em>J.A. 67, because such failures do not fall within the definition of \u201cyour work\u201d because no \u201cwork [was] <em>performed.\u201d </em>But appellants\u2019 \u201cwork\u201d was the development of the site, including subdividing the lots and building the homes. Appellants\u2019 alleged failures to investigate and remove the OEW constitute defects, deficiencies, or inadequacies in their development of the site, i.e., in the performance of their work. Accordingly, there is no possibility that appellees will be obligated to cover losses suffered by appellants in the underlying litigation and appellees are therefore not obligated to defend appellants in that litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-6\">. Because these three appeals present insurance coverage disputes involving the application of identical insurance policy language to the same underlying state court litigation, we consolidated the cases for argument and dispose of them together in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-14\">.
