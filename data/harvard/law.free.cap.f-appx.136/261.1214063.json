Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>he petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order affirming without opinion the immigration judge\u2019s denial of his request for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and for relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">M\u00e1xime first contends that the IJ erred by denying his application for asylum because, according to M\u00e1xime, the record shows that he has a well-founded fear of persecution based on his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We use a \u201chighly deferential\u201d standard of review to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the IJ\u2019s factual decision that M\u00e1xime is not eligible for asylum. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe must defer to the [IJ] unless a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Lorisme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1445 (11th Cir.1997) (internal marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-17\">Any alien who arrives or is present in the United States may apply for asylum, and the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to anyone who qualifies as a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined by the INA as \u201cany person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... who is unable or unwilling to return to ... that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-18\">\u201cTo establish asylum eligibility based on political opinion or any other protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ground, the alien must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of [his] political opinion ..., or (2) a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that [his] political opinion ... will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005). The alien must present \u201cspecific, detailed\u201d facts showing that the persecution he has suffered or fears he will suffer is on account of his political opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 1231. \u201cEven a clear probability that an alien\u2019s life is threatened without any indication that the basis of the threat is related to a statutorily enumerated ground is insufficient to establish eligibility for relief.\u201d <em>Perlera-Escobar v. INS, </em>894 F.2d 1292, 1297 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that M\u00e1xime has failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. First, there is no evidence that M\u00e1xime suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion. M\u00e1xime did testify that he was shot at and received several threatening telephone calls, but he provided no evidence that those incidents were related to his political opinion. Neither the shooters nor the callers identified themselves as members of the Lavalas party (the group that M\u00e1xime claims has or will persecute him), nor did they say anything about Maxime\u2019s political opinion or that of his family members. In fact, M\u00e1xime himself admits that he was not involved with politics in any way or associated with any groups or organizations in Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Second, M\u00e1xime has failed to show that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution due to his political opinion. M\u00e1xime claims that several of his relatives who had been members of the Haitian army were killed by members of the Lavalas party, which abolished the Haitian army and cracked down on its former members after regaining power in Haiti in 1994. M\u00e1xime contends that his relationship with those family members also makes him a target of Lavalas. There are numerous problems with this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">First, although M\u00e1xime testified that several of his relatives, including his father and brothers, had been killed, he presented no other evidence to suggest they were murdered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, even if we were to assume that Maxime\u2019s family members were murdered, M\u00e1xime has provided only speculative and secondhand evidence to suggest that their deaths were related to their political opinions. For instance, M\u00e1xime claims that his uncle\u2019s killers wrote \u201cHave respect for KLSN Lavalas\u201d on a wall in his uncle\u2019s home. Yet, M\u00e1xime was not there and did not see the message; he learned of it only from neighbors who told him about it. Similarly, Maxime\u2019s claim that his father died due to stress resulting from the robbery of his bakery by members of the Lavalas party is mere speculation based on what others told him. M\u00e1xime was not there at the time of either the robbery or his father\u2019s death. Moreover, M\u00e1xime specifically admitted that he did not know who had killed his brother Rony or what had happened to his other brother Ganel; he simply \u201cimagine[d]\u201d it was Lavalas. A.R. 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">Finally, even if we were to assume that Maxime\u2019s family members were murdered due to their political opinions or their in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>volvement in the former Haitian army, that would not show that M\u00e1xime will also be the target of such violence. In fact, the record shows that M\u00e1xime was not closely affiliated with his relatives who were members of the former Haitian army. He was raised by an aunt and did not live with his father and brothers or have close contact with them. That Maxime\u2019s relatives who were members of the former army may have been targeted by Lavalas is insufficient to show that he will be, especially considering that he was never a member of the army. Even the country report that M\u00e1xime belatedly submitted (and which, therefore, the IJ did not admit into evidence) states that attacks on relatives of former Haitian army soldiers are not a problem in Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Next, M\u00e1xime contends that the IJ incorrectly determined that he was not entitled to either withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The burden of proof is higher for withholding of removal than for asylum. Thus, if \u201can applicant is unable to meet the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum, he is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93. Because M\u00e1xime failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution sufficient to support his asylum claim, he also could not establish that he was eligible for withholding of removal, and the IJ\u2019s decision was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that M\u00e1xime is not entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture because he failed to show that he will more likely than not be tortured if he is returned to Haiti. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). An IJ must consider all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture, including evidence of past torture inflicted on the applicant and evidence that the applicant could relocate to a part of the country where he is unlikely to be tortured. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.16(c)(3). Here, M\u00e1xime has shown no evidence of past torture. The IJ properly considered the fact that, on at least one occasion, the police department (members of which, according to M\u00e1xime, had attempted to kill him) let him go without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Furthermore, the record suggests that M\u00e1xime could relocate to another part of Haiti to avoid any likelihood of torture. Maxime\u2019s (now) ex-wife has remained in Haiti with their two children without any problems. And, M\u00e1xime himself testified that he became a target only after Lavalas party members who knew that his uncle, father, and brothers had been in the former Haitian army saw him at a funeral in Cap-Haitien. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that M\u00e1xime could avoid problems with those Lavalas members by relocating to another town.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\">. M\u00e1xime attempted to introduce their death certificates, but the IJ did not admit them into evidence because M\u00e1xime had submitted them untimely. Even if the death certificates had been admitted, they provide no evidence that Maxime's family members were murdered because they do not describe the causes of death or provide any other information to corroborate Maxime\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
