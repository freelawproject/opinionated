Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At sentencing, the district court concluded that it did not have the constitutional authority to enhance Bryan\u2019s sentence based upon a quantity of drugs that exceeded the quantity contained in the indictment in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The government objected at sentencing and argues that the district court erred by extending <em>Blakely </em>to the Sentencing Guidelines and refusing to enhance Bryan\u2019s sentence based on the sentencing guidelines even though the court decreased Bryan\u2019s sentence based upon a reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 749-52. In a second and separate majority opinion, the Court in <em>Booker </em>concluded that, to best preserve Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the appropriate remedy was to \u201cexcise\u201d two specific sections \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence within the guideline range, absent a departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal, including <em>de novo </em>review of departures from the applicable guideline range) \u2014 thereby effectively rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only. <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 764. The Supreme Court noted, however, that courts must continue to consult the Guidelines, together with the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The Court further indicated that both its \u201cSixth Amendment holding and ... remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act\u201d must be applied to \u201call cases on direct review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-19\">One of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>two defendants, Ducan Fanfan, was sentenced based upon the district court\u2019s partial application of the Guidelines. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 747. Specifically, the district court in Fanfan\u2019s case refused to apply enhancements for additional drug quantities exceeding the quantities contained in the indictment or in the jury\u2019s verdict, or for Fanfan\u2019s role in the offense, but did apply other provisions of the Guidelines that it found did not implicate the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held that Fanfan\u2019s sentence did not violate the Sixth Amendment because it did not exceed the sentence authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 769. Nevertheless, the Court vacated Fanfan\u2019s sentence to allow the government to seek resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-24\">Because the district court erred in light of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>by failing to properly calculate and consider the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range, we vacate and remand Bryan\u2019s sentence to the district court for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Upon careful review of the sentencing transcript and the presentence investigation report, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-11\">. Both parties\u2019 briefs in this appeal were filed prior to the Supreme Court's recent decision in <em>Booker. </em>Therefore, we requested and received supplemental briefing on the effect of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-12\">. These factors include, <em>inter alia, </em>the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence, protection of the public, the pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-26\">. Bryan does not argue that the <em>Booker </em>error was harmless, but rather urges this Court to ignore the error and simply review for reasonableness. However, \"once the court of appeals has decided that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>misapplied the Guidelines, a remand is appropriate unless the reviewing court concludes, on the record as a whole, that the error was harmless, i.e., that the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d Wil<em>liams v.
