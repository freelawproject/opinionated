Parra-Sotelo argues for the first time on appeal that the statute of conviction, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), (b), is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Parra-Sotelo\u2019s appeal waiver does not bar review of this issue because he did not waive his right to appeal his conviction. Nevertheless, as he concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
