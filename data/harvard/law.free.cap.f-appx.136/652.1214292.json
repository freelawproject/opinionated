Fobbs argues on appeal that his enhanced sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We review this argument for plain error because Fobbs did not make a Sixth Amendment objection in the district court. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-23\">As Fobbs does not suggest that his sentence was enhanced based on any fact <em>other than a prior conviction, </em>he has not shown that his sentence violates <em>Booker </em>or the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 769. We agree with Fobbs that the district court erred when it sentenced him pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system. <em>Id. </em>at 750, 768-69. Nevertheless, as the record does not suggest in any way that the district court would have imposed a different sentence had it been aware that the sentencing guidelines are merely advisory, Fobbs has not met his burden of establishing plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b676-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
