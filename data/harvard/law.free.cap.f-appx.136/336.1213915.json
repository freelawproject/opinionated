Signore, appeals the judgment of the district court on the ground that the district court erred in granting the Defendant City of Montgomery\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We agree with the district court that even if Signore was speaking on a matter of public concern, his First Amendment interests were outweighed by the City\u2019s interests in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs. <em>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1734-35, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968); <em>Watkins v. Bowden, </em>105 F.3d 1344, 1352-53 (11th Cir.1997). We further agree with the district court that Signore did not properly raise any overbreadth challenge to the Montgomery Police Department regulations pursuant to which he was disciplined. The judgment of the district court is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
