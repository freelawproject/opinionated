For the first time on appeal, he argues that the district court erred in imposing a sentence under a mandatory guideline scheme, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,---, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Palacios did not raise this issue in the district court, this court reviews the argument for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, Palacios must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-24\">(1) an error;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-25\">(2) that is clear or plain; (3) that affected his substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of his judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-26\">Palacios argues that sentencing him under a mandatory guideline scheme constitutes plain error. He makes no showing, as required by <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>that the district court would likely have sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>him differently under an advisory sentencing scheme. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733-34. Similarly, there is no indication from the court\u2019s remarks at sentencing that the court would have reached a different conclusion. Thus, Palacios has not met his burden to show that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence under a mandatory guideline scheme was plain error. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Palacios\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b687-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
