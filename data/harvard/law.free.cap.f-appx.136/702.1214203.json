WISD asserts that dismissal was proper, renewing its argument that Restitution Revival\u2019s claims are not ripe and are barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-23\">Although neither party addresses the issue, we find that Restitution Revival\u2019s lawsuit, by which it seeks to collaterally attack the state-court judgment in the condemnation proceedings, is barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine. <em>See Liedtke </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>v. State Bar of Texas, </em>18 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Restitution Revival\u2019s proper remedy was to seek certiorari from the Supreme Court after the Texas Supreme Court denied review in the condemnation proceedings, not file suit in federal district court. <em>See Liedtke, </em>18 F.3d at 317. The district court\u2019s dismissal of the lawsuit is AFFIRMED. <em>See Doody v. Ameriquest Mortgage Co., </em>242 F.3d 286, 289 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b726-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
