Basse. He claimed defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs and denied him medical treatment on the basis of his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Bocanegra first complains the district court erred in failing, prior to dismissal, to conduct a <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), hearing or to use a questionnaire. We review the denial of a <em>Spears </em>hearing for abuse of discretion, considering whether the complaint\u2019s allegations would pass muster with additional factual development. <em>E.g., Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 10 (5th Cir.1994). Bocanegra has not shown the district court abused its discretion; he does not describe additional facts to salvage his otherwise deficient complaint that would have been revealed either through a <em>Spears </em>hearing or by a questionnaire. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-14\">Dismissal of an IFP complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(I) is reviewed for abuse of discretion, <em>e.g., Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997); dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b)(ii), <em>de novo. Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir. 1999). Review of the record and Bocanegra\u2019s brief on appeal reveals the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Bocanegra\u2019s complaint as frivolous or err in dismissing it for failure to state a claim. <em>See id.; Eason, </em>14 F.3d at 10. Bocanegra\u2019s allegations of denial of medical treatment or proper testing amount to a disagreement with the course of his treatment, which is insufficient to support relief for a claim brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). At most, Bocanegra\u2019s allegations that he should have been administered a particular test or treatment amount to assertions of medical malpractice or negligence, rather than an Eighth Amendment denial of medical care. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">Bocanegra fails to allege any act evidencing discriminatory intent on the part of the named defendants to support his assertion that he was denied medical treatment on the basis of his race. <em>See McCleskey v. Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 292, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 95 L.Ed.2d 262 (1987). Bocanegra\u2019s allegation that two white inmates received tests/treatment that Bocanegra believed he should have received is also insufficient to support a claim of racial animus because Bocanegra failed to allege any facts showing the two white inmates were, in all other respects, similarly situat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ed to him. <em>Muhammad v. Lynaugh, </em>966 F.2d 901, 903 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Bocanegra\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Bocanegra\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction is DENIED. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Bocanegra: if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility, unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\n<em>APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION DENIED; STRIKE WARNING ISSUED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
