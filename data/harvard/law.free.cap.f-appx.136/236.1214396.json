We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-27\">Zhang, a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, arrived in the United States on July 30, 2002. She filed an asylum application on November 25, 2002. Zhang alleged that she suffered past persecution on account of her political opinion because she did not agree with the repression of Falun Gong, a religious sect, by the Chinese gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ernment. Although Zhang was not a member of the sect, Zhang\u2019s grandfather was a practitioner of Falun Gong. Zhang testified that Chinese officials twice raided her home to arrest her grandfather, and after the second raid, the officials threatened to arrest her entire family if her grandfather did not surrender. Zhang\u2019s parents and grandfather went into hiding in Shen Zhen in China. Zhang escaped from China and came to the United States. Zhang argues that she fears she will be arrested if she returns to China because of her grandfather\u2019s association with Falun Gong and because she left the country illegally. The Immigration Judge denied Zhang\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal, because, Zhang, although credible, did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution or torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We review the decision of the Immigration Judge as if it were the decision of the BIA, because the BIA adopted the decision of the Immigration Judge without opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cThe IJ\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u2018must affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d \u2019 <em>Sepulveda v. United States Atty. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). \u201cUnder this highly deferential standard of review, the IJ\u2019s decision can be reversed only if the evidence \u2018compels\u2019 a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). An alien who establishes, with specific and credible evidence either (1) past persecution on account of his or her membership in a particular social group, political opinion, or other statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his or her membership in a particular social group, political opinion, or other statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution, is eligible for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. \u201c[A]n applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Substantial evidence supports the finding of the Immigration Judge that Zhang did not suffer past persecution or establish a well-founded fear of persecution if she returned to China. \u201cAlthough, the INA does not expressly define \u2018persecution\u2019 for purposes of qualifying as a \u2018refugee,\u2019 see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), we have discussed other circuits\u2019 holdings that \u2018persecution\u2019 is an \u2018extreme concept,\u2019 requiring \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u2019 and that \u2018[m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231. (citation omitted). Zhang did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">At most, Zhang established that Chinese officials threatened to arrest her and her family because of her grandfather\u2019s religious opinion, not because of Zhang\u2019s religious or political opinion. In addition, as a result of the threat of arrest, Zhang\u2019s parents and grandfather relocated in China, apparently without further incident. This evidence does not compel the conclusion that she was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution if she returns to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Neither did Zhang establish that she is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA. Zhang is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if she can show that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular so<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>cial group, or political opinion. <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cThis standard is more stringent than the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum.... [B]eeause [Zhang] cannot meet the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum, it is <em>a fortiori </em>that [she] cannot meet the withholding of removal standard.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Zhang\u2019s alternative theory of relief under the CAT also fails. To obtain withholding of removal under the CAT, Zhang must establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d she will be tortured in the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Zhang did not establish that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she would be tortured if she is returned to China. Zhang\u2019s fear that she could be arrested is insufficient to establish that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
