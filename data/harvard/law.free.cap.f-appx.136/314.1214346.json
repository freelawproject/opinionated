On appeal, Nicholas argues the district court erred by (1) admitting statements he made to law enforcement following his arrest; (2) denying his motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence; and (3) increasing his sentence based on facts not charged in the indictment or found by the jury, in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Subsequent to the filing of the briefs in this case, the Supreme Court extended its holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>542 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">We review the district court\u2019s resolution of evidentiary issues for a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Mendez, </em>117 F.3d 480, 484 (11th Cir.1997). We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>resolving all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Rudisill, </em>187 F.3d 1260, 1267 (11th Cir. 1999). The evidence is sufficient where a reasonable trier of fact, choosing among reasonable interpretations of the evidence, could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Lluesma, </em>45 F.3d 408, 409-10 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">As for Nicholas\u2019s constitutional, <em>Blakelybased </em>sentencing claim, he timely raised it in the district court and his initial brief in this Court, and thus he is entitled to preserved error review. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948-49 (11th Cir.2005). We will reverse a <em>Booker </em>error only if the error was harmful, meaning that the error affected substantial rights. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 829 (11th Cir.2000) (reviewing preserved constitutional challenge to a sentence <em>de novo, </em>but stating we \u201cwill reverse or remand only for harmful error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">After thorough review of the record, as well as careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no error as to Nicholas\u2019s convictions. As for his sentence, although we find no constitutional error under <em>Blakely, </em>based on the intervening decision in <em>Booker, </em>and more specifically, <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding, we conclude we must vacate and remand for resentencing, pursuant to the discretionary Sentencing Guidelines scheme now required by <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">The relevant facts are straightforward. On January 19, 2004, Nicholas was arrested at the Orlando International Airport, after he met Milton Meade, a co-conspirator who had just arrived on a plane from San Juan, Puerto Rico, carrying a cooler filled with cocaine. Prior to trial, Nicholas moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude his statement to law enforcement, made shortly after his arrest at the Orlando airport, that the cooler seized from Meade \u201cmight\u201d contain drugs. Nicholas argued that the statement was barred both by Fed.R.Evid. 602 and 701, because he lacked personal knowledge of the contents of the cooler, and by Fed.R.Evid. 403, because it was unfairly prejudicial. The district court summarily denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>At trial, the government first presented the testimony of Olga Silva, a Senior Inspector with the U.S. Customs Service who was assigned to interview passengers arriving at the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on January 19, 2004. After she interviewed Meade, as he departed from a flight from Antigua to Puerto Rico, Silva xrayed a cooler Meade was carrying. Meade claimed it contained frozen fish. The x-ray machine revealed that the fish contained a white powdery substance, which subsequent field tests revealed to be cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Martin Reyes, a Special Agent with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service (\u201cICE\u201d), testified that, after meeting Meade in an interrogation room at the San Juan airport and informing him of his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights, Meade told Reyes that a man he knew as \u201cMello,\u201d who lived in Antigua, had purchased his plane ticket and provided him with the cooler containing the cocaine. Meade was supposed to deliver the cocaine to a man in Orlando, Florida named \u201cJunior,\u201d and was promised $2,000 to $4,000 for his services. Meade said that he had made similar deliveries from Mello to Junior on three prior occasions, receiving between $2,000 and $4,000 for his services. Meade described Junior as a black male, approximately 5'8\" tall, with an Afro, glasses, and long, slim sideburns. During the interview, Meade indicated to Special Agent Reyes that he would cooperate with the government. Special Agent Reyes than arranged for Meade to take a later flight to Orlando, Florida and make a controlled delivery of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Richard Mosquera, another ICE Special Agent, accompanied Meade on the later flight from San Juan to Orlando. Special Agent Mosquera testified that, while in San Juan, Meade made a number of \u201cconsensually monitored\u201d calls to Mello in Antigua, so authorities could \u201chear his supplier talking about the smuggling venture.\u201d In these calls, Meade indicated that he had been delayed by-a problem with his luggage, but was on a later flight. Meade\u2019s source indicated that \u201cJunior\u201d would meet Meade at the Orlando airport. Upon arrival in Orlando, Meade picked up his baggage, including the cooler, and met the defendant, Nicholas, in an area near the baggage claim. Special Agent Mosquera observed Nicolas talking on a cellular phone when the initial contact with Meade took place. At that point, Meade tried to hand Nicholas the cooler, but Nicholas refused to take it. Nicholas had \u201ca little bit of [a] conversation\u201d with Meade, at which point Meade and Nicholas were both arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Meade testified at trial as a government witness, describing how he had transported cocaine to the United States three times prior to his arrest for the instant offense. On each of these trips, Mello gave Meade a cooler to transport to Junior in Orlando. Also on each trip, Nicholas would give Meade between $50,000 and $60,000 to take back to Antigua. On the third trip, Nicholas paid Meade part of his $1,600 fee. Also during the third trip, Meade accompanied Nicholas to a Western Union to wire money to Mello in Antigua. Finally, Meade stated that Nicholas was talking to Mello on a cell phone when the two met, immediately prior to their arrest in Orlando.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Special Agent Jeff Harmon of the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), along with ICE Special Agent Saoud, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>terviewed Nicholas after his arrest on January 19, 2004. Harmon subsequently searched Nicholas\u2019s residence, pursuant to Nicholas\u2019s consent. Harmon discovered the following: (1) two canisters of black axle grease, which Harmon noted is sometimes used to mask the odor of cocaine; (2) a cooler that was \u201calmost an exact match\u201d with the cooler Meade had carried; (3) a receipt indicating that Nicholas had spent $1,600 at a store in Orlando, and receipts for three money orders totaling $1,043; (4) a receipt from a Foot Locker store for an $861 purchase and a receipt from a Fifth Gear clothing store for a $2,360 purchase; (5) a lease agreement indicating that Nicholas was the official tenant of the apartment and the rent was $445 per month; and (6) a pay stub bearing Nicholas\u2019s name and dated December 20, 2002, indicating his year-to-date gross earnings were $6,640.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">On cross-examination, Nicholas\u2019s attorney asked Harmon a series of questions about his post-arrest interview of Nicholas. Counsel first highlighted that Nicholas was cooperative with the agents and agreed to be interviewed. Counsel then asked: \u201cAnd he [Nicholas] consistently denied any knowledge of the drugs [in the cooler], correct?\u201d to which Harmon responded that, when he asked Nicholas, \u201cBesides fish, what\u2019s in the cooler?\u201d Nicholas said, \u201cIt might be drugs.\u201d Defense counsel did not object to this answer, but instead decided to ask Harmon to clarify what Nicholas might have meant by \u201cit might be drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">This line of questioning included again asking Harmon whether Nicholas said he <em>\u201cknew\u201d </em>(as opposed to \u201cguessed\u201d) what was in the cooler. Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination on this point culminated in the following question: \u201cAnd he [Nicholas] guessed that, \u2018Oh well, it might be drugs,\u2019 but he didn\u2019t know the type, correct?\u201d When Harmon responded to this question in the affirmative, defense counsel continued: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a very logical assumption or a very logical guess, if he had just been arrested by the D.E.A. at the airport, that \u2014 and they\u2019re asking you about a cooler, that there might be narcotics in that cooler?\u201d Harmon indicated that he did not know what Nicholas was thinking or what his logic was at the time of the interview to which defense counsel asked, \u201cWell, you\u2019re a D.E.A. agent, right?\u201d The cross-examination then proceeded on to other issues relating to Harmon\u2019s duties as a DEA agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">As for chemical testing of the cocaine seized from the cooler, Juan Bruna, a senior forensic chemist with the DEA, testified that the ICE sent him an evidence bag via Federal Express which contained \u201cfour rectangular bricks\u201d of a substance that appeared to be cocaine. He performed mass spectroscopy on the substance and the analysis indicated with \u201c100 percent certainty\u201d that the four bricks were cocaine. Bruna further stated that, excluding the packaging, the cocaine powder in the four bricks weighed a total of 3,992 grams. Over Nicholas\u2019s objection to the chain of custody, the government admitted the cocaine into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Finally, the government called Special Agent Saoud who testified that a typical personal-use amount of cocaine is three to four grams, and that the quantity of cocaine found on Meade was \u201ca distribution amount.\u201d During Saoud\u2019s interview of Nicholas, Nicholas consented to a search of his cellular phone. The results of this search indicated that Nicholas\u2019s phone had been used to call a number which Meade had also called that same day. Saoud said that the last person Nicholas called prior to his arrest was Mello, and that Nicholas had made 42 such calls to Mello\u2019s number in Antigua on the day he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>After the government rested, Nicholas moved for a judgment of acquittal on all three counts, arguing that because all of his activities occurred -within the United States, there was no evidence that he had conspired to import cocaine or had personally imported cocaine. He also asserted that the government had presented no evidence that he ever took physical possession of the cooler after he met Meade. After the district court denied the motion, Nicholas rested without presenting any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The jury subsequently found Nicholas guilty on all three counts. On the verdict form, for each of the three counts, the jury indicated that Nicholas was responsible for \u201c500 grams or more\u201d of cocaine. Nicholas then proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Nicholas was responsible for 4.6 kilograms of cocaine, which yielded a base offense level of 30. With this base offense level and a category I criminal history, Nicholas\u2019s Guidelines range was 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. Nicholas filed a written objection, making the general argument that <em>Blakely </em>rendered the Sentencing Guidelines unconstitutional, but not challenging any of the PSI\u2019s factual statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">At the sentencing hearing, Nicholas reiterated his objection to the constitutionality of the Guidelines. Acknowledging this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>381 F.3d 1070 (11th Cir.2004), <em>vacated and superseded on reh\u2019g, </em>400 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir.2005), the district court responded, \u201cthe Eleventh Circuit has instructed me to continue to apply the guidelines until the Supreme Court resolves the issue.\u201d The district court also said that \u201cDistrict Judges in the Eleventh Circuit [must] continue to abide by the guidelines.\u201d The district court then adopted the PSI calculations and found the Guidelines range to be 97-121 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Prior to the imposition of sentence, defense counsel made a \u201cstatement in mitigation,\u201d arguing for the imposition of a sentence below the Guidelines range on two grounds: (1) because \u201cNicholas has no criminal record whatsoever,\u201d and (2) \u201cdue to the harshness of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d After again noting that it lacked discretion to sentence Nicholas outside of the Guidelines range, the district court imposed three concurrent 98-month terms of imprisonment, followed by a 4-year term of supervised release. This <em>appeal </em>followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">First, Nicholas argues on appeal that the district court erred by admitting Special Agent Harmon\u2019s testimony that, during his post-arrest interview, Nicholas indicated the seized cooler \u201cmight\u201d contain drugs. Notably, Harmon made this statement in response to defense counsel\u2019s line of questioning during cross-examination. As we have outlined above, defense counsel asked a series of questions concerning the post-arrest interview of Nicholas. One of Nicholas\u2019s theories of defense was that he never took possession of the cooler and had no reason to know it contained cocaine. The line of questioning about the post-arrest interview was in support of this theory of defense. During the exchange, counsel specifically asked whether Nicholas \u201cconsistently denied any knowledge of the drugs [in the cooler].\u201d Harmon responded that, when he asked Nicholas, \u201cBesides fish, what\u2019s in the cooler?\u201d Nicholas said, \u201cIt might be drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">\u201cIt is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>that party.\u201d <em>Ford ex rel. Estate of Ford v. Garcia, </em>289 F.3d 1283, 1293-94 (11th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, 537 </em>U.S. 1147, 123 S.Ct. 868, 154 L.Ed.2d 849 (2003); <em>see also United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1289 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[E]ven plain error review is unavailable in cases where a criminal defendant \u2018invites\u2019 the constitutional error of which he complaints.\u201d (quoting <em>Ford, </em>289 F.3d at 1294)). Based on our review of the record, including the trial transcript, we conclude that the invited-error doctrine precludes Nicholas\u2019s argument. We note that this rule is particularly applicable here, where Nicholas filed a pre-trial motion <em>in limine </em>in which he sought to exclude the statement about the cooler, thus indicating to us that defense counsel either was or should have been aware of this statement and Agent Harmon\u2019s knowledge of the statement. On this record, defense counsel\u2019s question invited the very response that he previously sought to exclude. Accordingly, any purported error caused by Agent Harmon\u2019s response was invited, and is not subject to review upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">As for Nicholas\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we also find no error. Nicholas argues that Meade\u2019s testimony was the only evidence that tied him directly to the cocaine, and that the testimony was inconsistent, false, and self-serving. The jury has the exclusive power to determine the credibility of witnesses, and \u201cthe court of appeals may not revisit this question.\u201d <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999). Testimony is incredible as a matter of law only when it includes \u201cfacts that [the witness] physically could not have possibly observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, 775 </em>F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir.1985) (internal quotations omitted) (brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Here, the issue of whether Meade\u2019s testimony was consistent or credible was plainly a question for the jury, which, it would appear, accepted Meade\u2019s account as accurate. The jury was free to choose among reasonable interpretations of the testimony. <em>See United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1267-68, 1269-70 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201cMoreover, we are bound by the jury\u2019s credibility determinations, and by its rejection of the inferences raised by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1267-68. Simply put, we are satisfied that the government presented abundant evidence, including Meade\u2019s testimony, as well as a litany of circumstantial evidence corroborating Meade\u2019s testimony, to support Nicholas\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Finally, Nicholas argues his sentence violated <em>Blakely, </em>which the Supreme Court has now extended to the federal Sentencing Guidelines in <em>Booker. See </em>125 S.Ct. at 738. In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The Court subsequently applied the <em>Apprendi </em>rule in the context of Washington State\u2019s sentencing guideline scheme, clarifying that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2537 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Most recently, in <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court found \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue\u201d in <em>Blakely. See </em>125 S.Ct. at 749. The Court held that the mandatory nature of the Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at 749-52. As we recently observed, \u201c[t]his constitutional holding \u2018means that it is no longer possible to maintain the judicial factfinding that Congress thought would underpin the mandatory Guidelines system that it sought to create.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1275-76 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">In the instant case, we find no Sixth Amendment violation within the meaning of <em>Booker. </em>The district court did not impose a sentence higher than that which the indictment charged and the jury\u2019s verdict authorized. Both the indictment and the jury verdict indicated that each of the three counts involved \u201c500 grams or more\u201d of cocaine. Nicholas\u2019s offense level was calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5), which provides for an offense level of 30, rather than 26, when a controlled-substance offense involves, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[a]t least 3.5 KG but less than 5 KG of Cocaine (or the equivalent amount of other Schedule I or II Stimulants).\u201d At trial, the DEA forensic chemist, Bruna, testified that the cocaine in Meade\u2019s cooler weighed 3.992 kilograms.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Although the jury verdict stated the quantity of cocaine only as \u201c500 grams or more,\u201d the jury\u2019s finding of guilt could be based on only one quantity: 3.992 kilograms. This is so because the <em>only </em>evidence on amount presented to the jury, through Bruna\u2019s testimony, indicated the weight of the cocaine found in co-conspirator Meade\u2019s cooler, which was the 3.992-kilograms amount.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Cf. United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that in the context of an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge based on drug quantity, \u201c[w]e must affirm [the] sentence if the record does not contain evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to drug quantity\u201d). Nicholas was not held responsible for any additional cocaine. Moreover, he did not object to the PSI\u2019s factual statement on quantity, instead choosing to make only a general objection to the constitutionality of the Guidelines. Even during his \u201cstatement of mitigation,\u201d he urged the district court to impose a sentence below the Guidelines range based on only these two grounds: (1) his lack of a criminal history and (2) the harshness of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">On this record, where Nicholas was held responsible only for the quantity of cocaine presented to the jury during Bruna\u2019s testimony and he did not contest the PSI\u2019s statement of quantity at sentencing, there is no impermissible judicial fact finding in violation of the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Although there was no Sixth Amendment violation here, Nicholas was sentenced under the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. The district court followed the correct sentencing procedure when it sentenced Nicholas, but' \u201cthe Supreme Court has now excised the mandatory nature of the Guidelines in <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (reviewing <em>Booker </em>claim for plain error). In <em>Shelton, </em>we concluded that \u201cit was [non-constitutional] <em>Booker </em>error for the district court to sentence Shelton under a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31 (citing <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir. 2005) (\u201cthe [non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>] error is the mandatory nature of the guidelines once the guidelines range has been determined\u201d)). \u201cAs a result of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding, <em>Booker </em>error exists when the district court misapplies the Guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed to advisory.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Here, although we find no Sixth Amendment violation because the district court did not increase Nicholas\u2019s base offense level based on findings about drug quantity, we find <em>Booker </em>error based on the remedial holding of the case. After adopting the PSI and its recommended Guidelines range, the district court treated the resulting range as mandatory. Had the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory, it might have found that Nicholas was responsible for 3.9 kilograms of cocaine but nevertheless sentenced him below the Guidelines range for this quantity based upon other factors, such as the two grounds Nicholas argued during his \u201cstatement of mitigation.\u201d The district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, and on this record it is impossible to tell what sentence it would have imposed under an advisory reading of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Moreover, the government has not has not met its burden to show that the district court\u2019s non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error was harmless, under <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). <em>Cf. United States v.

Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948-49). A non-constitutional error is harmless unless it had a \u201csubstantial influence\u201d on the outcome or leaves one in \u201cgrave doubt\u201d as to whether it had such effect. <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 765, 66 S.Ct. at 1248. Under the <em>Kotteakos </em>standard, \u201cnon-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the verdict, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1315 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cIf one can say \u2018with fair assurance ... that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 the judgment is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id </em>(quoting <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 764, 66 S.Ct. at 1248); <em>see also United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1266 n. 20 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cErrors do affect a substantial right of a party if they have a \u2018substantial influence\u2019 on the outcome of a case or leave \u2018grave doubt\u2019 as to whether they affected the outcome of a case.\u201d (quoting <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 764-65, 66 S.Ct. at 1248)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The district court was operating under the assumption that the Guidelines were mandatory, and in this case we cannot tell what sentence it would have imposed, particularly since Nicholas argued two grounds, unrelated to the issue of drug quantity, as supporting a lower sentence: (1) his lack of a criminal history and (2) the harshness of the Guidelines. On this record, the government has not met its burden to show harmlessness, or no effect on substantial rights. <em>Cf. Davis, </em>407 F.3d at 1271 (\u201cWe simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Because in this case, the government cannot establish the <em>Booker </em>non-constitutional error was harmless, within the meaning of <em>Kotteakos, </em>we vacate Nicholas\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in light of the remedial holding of <em>Booker. </em>No reversible error occurred during the guilt phase of the proceedings, and we affirm Nicholas\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">AFFIRMED, IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED, IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 458-71, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1619-26, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\">. We easily dispense with Nicholas\u2019s other conviction-related argument, that the district court erred by admitting into evidence the cocaine and cooler, both of which were seized from Meade following his and Nicholas\u2019s arrests, and the cooler in which the co-conspirator transported the cocaine. Nicholas argues the government did not establish a proper chain of custody for admission of this evidence. We reject this claim without further discussion since gaps in the chain of custody go to the <em>weight </em>of the evidence, rather than its <em>admissibility. See United States v. Roberson, </em>897 F.2d 1092, 1096 (11th Cir.1990) (citing <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>758 F.2d 1517, 1521 (11th Cir.1985) (observing that \"the adequacy of the proof relating to the chain of custody is not a proper ground to challenge the admissibility of the evidence\u201d)). Even if Nicholas\u2019s argument fairly could be read to concern the weight of this evidence (as opposed to its admissibility), we remain unpersuaded. Under Fed.R.Evid. 901(a), \u201d[t]he requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 901(a). Here, the government\u2019s evidence was sufficient under Rule 901(a) and the jury was free to resolve the issue of chain of custody, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>and the various federal agencies\u2019 handling of the cocaine and cooler, against Nicholas. <em>See United States v. Chaplinski, </em>579 F.2d 373, 374-75 (5th Cir.1978) (\" 'The adequacy of the chain of custody was a factual question which the jury resolved against appellants).\u2019\" (quoting <em>United States v. Graham, 464 </em>F.2d 1073, 1076 (5th Cir.1972))); <em>cf. Bonner v.

The PSI, which the district court adopted, indicated that Nicholas was responsible for 4.6 kilograms of cocaine. The discrepancy as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>to quantity between Bruna\u2019s testimony and the PSI had no effect on the calculation of Nicholas\u2019s offense level since Bruna\u2019s amount (3.992 kilograms) and the probation officer's amount (4.6 kilograms) both put Nicholas in the same offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\">. This fact distinguishes the case from our recent decision in <em>United States v.
