Langston pled guilty to three counts of bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (2000). On October 6, 2004, the district court sentenced Langston, over his objection based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-21\">Langston has appealed, challenging his sentence under <em>Blakely, </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in which the Court applied the reasoning in <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines. Langston seeks remand of his case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-23\">We conclude that Langston is entitled to be resentenced under <em>Booker, </em>as the Government concedes. As Langston raises no other issues on appeal, we affirm his conviction and vacate the sentence imposed by the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On remand, the district court shall reconsider Langston\u2019s sentence in light of <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We dispense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-15\">. Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Langston's sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-16\">. Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767, 125 S.Ct. 738. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and then impose a sentence. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
