BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b271-26\">Noel Osvaldo Nieves-Bogado pled guilty to importation of one kilogram or more of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a) and 960(b)(1). During the Rule 11 colloquy, the district court explained: (1) the various rights that Nieves-Bogado would be relinquishing by pleading guilty; (2) that the district court at sentencing would decide the exact weight of the drugs and whether the weight was a little bit above or below one kilogram; and (3) that Nieves-Bogado was pleading guilty to \u201cright around one kilogram.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The PSI stated that the weight of the drugs was 1.095 kilograms and that it triggered a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. In response to the PSI, Nieves-Bogado objected to the calculation of the drugs, stating that \u201cthe government has ... no evidence of this exact weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">At sentencing, the government called as a witness the DEA agent who performed the laboratory tests on drug pellets that Nieves-Bogado passed at the hospital after his arrest at the Miami airport. The DEA agent testified in detail about how he calculated the drug weight using extrapolation. Extrapolation involves weighing randomly selected pellets, and projecting the total weight of the pellets at issue based on the weight of the samples. The district court made a fact-finding that, based on the DEA agent\u2019s testimony, the correct weight of the drugs was 1.095 kilograms.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Nieves-Bogado objected to the district court\u2019s fact-finding and to the district court\u2019s reliance on the DEA agent\u2019s testimony. However, Nieves-Bogado did not raise any constitutional claim to a jury trial on drug quantity, and Nieves-Bogado did not raise any constitutional issue pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">Because Nieves-Bogado met the criteria for the safety valve provision, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, he was eligible for a sentence in accordance with the applicable Guidelines without regard to the statutory minimum of ten years. After making sentencing reductions, the district court adopted the findings of fact in the PSI, determined that Nieves-Bogado\u2019s Guidelines range was 70-87 months\u2019 imprisonment, and sentenced Nieves-Bogado to 84 months\u2019 (seven years) imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">In his prior direct appeal, Nieves-Boga-do argued for the first time that, as to his sentence, he was entitled to have the drug quantity amount for sentencing purposes determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Applying plain-error review, this Court concluded in an unpublished opinion that because the circuits were split at the time, it was not obvious that <em>Blakely </em>required a jury determination of drug quantity for purposes of application of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Nieves-Bogado, </em>126 Fed.Appx. 463, at 8 (11th Cir. 2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">Nieves-Bogado filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>in the United States Supreme Court. On April 22, 2005, the Supreme Court vacated our December 16, 2004 judgment and remanded his case to this Court for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-16\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b272-17\">Because Nieves-Bogado did not raise any constitutional issues in the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>court based on <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>or <em>Booker, </em>our review is only for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>73 U.S.L.W. 3531 (Feb. 23, 2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In <em>Booker, </em>a majority of the Supreme Court concluded that the mandatory nature of the Guidelines made them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guaranty of the right to a jury trial where \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established'by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict [was not] admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. As explained in <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301, \u201c[t]he constitutional error is the use of extra-verdict enhancements to reach a guidelines result that is binding on the sentencing judge; the error is the mandatory nature of the guidelines once the guidelines range has been determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We first conclude that the DEA agent\u2019s testimony at sentencing constituted sufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s fact-finding as to drug quantity, and the district court correctly determined the proper Guidelines range for NievesBogado\u2019s conviction is 70-87 months\u2019 imprisonment. Nonetheless, Nieves-Boga-do\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated because his sentence was enhanced, under a mandatory Guidelines system, based on facts not found by a jury or admitted by Nieves-Bogado. The Sixth Amendment violation stemmed not from the district court\u2019s extra-verdict enhancement, but from the district court\u2019s use of that extra-verdict enhancement in sentencing Nieves-Bogado under a mandatory Guidelines scheme. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301. Because Nieves-Bogado has shown a Sixth Amendment violation, Nieves-Bogado has met the first two prongs of plain error review: error that is plain. <em>Id. </em>at 1298-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">However, Nieves-Bogado has failed to establish that any <em>Booker </em>error affected his substantial rights. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301. In this case, the sentencing record provides no basis for a conclusion that Nieves-Bogado has shown a reasonable probability of a more lenient sentence under an advisory Guidelines regime. In fact, the district court refused to sentence Nieves-Bogado at the low end of the Guidelines range of 70-87 months\u2019 imprisonment. Instead, the district court sentenced Nieves-Bogado to 84 months\u2019 imprisonment, which is in the middle of the Guidelines range. Thus, we conclude that Nieves-Bogado has not satisfied the third prong of plain-error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">Accordingly, we reinstate all of our December 16, 2004 opinion affirming NievesBogado\u2019s conviction. Further, we affirm Nieves-Bogado\u2019s sentence for the reasons stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">SENTENCE AFFIRMED; OPINION REINSTATED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\">. Nieves-Bogado also raised an issue with respect to his guilty plea, and this Court affirmed Nieves-Bogado\u2019s conviction. <em>United States v. Nieves-Bogado, </em>126 Fed.Appx. 463, at 17 (11th Cir.2004). Nieves-Bogado's conviction is not at issue on this remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\">.
