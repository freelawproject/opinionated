Given Anderson\u2019s criminal history category III in the underlying criminal conviction, and the fact that the conviction involved a Class C felony, the probation officer recommended a term of imprisonment under the sentencing guidelines of five to eleven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-24\">At sentencing, Anderson pleaded guilty and admitted the violations, although she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>denied using drugs on one of the occasions listed in the petition. After considering the guidelines range, the court imposed a sentence of thirty-six months imprisonment, stating that it found the range to be inadequate in this case. Anderson did not object to the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">On appeal, Anderson argues that the court abused its discretion because the thirty-six month sentence grossly exceeded the range provided for by the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Generally, we review departures in sentences imposed for probation revocation under Chapter 7 of the sentencing guidelines for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1299 n. 2 (11th Cir.2002). When a defendant fails to object to an error before the district court, however, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>314 F.3d 565, 566 (11th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). \u201cPlain error occurs where (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>314 F.3d at 566; <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Here, Anderson admitted that her probation violation included possession of a controlled substance, which required the court to impose a term of imprisonment upon revocation. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(b)(1), (3), (4); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, comment. (n.5). In determining the applicable sentence, the court is instructed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3581(b), which authorizes a sentence of not more than twelve years for a Class C felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3581(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, a court is required only to consider the sentencing guidelines policy statements in Chapter 7 in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence for probation violations, and the guidelines are not binding on the courts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B); U.S.S.G. ch. 7, pt. A(l), (3)(a); <em>Cook, </em>291 F.3d at 1301; <em>United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 361 (11th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Milano, </em>32 F.3d 1499, 1503 (11th Cir.1994), <em>superceded on other grounds by, Cook, </em>291 F.3d at 1300. The guidelines range is calculated based on the grade of the probation violation and the defendant\u2019s criminal history category at the time of the original sentencing hearing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4; <em>Milano, </em>32 F.3d at 1501. As the guidelines are merely advisory, however, the court may depart upward from that range, as long as the sentence is within the statutory maximum. <em>Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d at 362; <em>see also United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 749-50, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and holding that the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d is \u201cthe maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts ... admitted by the defendant\u201d). Additionally, the guidelines recognize that, where the original sentence included a downward departure, as Anderson\u2019s did, an upward departure from the sentencing range may be warranted. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">Here, upon revocation of probation, the court considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and determined that the sentence calculated under the guidelines was inadequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>and an appropriate sentence was thirty-six months imprisonment. As the court was authorized to sentence Anderson up to a maximum of twelve years imprisonment, Anderson cannot show plain error in the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-15\">. Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), the statute under which Anderson was convicted, the statutory maximum sentence was twenty-years imprisonment, making it a Class C felony. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3559(a)(3) and 3561(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\">. In revoking a term of probation, the court should consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), including: the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the seriousness of the offense, deterrence, and the need to provide the defendant with treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), 3583(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
