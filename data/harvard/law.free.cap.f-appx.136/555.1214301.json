We affirmed his conviction and sentence, and subsequently denied rehearing. <em>See United States v. Beckley, </em>94 Fed. Appx. 971, No. 03-4299 (4th Cir. Apr. 20, 2004) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-30\">Beckley filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. His petition was granted, and this court\u2019s judgment was vacated, in light of the decision in <em>United States v. Booker,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>In re Beckley,\u2014</em> U.S.\u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1045, 160 L.Ed.2d 1042 (2005). Beckley\u2019s case has been remanded to this court for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>He has moved for release on bail pending further proceedings on remand from the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-34\">Beckley\u2019s sentence was imposed prior to the decisions in <em>Booker </em>and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>predecessor, <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and he did not raise objections to his sentence based on the mandatory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines or the district court\u2019s application of sentencing enhancements based on facts not admitted by Beckley or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-60 (4th Cir.2005). Beckley\u2019s Guidelines range was calculated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">Base offense level<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">Intended loss of over $400,000 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> + 14</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">Use of sophisticated means <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> +2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">Adjusted offense level 22</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">Acceptance of responsibility <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> - 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">Total offense level: 19</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-13\">Criminal history category: III</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-14\">Guidelines range 37-46 months</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">The district court imposed a term of imprisonment of forty-four months. If not for the enhancement based on use of sophisticated means, a fact found by the district court (and disputed by Beckley at sentencing), his offense level would be reduced by two levels, resulting in a Guidelines range of 30-37 months. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(C). Moreover, if the district court had not enhanced Beckley\u2019s offense level for an amount of loss greater than the amount he has essentially admitted\u2014 $48,058 \u2014 his offense level would be reduced by another eight levels, for a Guidelines range of 8-14 months. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(D), (H). His forty-four month sentence thus meets the standard for plain error that must be recognized under the reasoning set forth in Hughes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we grant Beckley\u2019s motion to remand for resentencing in light of <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-24\">Finally, Beckley moves for bail pending further proceedings on remand from the Supreme Court. Motions for bail pending appeal are governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b) (2000). <em>See United States v. Steinhorn, </em>927 F.2d 195, 196 (4th Cir. 1991). Of particular relevance here, the court must consider whether the appeal presents a substantial question, and whether, if that question is decided in the defendant\u2019s favor, the defendant is likely to receive a sentence shorter than the sum of time served plus the expected duration of the appeal process. 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u00a7 3143(b)(1)(B); <em>see Steinhorn, </em>927 F.2d at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The Government concedes that a substantial question exists about whether Beckley is entitled to resentencing. Nevertheless, the Government argues that Beckley is not entitled to release pending appeal because he has not shown a likelihood that, on resentencing, he will receive a sentence shorter than \u201cthe total of the time already served plus the expected duration of the appeal process.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b)(l)(B)(iv). Beckley counters that his sentence was enhanced based on facts not charged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He contends that because he has already served three quarters of his forty-four month sentence, his appeal may result in a shorter sentence, and if he is not released, the Supreme Court\u2019s intent in vacating this court\u2019s judgment will be frustrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Beckley has demonstrated a substantial question regarding the propriety of his sentence in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes. </em>However, the possibility that Beckley will receive a sentence on remand that is less than the sum of the time remaining on his sentence and the duration of the appeal process is speculative at best. On remand, the district court will calculate a sentencing range in accordance with the Guidelines, although that range will be advisory rather than mandatory. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 767. Neither Beckley\u2019s base offense level nor his criminal history category will change. Beckley has not shown that it is as likely as not that the district court will elect to sentence him based on different facts than those applied in his first sentencing proceeding, or exercise its discretion in his favor on the same facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">On this record, release on bail pending further proceedings is not warranted. We deny as moot Beckley\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus seeking a ruling on the bail motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">In sum, we grant Beckley\u2019s motion to remand this case for resentencing in light of <em>Booker. </em>We deny Beckley\u2019s motions for release on bail pending further proceedings. We grant Beckley\u2019s motion to file a pro se formal brief, grant Beckley\u2019s motion to proceed pro se in the present appeal, and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from further representation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">\n<em>REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-16\">. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 2B 1.1 (a)(2) (2002 &amp; Supp.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b580-17\">.

Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\">.
