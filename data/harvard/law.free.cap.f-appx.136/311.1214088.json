Zheng admitted that she was removable, but sought asylum, withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. An Immigration Judge ruled that Zheng was removable and that she was not entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief. Zheng appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals. The BIA affirmed without opinion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). Zheng now petitions this Court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201cBecause the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s order without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision constitutes the final agency determination to be reviewed by this Court.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1285 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cTo the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, this Court\u2019s review is <em>de novo.\u201d D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and this Court must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817-18 (internal marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u201cWe have described the substantial evidence test as \u2018deferential,\u2019 and have emphasized we may not \u2018re-weigh the evidence\u2019 from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir. 2001). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (considering a withholding of removal claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Zheng challenges the IJ\u2019s allegedly heavy reliance on the State Department\u2019s County Reports. This issue is meritless. We have said that an IJ may heavily rely on the Country Report. <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Zheng also alleges that the IJ erred in finding her not credible, a determination that undermined her ability to gain relief. \u201cAs with other factual findings, \u2018[cjredibility determinations ... are reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u2019 That is, \u2018[t]he trier of fact must determine credibility, and this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the [IJ] with respect to credibility findings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286 (internal citations omitted; brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\u201c[A]n adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support a denial of an asylum application\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1287. \u201cOf course, an adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFurther, the IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Here, the IJ \u201cofferfed] specific, cogent reasons for [his] adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1287. Prior to and during her removal hearing, Zheng repeatedly claimed that she was single and feared punishment because she had lived with her boyfriend. During the removal hearing Zheng claimed for the first time that she and her boyfriend were married under the customs of her area because they lived together. When the IJ questioned the accurateness of Zheng\u2019s assertion, in light of his own familiarity with those traditions, Zheng said for the first time that she and her boyfriend had undergone a traditional marriage ceremony. Moreover, Zheng <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>was initially vague in answering questions about her wedding date and did not have any pictures of the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Also, Zheng gave one birth year (1982) when she first arrived in the United States and another (1984) in her application for asylum and at the removal hearing. The birth year Zheng claimed at the removal hearing made her underage for legal marriage in China while her initially-given birth date did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">These inconsistencies support the IJ\u2019s finding that Zheng was not credible. <em>Cf. Id. </em>at 1287-88 (concluding that the IJ\u2019s finding that Forgue was not credible was supported by substantial evidence because, prior to his hearing before the IJ, Forgue had failed to reveal numerous facts that would support his claims). Given the IJ\u2019s determination that Zheng lacked credibility, a finding that this record does not compel be reversed, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\">. If an applicant cannot establish that she is entitled to asylum, she generally cannot establish that she is entitled to withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n.4 (\"Because Forge has failed to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, he necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under CAT.\u201d) (citing <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 </em>F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001)) <em>Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1292-93 (\"Where an applicant is unable to meet the well-founded fear standard for asylum, he is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of deportation.\u201d) (internal citations and marks omitted). Here, there no argument is made that Zheng's case is outside the general rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
