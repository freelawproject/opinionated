The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>court sentenced him to 77 months in prison and three years of supervised release. For the first time on appeal, Villarreal contends that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by imposing a 16-level Sentencing Guidelines increase based on his aggravated-felony conviction, without submitting that factor for proof to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court held that, <em>\u201c\u2018[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). In <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d In <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, the Supreme Court extended the <em>Blakely </em>holding to the Guidelines, holding that \u201c[a]ny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (emphasis added). The Court excised 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) of the Sentencing Reform Act, rendering the guidelines effectively advisory rather than mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 764-65. Under <em>Booker, </em>district courts are still required to consider the guidelines, and <em>Booker </em>applies to this direct appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 757-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">A challenge under <em>Booker </em>that is raised for the first time on appeal, like Villarreal\u2019s, is reviewable only for plain error. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-9517 (Mar. 31, 2005). Villarreal has not established error, plain or otherwise, with respect to the Sentencing Guidelines in his case, because <em>\u201cBooker </em>explicitly excepts from Sixth Amendment analysis\u201d the fact of a prior conviction. <em>See United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b643-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
