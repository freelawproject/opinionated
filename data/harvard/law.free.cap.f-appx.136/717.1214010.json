As we do not have jurisdiction, we dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-27\">Kukoyi pleaded guilty in 1987 to sexually molesting his step-daughter. Adjudication was deferred and he was placed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>probation for ten years. The offense of which Kukoyi was convicted constitutes sexual abuse of a minor, see <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 604 (5th Cir.2000), which is an aggravated felony under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A); <em>United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 315-16 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we do not have jurisdiction to review his petition. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Nehme v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 415, 420 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">We decline to consider Kukoyi\u2019s assertion that he is not an alien. He admitted in the removal proceedings that he was neither a citizen nor national of the United States, and he contested his status for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 390 n. 13 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). We similarly do not consider the documents he provided as they were not part of the record, <em>see Goonsuwan, 252 </em>F.3d at 390 n. 15, and which, in any event, do not demonstrate that he is a United States national.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">We reject Kukoyi\u2019s argument that the current definition of aggravated felony does not apply to his .1987 conviction. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43); <em>Alfarache v. Cravener, </em>203 F.3d 381, 384 (5th Cir.2000). Further, his deferred adjudication constituted a conviction for purposes of IIRIRA. <em>See Moosa v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 994, 1005 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b741-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
