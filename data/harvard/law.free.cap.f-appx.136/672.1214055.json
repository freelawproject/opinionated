Jackson appeals his sentence as to all counts and his conviction on the \u00a7 924(c) count. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Jackson argues that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). As Jackson did not renew his Rule 29 motion for acquittal, our review is limited to determining whether there is a manifest miscarriage of justice, meaning that the \u201cthe record must be devoid of evidence of guilt or the evidence must be so tenuous that a conviction is shocking.\u201d <em>See United States v. Avants, </em>367 F.3d 433, 449 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Jackson\u2019s contention that the evidence did not show he was guilty of a drug trafficking crime is without merit. Jackson does not separately challenge his conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, which is the predicate offense for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction. <em>See United States v. Munoz-Fabela, </em>896 F.2d 908, 911 (5th Cir.1990). In addition, the evidence that Jackson was arrested in possession of more than 20 grams of crack cocaine coupled with testimony that such an amount is consistent with distribution was sufficient to support a finding of drug trafficking. <em>See United States v. Harrison, </em>55 F.3d 163, 165 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The evidence amply supported the jury\u2019s verdict that the weapon recovered from Jackson when he was arrested furthered the offense. The gun was found in Jackson\u2019s rear waistband, it was loaded, and it was readily accessible and near the drugs that Jackson was carrying. <em>See United States v. Ceballos-Torres, </em>218 F.3d 409, 413-15 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Jackson next argues that the district court erred in concluding that his two pri- or offenses for theft and robbery were not related for purposes of his criminal history score. Relatedly, he contends that the district court erred in relying on summaries of police reports set out in an addendum to the Presentence Report(PSR) and that, as those reports were not part of the record, there was no evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding. He also asserts that reliance on the reports was improper under <em>United States v. </em>Booker,U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>- U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">In making sentencing determinations under the Sentencing Guidelines, a district court may rely on information set forth in the PSR. <em>United States v. Montoya-Ortiz, </em>7 F.3d 1171, 1180 (5th Cir.1993). Jackson does not dispute the reliability or accuracy of the PSR\u2019s summary of the reports and, in fact, cited the summary and the reports in support of his arguments to the district court. His contention that there was no evidence to support the district court\u2019s findings is without merit. We also reject his claim that the district court\u2019s reliance on the reports violated <em>Booker </em>or <em>Shepard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-16\">The district court did not err in finding that the offenses were not related. First, the offenses did not occur on the same occasion. One was the theft of a vehicle from a dealership, while the second was an armed robbery of an individual, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>and the crimes occurred in different locations at different times. <em>Cf. United States v. Moreno-Arredondo, </em>255 F.3d 198, 207 (5th Cir.2001). Further, they were not part of a common scheme or plan as they were not planned at the same time, nor did the theft of the vehicle necessarily entail the subsequent robbery. <em>Cf. United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 520 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Finally, Jackson argues that, pursuant to <em>Booker, </em>the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by basing his sentence on facts that were neither found by a jury nor admitted by him. As Jackson did not make a Sixth Amendment challenge in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Jackson cannot show that any error affected his substantial rights under the third prong of the plain error test, because there is nothing in the record to indicate that the district court would have given Jackson a lower sentence under an advisory rather than a mandatory sentencing scheme. <em>See id. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b696-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
