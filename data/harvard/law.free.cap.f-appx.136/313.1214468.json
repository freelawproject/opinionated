His petition challenges the Bureau of Prisons\u2019s application of good-time credit on the ground that the Bureau <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>is ignoring the statutory command, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b), that a prisoner is eligible for 54 days of such credit, by awarding only 47 days of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Prisoners seeking habeas relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241 are subject to administrative exhaustion requirements. <em>Skinner v. Wiley, </em>355 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>541 U.S. 1036, 124 S.Ct. 2112, 158 L.Ed.2d 722 (2004). In the civil context, the inadequate nature of an administrative remedy does not preclude the application of a mandatory exhaustion requirement. <em>See Alexander v. Hawk, </em>159 F.3d 1321, 1325-28 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">We have described the Administrative Remedy Program (\u201cARP\u201d), 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">The [BOP] ... established regulations governing formal review of inmate complaints relating to any aspect of imprisonment. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 542.10 to .16 (1989). These regulations ... set out the procedures that prisoners must pursue prior to seeking relief in the district court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">If, and only if, the defendant has pursued his administrative remedy may he seek relief in the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\"><em>United States. v. Herrera, </em>931 F.2d 761, 764 (11th Cir.1991) (internal quotations and citations omitted). In <em>Herrera, </em>after noting that exhaustion of administrative remedies is jurisdictional and must be addressed, we held that, because the defendant had failed to pursue his administrative remedy, \u201c[t]he district court was without jurisdiction to entertain [the defendant\u2019s] application for credit time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with the Bureau of Prisons, as required by the ARP, prior to filing his petition in the district court. The court therefore lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition and should have dismissed it. We accordingly vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the petition without prejudice so that petitioner may exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
