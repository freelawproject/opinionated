Miller argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from his vehicle. Specifically, Miller contends that the anonymous tip leading to his arrest was unreliable and therefore failed to establish the requisite reasonable suspicion to justify the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-18\">Contrary to Miller\u2019s assertion, the information provided by the anonymous caller concerned Miller\u2019s involvement in an active drug transaction. Furthermore, the investigating officers took steps to test and verify the information provided by the caller. Under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d the information provided by the anonymous tipster, coupled with Miller\u2019s subsequent suspect behavior, established sufficient reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. <em>See Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 330-31, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>190 F.3d 668, 672 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Miller\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>6 F.3d 287, 289 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-19\">Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and by presumed extension, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005),<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> Miller asserts that his sentencing enhancements under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a) and for relevant drug-quantity conduct are unconstitutionally excessive. As Miller failed to raise this claim in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>peti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number><em>tion for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-9517 (U.S. Mar. 31, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">For purposes of Miller\u2019s 240-month sentence on the conspiracy count, <em>Booker </em>is not implicated. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.2005) (noting that <em>Booker </em>does not control analysis of the Guidelines as they treat a prior conviction). To the extent the Guidelines\u2019 offense grouping provisions and drug quantity calculation rendered Miller\u2019s enhanced 240-month sentence on the substantive drug offense unconstitutional, Miller\u2019s <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim fails at the third step of the plain error test because he has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-22\"><em> </em>Miller has not supplemented his original <em>Blakely </em>argument with a discussion of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>impact on his case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
