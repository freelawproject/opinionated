The action was for assault and battery. It was tried at the March circuit in Albany, and the plaintiff recovered a verdict for $500. When the verdict was rendered, the defendant obtained an order allowing him thirty days t\u00f3 make a case, &amp;c., and directing that all the proceedings on the part of the plaintiff be stayed in the mean time. \u2022 This order was made on the 24th of March. On the 5th of April following the plaintiff applied to one of the justices of this court, upon an affidavit showing these facts, for an order of arrest, alleging that the defendant was about removing beyond the jurisdiction of the court. The order was made, and the defendant was held to bail in the sum of $650. The defendant moved to-vacate the order, first, upon the ground that it was obtained in violation of the order staying the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings; and, second, because the affidavit upon which it was obtained was insufficient.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-9\">L.

Such an order has reference to the <em>ordinary </em>proceedings in the action only. The plaintiff, while' the stay of proceedings remained operative, could not perfect- his judgment, but he might institute proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ings to have the order itself vacated. So, too, while he might not proceed to obtain the relief for which the action is brought, he might proceed to obtain any temporary relief to which he may be entitled. The application for the order of arrest, therefore, was not a violation of the order staying the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Nor can the motion prevail upon the other ground. It appeared by the affidavit, upon which the order of arrest was granted, that the action was brouglit to recover damages for an injury to the person of the plaintiff. This was enough to give the judge jurisdiction. It then became a matter of discretion whether or not the order should be allowed. The manner in which that discretion has been exercised is not the subject of review upon a motion to vacate the order. The motion must, therefore, be denied with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
