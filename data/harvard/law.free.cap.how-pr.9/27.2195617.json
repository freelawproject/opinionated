On the trial it became necessary for the plaintiff to prove its corporate existence, under a statute of the state of Connecticut. The plaintiff claimed to be a corporation organized under a general statute of that state, entitled, \u201c Of Joint Stock Corporations,\u201d the 196th section of which is as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-11\">\u201c Any number of persons not less than three, who, by articles of agreement in writing, have associated, or shall associate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>according to the provisions of this chapter, under any name assumed by them, for the purpose of engaging in and carrying on any kind of manufacturing, mechanical, mining, or quarrying business, or any other lawful business, and who shall comply with all the provisions of this chapter, shall, with their successors and assigns, constitute a body politic and corporate, under the name assumed by them in their articles of association.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">Section 210 of the same statute requires certain things to be done before any corporation can be formed under it, such portion of which section as is necessary for the understanding of the points decided, is stated in the opinion of the justice, which follows. The other facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-6\">S.

Lounsbury, clerk of the town of Waterbury, New-Haven County, in the state of Connecticut, showing, among other things, that on the 18th day of August, 1847, the president and directors of the Waterville Manufacturing Company deposited in the town clerk\u2019s office in said town a certificate of their organization, giving a full copy thereof, which in point of form appears to be in conformity with the act before mentioned; that the same was. duly recorded, and that the copy of the certificate given is a true copy from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">To this certificate of the town clerk was appended \u00e1 certificate of the secretary of state of the state of Connecticut, in words and figures following, viz.:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u201c State of Connecticut, office of Secretary of State:</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u201c I hereby certify that Wales B. Lounsbury was, at the time of subscribing the foregoing attestation, and now is, the Town Clerk of the town of Waterbury, in New-Haven County, in said state, duly elected and sworn to a faithful discharge of his said office and trust, and that full faith and credit may and ought to be given to his official acts and attestations; and I further certify, that I believe the foregoing signature of,the said Wales B. Lounsbury to be genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">\u201c In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and affixed the seal of the said state, at Hartford, this 27th day of October, A.

That the certificate of the town clerk of Waterbury was defective, inasmuch as the attestation thereof was not under his seal of office, and did not show that he had no seal of office; and, 2d. That the certificate of the secretary of state did not show that the certificate of the town clerk was in due form.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">The act of congress requires that the attestation of the keeper of the records and books shall be under his seal of office, <em>\u201cif there be a seal.\u201d </em>If there be no seal, then, of course, the attestation may be good without one. I think we ought not to presume the town clerk kept a seal of office, when we know that in analogous cases in our own state there is no seal of office. On the contrary, if any presumption is to be indulged in, it should be that there was no official seal of the clerk, for the reason that, if there was, it would have been affixed to his attestation. If the attestation had been by the clerk of a court in order to prove judicial proceedings, the presumption, perhaps, would be, that there was a seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">But the certificate of the secretary of state is defective in not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>stating that the clerk\u2019s certificate is <em>in due farm, </em>and by the proper officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">It is contended in answer to this objection, that it was not specified upon the trial. The objection was, that the certificate of the secretary of state was not sufficient, &amp;c., <em>because </em>the act of congress did not apply to <em>such a case, </em>and that the same was not properly authenticated, &amp;c. I incline to think the bill of exceptions does not allude to the point now insisted upon. The objection related to two things : first, that the act of congress did not apply to such a case; and, second, that the secretary\u2019s certificate was not properly authenticated : no complaint was made of its form, or that it did not contain facts sufficient. The objection in this respect was, that it was not properly <em>authenticated. </em>To authenticate is to render authentic. Among other definitions of the adjective authentic, is the following: \u201c Having a genuine original authority, in opposition to that which is false, fictitious, or counterfeit; being what it purports to be; genuine; true; applied to things, as, an authentic paper or register.\u201d (Webster.) Now, the certificate of the secretary of state conforms to this definition. It proved itself; enough appeared to give it genuine original authority; it was what it purported to be. It was genuine and true, as far as it went, and was good for all it contained. If it did not prove enough, the particular defect should have been pointed out, in order that the plaintiff might have given other proof to supply the defect. I suppose it would have been competent for the plaintiff to have introduced the clerk of the town of Waterbury, and proved by him all that was necessary in relation to depositing in his office the certificate of the president, directors, and company, as required by the statute of Connecticut; and we have no authority for saying it was not in the plaintiff\u2019s power to do so, if the objection in question had been pointed out. The act of congress, providing for this kind of evidence, is cumulative, and not intended to supersede the common law rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Upon the questions relating to the merits, I have only to say, that I think the evidence, taken together, was sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>entitle the plaintiff to recover. The defendant Brown cannot object that the instrument of October 26th, 1848, was not a joint proposition by both the defendants, and the subsequent transactions between the parties show that both Brown and Bryan regarded it in that light.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">New trial denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
