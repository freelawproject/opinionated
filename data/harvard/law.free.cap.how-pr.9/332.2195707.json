After the commencement of the circuit and before the cause was reached upon the calendar it was referred by consent of the attorneys for the parties. The plaintiff having obtained a report in his favor, claimed, upon the taxation of his costs, to be allowed a fee of $10 for the June circuit. This item was objected to, and disallowed by the clerk. The plaintiff moved for a retaxation.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AeY\">Martin I. Townsend, <em>for Plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-8\">T. C. Sears, <em>for Defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b341-9\">Harris, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Akbr\">I think the fee in question should have been allowed to the plaintiff. The cause was \u201c <em>necessarily </em>\u201d on \u2022the calendar, for by the term \u201c necessarily,\u201d I suppose nothing more is intended than that the cause should be <em>regularly </em>or <em>properly </em>upon the calendar. In other words, the cause is <em>necessarily </em>on the calendar, when, being at issue and in readiness for trial, the party who has noticed it for trial has put it on the calendar for the purpose of trying it, if he has an opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">The cause was also <em>postponed. </em>It is true that the order which had the effect to postpone the trial was entered by the consent of the parlies, yet it is not the less true that the cause was <em>postponed. </em>I concur in the decisions which hold that where a cause, being on the calendar, is postponed upon the application of one party, against the will of the other, the party obtaining the postponement shall not afterward be allowed a fee for attending that circuit. It would be obviously unjust to allow a party who had been successful in the action to charge the unsuccessful party his costs for attending a circuit, after having himself prevented the cause from being tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>at such circuit. There is nothing in the provision of the Code upon this subject which requires such a construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">It was upon this distinction that the decision in Perry agt. Livingston (6 <em>How. </em>404) was founded. The cause was upon the calendar for trial. It was referred, upon motion of the defendants, and against the objection of the plaintiff. The defendants having succeeded upon the trial, sought to charge the plaintiff with the costs of the circuit at which the cause had been thus postponed at the instance of the defendants, and against the plaintiff\u2019s will. It was properly held, that this could not be done. Hinman agt. Bergen (3 <em>Code R. </em>225) is to the same effect. On the other hand, in Burton agt. Shelden, (1 <em>Code R. </em>134,) where, as in this case, the cause being on the calendar, was referred by stipulation, it was held, that the successful party was entitled to tax a fee of $10 for the circuit at which the cause was thus postponed. An order must be entered directing the clerk to amend the entry of costs in the judgment by adding the item thus improperly rejected.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
