The defendants\u2019 attorney served notice of retainer for Trempert and Mrs. Urban, and demanded copy complaint, Nov. 1, 1850. And on the 9th Nov., defendants\u2019 attorney served another notice of retainer and demand of copy complaint for all the defendants, which plaintiff\u2019s attorney neglected to serve. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>21st Nov. defendants\u2019 attorney served notice of motion to dismiss the complaint, for the reason that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not serve his complaint as demanded. The moving papers showed that only twelve days had elapsed between the date of the last demand of copy complaint, and service of notice of the motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-5\">J.

And after the defendants\u2019 counsel had left court, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel called the attention of the court to the fact that there was not <em>twenty </em>days between the last demand of complaint and service of notice of motion; the judge thereupon directed the clerk not to enter the rule, and to give notice to defendants\u2019 counsel to come into court again, and on his appearing, the judge remarked, that there had been a mistake made in granting the motion, for the reason that twenty days had not intervened between the date of demand of complaint and service of notice of motion. Defendants\u2019 counsel remarked that such was not the fact, although the moving papers did not show it, and he thereupon produced the admission of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, of service of notice of retainer, dated Nov. 1, 1850, which showed that twenty days had elapsed. And also cited 4 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>306, Littlefield agt. Murin, in which it was required that the complaint should be served within a <em>reasonable </em>time, and that twenty-four hours would ordinarily be sufficient. The judge then said, that although the moving papers did not show that twenty days had elapsed, yet that the admission of service of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, dated Nov. 1, 1850, did show that the defendants\u2019 attorney was entitled to move at any rate, and he would not therefore disturb the decision first made. And remarked, that after the twenty-four hour rule had appeared, he dissented from the decision, and then held a correspondence with Justice Allen upon the subject; and it was agreed that thereafter, in all cases, they should hold that twenty days must be the time allowed to plaintiffs to serve complaint after demand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
