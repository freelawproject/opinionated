The children were all of full age at the death of their father that the marriages of the daughters were prior to 1847 : that Bisnop and his, wife had issue living: that Alexander and his wife never had any issue: that John B. Vail recovered judgment in this court against said Alexander, which was docketed on the 17th November, 1848, for the sum of $549,37; and that said Vail recovered judgment in the superior court against said Bishop, which was docketed on the 16th April, 1849, for the sum of $380,79\u2014both of which judgments were a lien upon the said surplus moneys: that the judgment against Alexander was rendered for a .debt contracted in the month of January, 1848, and that the judgment against Bishop was rendered for a debt contracted prior to the month of November, 1847: that the last-mentioned judgment was to the extent of $200 collateral to the first-mentioned judgment: that said John B.

Both sets of engagements were contracts, both were then subsisting, and both had been entered into upon the faith of previous laws. As to both, therefore, it was. beyond the constitutional power of the legislature, had it been so intended, \u201c to impair their obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">What then, for that is the point to be solved, were the previous rights of creditors of. husbands against the real estate of their wives <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">In Namceizaitz agt. Gahn (3 <em>Paige, </em>614) it was held that the wife\u2019s equity, as it is termed, was paramount to the .claims of the judgment creditor. And in Udell agt. Kenney, (3 <em>Cow. </em>590; 5 <em>Johns. Ch. R. </em>464,) the court held, also, that it could not be disposed of by the husband without making a suitable provision for her support, to be determined by.a reference, ad-cording to the circumstances of each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Besides, during the wife\u2019s life, the husband\u2019s title:\u2014and his creditor\u2019s title can be no better\u2014was not absolute. . It might be suspended at, any moment, and even destroyed, by his misconduct. (4 <em>John. Ch. R. </em>318; 4 <em>Haywood, </em>19, 24; 2 <em>M\u2019 Cord, </em>368; 5 <em>Monroe, </em>340; 1 <em>Paige, </em>620.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">On a foreclosure, the surplus moneys brought into court are subject to its jurisdiction as a court of equity, which, in such cases, never allows the fund to be taken out without a suitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>provision for the wife and her children. And as the sums in this case are small and not more than sufficient, the whole, independently of the act of 1848, must be adjudged to the wives.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">I might here add, however, that if there were any doubts of the rights of the married women in this case, antecedently to the act of 1848, that act would remove them. Its validity in respect of after-acquired property can not be denied. The competency of the legislature to enact that property, thereafter devised or descended to married women, should be their own, exclusive of their husbands, stands upon precisely the same footing as their power, even against the presumptive rights of heirs apparent already born, to alter the law of descents and testaments. The law of primogeniture at one time prevailed even in this republican country. At the time of its repeal and of the substitution of the present rule, did any one contend that it was necessary to save the rights, or rather I should say the pretensions, of then existing eldest sons'? And are the mere expectations of creditors, as to property which may thereafter by possibility descend to their debtors\u2019 wives, of any\" more sacred character <em>1 </em>When the constitution of the United States declared that no state should thereafter pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts, its object was to secure, not such airy possibilities, but substantial, well-defined rights, resting on specific contract, on legal obligation. Now, property which, when the act of 1848 went into operation, the wife did not then own, was clearly not subject to her husband\u2019s then debts. And yet all her property, \u201c except only so far as .the same .might be <em>so </em>liable,\u201d was, by the second section, declared for the future to be her sole and separate estate. The property in the present case at that time was not hers, but her father\u2019s. It was liable, not for her <em>husband's, </em>but for her <em>father's, </em>debts. It did not become hers, nor had she any right in law, either contingent or vested, till her father\u2019s death, which did not happen till 1849. <em>Nemo est hares </em>viventis\u2014ali.ving man has no heirs\u2014is a maxim which, in the sense just indicated, is as old as the law. Her father had a right to give his property to whom he pleased, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the legislature had a right, in the event of his not doing so, to say that it should pass absolutely and unencumbered to his married daughters, free from any control or disposal of their husbands. No wrong, in either case, was done to the husbands or the husbands\u2019 creditors. They might be disappointed, no uncommon occurrence in this life, but a mere disappointment is not a breach of either law or constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Decree accordingly, against the judgment creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Note.\u2014The foregoing decision was affirmed at the general term held in June, 1854. The decision in the case of Rusher and wife agt. Morris and wife, <em>ante, </em>p. 266, was also affirmed at the same time.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
