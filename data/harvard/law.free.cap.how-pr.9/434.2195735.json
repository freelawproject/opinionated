Peter Swarts &amp; Daniel Swarts, Administrators, &amp;c.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b442-8\">An <em>offer </em>to refer an account presented to administrators for payment (2 JR. <em>8. </em>88, \u00a7 <em>36) need not </em>be in writing; it is good by parol.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b442-10\">Where in an action against administrators, the plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars differs from the account previously presented to them for payment, in the charge of <em>interest </em>only, it is a variance which can not be regarded, because, interest is no part of the account, -it is a mere incident or legal result.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b442-11\"><em>At </em>Chambers, <em>Penn </em>Yan,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AGA\">April, 1854.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIY\">This action was brought to recover the balance of an account claimed by the plaintiff to be due to him from the defendants\u2019 intestate in his lifetime, amounting to $20.75. The account consisted of over twenty items bearing dates ranging from June 27, 1831, to November 21,1845, inclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-12\">At the proper time, the plaintiff presented the account for payment to the administrators, accompanied by the affidavit required by the statute, (2 R. 8.. 88, \u00a7 35,) and payment was refused on the ground there was nothing due. The plaintiff then offered to refer the matter, pursuant to section 36 of the same statute, but the defendants refused to refer; whereupon the plaintiff brought this action. The offer to refer was not in writing, but was merely verbal. In the account presented before the action was brought, the last item was under date of November 21st, 1845, and amounted to 13 cents. Then followed a charge of \u201c interest on $15.50 of the above amount for five years,\u201d carried out at $5.25. After the action was brought, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the defendants demanded a bill of particulars, which was rendered, and was in all respects like the one presented before the action was commenced, except that the said item of interest was put down at <em>$8.50 </em>instead of $5.25. The action was defended, and the plaintiff recovered judgment for the item of 13 cents before mentioned, and no more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel now moves for costs to be included in the judgment against the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-6\">J. S. Seely, <em>for the plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-7\">J. Taylor, <em>for the defendants, </em>contended that the plaintiff was not entitled to costs, for the reasons:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-8\">1. That the offer to refer was by parol. It should have been in writing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-9\">2. The bill of particulars of the demand sought to be recovered is not the same demanded before action brought. It is larger\u2014and cited 1 <em>Denio, </em>674, and 6 <em>Hill, </em>386.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b443-10\">Welles, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ALDO\">The plaintiff is entitled to recover judgment for costs against the defendants, to be collected from the estate of the intestate. (2 <em>R. S. </em>90, \u00a7 41; Bullock agt. Bogardus, 1 <em>Denio, </em>276, <em>and note a, at the end of the case; </em>Hartshorn agt. King, <em>id. </em>674; <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 304, <em>subd. </em>3, <em>and </em>\u00a7 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">As to the objections of the defendants\u2019 counsel: 1. The law does not require the offer to refer to be in writing. The practice has been.both ways, and I have never before heard it objected that an offer by parol was not good. 2. The account presented to the administrators was substantially like the one contained in the bill of particulars. The only variance is in the charge for interest, which can not be regarded, in respect of the present question, as a part of the account. \u2022 In the account presented, the charge for interest is put down at $5.25, and in the bill of particulars, interest on .the same account is charged at $8.50. If the plaintiff was entitled to interest at all, it was a mere incident or legal result. The case is plainly distinguishable in this respect from those cited by defendants\u2019 counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
