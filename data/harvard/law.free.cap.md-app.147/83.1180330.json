It is important to note, however, that the General Assembly has, by statute, singled out certain misdemeanors for which a police officer may, if certain conditions are met, make a warrantless arrest, even through the misdemeanor (1) has not been committed in the officer\u2019s presence or view and (2) where the officer does not have probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor has been committed in his presence or view. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-203 \u2014 2-205.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The reasonable promptness rule does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>apply to misdemeanor arrests, which come within the ambit of sections 2-203 to 2-205, nor does it apply to felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In the case at hand, the misdemeanor (trespass) allegedly committed in the presence of the arresting officer was trespass \u2014 a crime which comes under the general rule. Because appellant was not arrested with reasonable promptness after the officer observed the trespass (or supposed trespass) being committed in his presence, we shall hold that appellant\u2019s arrest was illegal. As a consequence, items seized incident to appellant\u2019s arrest must be suppressed under the \u201cfruits of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. <em>See Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">I. <em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Appellant was arrested without a warrant on November 6, 2000. A search incident to his arrest was conducted by Takoma Park Police Officer Frank Webb. The search revealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>that appellant was carrying over $1,000 in cash, together with a \u201crock-like\u201d substance that later testing proved to be cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Appellant was indicted for possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. His counsel filed a timely motion to suppress the evidence seized incident to his arrest. The motion was denied after a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Appellant waived a jury trial, pled not guilty, and proceeded to trial on an agreed statement of facts. Appellant was found guilty and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment, with all but seven months suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Two questions are raised on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">1. Where appellant was arrested without a warrant for the misdemeanor of trespass, which had been committed in the officer\u2019s presence thirteen days earlier, did the timing of the arrest, standing alone, demonstrate its illegality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">2. If the answer to Question No. 1 is in the negative, did probable cause exist for the arrest of appellant for trespass?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">II. <em>THE MAY 18, 2001, SUPPRESSION HEARING </em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aex\">A. <em>Testimony of Officer Frank Webb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">Located in Takoma Park, Montgomery County, Maryland, 125 Lee Avenue is one of approximately seven \u201clow income apartment buildings,\u201d which are three or four stories high. Posted in the lobby of 125 Lee Avenue, at all times here pertinent, was a conspicuous blue and white sign, reading \u201cno trespassing or loitering.\u201d The sign also notified readers that the police were authorized to act as agents of the owner. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>apartment building located at 125 Lee Avenue address is owned by one Antonio Samos.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">On the night of October 24, 2000, Officer Webb, along with two other Takoma Park police officers, received a call from a police dispatcher notifying them that \u201csubjects were smoking and selling CDS\u201d on the parking lot of 125 Lee Avenue. All three officers immediately responded to the Lee Street address. The officers, who were in uniform, parked their vehicles a short distance from the apartment building and proceeded to walk toward the building. As Officer Webb crossed the parking lot, he saw appellant near the rear of 125 Lee Avenue. The officer, who had known appellant for about a year, recognized him immediately. When appellant saw Officer Webb, he put \u201can unknown object\u201d in his mouth and ran into the rear entrance of 125 Lee Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">As soon as appellant fled, Officer Webb chased after him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Officer Webb got inside the apartment building, he did not see appellant. Therefore, he and the other officers knocked on several doors and made inquiry about him, but their efforts to locate appellant were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Officer Webb had previously stopped appellant for an \u201copen-bottle\u201d violation. As a result of that stop, which did not lead to an arrest, he knew that (1) appellant \u201clived somewhere in the New Hampshire Avenue area\u201d of Takoma Park, (2) appellant\u2019s full name was Angelo Louis Torres, and (3) appellant \u201chad been barred by other [Takoma Park] officers ... from several locations on Lee Avenue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">On direct examination, the prosecutor, Officer Webb, and the motions judge had the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">Q. [THE PROSECUTOR:] [Y]ou indicated that you chased Mr. Torres. What were you chasing him for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">A. To further investigate why he was, first of all, trespassing, find out what he put in his mouth, you know, what his\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>THE COURT: Let me just clarify some-thing, had you banned him from this area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">THE WITNESS: That \u2014 he has been banned by other officers. I don\u2019t have anything in writing, but he has been banned from several locations on Lee Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">BY [THE PROSECUTOR]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">Q. Were ... you aware that he had been banned by several other officers at the time that you chased him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Later in Officer Webb\u2019s testimony, he admitted that when he chased after appellant he did not know whether appellant had ever been barred from 125 Lee Avenue. Therefore, if he had caught appellant, he \u201cwas going to conduct an investigative detention to ascertain whether or not he was barred from\u201d 125 Lee Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Following the unsuccessful chase, Officer Webb did not seek an arrest warrant, nor did he document in any way his encounter with appellant. Moreover, he made no further inquiry of Mr. Samos (the owner of the premises) or anyone else to determine whether appellant had, in fact, been barred from entering onto the 125 Lee Avenue premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">On November 6, 2000, which was thirteen days after he had seen appellant at the 125 Lee Avenue address, Officer Webb, while on routine patrol, saw the appellant walking down University Boulevard in the company of a female. The officer did a U-turn and then saw appellant go into a nail salon. The officer followed appellant into the salon and placed him under arrest for trespassing at 125 Lee Avenue on October 24, 2000. That arrest led to the discovery of the money and cocaine, which appellant sought to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">B. <em>Testimony of Meryl Wise</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">Meryl Wise, at the time of the suppression hearing, had resided at 125 Lee Avenue for approximately five years. He knew appellant well because the latter had formerly dated one of his daughters. According to Mr. Wise, appellant was in the habit of visiting him in his apartment \u201cjust about every day.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>On October 24, 2000, appellant entered his apartment in a normal manner \u2014 then walked to one of the rear rooms in the apartment and began talking to one of his children. Shortly after appellant entered the apartment, a police officer knocked at the door. Mr. Wise answered, and the officer inquired if \u201csomebody [had run] into the building!\u201d Mr. Wise replied, \u201cNobody ran in h\u00e9re.\u201d The officers gave the areas immediately inside the doorway of the apartment a cursory look and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">C. <em>The Decision of the Motions Judge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In her opinion, the motions judge said, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">At the time \u2014 on October 24, [Officer Webb] did not actually know that the defendant was barred, but he had certain information about people smoking and selling CDS, and we have the fact that the defendant ran.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">I disagree with you about the fact that presence means that it actually has to be on that day. Only Officer Webb is an eyewitness to this. So he is the only one who saw a misdemeanor maybe being committed \u2014 probable cause to believe it had been committed in his mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">No other officer could have arrested [defendant on] November 6 without a warrant, but since it was Officer Webb, it was he who believed he saw a misdemeanor being committed in his presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-10\">So therefore on November 6, when he did actually see the defendant, I believe that he was authorized to arrest him for trespassing. Now, if it had been another officer, I would agree with the defense that a warrant was necessary but not under these facts or situation, and the fact that maybe he wasn\u2019t trespassing, that is neither here nor there because we are just dealing with the very low standard of probable cause, is it more like[ly] than not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-11\">I will say if Mr. Wise had just said that the defendant was in the apartment, maybe it could have all been cleared up because he had permission to be there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Preliminarily, we shall assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Officer Webb, on October 24, 2000, had probable cause to arrest appellant for trespassing at 125 Lee Avenue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With that assumption, the question becomes whether Officer Webb, if he chose to make a warrantless arrest, was required to make the arrest promptly after he had probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor had been committed in his presence. Aside from Maryland authority, discussed <em>infra, </em>the overwhelming weight of authority supports the proposition that a warrant-less misdemeanor arrest \u201cmust be made promptly, that is, at the time of the offense or as soon thereafter as circumstances permit....\u201d Wayne R. LaFave, Jerold H. Israel &amp; Nancy J. King, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 3.5(a), at 155 (2d ed.1999); <em>see also One 1992 Toyota 4-Runner v.

Hampton, </em>164 Cal.App.3d 27, 209 CaLRptr. 905, 907 (1985) (a warrantless arrest for misdemeanors \u201cmust be made at the time of offense or within a reasonable time thereafter.\u201d); <em>State v. Wozniak, </em>94 Idaho 312, 486 P.2d 1025, 1029 (1971) (\u201cAn arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor made within a prompt and reasonable time after the offense is valid.\u201d); <em>Carson v.

Torc\u00eda, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 70 (13th ed. 1989) (If the arresting officer \u201cdoes not act with reasonable promptness, and if the delay was unnecessary, the arrest without a warrant will be unlawful.\u201d); 5 Am.Jur.2d <em>Arrest </em>\u00a7 55 (2001) (\u201cThe arrest [for a misdemeanor] must be made at the time the offense, or some part of it, is being committed, or within a prompt and reasonable time after its commission, or upon fresh and immediate pursuit of the offender.\u201d); H.D. Warren, Annotation: <em>Peace Officer\u2019s Delay in Making Arrest Without a Warrant for Misdemeanor or Breach of Peace, </em>58 A.L.R.2d 1056, 1063 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>(1958) (\u201cIt is a general rule that once an officer has the right to arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor or breach of the peace committed in his presence he must do so as soon as he reasonably can, and if he delays for purposes disassociated with the arrest or for such a length of time as to necessarily indicate the interposition of other purposes, he cannot arrest without a warrant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In the case of <em>Childress v. State, </em>227 Md. 41, 43, 175 A.2d 18 (1961), the Court of Appeals, citing <em>inter alia, </em>the annotation last mentioned <em>(i.e., </em>58 A.L.R.2d 1056), recognized the rule that ordinarily a police officer may make an arrest, without a warrant, for misdemeanors committed in his presence only if the arrest is made within a reasonable time after the commission of the misdemeanor (or supposed misdemeanor). In <em>Childress, </em>the appellant, Roy A. Childress, undertook to direct traffic near a busy intersection during rush hour in Baltimore City. 227 Md. at 42-43, 175 A.2d 18. A Baltimore City police officer, who was directing traffic nearby, saw what appellant was doing and was not amused. He walked over \u201cto within five feet of [Childress] and told him he was under arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43, 175 A.2d 18. Childress walked away and entered a nearby house, where he boarded. <em>Id. </em>The officer followed Childress into the hallway of the rooming house, \u201claid a hand on his shoulder and told him he was under arrest.\u201d Childress responded by hitting the officer in the nose and knocking him down. <em>Id. </em>When two other officers were called to the scene, they, too, were attacked by Childress.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">On appeal, Childress contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that his arrest was illegal, and therefore, he was justified in resisting arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 175 A.2d 18. In holding that the arrest was legal, the <em>Childress </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">The arrest occurred when the first officer laid his hand on the appellant\u2019s shoulder and told him he was under arrest. <em>Cornish v. State, </em>215 Md. 64, 137 A.2d 170; <em>Price v. State, </em>227 Md. 28, 175 A.2d 11. The arrest was for a misdemeanor committed in the presence of a police officer, and was proper on that score. See cases cited on that point in the <em>Price </em>case and Kauffman, <em>The Law of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>Arrest in Maryland, </em>5 Md. L.Rev. 125, rule 6, p. 160. <em>The arrest was made almost at once and was therefore made in due time. </em>See 1 Bishop, <em>New Criminal Procedure </em>(Underhill, 2 ed., 1913), \u00a7 183(6); 4 Wharton, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>(Anderson ed., 1957); \u00a7 1615; 4 Am.Jur., <em>Arrest, \u00a7 67; Annotation, 58 A.L.R.2d 1056; </em>A.L.I. <em>Code of Criminal Procedure, </em>\u00a7 21(a) and comment thereon (at p. 234). Cf. <em>Gattus v. State, </em>204 Md. 589, 699-601, 105 A.2d 661, where this rule was recognized but found inapplicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 43, 175 A.2d 18 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">At oral argument in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the State contend-. ed that Officer Webb, on October 24, 2000, had an \u201carticulable suspicion\u201d that appellant was guilty of trespass and therefore had authority to make a <em>Terry </em>stop. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (Police may stop and briefly detain a person for purposes of investigation if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articula-ble facts that criminal activity may be afoot.). Whether Officer Webb could have made a <em>Terry </em>stop on October 24, 2000, is beside the point. As far as is shown by the record, Officer Webb never shouted for appellant to stop or otherwise tried to alert him to the fact that he wished to \u201cbriefly detain\u201d him for purposes of investigation. In any event, he never made such a stop. And, at the time he actually detained appellant, Officer Webb had no reason to believe \u201cthat criminal activity was afoot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The requirement of reasonable promptness in effectuating a warrantless misdemeanor arrest \u201cis designed to prevent too great an inroad on the rule requiring a warrant of arrest.... \u201d Charles E. Torc\u00eda, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 70 (18th ed.1989). As the Supreme Court said in <em>Trupiano v. United States, </em>\u201c[w]arrants of arrest are designed to meet the dangers of unlimited and unreasonable arrests of persons who are not at the moment committing any crime,\u201d 334 U.S. 699, 705, 68 S.Ct. 1229, 92 L.Ed. 1663 (1948); <em>see also </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 5.1(b) (3d ed.1996). The reason for requiring a warrant holds especially true in cases of misdemeanors where, because of the relative lack of severity of the offense, \u201cgreater ... formality [should be] prescribed for the exercise of the power to deprive the citizen of his liberty.\u201d <em>Yancey v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York, </em>96 Ga.App. 476, 100 S.E.2d 653, 656 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The \u201creasonable promptness\u201d requirement was found not to have been met when an officer waited two hours after the misdemeanor to make a misdemeanor arrest in <em>Collette v. Director of Revenue, </em>717 S.W.2d 551 (Mo.Ct.App.1986). <em>See also State v. Warren, supra, </em>103 N.M. 472, 709 P.2d 194 (1985) (delay of two to three hours in making arrest rendered arrest invalid); <em>Jackson v. Superior Court, </em>98 Cal.App.2d 183, 219 P.2d 879 (1950) (misdemeanor arrest made 28 hours after offense invalid due to delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Aside from <em>Childress, supra, </em>no Maryland appellate case has addressed the question of when a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor committed in the officer\u2019s presence or view must be made. But, the concept has been discussed when applying the common law doctrine of fresh pursuit. Under the fresh pursuit doctrine a police officer may arrest a suspect, outside of the officer\u2019s jurisdiction, \u201cfor misdemeanors committed in his presence <em>within a reasonable time thereafter. Glover v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 393, 400-01, 594 A.2d 1224 (1991) (citing <em>Gattus v. State, </em>204 Md. 589, 600-01, 105 A.2d 661 (1954)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In <em>Gattus v. State, </em>204 Md. 589, 600-01, 105 A.2d 661 (1954), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">There is another common law doctrine of fresh pursuit whereby a peace officer may arrest, without a warrant, for misdemeanors committed in his presence <em>within a reasonable time thereafter. </em>The' fresh pursuit affects only the reasonableness of the lapse of time between the commission of the offense and the arrest therefor. See 6 C.J.S., pp. 590, 591.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">In <em>Gattus, </em>the Court held the aforementioned common law rule to be inapplicable because the misdemeanor for which the appellant was arrested was not committed in the arresting officer\u2019s presence or view.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">In the case at hand, Officer Webb observed the acts that (allegedly) gave him probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor had been committed in his presence thirteen days <em>before </em>he arrested appellant. We have found no case that applied the reasonable promptness rule which found a war-rantless misdemeanor arrest valid where the delay exceeded one hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">We hold that Officer Webb did not act with \u201creasonable promptness\u201d in arresting appellant. Therefore appellant\u2019s arrest for trespass was illegal, and the drugs and money seized as a consequence of the arrest should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Even if Maryland did not apply the reasonable promptness rules, appellant\u2019s arrest would still have been illegal. At the time Officer Webb chased after appellant \u2014 and for the thirteen days that followed \u2014 the officer did not know whether appellant had ever been banned from entry onto the 125 Lee Avenue premises. Under such circumstances, a warrant would not have issued because Officer Webb never checked to see whether, in fact, appellant had been prohibited from entering the premises. The mere fact that Officer Webb knew that appellant had been banned from \u201cseveral locations on Lee Avenue\u201d plainly would not give him probable cause to believe that he had been banned from <em>all </em>\u201clocations\u201d on that avenue.

In this case, there was no conflicting evidence presented at the suppression hearing. The sole dispute concerns the second level finding of the motions judge, <em>i.e., </em>whether the arrest of appellant was lawful. <em>See Ornelas v.

Although the State fails to cite any authority in support of its position that there is no \u201creasonable promptness\u201d requirement when a misdemeanor arrest is made without a warrant, our research has found that there are a scattering of cases that would support the State\u2019s position. <em>See Jordan v. Shea, </em>46 Mich.App. 443, 208 N.W.2d 235, 238 (1973) (\"We find no time limit ... as to when [a warrantless] arrest [for a misdemeanor] must be made.\u201d). <em>See also Dailey v. United States, </em>261 F.2d 870 (5th Cir.1958), interpreting a statute that allowed certain federal agents to \"make arrests without warrant for violations of <em>any </em>law of the United States relating to narcotic drugs ... or marihuana ... where the violation is committed in the presence of the person making the arrest, or where such person has reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 872 (emphasis added). The <em>Dailey </em>Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">[t]here is nothing in the statute requiring that an arrest be made immediately following the arresting officer\u2019s knowledge of probable cause for arrest. If an arresting officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a person has violated the narcotics laws, he may defer the arrest for a day, a week, two weeks, or perhaps longer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-9\"><em>Id.; see also United States v. Davis, </em>281 F.2d 93, 97 (7th Cir.1960) (Under a statute which allowed narcotics agents to \"make arrests without warrant for violations ... if committed in the presence of the person making the arrest, or where such person had reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested was committing [a narcotics] violation, there is no requirement that the arrest be made immediately following the arresting officer\u2019s learning of the probable cause\u201d; thus, a delay of about eight days did not constitute an illegal arrest).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
