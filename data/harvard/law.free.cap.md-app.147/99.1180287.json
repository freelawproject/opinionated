On this appeal, she presents the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">I. Did the juvenile court abuse its discretion by refusing to vacate the order terminating the mother\u2019s parental rights, where the Court of Appeals had ordered further proceedings in a related case from which an appeal was pending at the time the order terminating parental rights was entered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">II. Did the juvenile court abuse its discretion by determining that the child would be harmed by the psychological examination proposed by the mother, and that the harm outweighed the mother\u2019s need for the examination?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">We answer the second question in the affirmative. We need not and shall not address the first question.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">PROLOGUE</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">Ms. Helen M., the appellant, is the natural mother of Mark M., who was born on March 5, 1994, and who was adjudicated a child in need of assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d) on April 9, 1995, by the District Court of Maryland, Montgomery County, sitting as the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">On June 17, 1999, the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cthe Department\u201d) filed a \u201cPetition for Guardianship with Right to Consent to Adoption or Long Term Care Short of Adoption.\u201d The Department recommended that Mark M. be adopted by his paternal grandmother, Peggy M., with whom he had been residing since June of 1998. On February 24, 2000, in connection with the Department\u2019s petition, Helen M. filed a \u201cMotion for Evaluation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Child.\u201d A hearing was held on the motion on March 29, 2000, and the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">A six-day hearing on the \u201cPetition for Guardianship with Right to Consent to Adoption\u201d commenced on April 26, 2000 and the appellant appealed the final order that terminated the appellant\u2019s parent rights and granted the Department\u2019s Petition, and on June 13, 2000, the juvenile court granted the petition and terminated Helen M.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">ACT ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In her first appeal to this Court, Helen M. argued that it was a denial of due process to refuse her request for an examination of the child by her own expert.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court neither reversed nor affirmed on this issue, but instead remanded the case for further proceedings, \u201cin order for the court fully to consider and determine whether such an evaluation would be harmful to Mark, and whether appellant is entitled to the requested evaluation.\u201d <em>In Re: Adoption/Guardianship No. 6Z99027, </em>No. 884, September Term, 2000 (filed March 9, 2001) at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">At the time of the remand by this Court, an appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals from a related CINA proceeding involving visitation. In that proceeding, the juvenile court had refused a similar request by Helen M. for a psychological examination \u00f3f Mark and had denied Helen M. visitation with her son. In light of the pending appeal from the CINA proceeding, Helen M. filed a motion in this Court to stay further proceedings in the juvenile court in this termination of parental rights (\u201cTPR\u201d) action. This Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ACT TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">On July 13, 2001, in accordance with the mandate from this Court, the juvenile court held a hearing to determine whether the forensic mental examination of Mark sought by Helen M. would be harmful to him, and whether Helen M. was entitled to such an examination before her parental rights could be terminated. Dr. John Mealy, the clinical psychologist that Helen M. proposed to conduct the examination, testified that the purpose of the examination would be to determine \u201cto what extent [Mark\u2019s fear of Helen M. is] a reality based perception.\u201d Dr. Mealy had reviewed the records in this case and had also listened to testimony elicited during previous proceedings in this case from Dr. Robert Lazun, Mark\u2019s therapist, and Dr. Joseph Poirier, a clinical psychologist who had evaluated Helen M. and her family for the Department in 1995. Dr. Mealy noted that reports of abuse conflicted with reports that Mark was well-treated by his mother, so that it was difficult to determine the quality of that relationship. Furthermore, because the attachment with his mother had been abruptly terminated with no visitation, the child had been subjected to a potentially traumatic experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Dr. Mealy testified that, because of these complicated issues, an in-depth examination would be necessary, which would include watching Mark interact with his grandmother, teachers, or any other caretakers. In Dr. Mealy\u2019s opinion, it would also be important to conduct psychological testing so that he could \u201ctry and get a sense of what [Mark\u2019s] experience is, what he thinks about, what his personality, characteristic strengths, weaknesses, what kind of thinking goes on, how his emotion is handled.\u201d One of his goals would be to determine the extent to which Mark\u2019s perception of his mother was based on reality, and he suggested that an evaluation of the mother could also be important in that process. He stated that in his experience children would sometimes describe their parents as horrible people, and yet when they were together in the same room with them, they would appear to have a good relationship. Dr. Mealy added that he could not envision any harm to the child from such an evaluation, and he had \u201cno sense that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>I\u2019ve ever traumatized a child that way.\u201d In his experience, children responded favorably to his treatment of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">When questioned as to whether he had to talk to Mark about his mother, Dr. Mealy testified that if any discussion with Mark about his mother was too distressing for him, he would not pursue it. If Mark handled those discussions well, however, he might even entertain the possibility of a visit with his mother so that he could observe them together. According to Dr. Mealy, the important thing would be that the evaluation be \u201cdone in a sensitive way, to him.\u201d Dr. Mealy testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">Perhaps there should be some visitation with his mother, that I could observe, you know. I mean, that\u2019s, in terms of a full evaluation, that\u2019s out on the edge of it. It\u2019s not something that I would say that I wouldn\u2019t, that I\u2019m going to do, but it\u2019s something that could be sensible, as an evaluation progresses....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Dr. Mealy estimated that it would require approximately 20 hours to perform the type of thorough evaluation that was needed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Although he had never met Mark, Dr. Mealy believed that the examination could be conducted without causing him any additional trauma. When questioned on cross-examination as to whether he had any opinion on whether the process would be harmful to Mark, Dr. Mealy responded that the evaluation would be conducted in a way that was safe and comfortable for Mark, and that he would not pursue avenues of inquiry that were having an adverse effect on him. Dr. Mealy acknowledged that he had no basis for determining whether Mark\u2019s reaction to the mere mention of his mother was based on reality or not, but he felt it was important to the child\u2019s welfare to find out whether those fears were based in reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Dr. Mealy acknowledged that the guiding principle in this process was first to \u201cdo no harm.\u201d He added that, if the court was uncomfortable with the possibility that the child might be traumatized by the evaluation, he could provide the court with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>an interim report which would cover: the tests he had given up to that time; his findings; and his recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Dr. Robert Lazun, a licensed clinical social worker who had been Mark\u2019s therapist since July of 1998, testified as an expert witness for the Department. Dr. Lazun expressed his belief that the proposed examination <em>would </em>be harmful to Mark. According to Dr. Lazun, Mark was doing very well in the care of his grandmother and was developing a sense of trust in his caretakers and teachers. He and Mark have been working on building relationships of trust among Mark and those with whom he interacts. Mark, however, is suspicious of anything that he associates with his mother. Dr. Lazun stated, \u201cMark reacts when he hears anything about, anything which reminds him, or makes him think of, the fact that he would have to have something to do with his mom.\u201d Dr. Lazun was confident that having to go through an additional evaluation would send up a \u201cred flag\u201d for Mark, and that \u201cMark would automatically assume that it has to do with his mother.\u201d Dr. Lazun concluded that Mark \u201cwould immediately begin to question the trust that he has in his grandmother and other people,\u201d would \u201cslip back, very far,\u201d and that \u201che would believe that there isn\u2019t really anyone he can trust.\u201d Dr. Lazun added that the consequences of the examination proposed by Dr. Mealy would be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">According to Dr. Lazun, Mark was doing very well in the care of his grandmother and was developing a sense of trust in his caretakers and teachers. In his opinion, any kind of evaluation would be harmful to Mark at this time because he would sense a connection between the evaluation and his past life, which causes him a great deal of anxiety. According to Dr. Lazun, Mark would sometimes express his anxiety by twisting and pulling out his hair and spitting. Also, Mark would become irritable and demanding with his grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In Dr. Lazun\u2019s opinion, Mark would be resistant to any testing procedures, and as a result they would probably not produce an accurate reading. Furthermore, the tests might cause him to distrust others and become disruptive at school and at home. When asked about the possible impact of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>meeting with his mother, Dr. Lazun stated that he was \u201cspeechless\u201d and unable to imagine the impact. He further testified, however, that he had occasionally raised the subject of Mark\u2019s mother with him over the past six months, and Mark no longer clenched his fists when she was mentioned. Instead, Mark stated in a very matter of fact way that he didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Although Dr. Lazun stated that in his opinion Mark would be upset and lose his sense of trust in the world if psychological tests were administered to him, Dr. Lazun admitted that he was a clinical social worker, not a psychologist, and that he was not trained in the use and interpretation of psychological tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">When Dr. Mealy was called to testify in rebuttal, he stated that any perception by Mark of the evaluation as a threatening event would be a distortion of reality and would have \u201clittle to do with the reality of the psychological evaluation as I would conduct it.\u201d Dr. Mealy further testified that if Mark\u2019s therapist were to advise him that any reference to the mother would produce a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d emotional reaction in Mark, \u201cthen I wouldn\u2019t do it, unless I gained independent confidence that it was possible by the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">After hearing this additional evidence, the juvenile court \u201creaffirmed\u201d its termination of Helen M.\u2019s parental rights. The court issued an order stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">[T]he court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the evaluation requested would be harmful to the child, Mark M., and would not be in his best interest. In balancing the need to protect Mark M. from further harm with the mother\u2019s assertion of good cause for the evaluation, the Court finds that the risk of harm to Mark M. far outweighs the mother\u2019s need for the evaluation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Helen M. has again appealed to this Court</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">COMMENTARY</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">In resolving Helen M.\u2019s appeal in the related CINA proceeding, the Court of Appeals observed that \u201c[a] parent\u2019s interest in raising a child is, no doubt, a fundamental right, recognized by the United States Supreme Court....\u201d <em>In Re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 705, 782 A.2d 332 (2001) (citing <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000); <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972)). The Court added that \u201cMaryland, too, has declared a parent\u2019s interest in raising a child to be so fundamental that it \u2018cannot be taken away unless clearly justified.\u2019 \u201d <em>In Re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 705, 782 A.2d 332 (citing <em>Boswell v. Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 218, 721 A.2d 662 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">As the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">That fundamental interest, however, is not absolute and does not exclude other important considerations. Pursuant to the doctrine of <em>parens patriae, </em>the State of Maryland has an interest in caring for those, such as minors, who cannot care for themselves.... We have held that \u201cthe best interests of the child may take precedence over .the parent\u2019s liberty interest in the course of a custody, visitation, or adoption dispute.\u201d ... That which will best promote the child\u2019s welfare becomes particularly consequential where the interests of a child are in jeopardy, as is often the case in situations involving sexual, physical, or emotional abuse by a parent____[T]he child\u2019s welfare is \u201ca consideration that is of \u2018transcendent importance\u2019 \u201d when the child might otherwise be in jeopardy....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-8\"><em>In Re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 705-06, 782 A.2d 332 (citations omitted). <em>See also In Re Adoption/Guardianship No. T00032005, </em>141 Md.App. 570, 580-82, 786 A.2d 64 (2001). The Court of Appeals further recognized in the related case that \u201cin cases where abuse or neglect is evidenced, particularly in a GINA case, the court\u2019s role is necessarily more pro-active.\u201d <em>In Re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 706, 782 A.2d 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">At the relevant time, former \u00a7 3-818 of the Courts Article controlled psychological examinations of children in CI\u00d1A and TPR cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-818 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art. <em>See also id., </em>former \u00a7 3-804(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (providing that juvenile court has jurisdiction in CINA proceedings and proceedings for termination of parental rights where child has been determined to be in need of assistance). Former \u00a7 3-818 provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014 After a petition or a citation has been filed, the court may direct the Department of Juvenile Justice or another qualified agency to make a study concerning the child, his family, his environment, and other matters relevant to the disposition of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">\u25a0(b) <em>Examination by professionally qualified </em>person.\u2014 As part of the study, the child or any parent, guardian, or custodian may be examined at a suitable place by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other professionally qualified person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\"><em>Id., </em>former \u00a7 3-818.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In <em>In Re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 717, 782 A.2d 332, the Court of Appeals held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">motions for independent [psychological] examinations may be made by a parent or other party in a CINA proceeding, in addition to the state. We also hold that when making a motion to compel a physical or mental examination of a child pursuant to Section 3-818 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the party making the motion must demonstrate good cause for such an examination. The examination should be reasonably calculated to assist the trier of fact in rendering its decision....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">The party also must show that the proposed examination will not be harmful to the child....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">(Citations omitted.) In the appeal from the related CINA proceeding, the Court of Appeals determined that Helen M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>had \u201cfailed to make a proper showing of a need for an independent ... examination of Mark M.\u201d and \u201cdid not provide any means to assure that such an examination would not be harmful to Mark M.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719, 782 A.2d 332. The Court relied on a different ground \u2014 the juvenile court\u2019s improper delegation to Mark\u2019s therapist of its authority to determine visitation \u2014 in reversing the juvenile court\u2019s denial of visitation to Helen M. The Court nevertheless commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">Upon remand, Helen M. should have the opportunity to advocate for an independent [psychological] examination if she so chooses, but must provide the data specified, and the court must balance the protection of Mark M. against Helen M.\u2019s need for the examination. The juvenile court must be specific in its decision to either grant or deny the motion for an independent [psychological] examination of the child. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The Court\u2019s holding regarding independent psychological examinations in CINA proceedings is equally applicable to \u2022TPR proceedings. A parent against whom a petition for termination of parental rights has been filed may move for an independent examination, and must then demonstrate that there is good cause for the proposed examination and that the examination will not be harmful to the child. <em>See id. </em>at 717-18, 782 A.2d 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Upon Helen M.\u2019s first appeal from the juvenile court\u2019s termination of her parental rights, this Court suggested that there was merit in Helen M.\u2019s assertion that there was good cause for the examination. We stated: \u201cIn a case of this magnitude, we are hard pressed to articulate any reason to deny the mother a full and fair opportunity to establish the child\u2019s emotional ties to her, or to challenge the testimony of the Department\u2019s key expert.\u201d <em>In Re: Adoption/Guardianship No. 6Z99027, </em>No. 884 at 33. We recounted the evidence presented at the TPR hearing and concluded, moreover, that there was an \u201cabsence of evidence that Mark would have been harmed by an evaluation conducted by the mother\u2019s expert. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>We observed that, in terminating Helen M.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>parental rights, the juvenile court had erroneously asserted that \u201cissues such as the child\u2019s attachment to his mother are not \u2018under the purview of the termination of parental rights\u2019....\u201d <em>Id. </em>We pointed out that, under \u00a7 5 \u2014 313(c)(iii) of the Family Law Article, a court is required to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe child\u2019s feelings toward and emotional ties with the child\u2019s natural parents\u201d before it may terminate parental rights and pennit adoption without the natural parents\u2019 consent. <em>Id. </em>at 32. We thus remanded the case to the juvenile court, without affirmance or reversal, with instructions to reconsider whether Helen M. was entitled to the examination and whether it would be harmful to Mark. <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">As we have indicated, the juvenile court <em>did </em>hear additional testimony from both Dr. Mealy and Dr. Lazun. The court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">... Based on the testimony and the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses that appeared in front of me, on the hearing on ... remand, I have determined that such an evaluation would be very detrimental to Mark, and I will not order it. I have to determine whether the appellant is entitled to the requested evaluation...'. There has to be good cause and ... evidence to support ... the mother\u2019s request for the evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">Now, as I re-read the testimony and the ... opinions, in this case, the reason the mother requested this, was mainly to support a theory that she had, of alienation of affections. And I find that based on all the evidence that I heard, there is absolutely nothing to support that theory. To the contrary, all the evidence is to the contrary of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">So, in balancing the mother\u2019s need against the need to protect the child, his best interest ..., I find that ... the mother has not met her burden in any way.... [A]ll there has been is a flat assertion, of the possibility of this, ... there\u2019s been no evidence to support it. And as a matter of fact, all the evidence that was presented was totally contrary to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>So, I find that the balance is in favor of Mark and the protection of Mark, and so I will not order the evaluation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We review a juvenile court\u2019s denial of a request for a psychological examination under former \u00a7 3-818 of the Courts Article to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>See, e.g., In Re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 719, 782 A.2d 332. We are persuaded that there was an abuse of discretion in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">As we indicated in response to Helen M.\u2019s first appeal, Helen M. was faced with the loss of a fundamental right \u2014 the right to raise her child. The Department\u2019s key witness was Mark\u2019s therapist, Dr. Lazun. Dr. Lazun was a licensed clinical social worker who had been hired by Mark\u2019s grandmother, the woman with whom Mark resided and who hoped to adopt Mark upon the termination of Helen M.\u2019s parental rights. Dr. Lazun was expected to \u2014 and ultimately did \u2014 testify to the effect that it was in Mark\u2019s best interest that Helen M.\u2019s parental rights be terminated and the adoption proceed. Absent a psychological examination by another mental health professional, Helen M. would have no effective way to refute Dr. Lazun\u2019s testimony. Significantly, as we indicated in our opinion resolving the first appeal, Helen M. presented evidence at the initial TPR hearing to the effect that she was a caring and effective parent who had met with some success in overcoming her own mental health and substance abuse problems. <em>See In Re: Adoption Guardianship No. 6Z99027, </em>No. 884 at 6-7. There was thus an evidentiary basis for Helen M.\u2019s contention that there was a strong bond between Mark and herself. The juvenile court\u2019s determination that Helen M. had failed to establish good cause for the proposed examination was simply incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Nor can we accept the juvenile court\u2019s determination that, under any circumstances, \u201can evaluation would be very detrimental to Mark.... \u201d While Dr. Lazun stated that the mere mention of Helen M. to Mark would set Mark\u2019s therapy back and create trust issues, he indicated that he himself tested the waters periodically by asking Mark if he wanted to talk about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>his mother. Although in the past Mark was visibly upset by this question, he now simply responded that he did not. Dr. Lazun\u2019s position that <em>any </em>evaluation of Mark would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d to Mark if conducted by anyone other than himself is untenable; it would hobble Helen M.\u2019s defense by ensuring that the Department\u2019s position was the <em>only </em>position that could be supported by informed expert testimony. Dr. Lazun admitted, moreover, that he, unlike Dr. Mealy, is not a psychologist and is not trained in the use and interpretation of psychological testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">EPILOGUE</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We acknowledge that Mark M.\u2019s emotional health may be precarious, and that any examiner must be sensitive to Mark\u2019s insecurities and tender age,' as well as to the concerns of Mark\u2019s therapist. We do not, however, accept the proposition that an examination simply cannot be conducted. We are confident that Dr. Mealy, a trained clinical psychologist with more than 30 years of experience in conducting psychological examinations of children, will be able to conduct the examination in a manner that is not harmful to Mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT OF MARYLAND, MONTGOMERY COUNTY, JUVENILE DIVISION VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">APPELLEE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\">.
