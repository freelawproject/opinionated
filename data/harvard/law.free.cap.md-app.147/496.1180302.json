We must also determine whether the court erred by admitting in evidence the results of a voice stress test, and in barring the admission of certain psychiatric testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">A jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County convicted Sirena Catura Whittington, appellant, of the second degree murder of her husband, Andre Whittington. She was also found guilty of a handgun offense. Thereafter, the court sentenced appellant to consecutive terms of imprisonment totaling 50 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">On appeal, Whittington poses three questions, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">I. Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress her confession?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">II. Did the trial court err in admitting evidence at trial that appellant failed a voice stress analysis test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">III. Did the trial court err in ruling that appellant\u2019s board-certified psychiatrist could not render an opinion as to whether appellant\u2019s confession was voluntary?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">I. SUPPRESSION MOTION</p>\n<p id=\"AWa\">A. Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b522-15\">On the morning of March 26, 1999, Andre Whittington was shot once in the back of the head at his office in Laurel. He died shortly thereafter. At trial, the State proceeded on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>theory that appellant shot the victim because she thought her husband \u201cwas being unfaithful to her and she was tired of it.\u201d The defense acknowledged that appellant shot her husband, but claimed she did so because she was a victim of spousal abuse. At the time, appellant was in her mid 20\u2019s, a mother of two children, and had completed one year of community college. She was one of many witnesses who testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Prior to trial, appellant moved unsuccessfully to suppress the statements she made during custodial interrogation, one of which was a confession. At the suppression hearing held in February 2001, numerous witnesses testified. What follows is a summary of the evidence adduced at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Detective Jeffrey Reichert contacted appellant by telephone shortly after 1:00 p.m. on March 26, 1999, the date of Mr. Whittington\u2019s death. Appellant told him she had dropped her husband off at work at around 7:50 a.m. that morning. Detective Reichert arranged to meet appellant at her home at 2:00 p.m. that afternoon. At the time, appellant was not yet a suspect in the murder. Appellant told the detective that she had driven her husband to work in her car, because the tires had been slashed on his car. She also gave an oral account of the events of the morning and the previous evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">On March 29, 1999, three days after the murder, appellant went with her parents to the police station, at the request of the Prince George\u2019s County homicide unit. She arrived before 1:00 p.m. During the first eighteen hours that appellant was at the police station, she gave several statements, oral and written, denying any participation in the shooting. At about \u20227:00 a.m. on March 30, 1999, some eighteen hours after her arrival, appellant confessed to the homicide. The State introduced as an exhibit a \u201clog\u201d showing what transpired while appellant was at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">At 12:50 p.m. on March 29, 1999, appellant was met by Detective Nelson William Rhone, Jr., who escorted her to an interview room. Detective Rhone described the room as 8 feet by 6 feet in size, with one desk, two chairs, a door, and carpeting. Appellant was not handcuffed or shackled, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Rhone did not wear his handgun in the interview room. At the time of the interview, Detective Rhone already knew that a woman had been seen leaving her husband\u2019s place of employment after the gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">According to Detective Rhone, appellant initially seemed somewhat \u201cgroggy,\u201d and \u201clethargic.\u201d She explained to him that the previous morning she had taken \u201chalf a pill\u201d that her doctor had prescribed to help her sleep. The detective claimed, however, that as appellant spoke she seemed less lethargic. He then asked her some general biographical questions. At some point appellant told him that earlier that year she had been questioned by the police for misuse of credit cards and theft of computers. As to the computer theft incident, she told the detective that she had been advised of her rights and had given a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Detective Rhone advised appellant of her rights beginning at 1:35 p.m., using the \u201clong\u201d waiver form. Appellant indicated that she understood her rights and initialed, checked, and signed the form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the log, the advice of rights was completed at 1:45 p.m. Thereafter, appellant gave an oral statement as to the events of the night before and the morning of her husband\u2019s murder, in which she denied any involvement in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">At about 1:50 p.m., Detective Rhone gave appellant a pen to write her first statement; he left the room. Unknown to appellant, the detective put a powder on the pen that was invisible to the naked eye. The log states: \u201cAs a deceptive technique used, this investigator used a[n] orange finger print <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>powder on a black pen that would only show up under a neon or infrared light source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Detective Rhone returned to the room at around 2:30 p.m. Upon reading appellant\u2019s written statement, he noted some \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in it. He then engaged in a question and answer interview of appellant, in which he asked her a series of questions to clarify her statement. The detective wrote the question, appellant wrote the answer, and she initialed each answer as well as each page.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">At some point, the detective asked appellant whether she would consent to a test that would show whether she had \u201cblow back\u201d on her hands from recent handgun use. It was a bogus test, intended to trick appellant into believing that the police could determine whether she had recently fired a gun. Appellant consented to the test. The detective also asked appellant whether she would consent to a voice stress analysis (\u201cVSA\u201d) test. Again, appellant agreed. According to Detective Rhone, at no time did appellant ask for an attorney or ask him to stop the interview. Moreover, he denied threatening appellant or making any promises to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">At 3:10 p.m., appellant was taken to the restroom and then returned to the interview room. At about 4:00 p.m., an evidence technician entered the room to examine appellant\u2019s hands under an infrared light. He showed appellant the orange \u201cpowder\u201d on her hands, stating that it was residue from a gun. It is undisputed that this was untrue; the orange powder came from the pen appellant had been given to write her statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Sergeant Glen Clark met with appellant between 4:25 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. Appellant agreed to submit to a voice stress \u201clie detector\u201d test, which Sergeant Clark performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">At-5:16 p.m., Detective Rhone entered the room and asked appellant if she would sign a consent form allowing the police to search her house in Baltimore. She agreed and executed the form. At 5:30 p.m., Detective Rhone offered appellant food and water, which she refused. She was left alone until 7:25 p.m., at which time Detective Christopher Brophy en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>tered the room. During her meeting with Detective Brophy, appellant requested and was given two cups of water. Detective Brophy did not take any statements from appellant, and he left the interview room at 8:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">From 8:45 p.m. to 9:25 p.m., Detective Brophy and Detective Joseph Hoffman met with appellant. She was then left alone for an hour. Detective Hoffman again met with appellant from 10:30 p.m. until 1:00 a.m. Shortly thereafter, she was taken to the restroom and given some food. From 1:30 a.m. until 3:00 a.m., appellant met with Detective Joseph Berg-strom.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Detective Samuel Smith met with appellant at around 3:30 a.m. At 3:35 a.m. Detective Hoffman entered the room for the purpose of removing appellant\u2019s money and jewelry. Smith recalled that appellant asked, \u201chow could the police arrest someone [if] they didn\u2019t have a gun?\u201d She also asserted that \u201cif she says something she\u2019s going to jail. If she does not say anything she\u2019s going to jail.\u201d He began a question and answer interview, writing both the questions and appellant\u2019s answers. Detective Smith left the room, then returned and finished the interview at 4:10 a.m. Appellant refused to sign or initial Smith\u2019s notes of her statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Detective Smith testified that while he met with appellant, she was alert and did not seem tired. Moreover, she never requested food or drink, did not ask to use the bathroom, and was not handcuffed. Further, Smith maintained that appellant did not request an attorney or ask to speak to her parents, nor indicate that she did not want to talk to the detectives. Smith was not in uniform.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Appellant was taken to the restroom at 4:20 a.m. Upon her return to the interview room, she spoke with Detective Robert Frankenfield. He described appellant as cooperative, and noted that she did not appear fatigued. In his view, appellant seemed bothered by something and wanted to talk. Franken-field claimed that appellant never asked to speak to an attorney, nor did she decline to speak to him. Moreover, he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>not threaten or coerce her, nor did he wear a weapon while in the room with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Detective Frankenfield recalled that appellant told him about her marriage and discussed her belief that her husband was \u201ccheating\u201d on her. She also revealed that she had been subjected to verbal and physical abuse by her husband. At some point, appellant told Frankenfield, \u201cyou\u2019re trying to break me, you\u2019re trying to break me, and she started shaking her headL.]\u201d Saying she was \u201cso sorry,\u201d appellant then confessed to murdering her husband. She explained that when he hit her, called her names, and choked her, she just \u201csnapped.\u201d Appellant claimed that she \u201cdidn\u2019t remember taking a gun out,\u201d but just \u201cremembered him falling!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">At 7:00 a.m., Detective Frankenfield gave appellant some paper and told her to write down what she had said. He then left the room. At around 7:30 a.m., he brought her some food while she finished what is referred to as the third and final statement. Thereafter, he engaged in a question and answer interview. Appellant initialed each answer and signed each page. At some point they spoke about the \u201cblow back\u201d evidence, and she told him that she could not have any \u201cblow back\u201d on her hands because, after shooting her husband, she had washed her hands with bleach.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The police provided appellant with a mattress on which to sleep at around 11:00 a.m. At noon, appellant was taken to a dumpster in Baltimore, where she claimed to have thrown the gun. At about 4:00 p.m., the police permitted appellant to call her family. Appellant was taken before a commissioner at 5:00 p.m., twenty-eight hours after she arrived at the police station.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Whittington presented a rather different version of her interrogation. She stated that when she met Detective Rhone at the police station she felt \u201cwoozy.\u201d She told him that she had taken a prescription medicine the night before to help her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>sleep. Detective Rhone had to steady her while escorting her to the interview room because her equilibrium was off.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">.Appellant asserted that Detective Rhone gave her an advice of rights form that already had check marks in the boxes. When she began to read the form, he told her that he knew she was in a hurry and showed her where to place her initials and signature. She then wrote a statement. After she finished, he took the statement and left the room for about fifteen minutes. When he returned, he slammed the paper on the table, told her that she was lying, and cursed at her. She also claimed that the detective \u201cpacked\u201d her \u201cup by [her] collar.\u201d Appellant also maintained that she told the detective she wanted a lawyer, but he told her she could not afford a lawyer and that she would have to get a public defender. Although appellant claimed that she asked to see her parents, she said Rhone refused to allow her to do so. Appellant also claimed that she asked for water but was never given any.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">According to appellant, she was never alone for more than twenty minutes. She recalled that, at one point, Detective Rhone left the interview room for about five minutes. When he returned, he told her she could go home after a question and answer session. Appellant said that when another officer entered, they started playing \u201cgood cop, bad cop.\u201d An officer asked her to take a \u201cpolygraph\u201d test for \u201cinsurance purposes.\u201d The officer told her that it \u201cwasn\u2019t admissible in court, so it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d Appellant agreed, and a man came in and performed the test. Although he told appellant that she had \u201cpassed\u201d the test, another officer came in and said she had \u201cfailed miserably.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Appellant stated that at around 1:00 a.m., she was placed in handcuffs and shackles and taken to a restroom. When she was brought back, Detective Smith entered the room and told her that they were going to lock her up regardless of whether she talked. According to appellant, Detective Smith never asked her any questions about the murder and never took a statement from her. After Detective Smith left, another person asked her to \u201ctake a gunpowder residue test,\u201d and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>agreed. About seven officers were in the room. Some had \u201cgoggle things\u201d on and told her to hold out her hands. Then, an officer \u201cturned the lights off and said, \u2018oh, she got it\u2019 and turned the lights on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">At one point, according to appellant, Detective Frankenfield entered the room with another police officer. The detective pulled a gun from his side and repeatedly waved it in her face. She told him that he was frightening her, and she crawled onto the floor underneath the desk and cowered. Appellant claimed that she repeatedly told Detective Frankenfield that she wanted a lawyer but he told her that it was not necessary. He promised she would go home once she had written a statement. She began to write about her relationship with her husband, but then asked the detective what he wanted her to say. He told her he would \u201ccoach\u201d her through the statement. She testified: \u201cHe basically coached me through this, because he had other statements with him[.]\u201d Further, she explained that she was willing to write down what he said because she was \u201ctired and fed up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Although Detective Frankenfield gave appellant some food, she said she never ate it. Nevertheless, appellant claimed she was very hungry, as well as tired and cold. She said she repeatedly asked to call her family but the officers refused to allow her to do so. Moreover, she stated that she told the officers that she was tired, to no avail. According to appellant, she asked each officer for an attorney. She also claimed that she was shackled and in handcuffs most of the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">On cross-examination, appellant admitted that earlier that year she was questioned by the police about the theft of some computers. At that time, she was advised of her rights, filled out an advice of rights form, and waived her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The defense called Dr. Alan Brody, a psychiatrist, who testified as an expert. Approximately eleven months after the murder, he examined appellant for about four hours. Dr. Brody explained that he attempted to determine Ms. Whit-tington\u2019s \u201cmental state\u201d at the time of the interrogation, in order to \u201cestablish some sense of what she might have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>experiencing psychologically [and] emotionally.\u201d His purpose was to assess the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s custodial statements. In his evaluation, Dr. Brody considered appellant\u2019s history and reviewed her testimony at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Dr. Brody described appellant as \u201cquite emotionally vulnerable, suggestable\u201d at the time of the police interrogation, as well as \u201cconfused.\u201d In addition, he opined that, following her husband\u2019s death, appellant \u201cwas probably suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder,\u201d which was most \u201csevere\u201d in the period immediately after the death. At the relevant time, the doctor said appellant was \u201canxious and depressed,\u201d psychologically affected by the pills she had taken earlier, \u201csleep deprived,\u201d was told \u201cfalse information\u201d and was \u201cintimidated by physical force.\u201d Further, Dr. Brody explained that sleep deprivation is \u201cvery significant\u201d in assessing the voluntariness of a statement. He also pointed to the police deception about the blow back test as a factor in the analysis of voluntariness. The doctor concluded that appellant was \u201cexhausted, frightened,\u201d and \u201cunder duress\u201d when she gave her confession. Based on all these factors, Dr. Brody opined that appellant\u2019s confession was not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Robert Phillips, M.D., Ph.D., a forensic psychiatrist, testified for the State as an expert in forensic psychiatry. In an effort to obtain \u201ca very clear understanding of the way in which [appellant\u2019s] neuropsychological capacities functioned,\u201d and provide \u201ca more accurate opinion regarding whether or not she had that capacity to waive her rights,\u201d Dr. Phillips reviewed numerous and varied documents relevant to the case; conducted \u201ccollateral interviews\u201d of several of appellant\u2019s relatives; arranged for and reviewed psychological testing of appellant performed by a clinical forensic psychologist; interviewed several of the detectives involved in the interrogation; and interviewed appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Dr. Phillips opined that there was \u201cno evidence of any clinical phenomenon or diagnosis that would have impaired the defendant\u2019s capacity to give a free, knowing or voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>statement to police authorities at the time she was questioned.\u201d Moreover, Dr. Phillips stated: \u201cThere is simply nothing in my clinical evaluation that supports the notion she had lost the capacity to make a decision.\u201d In addition, he testified that appellant \u201cabsolutely, unequivocally did not or does not at this time suffer from anything that remotely resembles post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d Indeed, in his view, at the time of the interrogation, \u201cthere was not one scintilla of evidence\u201d that appellant was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. To the contrary, he was satisfied that, at the time of the interrogation, there was \u201creally no clinical evidence\u201d of \u201cimpairment of cognition.\u201d Rather, in his view, appellant was capable of \u201cgiving a free and voluntary waiver\u201d of her rights. Based on the interview of appellant and his review of various documents, Dr. Phillips concluded that appellant was a \u201cmalingerer,\u201d in that she \u201cdistort[ed] facts for [her] own advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Detectives Rhone, Smith, and Frankenfield were recalled in rebuttal. They denied that appellant\u2019s confession was the result of the use of handcuffs, shackles, force, promises, threats, inducements, intimidation, deprivation of food, or denial of bathroom breaks or sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">After the evidence was presented, appellant\u2019s trial counsel argued that the statements were involuntary. Although defense counsel conceded that it is generally permissible for the police to be \u201csomewhat deceptive,\u201d he contended that in this case there was \u201ccoercion and duress in its classic form.\u201d Complaining about the length of interrogation, he asserted that the police used \u201cclassic terrorist tactics to get this woman to confess.... \u201d In this regard, defense counsel pointed to physical threats, removal of appellant\u2019s possessions, \u201cno bathroom,\u201d and no water. Moreover, he referred to her \u201cgroggy\u201d condition caused by her medication. Further, he claimed that appellant was subjected to \u201cconstant stress\u201d along with \u201cdeprivation of human essentials,\u201d including sleep. He added: \u201cIt is just not reasonable to think that being up for 18 straight hours ... is not going to create some type of need for sleep or rest in any human.\u201d He concluded that, from the State\u2019s perspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>tive, appellant was \u201csmart enough to know what to do, [yet] dumb enough to confess, but only after 18 hours.\u201d Significantly, the defense lawyer did not contend that appellant\u2019s confession was involuntary because of deceptive police conduct in using a bogus scientific test.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In its ruling, the court expressly discredited appellant\u2019s version of events and credited the State\u2019s account. It found that appellant\u2019s statements were obtained in compliance with <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). As to voluntariness, the court considered the defense\u2019s allegations of coercion and sleep deprivation, the undue length of the interrogation, and the conflicting expert testimony as to whether appellant suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome. In a thorough and well reasoned oral opinion denying appellant\u2019s suppression motion, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">A statement given by a defendant is admissible only if three broad ... factors are met. It has to be voluntary under Maryland common law, voluntary under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment under federal law and under Maryland constitutional law as well, and it must be in conformance with the mandates of Miranda.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">In determining whether the defendant\u2019s statement is voluntary under both Maryland common law and the due process and the federal and state constitutions, the standard is the totality of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">The factors that I must consider include where the interrogation was conducted, its length, who was present, how it was conducted, its contents, whether the defendant was given her <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the mental and physical condition of the defendant. The age, background, experience, education, character, intelligence of the defendant, whether the defendant was taken before a court commissioner following arrest and whether the defendant was physically mistreated, physically intimidated or psychologically pressured. Those are the factors listed in <em>Hof [v. State, </em>337 Md. 581, 596-97, 655 A.2d 370 (1995) ]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>I find that the statement was in fact made in compliance with <em>Miranda.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">As to whether or not the statement was voluntary, either under the Maryland common law or the federal and state constitutional law, basically the defense is twofold, that she confessed because she was sleepy, or she was so sleepy she would do anything to get sleep and that the length of the interrogation resulted in an involuntary statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">Thrown into that was the diagnosis by Dr. Brody that he believes she suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome, which he felt made her more vulnerable to questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">He based his opinion on the fact the interrogation took place in a small room, that she was handcuffed, that she was not permitted to go to the rest room, she was not permitted food, she was not permitted water, that there was deception on the part of the police, specifically as to the orange powder, and lastly, that she was sleep deprived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">The detectives testified that she was not handcuffed, that she was permitted to go to the rest room, she was permitted food, she was permitted water, she was offered food and water, which she refused. <em>So I believe the collective version of the detectives. I do not believe Miss Whittington. </em>Therefore, obviously I\u2019m not going to consider those factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">The deception on the part of the police is constitutionally, peimitted. The police are permitted to lie. They are permitted to deceive in their efforts to obtain the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">That leaves us with the sleep deprivation. Dr. Brody testified that the sleep deprivation can cause hallucinations, it causes losing touch with reality, psychotic episodes. Obviously, that is the very extreme case, and I did not infer from his testimony in that regard that he was saying that occurred in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\">On the other hand, Dr. Phillips testified, and testified that there\u2019s sleep deprivation and then there is sleep deprivation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>As part of anyone becoming a doctor, they\u2019re working 48 hour shifts, 86 hour shifts. The issue is not whether her normal night\u2019s sleep was interrupted, which certainly it was, or not even that she was tired. The issue is did the loss of sleep make her lose her capacity to make decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">I find that it did not. Dr. Phillips testified that you would see a broad array of dysfunction and other aspects of behavior if someone was in fact suffering from sleep deprivation, and I believe his testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">The other factor I\u2019m considering is the statements themselves. I\u2019ve looked at the statement that was given in the afternoon. I\u2019ve read that. I read the statement that was given at 7 a.m., and there appears to me to be absolutely no difference in those statements in terms of how they\u2019re constructed. The sentence structure is beautiful. Obviously, we\u2019re dealing with an educated person. The sentences are the same. The handwriting appears to be the same. The spelling is great. That statement looks in no way \u2014 that statement was not written by someone who had any lack of capacity to make that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">As between the two, I think it\u2019s clear already <em>I believe Dr. Phillips. </em>I believe his testimony was not only the most credible, it was the one that was based on the proper standards and the proper foundations. He had tests run, he obtained all the information, so he had a background, and he found there was no evidence of any clinical condition that would have impaired her capacity to freely and voluntarily make the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">There was no evidence of any post-traumatic stress, and that the sleep deprivation was simply not a factor.

DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">In-appellant\u2019s challenge to the denial of her motion to suppress, she focuses primarily oh deceptive conduct by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>police in using a phony \u201cblow back\u201d test.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although appellant concedes that the court was \u201cfree to believe\u201d the State\u2019s evidence, in which the police denied any mistreatment or deprivation of appellant\u2019s right to counsel, Whittington contends that the deceptive police conduct constituted psychological inducement or coercion. Consequently, she insists that her confession was involuntary and inadmissible. Whittington asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">[T]he State freely confirmed its effective use of a particular form of deception which was so extreme that it was coercive and intolerable. The use of a false, gunshot residue \u2018test,\u2019 coupled with use of a police technician to falsely validate the phony test results, crossed a line into impermissible deception. That level of deception was combined with the use of a \u2018voice stress test,\u2019 which is even less scientifically reliable than the inadmissible polygraph test, but which was touted to the accused as a lie detector. Finally, these stress factors, were combined with the length of the interrogation \u2014 14 out of 28 hours spent in police custody, while three detectives took turns questioning her \u2014 to form a type of coercion so severe that it did \u2018break\u2019 the Appellant and coerce her admissions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Appellant adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The detectives\u2019 conduct in the case <em>sub judice </em>far exceeds law enforcement tactics allowed in previous Maryland cases. The detectives here continuously confronted Appellant with the false claim that they possessed indisputable, scientific and lie detector evidence of her guilt. This method is far more coercive than merely representing to the suspect that another has implicated her. Defense lawyers can cross examine witnesses, whose motives to lie can be exposed. But scientific test results, as the detectives in this case claimed to have, cannot be so easily attacked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In response, the State asserts: \u201cDeception about constitu- ' tional rights is qualitatively different than deception about the amount of evidence available to police.\u201d As to appellant\u2019s constitutional rights, it maintains that the police did not resort to deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">When, as here, the prosecution seeks to introduce a defendant\u2019s custodial admission, the State must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the statement was obtained in conformance with the dictates of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602,16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 480, 536 A.2d 622 (1988).

United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). We accomplish this by reviewing the law and applying it to the first-level facts found by the suppression judge. <em>In re Tariq A-R-Y, </em>347 Md. 484, 488-89, 701 A.2d 691 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1140, 118 S.Ct. 1105, 140 L.Ed.2d 158 (1998); <em>Howard v.

Indeed, \u2018the defendant\u2019s own confession is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him [or her]....\u2019 \u201d <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 296, 111 S.Ct. 1246 (quoting <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 139, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) (White, J., dissenting)). As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Fulminante, </em>a confession is significant because \u201c \u2018[t]he admissions of a defendant come from the actor himself, the most knowledgeable and unimpeachable source of information.... Certainly, confessions have profound impact on the jury....\u2019 \u201d <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 296, 111 S.Ct. 1246 (quoting <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 140, 88 S.Ct. 1620) (White, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Appellant relies primarily on <em>State v. Cayward, </em>552 So.2d 971 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1989), <em>review dismissed, </em>562 So.2d 347 (Fla.1990), to support her contention that police deception in using a bogus scientific test rendered her confession involuntary. In <em>Cayward, </em>a teenager was suspected of sexually assaulting and smothering his young niece. During a two-hour interrogation, the police showed the suspect two scientific reports that had been fabricated as a ploy to induce a confession. <em>Id. </em>at 972. One report was prepared on stationery of the Florida Department of Criminal Law Enforcement; the other was prepared on stationery of Life Codes, Inc., a phony scientific testing organization. The police represented to the suspect that both scientific reports were genuine, and indicated that the test results revealed that Cayward\u2019s semen was found on the victim\u2019s underwear. <em>Id. </em>At the end of the interrogation, Cayward asked, \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>investigator told him, \u201cWe are going to the grand jury,\u201d and indicated that the State would seek the death penalty. <em>Id. </em>Cayward then confessed. Concluding that the fabrication of the documents and exhibition of them to the suspect violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights, the appellate court determined that the defendant\u2019s statement was involuntary. Thus, it upheld the trial court\u2019s suppression of the confession. <em>Cayward, </em>552 So.2d at 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The Florida court acknowledged that deceptive police conduct does not render a confession involuntary <em>per </em>se. Although the <em>Cayward </em>court recognized the viability of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test in regard to the determination of voluntariness, it found that there was \u201ca qualitative difference\u201d between the use of verbal \u201cartifices\u201d and the fabrication of bogus documents. <em>Id. </em>at 973. Thus, the court adopted a \u201cbright line\u201d rule, stating that the manufacture and use of false documents by the police to induce a confession \u201chas no place in our criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The <em>Cayward </em>court recognized that, because most people expect police interrogations to take place in a confrontational or adversarial atmosphere, a suspect would probably expect the police to engage in some form of oral deception. In contrast, the court indicated that neither the expectations of the suspect nor the public \u201cencompass the notion that the police will knowingly fabricate tangible documentation____\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the court\u2019s view, such police conduct was reminiscent of \u201cthe horrors of less advanced centuries in our civilization when magistrates ... schemed with sovereigns to frame political rivals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the court regarded such conduct as analogous to \u201cone of the parade of horrors\u201d that our \u201cmodem judicial system was designed to correct.\u201d <em>Cayward,, </em>552 So.2d at 974. Therefore, it concluded that \u201cthe manufacturing of false documents by police officials offends our traditional notions of due process of law....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">In reaching its decision, the Florida court reasoned that, unlike oral misrepresentations, manufactured documents have \u201cthe facial appearance of authenticity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>court expressed concern that such documents might find their way into official files and even the courtroom. In its view, the erroneous admission of false documents would diminish the public\u2019s confidence in both the police and the legal system. <em>Id. </em>at 975. <em>See also State v. Farley, </em>192 W.Va. 247, 452 S.E.2d 50, 60 n. 13 (1994) (agreeing with <em>Cayward\u2019s </em>holding distinguishing between police deception generally, and the manufacture of false documents by the police).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Analogizing to <em>Cayward, </em>appellant argues here that \u201cthe police not only used verbal lies, but they manufactured tangible, false scientific evidence, by using a powder [sic] surreptitiously placed on the hands of the accused. Then, they even involved a police \u2018evidence technician,\u2019 a black light, and goggles to show the accused that a bright orange powder was on her hands, supposedly conclusive, scientific proof that she had fired a gun and there was \u2018the blow back from the gun\u2019 glowing bright orange on her hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We reject Whittington\u2019s contention that police deception with regard to the use of bogus scientific procedures is inherently more coercive than other forms of deception. At the outset, we note that there are important distinctions between this case and <em>Cayward. </em>The test results in <em>Cayward </em>clearly induced the defendant to confess. In contrast, appellant did not immediately confess when she learned of the results of the \u201cblow back\u201d gun test. Moreover, the court\u2019s decision in <em>Cayward </em>was partly rooted in its deep concern about the potential for misuse of a written memorialization of a fake scientific test, as well as the \u201cindefinite life\u201d of such documentary evidence. In this case, however, no documents were fabricated, so the concerns of the <em>Cayward </em>court are not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">A confession is generally voluntary if it is \u201c \u2018freely and voluntarily made at a time when [the defendant] knew and understood what he was saying.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoey, </em>311 Md. at 481, 536 A.2d 622 (citation omitted). Conversely, \u201ca confession is involuntary if it is induced by force, undue influence, improper promises, or threats.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 536 A.2d 622. Thus, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Maryland nonconstitutional law or common law, a confession or inculpatory statement will be suppressed\u201d if the conduct of the police has overborne the defendant\u2019s will to resist and produces a statement that was not freely self-determined. <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 178-79, 699 A.2d 1170 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1082, 118 S.Ct. 866, 139 L.Ed.2d 763 (1998). Put another way, a custodial statement is inadmissible unless it is \u201c \u2018shown to be free of any coercive barnacles that may have attached by improper means to prevent the expression from being voluntary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burch v. State, </em>346 Md. 253, 266, 696 A.2d 443, <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1001, 118 S.Ct. 571, 139 L.Ed.2d 410 (1997) (quoting <em>Hillard v.

In <em>Hof, </em>the Court explicated the factors relevant to the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d standard. The factors include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ5\">where the interrogation was conducted; its length; who was present; how it was conducted; its content; whether the defendant was given Miranda warnings; the mental and physical condition of the defendant; the age, background, experience, education, character, and intelligence of the defendant; when the defendant was taken before a court commissioner following arrest; and whether the defendant was physically mistreated, [or] physically intimidated or psychologically pressured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\"><em>Hof, </em>337 Md. at 596-97, 655 A.2d 370 (citations omitted). Although there are many relevant factors, courts must consider the particulars of each case. <em>Cf. United States v. Arvizu, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (recognizing that determination of reasonable suspicion requires consideration by courts of \u201cthe \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 of each case----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In determining the voluntariness of a confession under the federal Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Colorado v. Connelly, supra, </em>479 U.S. 157, 107 S.Ct. 515, provides guidance. There, the Supreme Court held that \u201ccoercive police activity\u201d is a necessary element to finding a confession involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 167, 107 S.Ct. 515. The Court stated: \u201cAbsent police conduct causally related to the confession, there is simply no basis for concluding that any state actor has deprived a criminal defendant of due process of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 107 S.Ct. 515 (footnote omitted). A contrary rule, the Supreme Court reasoned, would require \u201csweeping inquiries into the state of mind of a criminal defendant who has confessed, inquiries quite divorced from any coercion brought to bear on the defendant by the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 107 S.Ct. 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">To be sure, the use of police deception is a proper consideration in regard to voluntariness. Indeed, courts have suppressed statements found to be the product of excessively deceptive conduct. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Tarlowski, </em>305 F.Supp. 112, 124 (E.D.N.Y.1969) (focusing on law enforcement\u2019s trickery in obtaining inculpatory information from a suspect; suppressing statement because federal agent deceived the accused into believing that he was the subject of civil litigation rather than a criminal investigation); <em>Alexander v. United States, </em>390 F.2d 101, 110 (5th Cir.1968) (recognizing that, \u201c[i]n order for the response to be free, the stimulus must be devoid of mendacity.\u201d), <em>appeal after remand, </em>431 F.2d 83 (5th Cir.1970); <em>United States v. LaVallee, </em>285 F.Supp. 233, 239 (S.D.N.Y.1968) (finding that prosecutor\u2019s deception was decisive factor that \u201ctip[ped] the scales against the State\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>417 F.2d 411 (2d Cir.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Nevertheless, the use of trickery to encourage a suspect to confess is not inherently unlawful. <em>See Frazier v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 739, 89 S.Ct. 1420, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969). Thus, the use of deception does not <em>compel </em>suppression, any more than would the use of promises, threats, or inducements, although it is certainly a factor in regard to voluntariness. As the Court indicated in <em>Ball, </em>347 Md. 156, 699 A.2d 1170, trickery and deception are ordinarily regarded as legitimate investigative techniques. There, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">A person who has committed an illegal act [ ] is not always eager to admit his or her wrongdoing. Police officers, charged with investigating crimes and bringing perpetrators to justice, are permitted to use a certain amount of subterfuge, when questioning an individual about his or her suspected involvement in a crime. As the Court of Special Appeals has observed, \u201c[deception short of an overbearing inducement is a \u2018valid weapon of the police arsenal.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\"><em>Ball, </em>347 Md. at 178, 699 A.2d 1170 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">In <em>West v. State, </em>124 Md.App. 147, 158, 720 A.2d 1253 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>353 Md. 270, 725 A.2d 1068 (1999), for example, we observed that the use of voice stress tests or lie detectors to produce a psychological effect on a suspect to obtain relevant facts does not, as a matter of law, require exclusion of a resulting statement. Rather, we looked to the totality of circumstances to determine if the defendant\u2019s will was overborne by aggressive police tactics. Similarly, we recently reiterated that the police may \u201cexaggerate the evidence they have accumulated against the person being interviewed,\u201d and they may tell a person that \u201che or she is only a witness, when, in fact, the person is a suspect.\u201d <em>Minehan v.

There, the defendant challenged police conduct during his interrogation, pointing to various lies by the police, such as false representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>tions that he had failed a polygraph, false assertions that there were eyewitnesses to the crime, and a bogus claim that his fingerprints were found at the crime scene. The Court recognized that \u201c \u2018the use of trickery by the misrepresentation to the accused of the evidence that the police possessed is ... within the ambit of ... \u201cother proper investigative efforts\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Moreover, the <em>Finke </em>Court found no constitutional significance in the difference between such assertions and the ploy of telling a suspect that an accomplice confessed, as sanctioned in <em>Hopkins v. State, </em>19 Md.App. 414, 311 A.2d 483 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>271 Md. 738 (1974). In <em>Hopkins, </em>this Court said: \u201cWe hold that the use of trickery by the misrepresentation to the accused of the evidence that the police possessed is, under the circumstances of this case, within the ambit of the \u2018other proper investigative efforts\u2019 recognized by <em>Escobedo [v. Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 311 A.2d 483 (footnote omitted). <em>See Rowe v. State, </em>41 Md.App. 641, 645, 398 A.2d 485 (\u201c[I]t is not unconstitutional to entice confessions deceptively\u201d; \u201cDeception short of an overbearing inducement is a \u2018valid weapon of the police arsenal\u2019 \u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>285 Md. 733 (1979); <em>Watkins v. State, </em>59 Md.App. 705, 718, 478 A.2d 326 (1984) (asserting that mere fact that officer\u2019s deceit motivated accused to make inculpatory statement did not render statement involuntary).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Decisions of courts in other jurisdictions suggest that the use of deception by the police during interrogation does not compel a finding of involuntariness. <em>See, e.g., Springer v. Commonwealth, </em>998 S.W.2d 439, 445-47 (Ky.1999) (finding that confession was not involuntary despite police ruse, in which police falsely used videotape to convince woman accused of murdering her husband that her calls had been monitored); <em>State v.

Houston, </em>941 F.Supp. 894, 902 (D.Neb.1995) (holding statement voluntary when officer pretended to be looking at autopsy report); <em>Swann v. State., </em>247 Va. 222, 441 S.E.2d 195, 202(Va.) (police officer\u2019s misrepresentation that \u201cRetinal Image Machine\u201d could reveal last image seen by victim did not invalidate confession), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 889, 115 S.Ct. 234, 130 L.Ed.2d 158 (1994); <em>State v.

In <em>Lewis v. State, </em>285 Md. 705, 722, 404 A.2d 1073 (1979), the Court of Appeals said that \u201cthere are limits to the type of police deception which will be tolerated without rendering a confession involuntary.\u201d More recently, in <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 305, 765 A.2d 97 (2001), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">While we permit the police to make appeals to the inner conscience of a suspect and use some amount of deception in an effort to obtain a suspect\u2019s confession ... when the police cross over the line and coerce confessions by using improper threats, promises, inducements, or psychological pressures, they risk loss of the fruits of their efforts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1r\"><em>Winder, </em>362 Md. 275, 765 A.2d 97, provides guidance to us. In that case, the defendant had been sentenced to death following convictions on three counts of first degree murder. On appeal, the defendant claimed that his confession was involuntary because it was obtained at the end of a twelve-hour interrogation conducted by four members of the State police, and \u201cwas the product of improper threats and promises made by the police----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306, 765 A.2d 97. The Court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>In analyzing the defendant\u2019s contentions, the Court in <em>Winder </em>\u201cgleaned\u201d a two-part test from <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. 145, 406 A.2d 415, with respect to inducement. <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 309, 765 A.2d 97. The Court stated that a confession is involuntary, and thus inadmissible, if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">1) a police officer ... promises or implies to a suspect that he or she will be given special consideration from a prosecuting authority or some other form of assistance in exchange for the suspect\u2019s confession, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">2) the suspect makes a confession in apparent reliance on the police officer\u2019s statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 151, 406 A.2d 415).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The <em>Winder </em>Court explained, at 362 Md. at 310, 765 A.2d 97: \u201cThe State shoulders the burden of establishing, by' a preponderance of the evidence, that the suspect\u2019s confession or inculpatory statement was not made in reliance on a promise or inducement made by a police officer or agent of the police.\u201d Then, it is the trial court\u2019s responsibility to determine whether a threat or inducement was made, and whether it had the \u25a0effect of actually influencing the defendant. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>348 Md. 337, 350, 703 A.2d 1267 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">As to the second prong, the <em>Winder </em>Court observed that, without reliance on the interrogator\u2019s comments, there is no fatal inducement. <em>Winder, </em>362 Md. at 309-10, 765 A.2d 97. The \u201csecond prong of the <em>Hillard </em>test triggers a causation analysis to determine whether there was a nexus between the promise or inducement and the accused\u2019s confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311, 765 A.2d 97. Applying the test to the facts and circumstances before it, the <em>Winder </em>Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s confession had been improperly induced by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Significantly, even if a confession is obtained by the police through the use of trickery or deception, <em>Winder </em>does not discard the totality of circumstances analysis in favor of a bright line or <em>per se </em>exclusionary rule. Indeed, in our view, the bright line test urged by appellant is at odds with the rationale of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis. Under the totality of circumstances analysis, the fake gun shot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>residue test was one factor, among many, relevant to volun-tariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Our factual recitation demonstrates that the motion court was presented with conflicting testimony from the police and the defense as to many important factors pertinent to the issue of voluntariness. In this regard, \u201c[w]eighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflicts in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact-finder.\u201d <em>Bayne v. State, </em>98 Md.App. 149, 155, 632 A.2d 476 (1993); <em>accord Marr v. State, </em>134 Md.App. 152, 178, 759 A.2d 327 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>362 Md. 623, 766 A.2d 147 (2001); <em>Hall v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 377, 393, 705 A.2d 50 (1998); <em>Hunter v. State, </em>110 Md.App. 144, 163, 676 A.2d 968 (1996). The court expressly credited the testimony of the detectives as to what transpired during the interrogation, as it was entitled to do. <em>See Grant v. State, </em>230 Md. 384, 386, 187 A.2d 319 (1963). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State as the prevailing party, we perceive no error in the trial court\u2019s factual findings or legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Appellant was not under arrest when she first arrived at the police station. She was promptly given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waived her rights. Moreover, she was not a novice to the criminal justice system; she had been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waived them earlier that year in an unrelated case. At the time in question, appellant was already in her mid-twenties and had completed one year of community college. Although appellant apparently was groggy when she first appeared at the police station, due to her medication, Detective Rhone\u2019s testimony indicated that her condition improved rather quickly. <em>See Hof, </em>337 Md. at 597, 655 A.2d 370 (\u201cAlthough being under the influence of narcotics does not automatically render a confession involuntary, it is certainly a factor to be considered....\u201d); <em>Hopkins, </em>19 Md.App. at 423, 311 A.2d 483 (\u201cA confession is not inadmissible as evidence merely because the accused is under the influence of a narcotic drug, although the condition of the accused is a factor to be considered.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Although appellant was in police custody for twenty-eight hours before she was brought before a commissioner, she confessed after about eighteen hours. Nor was she subjected to continuous interrogation for eighteen hours. In any event, the duration of the interrogation is not dispositive. We have recognized that the \u201csheer passage of time with repeated questioning ... is essential to the majority of [police] interviews.\u201d <em>West, </em>124 Md.App. at 158-59, 720 A.2d 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><em>Marr, </em>134 Md.App. 152, 759 A.2d 327, is instructive as to the length of the interrogation. There, the defendant was held for over thirty-five hours and, in that time, he was questioned for a total of fourteen hours. We concluded, however, that the statement was voluntary because \u201c[t]he tactics were not overbearing.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 759 A.2d 327. We noted that the defendant had been provided with food, drink, the opportunity to use the bathroom, and was not in any apparent discomfort. Similarly, appellant was questioned for a comparable amount of time, was offered food and water five times, and used the facilities four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In addition, although Whittington was interviewed by six police officers, only one officer was in the interview room with her at a time, except for one forty-five minute period when two officers were present. The officers testified that they did not threaten appellant, nor did they promise her anything to induce her to confess. Further, they were not wearing uniforms and did not wear their guns .in the interview room. They also claimed that appellant was handcuffed only after she had confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Significantly, the court found that appellant was not so exhaust\u00e9d at the time of the confession as to lose her ability to think. It based that finding on a comparison of appellant\u2019s first and last written statements. In the court\u2019s view, appellant\u2019s handwriting, sentence structure, and organization were as well-formed when she confessed as when she was first interviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">We also conclude that appellant failed to satisfy the second prong of <em>Winder. </em>Whittington has not referred us to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>portion of her testimony where she claimed, directly or indirectly, that she relied on police deception in making her confession. The evidence showed that the bogus scientific test was administered about three hours after appellant arrived at the police station. The confession did not occur for another fifteen hours. Thus, appellant\u2019s will was not overborne by the phony scientific test.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Like <em>Winder, Johnson v. State, </em>348 Md. 337, 703 A.2d 1267 (1998), underscores the importance of a temporal connection between the alleged improper inducement and the incriminating statement. There, the defendant was told that if he confessed to the crime, he might receive medical treatment instead of being \u201clocked up for the rest of [his] life and the key thrown down the sewer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 703 A.2d 1267. The Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court\u2019s determination that these statements were \u201cvery likely\u201d improper inducements. <em>Id. </em>at 350, 703 A.2d 1267. Nevertheless, the Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim of involuntariness, because three days elapsed between the time of the improper remarks and the incriminating statement, and the lapse demonstrated that the disputed statement was not induced by improper police conduct. <em>See also Stokes v. State, </em>289 Md. 155, 159-60, 423 A.2d 552 (1980) (concluding that defendant relied on a promise of help by the police because, after hearing the promise, he immediately revealed the location of the narcotics); <em>Ralph v. State, </em>226 Md. 480, 485, 174 A.2d 163 (1961) (concluding that defendant did not rely on inducement because eight hours elapsed between inducement and incriminating statement), <em>cert. denied, </em>369 U.S. 813, 82 S.Ct. 689, 7 L.Ed.2d 613 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The voluntariness of a confession requires fact-intensive analysis. Under the specific facts of this case, that analysis was conducted; we perceive no error in the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it admitted evidence at trial that she had failed a voice stress analysis test. The State responds that, under the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>stances of this case, the trial court properly exercised its discretion to admit the evidence to rebut Whittington\u2019s claim of coercion and her allegations of police misconduct, and to show \u201cthat the police were not being deceitful, as had been the case with the faked gun residue test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In <em>Smith v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 106, 119, 120, 355 A.2d 527 (1976), w\u00e9 held that evidence of the results of a voice stress test are inadmissible because the results are unreliable. We likened the voice stress test to a polygraph test, as both require operators to determine, based on human physiological responses, whether the subject is telling the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">It is well settled that neither evidence that a polygraph test was taken nor the results of the test are admissible in a criminal proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Guesfeird v. State, </em>300 Md. 653, 658-59, 480 A.2d 800 (1984). Indeed, the mere mention of the words \u201cpolygraph test\u201d is regarded as so damaging in a criminal prosecution that it has been referred to as a \u201cpariah.\u201d <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 275, 604 A.2d 489 (1992). We continue to adhere to the view that because a VSA test is akin to a lie detector test, the law regarding the admissibility of polygraphs applies equally to a VSA test. <em>See </em>Thomas R. Malia, Annotation, <em>Admissibility of Voice Stress Evaluation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number><em>Test Results or of Statements Made During Test, </em>47 A.L.R.4th 1202,1205-06 (1986, 2001 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Nonetheless, a limited exception to the rule barring admissibility arises when the voluntariness of a confession is an issue at trial and the test administration is relevant to voluntariness. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 513, 495 A.2d 1 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1986); <em>Murphy v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 803, 311\u2014 12, 659 A.2d 384 (1995); <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 347, 353, 443 A.2d 651, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 915, 103 S.Ct. 227, 74 L.Ed.2d 180 (1982). This is because in determining the voluntariness of a confession, the jury is entitled to have before it all of the evidence relevant to the issue. <em>Mitchell, </em>51 Md.App. at 350-51, 443 A.2d 651. In this regard, a polygraph test is considered \u201cno different than any \u2018other potentially coercive condition, person or device present during interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murphy, </em>105 Md.App. at 311, 659 A.2d 384 <em>(quoting Johnson v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 303, 309, 355 A.2d 504 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Although evidence of the administration of a polygraph test is admissible under limited circumstances, evidence of the <em>results </em>of the test, or the accused\u2019s refusal to take the test, is generally considered prejudicial and inadmissible. <em>Johnson, </em>31 Md.App. at 307-08, 355 A.2d 504. We have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">We foresee very few circumstances under which the \u201cresults\u201d of a polygraph test would ever be admissible. The potential for prejudice resulting from the jury knowing whether a defendant passed or failed a polygraph test would far outweigh any probative value that such evidence might have in determining the voluntariness or involuntariness of a subsequently or previously obtained confession. While the \u201cfact\u201d that the test was taken may be relevant under some circumstances to the voluntariness of a confession, the actual results of the test would ordinarily have very little, if any, such relevance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-8\"><em>Murphy, </em>105 Md.App. at 315-16, 659 A.2d 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">In this case, assuming that the claim of error is preserved, we are satisfied that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>' At the outset of trial, the court agreed with the parties that evidence as to the VSA test is generally inadmissible. On the second day of trial, before the jury was reconvened, the parties discussed the VSA test. Appellant sought admission in evidence of the fact that she took the test, because she believed it would show psychological coercion that induced her confession. On the other hand, she did not want the actual test results admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The State argued that \u201cthe results are going to have to come out,\u201d because \u201chow can it be coercive if she said she passed it?\u201d The court agreed with the State, saying: \u201cIt really can\u2019t be coercive unless they told her she flunked it.\u201d The court added: \u201cI think what\u2019s important is what was communicated to her.\u201d The court then said: \u201cI will tell them [i.e., the jury] this evidence is not admissible as to the truth of the test results, whatever they may be. It is only admissible to weigh the voluntariness of the statement. Let\u2019s wait until it comes up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Detective Rhone was questioned by the State about the interrogation of appellant. On cross-examination, appellant elicited from the detective the specifics regarding the interrogation. At the bench, defense counsel acknowledged: \u201cI opened the door. I know the door is opened.\u201d The court then discussed what it would tell the jury about the VSA, to which defense counsel said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Do you want to do it now?\u201d The Court indicated, \u201cRight\u201d and defense counsel responded, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The court then admonished the jury as to the limited purpose for which the VSA test was admissible. In the first of four separate cautionary instructions, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">Ladies and gentlemen, at this point, let me just tell you this. One of the facts ultimately you must find is whether or not the statements of [appellant] were voluntary. You\u2019re about to hear evidence of a voice stress analysis test. This test has been determined to be scientifically unreliable and the results are not admissible in evidence because they are not reliable results. You may consider the circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>test only as a factor in determining whether or not the statements given to the police by [appellant] were voluntary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Detective Rhone then testified that Sergeant Clark administered a VSA test to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">On direct examination, Sergeant Clark testified as to how he administered the VSA test to appellant. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">The voice stress test is a microphone that you speak into. There are several questions that you ask. This particular test she was given twice. There are nine questions that was [sic] asked of her. Two questions pertaining to does she know anything regarding the murder of Mr. Whittington, or did she suspect who was involved in that particular murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">At that point, the trial court, <em>sua sponte, </em>reiterated to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">All right.... [L]et me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that the evidence is admissible only for a limited purpose, for determining whether or not the statements were voluntary. It is not admissible for the truth of what it alleges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Thereafter, the State showed Sergeant Clark the \u201cvoice stress analysis test information sheet,\u201d which contained a list of the questions asked of appellant and the results. Sergeant Clark testified that he explained to appellant how the test would be administered and then he gave her the test. The State then asked Sergeant Clark the results of the VSA test. At that point, defense counsel objected. A bench conference ensued, at which the following discussion occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-11\">THE COURT: I think really \u2014 is he the one who communicated it to [appellant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-12\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Yes. He is the actual one who took the test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-13\">THE COURT: I understand, but if it\u2019s admissible just as to the fact as to its\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-14\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-15\">THE COURT: Then I have no problem with that. I\u2019ll admit it over your objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>[THE PROSECUTOR]: So to be clear, he took the test, she showed deception, and he communicated that to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">THE COURT: That\u2019s exactly right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">Upon counsel\u2019s return to the trial tables, the following colloquy transpired:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: Now, Detective Clark, you conducted the test with [appellant]; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">[THE WITNESS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: <em>And what were the results of that test?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">[THE WITNESS]: <em>It indicated that she was lying about the questions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-11\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: And did you communicate that information to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-12\">[THE WITNESS]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-13\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: And what was her response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-14\">[THE WITNESS]: She continued to deny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-15\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: And what occurred after this? [THE WITNESS]: Right after that, I briefed Detective Rhone of my findings, and that was the last contact I had with [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-16\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-17\">Appellant\u2019s attorney then cross-examined Sergeant Clark, eliciting, among other things, that the test was not reliable \u201cfor purposes of proving anything in a court of law against a person.\u201d Rather, it is used as a tool of confrontation by the police. Further, Clark explained that he discussed the test results with appellant, and she continued to deny any involvement in her husband\u2019s murder. The sergeant then formulated two questions relating to the murder of appellant\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-18\">On redirect, over appellant\u2019s objection, the State was permitted to elicit all nine questions asked of appellant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>conclusion of Sergeant Clark\u2019s testimony, the trial court once again instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">Ladies and gentlemen, just for one, one last time. That last witness you heard was a very limited admissibility witness. That test is not reliable so, obviously, you can\u2019t infer anything from the results of a non-reliable test. So it is not being introduced for the truth of the matter or proof of guilt or innocence. It\u2019s just a factor you may consider when you determine whether or not you believe the statements that were given by [appellant] were voluntary or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">At the close of all the evidence, the trial court admonished the jury for the fourth time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">This is just a reminder, Madam Foreman. You heard evidence during the course of this trial of the voice stress analysis test. Once again, that test has been determined to be scientifically unreliable and the results are not admissible in evidence because they simply are not reliable. You can consider the circumstances of that test only as a factor in determining whether or not the statements were voluntary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARS\">As we noted, the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s confession was sharply contested at trial. Therefore, appellant was entitled to introduce evidence that she took a VSA test, in an effort to show that her confession was involuntary because she was subjected to psychological stress at the time she confessed. This does not mean, however, that the State was allowed to show that appellant failed the VSA test. Given that there was no claim of deceit as to the use of the VSA test, the test results were not relevant to establish the absence of police deception. Nor did defense counsel open the door, merely because he sought to introduce evidence that the VSA test was administered. We agree with appellant that she \u201cdid not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>inject any evidence which made \u2018relevant\u2019 the actual outcome of an unreliable lie detector test.\u201d It follows that the court erred in admitting the results of the VSA test.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">We must next determine whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Under the particular circumstances attendant here, we hold that the error was harmless. We explain.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">In Maryland, when error has been established, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent view of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\"><em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976)(footnote omitted). But, a defendant is not required to prove that the error did not contribute to the verdict. Instead, the question is whether the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">As we have seen, the court carefully admonished the jury on four separate occasions, instructing it to consider the VSA test only as to the issue of the voluntariness of the statements. Further, the court told the jury that the test was not scientifically reliable. A jury is presumed to understand and follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>See Veney v. State, </em>251 Md. 182, 198, 246 A.2d 568 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 948, 89 S.Ct. 1284, 22 L.Ed.2d 482 (1969); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>136 Md.App. 27, 72, 764 A.2d 284 (2000), <em>rev\u2019d. on other grounds, </em>370 Md. 191, 803 A.2d 1034 (2002). Indeed, in <em>State v. Moulden, </em>292 Md. 666, 678, 441 A.2d 699 (1982), the Court of Appeals said: \u201c[0]ur legal system necessarily proceeds upon the assumption that jurors will follow the trial judge\u2019s instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>There are, of eourse, situations when \u201cthe risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.\u201d <em>Rainville v. State, </em>328 Md. 398, 411, 614 A.2d 949 (1992) (citing <em>Bruton v. U.S., </em>391 U.S. 123, 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968)). This is not such a case, however. Significantly, in addition to the repeated and clear cautionary instructions of the court, it was undisputed at trial that appellant shot her husband. Relying on a defense of spousal abuse and the battered wife syndrome, appellant testified in her own defense, and recounted a long history of physical violence and verbal abuse by her husband that culminated in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In her testimony, appellant explained that her husband had threatened her so many times with a gun that she finally decided to \u201cbuy one of [her] own.\u201d She added that she bought the gun because she was \u201cafraid,\u201d stating: \u201cI was tired of him pulling a gun on me, and I didn\u2019t have none for myself. I wanted it for protection in case I needed it.\u201d Further, appellant recalled that, on the morning of the incident, her husband made her drive him to work. She related that, to her surprise, her husband had discovered her gun and questioned her about it. Appellant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">And I said, I don\u2019t know what you are talking about. And that\u2019s when he choked me and pulled it out from somewhere \u2014 I don\u2019t know where it came from \u2014 and he was holding it to my head. And he told me how much he hated me, how much I messed up his life. He called me a bitch and told me I know how to fuck up a morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">He was still cussing me out and fussing at me. And the next thing I know, all I remember is him turning around laughing. I don\u2019t even know how I got it in my hands. And I heard it go off, and I saw him fall....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you realize what had happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Had you planned on doing this? [APPELLANT]: No. I didn\u2019t want anything like that to happen. I just wanted him to leave me alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In view of the foregoing, we are satisfied that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in ruling that her expert witness, a board-certified expert psychiatrist, could not testify at trial to the issue of whether her confession was voluntary. Her argument is not preserved for review. Even if it had been, we would find it without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">The issue was first raised by the prosecutor at the close of the suppression hearing, when she inquired about the admission of Dr. Brody\u2019s testimony. Underscoring that its ruling was tentative, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">Now, the other issue I think we can leave and we don\u2019t have to really reach today until we see that, is in what form he can express his opinion. I don\u2019t necessarily \u2014 and I\u2019m willing to be convinced otherwise, I don\u2019t think a forensic \u2014 I agree with Dr. Phillips, a forensic psychiatrist does not express that opinion. He expresses it in the way that Dr. Phillips does, whether someone has the capacity or not. You can\u2019t say I looked at the statement, it wasn\u2019t voluntary. You can say I\u2019ve examined this person and that person lacked the capacity to make a voluntary statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">So his testimony today was, it was a little broader than I think it should be in front of the jury, but we don\u2019t have to discuss that right now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">At trial, appellant called Dr. Brody as her last witness. After he was admitted as an expert in psychiatry, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>asked to approach the bench. At the ensuing bench conference, the following conversation occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I just want to bring up when we had this little issue in motions as to \u2014 I mean, when we get to it, his opinion as to \u2014 I\u2019m not exactly sure what his opinion is going to be, but I remember specifically in motions as to post-traumatic stress disorder, the voluntariness of the statement. I just want to put my objection on right now as to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">THE COURT: Okay. Are you going to get into that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Tangently. Really, I\u2019m using\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axs\">THE COURT: Because I believe the State is correct. Whether or not a statement is involuntary is a legal opinion, not a medical opinion, and it really exceeds his expertise to say that. But he can certainly have an opinion on any capacity to understand or what not. But he just can\u2019t say fiat out, in my opinion, it was involuntary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I was only going to touch on that tangently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The parties returned to the trial tables. Dr. Brody then testified about the battered wife syndrome. He also testified as to his two meetings with appellant. He opined that, based on his examination of appellant, she suffered from battered wife syndrome at the time of her husband\u2019s murder. Dr. Brody did not testify about the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Appellant never disputed the trial court\u2019s understanding of the scope of Dr. Brody\u2019s expert testimony. Appellant intended to elicit from Dr. Brody, and did elicit, that she was suffering from depression and battered spouse syndrome at the time of the occurrence. Because appellant never objected to the court\u2019s ruling, and acquiesced to it, ,her complaint cannot be heard on appeal. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131 (a); <em>Gilliam v. State, </em>331 Md. 651, 691, 629 A.2d 685 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1077, 114 S.Ct. 891, 127 L.Ed.2d 84 (1994)(\u201cAs Gilliam did not object to the course of action proposed by the prosecution and taken by the court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>apparently indicated his agreement with it, he cannot now be heard to complain that the trial court\u2019s action was wrong.\u201d). <em>See also Wilson v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 510, 526, 752 A.2d 1250 (2000) (stating that \u201cthe issue is not preserved for appellate review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In any event, the court\u2019s ruling comported with pertinent case law. <em>See generally </em>Md. Rule 5-702; <em>Sippio v. State, </em>350 Md. 633, 714 A.2d 864 (1998). \u201cIt is well settled that a psychiatrist may not opine \u2018concerning the defendant\u2019s actual intent at the time of an offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 269, 786 A.2d 706 (2001) (quoting <em>Hartless v. State, </em>327 Md. 558, 611 A.2d 581 (1992)). The Court of Appeals reasoned in <em>Hartless </em>that \u201cpsychiatrists have not been shown to have the ability to precisely reconstruct the emotions of a person at a specific time, and thus ordinarily are not competent to express an opinion as to the belief or intent which a person in fact harbored at a particular time.\u201d <em>Hartless, </em>327 Md. at 573, 611 A.2d 581. <em>Accord State v. Martin, </em>329 Md. 351, 366, 619 A.2d 992 (discussing distinction explored in <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988), between testimony about mental state at particular time and psychological profile that is consistent with particular mental state), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 855, 114 S.Ct. 161, 126 L.Ed.2d 122 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Relying on <em>Simmons, </em>we reiterated in <em>White v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 535, 790 A.2d 754 (2002), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aev-dedup-0\">\u201cexpert [testimony] that the defendant was <em>in fact </em>suffering from a specific psychiatric disorder on the date in question, is inadmissible as a matter of law because it usurps the jury\u2019s function and because a psychiatrist \u2018cannot precisely reconstruct the emotions of a person at a specific time.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK-\"><em>Id. </em>at 545, 790 A.2d 754 (quoting <em>Simmons, </em>313 Md. at 48, 542 A.2d 1258). <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-702.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Appellant relies on <em>Finke v. State, supra, </em>56 Md.App. 450, 468 A.2d 353, for the proposition that expert psychiatric testimony regarding the voluntariness of a confession is admissible. In <em>Finke, </em>this Court affirmed that expert testimony regarding a defendant\u2019s ability to make free and intelligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>decisions at the time of his arrest is generally admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 498-99, 468 A.2d 353. Later, in the discussion of the propriety of a hypothetical question, the Court stated: \u201cOne of the principal reasons given by the court in sustaining the State\u2019s objection to the hypothetical question was that [the doctor] was being asked to render an opinion on the ultimate issue before the jury \u2014 voluntariness of the accused\u2019s inculpa-tory statement \u2014 without ever having examined the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501-02, 468 A.2d 353. Thus, <em>Finke </em>does not support the proposition for which appellant cited it.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Moreover, \u201c[i]t is well settled that \u2018the admissibility of expert testimony is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial court, and its action in admitting or excluding such testimony will seldom constitute a ground for reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 659, 612 A.2d 258 (1992) (quoting <em>Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 350, 473 A.2d 903, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 900, 105 S.Ct. 276, 83 L.Ed.2d 212 (1984)), cert. <em>denied, </em>507 U.S. 931, 113 S.Ct. 1312, 122 L.Ed.2d 700 (1993); <em>accord Wise v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 127, 135, 751 A.2d 24 (reaffirming trial judge\u2019s broad discretion as to admissibility of expert testimony and observing that judge\u2019s decision in this regard rarely serves as grounds for reversal), cert. <em>denied, </em>360 Md. 276, 757 A.2d 811 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Here, the court permitted a full exploration of Dr. Brody\u2019s opinion regarding Whittington\u2019s general psychological profile and condition as it related to the voluntariness issue. But, expert testimony that Whittington\u2019s confession was, in fact, involuntary would have constituted testimony regarding appellant\u2019s state of mind at a particular point in time. The court properly precluded such testimony. In doing so, the court neither erred nor abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\">. The advice of rights form advised appellant that she had the right to remain silent; that anything she said could be used against her in court; she had the right to talk to a lawyer before she was asked any questions and to have a lawyer present during questioning; if she could not afford a lawyer and wanted one, a lawyer would be provided at no cost to her; and she had the right to stop the questioning at any time. Appellant checked the box and placed her initials next to the following statements: she understood each right; she wanted to make a statement without a lawyer; she had not been promised anything or threatened; and she was not under the influence of any substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">. Appellant does not complain about the delay in being brought before a police commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\">. As we noted, at the motion hearing the defense did not rely on a claim of deceptive police conduct based on bogus scientific testing. Instead, defense counsel complained about various aspects of the interrogation, including the length of the interrogation and appellant\u2019s sleep deprivation. The defense also pointed to appellant\u2019s mental state. When appellant was asked at the hearing why she eventually wrote what she was told by Detective Frankenfield, she testified: \u201cI was tired and fed up. One came in with a gun. What's next? I was tired.\u201d Similarly, asked why she wrote the portion of the statement describing the \u2018\u2018incident,\u201d appellant said: \u2018\u2018Because I just wanted to go home and go to sleep. I just wanted to leave. They told me I could leave if I just wrote this one last thing. They told me I could go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">In any event, the State does not argue lack of preservation with respect to appellant\u2019s claim on appeal about police deception. Nor does the State suggest that any portion of appellant\u2019s interview at the police station was non-custodial. Therefore, we shall assume that the issue of coercion based on police deception is properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\">. Because appellant does not contend that the police failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), we shall not address that matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\">. In <em>Murphy v.

The distinction is that polygraphy, albeit based on scientific theory, remains an art with unusual responsibility placed on the examiner. The acquainting of the examiner with the subject matter is often a source of improper suggestion, conscious or subconscious. The preparation of the test and discussion with the examinee of the polygraph procedure furnishes additional opportunity for improper subjective evaluation. The construction of the examination further proliferates controversy, for while experts may agree that a particular examination was inconclusive, they often do so for different reasons.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b554-19\">.
