Dale Lucas (the \u201cappellant\u201d) appeals the Circuit Court for Baltimore County\u2019s decision affirming a determination by the Baltimore County Board of Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d) that the proposed use did not meet the definition of an airport.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He presents the following questions for our review:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>I.

We address the remaining questions in the interest of completeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The Lucas property (\u201cHelmore Farm\u201d) is in the Greenspr-ing Valley area of Baltimore County, which borders Baltimore City. It is bordered by Greenspring Valley Road to the north, Hillside Valley Road to the south, Falls Road to the east, and the property of appellee Susan Immelt to the west. The property is located north of the intersection of 1-83 and the Baltimore Beltway.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Helmore Farm is an eighty-seven-acre tract on which thoroughbred horses are bred, raised, and trained. In addition, the farm acts as a quasi-hospital where thoroughbred horses are \u201claid up\u201d during their rehabilitation process. On the property are two primary residences, several tenant dwellings, stables, and outbuildings. It is located within a National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Register Historic District and participates in Baltimore County\u2019s agricultural preservation program.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Helmore Farm, for the most part, is zoned \u201cResource Conservation \u2014 Agriculture,\u201d the R.C. 2 zone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The purpose of an R.C. 2 district is \u201cto foster conditions favorable to a continued agricultural use of the productive agricultural areas of Baltimore County by preventing incompatible forms and degrees of urban uses.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> BCZR 1A01.1B.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Aircraft have operated,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in connection with the thoroughbred business, in and out of Helmore Farm since 1956. In 1997, Edgar Lucas constructed a helicopter landing pad, in a fenced-in area, on the southwestern edge of the property, approximately twenty-three feet from the property of appellee Susan Immelt. The helicopter landing site also included a windsock, perimeter lights, a guidance beam, and an all-weather observation system. The landing pad is partially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>paved and its dimensions are approximately 165 feet by 172 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In 1998, Martin Grass, Chairman of the Rite-Aid Corporation, and part owner of the thoroughbred business at Helmore Farm, commuted by helicopter from Helmore Farm to his office in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The helicopter activity caused citizen opposition and led Edgar Lucas to file a petition with the Baltimore County Zoning Commission for a special exception for operation of a landing area for both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft at Helmore Farm. The proposed facility would consist of the existing helicopter landing pad, in addition to a separate landing strip, approximately 200 feet wide by 1,200 feet long, for fixed-wing aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Edgar Lucas filed a petition, with the Baltimore County Deputy Zoning Commission, for approval of an airport and/or helicopter operation on Helmore Farm as a legal, nonconforming use.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the alternative, he sought a special exception for an airport, pursuant to BCZR Section 1A01.2.C.1.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>A hearing took place before the Deputy Zoning Commissioner for Baltimore County (\u201cDeputy Commissioner\u201d), which highlighted the proposed use of the facility. Appellees appeared in opposition to Edgar Lucas\u2019s request for the special exception. Edgar Lucas was the only witness called to testify regarding the past usage of Helmore Farm for the landing and taking-off of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. The Deputy Commissioner denied his request for approval of a legal nonconforming use, concluding that his testimony was insufficient to establish the requisite prior existence of an airport or helicopter operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The Deputy Commissioner, however, approved the special exception. He based his decision on testimony and evidence presented both in support of and in opposition to Edgar Lucas\u2019s petition, his site visit to observe the arrival and departure of a helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft, and the inclusion of \u201chelicopters\u201d in the dictionary definition of the word \u201caircraft.\u201d The special exception, however, included several restrictions and conditions to ensure no intensified use of the facility would occur.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>People\u2019s Counsel appealed the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s decision to the Board. The Board considered two questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">1. Is the site an airport permitted within the R.C. 2 zone; and, if so, are helipads and helistops permitted uses -within the meaning and definition of an \u201cairport\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">2. Based on the weight of the testimony and evidence submitted at the hearings, has the Appellant met his burden that the use proposed does not produce any \u201cadverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with such special exception uses irrespective of its location in the zone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">On February 25, 2000, the Board issued its opinion, stating: Since 1979, there have been significant amendments to other [provisions in] R.C. 2 zones, but no further amendments to the provisions relative to \u201cairports,\u201d \u201cairstrips,\u201d and helicopter uses. So, at the present time, under current BCZR regulations, we have the present status concerning where certain facilities are permitted by special exception and by right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">By special exception:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">Airport : R.C. 2, R.C. 3, D.R. 1,[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] B.R.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">Airstrip : M.L.R.,[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>J M.L.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Heliport, I : B.M.,[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] B.R.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKS\">Heliport, II : B.L.,t<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] B.M., B.R., M.L.R.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASh\">Helistop R.C. 3, D.R. zones</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtS\">By right:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJj\">Airport None</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKU\">Airstrip None</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ_\">Heliport, I : M.L., M.H.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOO\">Heliport, II : M.R.,[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] M.L.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ao-dedup-0\">Helistop B.L., B.M., B.R., M.R., M.L.R.; M.L., M.H.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">The Board went on to note that \u201ccertain helicopter operations are permitted as provided by Section 420 of the BCZR.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Board concluded that the R.C. 2 zone permits an \u201cairport\u201d by special exception, but prohibits \u201cheliports,\u201d \u201chelistops,\u201d or \u201cairstrips.\u201d Accordingly, the Board denied Edgar Lucas\u2019s petition for either approval of an airport and/or helistop operation as a legal nonconforming use or for a special exception for an airport pursuant to BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2.C.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-17\">The Board determined that the definition of \u201cairstrip\u201d would not include helicopter operations and that a special exception would not permit the uses proposed at Helmore Farm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-18\">While the BCZR describes an airport as \u201cany area of land or water designated and set aside for landing or taking off of aircraft,\u201d and a helicopter fits the definition of \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>rotary aircraft,\u201d nevertheless ... the legislative history and intent of the uses permitted by special exception in R.C. 2 zone[s] clearly precludes such uses by helicopters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">Had the County Council not sought to specifically separate and define helicopter uses in various zones, this Board might believe differently, and in so doing, adopt the Appellant\u2019s belief that the interpretation of an \u201cairport\u201d includes \u201cheliport or helistop.\u201d That however, is not the case. Clearly the Legislative Council of Baltimore County had very narrowly addressed helicopters and uses within the various zones. '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In the alternative, assuming that helicopter operations were included in the definition of \u201cairport,\u201d the Board examined whether appellant met his burden concerning the \u201cimpact\u201d factors required pursuant to BCZR 502.1 and in <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981). In reaching that determination, the Board used the following standard: \u201cThe question is one of whether or not the adverse effects are greater at the proposed site than they would be elsewhere in the County where they may be established, i.e., the other areas within the R.C. 2 zones.\u201d The Board noted that it believed that \u201cthe appellant has the burden of establishing that the impact factor caused by the proposed use is not greater at the site than the same use elsewhere in the zone (R.C. 2 zone).\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">The Board concluded that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">the impact upon the National Historic District would be greater in the Greenspring Valley than if located in other northern areas of the R.C. 2 zones. Relying considerably on the expertise of [expert witnesses] Messrs. Dillon, Solomon and Gerber, there are individual areas in the Northern part of the county that would be less impacted than at the present site. The Board concludes that it is not a matter of finding a better site for the proposed use in the R.C. 2 zone, but rather the question is one of total impact; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Board concludes that the Appellants have not established that fact by the preponderance of the evidence to the Board\u2019s satisfaction. Acknowledging that airports and helicopter uses have inherent negative impacts, the detrimental effects upon the smaller Greenspring Valley district would clearly have a greater negative impact than if located elsewhere in the vast acreage constituting the R.C. 2 zone of Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">A timely petition for judicial review was filed by appellant. On September 28, 2000, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County held a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The first issue before the circuit court was whether the Board erred in its determination that the proposed use did not constitute an airport. The court held that \u201can airport does not include a heliport or helistop and the proposed use is not an \u2018airport,\u2019 therefore it is not a permitted use in an R.C. 2 zone, and the Board\u2019s conclusion was reasonably based upon the facts proven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The second issue before the circuit court was whether the Board erred as a matter of law by utilizing an incorrect interpretation of the special exception standard. Although the court thought it unnecessary to address this question, based on its finding on the first question, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s determination regarding the adverse impact that would have been caused if the special exception had been granted. On March 20, 2001, the court issued its memorandum and order affirming the Board\u2019s decision. Appellant then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">In <em>Eastern Outdoor Adver. Co. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>128 Md.App. 494, 514-15, 739 A.2d 854 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 Md. 163, 747 A.2d 644 (2000), we set out the applicable standard for reviewing the decision of an administrative agency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">[Cjourts recognize two standards of review of a decision of a zoning board: one for the board\u2019s conclusions of law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>another for the board\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of mixed questions of law and fact. When reviewing the board\u2019s legal conclusions, the court \u201cmust determine whether the agency interpreted and applied the correct principles of law governing the case and no deference is given to a decision based solely on an error of law.\u201d When reviewing findings of fact and conclusions regarding mixed questions, however, [we] \u201ccannot substitute [our] judgment for that of the agency and must accept the agency\u2019s conclusions if they are based on substantial evidence and if reasoning minds could reach the same conclusion based on the record.\u201d If a court finds no substantial or sufficient evidence to support the factual findings of the Board, the Board\u2019s decision will be reversed because it was arbitrary and illegal.

Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>146 Md.App. 283, 299-302, 807 A.2d 49 (2002) <em>(\u201cEastern Outdoor </em>17\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The substantial evidence test is an \u201cassessment of whether the record before the Board contained at least \u2018a little more than a scintilla of evidence\u2019 to support the Board\u2019s scrutinized action.\u201d <em>Friends of the Ridge v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>120 Md.App. 444, 466, 707 A.2d 866 (1998), <em>vacated in part, </em>352 Md. 645, 724 A.2d 34 (1999) (citation omitted). The existence of such substantial evidence \u201cpushes the Board\u2019s decision into the unassailable realm of a judgment call, one for which we may not substitute our own exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Friends of the Ridge, </em>120 Md.App. at 466, 707 A.2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Because we repeat the reviewing task of the circuit court, this Court reevaluates, under the same standards, the decision of the agency, not that of the circuit court. <em>Carnage Hill-Cabin John, Inc. v. Maryland Health Resources Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>125 Md.App. 183, 211, 724 A.2d 745 (1999). The Court of Appeals has set out the applicable standard of review of the grant or denial of a special exception use:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALU\">The special exception use is a part of the comprehensive zoning plan sharing the presumption that, as such, it is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the interest of the general welfare, and therefore, valid. The special exception use is a valid zoning mechanism that delegates to an administrative board a limited authority to allow enumerated uses which the legislature has determined to be permissible <em>absent any fact or circumstance negating the presumption. </em>The duties given the Board are to judge whether the <em>neighboring properties in the general neighborhood would be adversely affected </em>and whether the use in the particular case is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">Whereas, the applicant has the burden of adducing testimony which will show that his use meets the prescribed standards and requirements, he does not have the burden of establishing affirmatively that his proposed use would be a benefit to the community. If he shows to the satisfaction of the Board that the proposed use would be conducted without real detriment to the neighborhood and would not actually adversely affect the public interest, he has met his burden. The extent of any harm or disturbance to the neighboring area and uses is, of course, material. If the evidence makes the question of harm or disturbance or the question of the disruption of the harmony of the comprehensive plan of zoning fairly debatable, the matter is one for the Board to decide. But if there is no probative evidence of harm or disturbance in light of the nature of the zone involved or of factors causing disharmony to the operation of the comprehensive plan, a denial of an application for a special exception use is arbitrary, capricious, and illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\"><em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 11, 432 A.2d 1319 (citations omitted; emphasis in original); see also <em>Eastern Outdoor II, </em>307-09, 807 A.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">III.

So it would include the facilities to land a plane and to service a plane, and service the passengers that are involved with that airport, so it could be a very large airport, it could be a small airport, it could be simply fixed-wing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Norman E. Gerber, accepted without objection as an expert in the field of zoning and land use planning, testified that the operation proposed at Helmore Farm describes an \u201cairfield,\u201d not an \u201cairport.\u201d Gerber based his opinion on the fact that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqI\">the only two places that airstrips show up in the zoning regulations are in the ML zone and by virtue of including ML zones in the MH zone, and they were thought to be the kinds of areas where they could be paved, but didn\u2019t have to be.

There are facilities to care for potential passengers, or maybe even cargo. I haven\u2019t heard any real discussion of those kind of facilities being proposed to be placed here.

There is one on Back River Neck, which has been there for some time. And there\u2019s one out, which can be seen as you drive up 1-95, just before you enter into Harford County, I guess. To my knowledge, they are the only airports left operating in Baltimore County as an airport.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">Then, Martin Airport is much bigger than the other two. They have a wide variety of the kinds of facilities I am talking about at each of those.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">But, to me, I believe that\u2019s how zoning regulations views an airport and how that views an airstrip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">I believe that\u2019s perfectly consistent with the way the RC 2 zones were developed, because one would not expect to see a lot of airports in Baltimore County, even in 1969, '70, '71, '72, and '79, probably even less so today, based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>demand; the fact the Martin Airport has taken up a great deal of whatever void was thought to have been in Baltimore County in those other decades.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">On the other hand, an airstrip could normally be expected to be found at a lot of locations in terms of the kind of use. So far, they have only been permitted in the ML and MH zones in Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">If the Baltimore County zoning regulations hadn\u2019t gone to such great length to provide for helicopter operations, heliports, type I and heliport type II and helistops, and listed them specifically within zones, I would think that, in other words, if it was silent insofar as distinguishing between helicopter type operations and airports, then perhaps [helicopter use at an airport] would be correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">But that\u2019s not the case here. Baltimore County, through its zoning regulations, chose to further define aircraft operation and talk about, at great length, helicopters, and whether they are to be permitted or not permitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">And, as has been pointed out earlier today, but, again, for instance, airports are permitted by special exception in the RC 2. No helicopter type operation is permitted as of right except the Section 420 which is basically set up for special uses, emergencies, that sort of thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">They are not permitted. They are not listed a being permitted. I believe further evidence, that it was clear that the regulations intended not to permit helicopter operations in RC 2. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">The Board stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">Considerable weight attaches to the testimony of Mr. Paul Solomon and Norman Gerber as to the characteristics typically found in an airport use: Solomon: (1) strip or strips to land an aircraft: (2) gas tanks; (3) support facilities; (4) hangers, gas tanks, diesel tanks; (5) the facilities to land and to service a plane; (6) the facilities to service passengers; (7) parking lot (or lots); and (8) infrastructure by way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>of road access; Gerber: \u201cThe thing that comes closest to describing the kind of operation I [read about,] heard about (during the hearings), and I believe is the airstrip.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The Board determined that the \u201cR.C. 2 zone clearly precludes such uses by helicopters.\u201d The Board\u2019s conclusion was based on substantial evidence on the record and was one that reasoning minds could have reached. We are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that, because his facility would accommodate both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and does not fit into a more distinct use category related to helicopter facilities and helistops, it must, therefore, be considered an \u201cairport.\u201d The Board found that the proposed facility \u201ccannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be construed as an airport. It is obvious to the Board that there are distinctions between an \u2018airport\u2019 and an \u2018airstrip.\u2019 To permit continued use thereof as an airstrip is in direct violation of\u2019 the BCZR. The Board based it determination on the fact that an \u201cairstrip\u201d was not permitted in an R.C. 2 zone. BCZR \u00a7 102.1 reads: \u201c[n]o land shall be used or occupied and no building or structure shall be erected, altered, located, or used except in conformity with these regulations and this shall include any extension of a lawful nonconforming use.\u201d <em>See Kowalski v. Lamar, </em>25 Md. App. 493, 496, 334 A.2d 536 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In light of the legislative history, it is appropriate to view the specific designations of airstrip, helistop, and helipad as modifications of the general term \u201cairport,\u201d and creating distinct and separate uses for different levels of aircraft operations. The marriage of an airstrip with a helistop and helipad does not create an airport. We affirm the decision of the Board that the proposed use of Helmore Farm was not that of an airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Appellant has raised several other issues in this appeal, which, in light of our affirmance of the Board\u2019s decision that the proposed facility is not an airport for purposes of a special exception within the R.C. 2 zone, we need not reach for the purposes of deciding this case. Nevertheless, we shall address these issues for completeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>C. Helicopter Operations</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Based on his contention that his use is that of an airport, a contention rejected by the Board and us, appellant argues that the Board erred in ruling that the BCZR definition of an airport does not include helicopter operations. He argues that an \u201cairport\u201d permits the landing and taking off of \u201caircraft\u201d and that the dictionary definition of \u201caircraft\u201d includes helicopters. Again, appellees argue that the plain meaning of terms cannot be taken out of context. Therefore, they argue that the subsequent history related to heliports and helistops expressed a legislative intent to differentiate helicopter uses from airport uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">As we previously stated, to focus on one word in isolation would remove it from its context. Although appellant is correct in his assertion that a helicopter is a type of aircraft, the legislative history and BCZR\u2019s definitions expressly differentiate zones that permit helicopter operations. In fact, the regulations go' so far as to differentiate a type I and type II heliport and a helistop. Based on the amended BCZR, an R.C. <em>2 </em>zone permits a special exception for an \u201cairport,\u201d but expressly prohibits a special exception for an \u201cairstrip,\u201d \u201cheliport,\u201d or \u201chelistop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The use of helicopters in the R.C. 2 zone has been prohibited in the past. In 1989, Robert J. Smith, Case No. 90-1-SPHX, petitioned the Deputy Zoning Commissioner of Baltimore County for a special exception to use a helicopter in the R.C. 2 zone. The Deputy Zoning Commissioner relied on the legislative history regarding the distinction between airports and helicopter operations to conclude that the term \u201cairport\u201d was not broad enough in scope to provide the landing and take off of helicopters in the R.C. 2 zone. The Board in that case concluded that helicopter operations were \u201cclearly precluded\u201d uses within the R.C. 2 zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">To adopt appellant\u2019s general definition that an \u201cairport\u201d permits helicopter operations in the R.C. 2 zone would negate the specific zoning restrictions adopted by the Council regarding airports, helistops, and helipads and its prior intention not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>to permit helicopter operations in the R.C. 2 zone. <em>See Greco v. State, </em>347 Md. 423, 429, 701 A.2d 419 (1997); <em>see also Superior Builders, Inc. v. Brown, </em>208 Md. 539, 543, 119 A.2d 376 (1956) (\u201cThe Act should receive a practical construction, and should be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate its 'general purpose.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">We find only four zones in the BCZR that permit, by special exception or by right, the use of helicopters and an airport: the R.C. 3 (Resource Conservation \u2014 Deferral of Planning and Development); D.R. 1 (Density Residential, 1.0 dwelling unit per acre); B.R. (Business, Roadside); and M.L. (Manufacturing, Light) zones. Unlike the R.C. 2 zone, the R.C. 3 zone was never amended, and therefore permits as a special exception both \u201cairports\u201d and \u201chelistops.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 1A02.2B1.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Based on the BCZR\u2019s history of categorizing helicopter operations separately from airports, the Board\u2019s conclusion that the definition of \u201cairport\u201d does not include general helicopter operations is not wrong, as a matter of law, and was supported by substantial evidence. Therefore, the Board was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">D. Special Exception Standard</p>\n<p id=\"AIT\">i. Adverse Effect of the Proposed Airport</p>\n<p id=\"AtO\">Appellant argues that the Board \u201cidentified and applied an incorrect special exception standard.\u201d Specifically, he contends that the Board erred when it \u201cfailed to properly compare the effects of the proposed use to \u2018the effects normally inherent with such a use.\u2019 \u201d Instead, he argues, \u201cthe Board compared the adverse impacts of the proposed Helmore Farm airport at this location to the adverse impacts of the Helmore Farm airport elsewhere in the R.C. 2 zone.\u201d Appellees argue that appellant did not meet his burden of proving the facts required to satisfy the special exception standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">We begin by recognizing the inherent validity of special exception uses. <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 11, 432 A.2d 1319; <em>see Mossburg, </em>107 Md.App. at 7-8, 666 A.2d 1253. As we have stated, special exception uses are \u201cdesirable and necessary in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>... zoning planning provided certain standards are met.\u201d <em>Mossburg, </em>107 Md.App. at 7-8, 666 A.2d 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Schultz </em>established the standard by which the adverse effects of a special exception use are to be measured. Judge Davidson stated for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">We now hold that the appropriate standard to be used in determining whether a requested special exception use would have an adverse effect and, therefore, should be denied is whether there are facts and circumstances that show that the particular use proposed at the particular location proposed would have any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with such a special exception use irrespective of its location within the zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apo\"><em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 22-23, 432 A.2d 1319 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">This Court in <em>Hayfields, Inc. v. Valleys Planning Council, Inc., </em>122 Md.App. 616, 641, 716 A.2d 311 (1998), explained the standards established in <em>Schultz, swpra, </em>and <em>Mossburg, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoC\">In <em>Mossburg, </em>Judge Cathell for this Court provided an example of how to \u201coverlay\u201d the statutory conditions of a county\u2019s special exception law with the restrictions in <em>Schultz. </em>Based on the <em>Mossburg </em>example, we have added the limiting language of <em>Schultz </em>to BCZR \u00a7 502.1(a). The test becomes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">\u2014Before any Special Exception may be granted, it must appear that the use for which the Special Exception is requested will not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">a. Be [more] detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of the <em>locality </em>involved [than the effects normally inherent with such a use would be generally elsewhere in the zone]. [Citations omitted; bold added; italics in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\"><em>See Mossburg, </em>107 Md.App. at 21, 666 A.2d 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">In other words, the question is not whether the proposed facility will have some adverse effect on the Greenspring Valley area; it will because there are inherently detrimental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>effects associated with such facilities. The Board must determine whether the adverse effects of the special exceptions use in the particular location in which it is sought to be located would be greater or more detrimental than they would be generally at other locations within the R.C. 2 zone. Utilizing the standard as set out in <em>Schultz, </em>the Board determined that the \u201cquestion is one of whether or not the adverse effects are greater at the proposed site than they would be elsewhere in the County where they may be established, i.e., the other areas within the R.C. 2 zones.\u201d The Board noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">During the course of several hearing days, the Board heard an abundance and plethora of testimony from a number of acknowledged experts in the fields of aviation, airport planning, local planning, and general horse operations. Much of the testimony was conflicting and contradictory. The Board recognizes that the expert witness has become a standard component of the zoning hearing. Professional planners make frequent appearances on all zoning forums and are to be listened to carefully. However, in the final analysis, it is up to the Board to make a critical appraisal of such witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">Based on the testimony, evidence and weight assigned thereto, the Board has determined that the impact of the proposed facility at the subject site would be greater there than at any other location in the R.C. 2 zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">After issuing its holding, the Board reiterated its analysis of the special exception standard, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">The Board believes that the Appellant has the burden of establishing that the impact factor caused by the proposed use is no greater at the site than the same use elsewhere in the zone (R.C. 2 zone).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">To that end, the Board concludes that the impact upon the National Historical District would be greater in the Greenspring Valley than if located in other northern areas of the R.C. 2 zones. Relying considerably on the expertise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of Messrs. Dillon, Solomon and Gerber, there are individual areas in the Northern part of the county that would be less impacted than at the present site. The Board concludes that it is not a matter of finding a better site for the proposed use in the R.C. 2 zone, but rather the question is one of total impact; and the Board concludes that the Appellants have not established that fact by the preponderance of the evidence to the Board\u2019s satisfaction. Acknowl-' edging that airport and helicopter uses have inherent negative impacts, the detrimental effects \u2022 upon the smaller Greenspring Valley district would clearly have a greater negative impact than if located elsewhere in the vast acreage constituting the R.C. 2 zone of Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8h\">The Board obviously assigned considerable weight to the testimony of Messrs. Dillon, Solomon, and Gerber. Based on that evidence, the Board determined that, at Helmore Farm, the adverse effects inherently associated with the proposed facility would be above and beyond the adverse effects associated with an airport elsewhere in the R.C. 2 zone. The record clearly indicates that there are other parcels within the R.C. 2 zone where an airport would provide a lesser adverse impact than at Helmore Farm, and the Board recognized that finding a better site was not the issue. We believe that the Board applied the appropriate standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">ii. Special Exception Relevant Area</p>\n<p id=\"A9q6\">Appellant argues that \u201cthe Board failed to correctly apply the special exception standard as it did not review the \u2018detriment to adjoining and surrounding properties.\u2019 \u201d He contends that the Board erred in its- examination of the adverse effects on the Greenspring Valley generally and the entire R.C. 2 zone.\u201d Appellees argue that the Board did not commit error when it considered the Greenspring Valley area\u2019s unique characteristics as an agricultural, historic, and thoroughbred business area, therefore providing a more flexible definition of the adjoining and surrounding properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The Court of Appeals has said that the standard is \u201cwhether the <em>neighboring properties in the general neighborhood would </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>be adversely affected.\u201d Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 11, 432 A.2d 1319 (italics in original); <em>see also Eastern Outdoor II, </em>128 Md.App. at 514, 739 A.2d 854.

Based on our holding that the proposed use is not \u201cairport,\u201d however, there is no need to remand this case to the Board to reconsider the neighborhood and detriment to adjoining and surrounding properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>E. Special Exception Requirements of BCZR 502.1</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Appellant argues that the Board incorrectly analyzed the special exception requirements of BCZR Section 502.1.

Appellant contends that the Board erred in not utilizing the \u201caverage\u201d noise standard in analyzing the inherent adverse effects associated with airport noise, regardless of its location within the R.C. 2 zone, citing <em>Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 624, 93 S.Ct. 1854, 36 L.Ed.2d 547 (1973). Appellant also argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the testimony on which the Board relied was unsupported and should not have been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Appellees argue that the Board did not commit error in determining the proposed site\u2019s noise level and that it made its determination based upon evidence in the record that it deemed to be credible. In support of their argument, appel-lees direct us to numerous cases indicating that federal preemption under <em>Burbank, supra, </em>\u201cdoes not extend to local zoning locational decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The preemption doctrine stems from the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution: \u201cThis Constitution and Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\u201d U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2. The Court of Appeals has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">This clause has been interpreted to mean that \u201cstate laws which \u2018interfere with, or are contrary to the laws of Congress, made pursuant to the constitution\u2019 are invalid.\u201d <em>Wisconsin Public Intervenor v.

The site had been designated by the State Aviation Administration as the \u201cWoodbine Glider Port\u201d and operated as a \u201cLicensed Private/Commercial Airport.\u201d Two conditions were imposed on take offs to minimize \u201cthe adverse effects of airport noise.\u201d The Court summarized the aviation noise preemption debate by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">Pursuant to that power [the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution], Congress has enacted the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 72 Stat. 731, and amended it by the Noise Control Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 1234. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 1301 <em>et seq. </em>The Noise Control Act provides that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abp-dedup-0\">In order to afford present and future relief and protection to the public health and welfare from aircraft noise and sonic boom, the FAA, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and with EPA, shall prescribe and amend standards for the measurement of aircraft noise and sonic boom and shall prescribe and amend such regulations as the FAA may find necessary to provide for the control and abatement of aircraft noise and sonic boom, including the application of such standards and regulations in the issuance, amendment, modification, suspension, or revocation of any certificate authorized by this subchapter. No exemption with respect to any standard or regulation under this section may be granted under any provision of this chapter unless the FAA shall have consulted with EPA before such exemption is granted, except that if the FAA determines that safety in air <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>commerce or air transportation requires that such an exemption be granted before EPA can be consulted, the FAA shall consult with EPA as soon as practicable after the exemption is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">49 U.S.CApp. \u00a7 1431(b)(1).

The validity of the statutes and regulations is not questioned. Their implied preemptive effect is questioned. But that issue has in large part been resolved by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">That Court\u2019s decision in <em>City of Burbank, supra, </em>is the \u201cpreeminent authority on the question of federal preemption in the area of aviation.\u201d <em>Blue Sky Entertainment, Inc. v.

Furthermore, <em>City of Burbank </em>speaks directly to the problem of local efforts to control aircraft engine noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">The Court examined at length the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act and the Noise Control Act. It scrutinized the legislative history, which included a Senate Report and a letter from the Secretary of Transportation. The Senate Report explained, \u201c \u2018States and local governments are preempted from establishing or enforcing noise emission standards for aircraft unless such standards are identical to standards prescribed under [the Noise Control Act of 1972].\u2019 \u201d The letter from the Secretary of Transportation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Senator Monroney declared that \u201c \u2018State and local governments will remain unable to use their police powers to control aircraft noise by regulating the flight of aircraft.\u2019 \u201d 411 U.S. at 634-635, 93 S.Ct. at 1860, 36 L.Ed.2d at 554-555 (quoting S.Rep.

It gave weight to the remarks of the Chairman of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce to the effect that \u201cwe do not want\u201d cities and states \u201cto pass noise regulations.\u201d 411 U.S. at 636-637, 93 S.Ct. at 1861, 36 L.Ed.2d at 555 (quoting 118 Cong.

It noted Senator Tunney\u2019s view that under the 1972 Act there would be \u201c \u2018proposed means of reducing noise in airport environments through the application of emission controls on aircraft, the regulation of flight patterns and aircraft and airport operations, and modifications in the number, frequency, or scheduling of flights [as well as] ... the imposition of curfews on noisy airports....\u2019\u201d 411 U.S. at 637, 93 S.Ct. at 1861, 36 L.Ed.2d at 555-556 (quoting 118 Cong.

Contrary to the Board\u2019s position in that case, the Court said that <em>Burbank </em>\u201cdid not make an exception for small airports that do not involve inter-airport commercial cargo or passenger flights, or for activities not expressly governed by federal statute or regulation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>319 Md. at 369, 572 A.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">In <em>Harrison, </em>Carroll County was seeking to use its police powers to \u201ccontrol noise by regulating the flight of planes.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>Id., </em>319 Md. at 373, 572 A.2d 528.

Mr. Lamb, introduced by appellant, relied on data based upon the federal \u201cIntegrated Noise Model,\u201d opining that no matter what noise standard is utilized \u201cthe airport has minimal impact on adjacent land use without a detrimental impact. The adjacent land uses are compatible.\u201d That testimony was contradicted by Dr. Knoi, who was introduced by the appellees and accepted as an expert in mechanical engineering with a particular reference to fluid dynamics, acoustics, and noise computations. Dr. Knoi attended a noise demonstration at the proposed site and performed his own noise calculations. He utilized \u201cpeak\u201d noise levels based upon the standard of the Society of Automotive Engineering Standards, rather than the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s \u201cIntegrated Noise Model\u201d or \u201caverage\u201d noise level standard pursuant to federal law.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> His tests recorded noise levels ranging from 74.6 to 97 decibels.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The Board noted in its opinion that it found Mr. Lamb\u2019s testimony to be \u201cacademic\u201d and concurred with Dr. Knoi\u2019s opinion that the \u201caverage\u201d noise analysis was \u201cnot appropriate for the analysis of noise at the Helmore Farms facility.\u201d The Board based that conclusion on the fact that the \u201caverage\u201d noise level analysis was intended for large airports, \u201csuch as BWI,\u201d rather than airports such as the one proposed at Helmore Farm. Accordingly, based upon the testimony of Dr. Knoi, the Board found \u201cthat the impact level of noise at this site was greater than elsewhere in the zone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We believe the Board erred in using \u201cpeak\u201d noise level in its analysis, rather than the \u201caverage\u201d noise levels provided by Maryland law, which is not preempted by federal law in regard to land uses. <em>Gustafson, </em>76 F.3d at 786 (6th Cir.1996). Based on our determination that the Board correctly concluded that the proposed use of Helmore Farm was not an airport and that helicopter operations are excluded in the R.C. 2 Zone, however, we need not remand this case to the Board to consider the \u201caverage\u201d noise level standard in its impact analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">ii. Thoroughbred Operations</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">Appellant argues that the Board erred as a matter of law in holding that the proposed airport adversely affected local thoroughbred operations. He contends that no evidence existed in the record to support the Board\u2019s finding that the thoroughbred operations located in the area would be adversely affected by the operation of the Helmore Farm airport. Appellees argue that the unique nature of the thoroughbred operations in the Greenspring Valley area were cause for the Board\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The Board found that \u201cthe impact of the proposed operation [of an airport] would be greater at the subject location than elsewhere in the R.C. 2 zone where the thoroughbred horse industry is less developed and the daily operations as proposed would be of considerably diminished proportion.\u201d The Board heard conflicting testimony regarding thoroughbred operations in and around the southern Baltimore County region. The record indicates that the testimony that the Board relied upon, that of Mr. Solomon, included an opinion regarding the future hypothetical use of the Greenspring Valley for thoroughbred operations. Mr. Solomon opined that \u201cthere have been horse farms in [the area surrounding Hel-more Farm in] the past. There are now, and our position in zoning R.C. 2, was to maintain that use into the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Subject to our discussion regarding the relevant neighborhood in D(ii) above, we believe the Board could consider the impact of the proposed use on current and future thoroughbred operations in a properly defined neighborhood. <em>See Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 12-13, 432 A.2d 1319 (quoting <em>Deen v.

The following terms and restrictions were included in the special exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">1) The Petitioners are hereby made aware that proceeding at this time is at their own risk until the 30-day appeal period from the date of this Order has expired. If an appeal is filed and this Order is reversed, the relief granted herein shall be rescinded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">2) The special exception granted herein is limited to the current owners and operators of Helmore Farms, specifically, the Lucas family. It shall not be transferable to any third party. In the event that this property is sold or the Helmore Farms thoroughbred horse farm operation ceases to do business at this location, then the special exception granted herein shall cease and, terminate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">3) The airport operation shall be limited to one (1) landing and takeoff of a fixed wing aircraft per week. This restriction shall not apply to Mr. Lucas\u2019 personal aircraft, such as the proposed Maul\u00e9 fixed-wing aircraft, the brochure of which was submitted into evidence as Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 6. In the event Mr. Lucas purchases this private fixed-wing aircraft, he may come and go from his property as is necessary. However, this restriction pertains to the landing of aircraft by those other than the Petitioner. Furthermore, this restriction shall not apply to the weekends during which the Triple Crown races are held, that being the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Stakes. The Petitioner shall be permitted to have multiple fixed-wing landings and take-offs on those weekends, only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">4) There shall be no more than two helicopter events on any given day. A helicopter event consists of an arrival and a departure. Said landings and take-offs shall occur between the hours of 7:00 AM and 10:00 PM as stated heretofore. There shall be no helicopters permitted to land at this airport that exceed the decibel level generated by the Augusta A-109. This restriction is imposed upon the Petitioner in order to limit the size and type of helicopters which will be permitted to utilize this airport. The noise level of the Augusta A-109 helicopter was acceptable to this Deputy Zoning Commissioner; however, there are many other helicopters whose noise levels may not be acceptable. Therefore, it is necessary to restrict to the extent possible the type of helicopter permitted to land on the subject property. This restriction shall not apply to the weekends during which the Triple Crown races are held, that being the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Belmont Stakes. The Petitioner shall be permitted to have multiple helicopter landings during those weekends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">5) All helicopters shall be prohibited from landing and taking off in a direction that would carry the helicopter in a westerly direction over the lands owned by the Immelt or Carroll families. All landings and take-offs of helicopters shall proceed in the direction of Falls Road, thereby flying over the Meadowwood, Inc. property, currently owned by Baltimore County for use by its Department of Recreation and Parks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">6) There shall be no landing or taking off of aircraft from the subject property prior to 7:00 AM on any given day, or after 10:00 PM on any given evening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">7) There shall be no fueling of any type of aircraft on the subject property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">8) The storage of aircraft not owned by the Petitioner shall not be permitted on the subject property for any more than 14 consecutive days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">9) There shall be no aircraft repair of any kind taking place on the subject property, except for emergency repairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">10) There shall be no sale of aircraft from the subject property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">11) The Petitioner shall be required to install a double row of white pine trees along the western boundary of his property from the northern boundary of the special exception area, south along the western property line and terminating at the existing tree line which buffers the Jones Falls waterway from the subject property. This double row of white pine trees is an attempt to further mitigate the noise levels generated by the aircraft that come and go from the subject site. Along these lines, the Petitioner shall submit for review and approval by Mr. Avery Harden, the Landscape Architect for \u2022 Baltimore County, a landscape plan depicting this double row of pine trees along the western property line of the subject property in the area described above. The existing tree line in this area is mostly deciduous, wherein the ability of those trees to buffer the sound generated from this airport would be significantly reduced during the winter months. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement this existing vegetation by way of these additional plantings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>12) When applying for any permits, the site plan and landscaping plan filed must reference this case and set forth and address the restrictions of this Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">13) All helicopters coming and going from the subject property shall be required to fly over 1-83 and Falls Road when arriving/departing the airport. No helicopters shall be permitted to fly over Greenspr-ing Station and the adjacent community of Heatherfield at any time. Multiple violations of this provision shall result in a revocation of the special exception granted herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">The first twelve provisions were contained in the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s opinion, dated August 5, 1998.
