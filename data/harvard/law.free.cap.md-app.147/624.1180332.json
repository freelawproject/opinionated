Mattingly, Sr., appellant, sued DIRECTV, Inc. and its parent company, Hughes Electronics Corporation (\u201cHughes\u201d), appel-lees, for charging an illegal $2.81 late fee to his account for satellite television services. The Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County agreed with DIRECTV and Hughes that Mattingly is bound by an arbitration clause that DIRECTV inserted into its standard \u201cCustomer Agreement\u201d approximately one month after Mattingly subscribed to its service, and dismissed the complaint without prejudice, to allow arbitration of the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In this appeal, Mattingly challenges that dismissal. He rais\u00e9s numerous issues, which we condense and restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">I. Did the circuit court err in holding that Mattingly agreed to the arbitration clause by failing to cancel his DIRECTV service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">II. Did the circuit court err in holding that Mattingly agreed to arbitrate his claims against Hughes, who was not a party to the agreement, but merely the corporate parent of DIRECTV?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">III. Is the arbitration clause unconscionable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">IV. Did the circuit court err in rejecting Mattingly\u2019s efforts to enforce an alleged \u201csettlement agreement\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">We shall hold that the circuit court erred in finding that Mattingly agreed to an amendment adding the arbitration clause because there is no evidence in this record to show that DIRECTV gave him \u201cwritten notice describing the change,\u201d as required under the terms of its customer agreement. For this reason, we will reverse the judgment in favor of DIRECTV. As to Hughes, however, we shall affirm the judgment, because Mattingly has not stated a claim upon which relief could be granted against Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">Our decisions on the first two issues make it unnecessary to reach Mattingly\u2019s alternative contention that the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>clause is unconscionable. As to the so-called \u201csettlement agreement,\u201d we conclude that the court correctly denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">After purchasing satellite television equipment at Circuit City in Waldorf, Mattingly subscribed to DIRECTV\u2019s satellite television service. In a February 20, 1997 telephone call, he agreed to accept DIRECTV service subject to the terms of a customer agreement that would later be mailed to him. DIRECTV activated the satellite service while Mattingly was still on the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The next day, DIRECTV sent Mattingly an invoice, along with a \u201cCustomer Agreement\u201d effective \u201cAugust 28, 1996, until replaced\u201d (the \u201c1996 Agreement\u201d). This agreement stated that <em>\u201cCustomer\u2019s receipt of services constitutes Customer\u2019s 'acceptance of and agreement to all terms and conditions of this Agreement.\u201d </em>One of those conditions was a \u201cchange of terms\u201d clause, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">DIRECTV reserves the right to change these terms and conditions .... If any changes are made, [DIRECTV] will send you a written notice describing the change and its effective date. If a change is not acceptable to you, you may cancel your service. If you do not cancel your service, your continued receipt of any service is considered to be your acceptance of that change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Another term of the 1996 Agreement was that Mattingly agreed that \u201cif [his] payment is not received by DIRECTV before [his] next statement is issued, [he] may be charged an Administrative Late Fee\u201d of up to $5.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Less than a month after Mattingly\u2019s subscription began, on March 18, 1997, DIRECTV mailed a new Customer Agreement to Mattingly (the \u201c1997 Agreement\u201d). The 1997 Agreement differed from the 1996 Agreement in that it included an arbitration clause. That clause stated that any claim \u201carising out of, or relating to, this Agreement or any services provided by DIRECTV which cannot be settled by the parties shall be resolved according to binding arbitration[.]\u201d It is undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>that Mattingly did not cancel his DIRECTV service, and indeed, that he has continued to be a DIRECTV customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">By invoice dated July 17,1999, DIRECTV charged Mattingly a \u201clate fee\u201d of $2.81 for a \u201cpast due amount\u201d of $56.12. In the \u201cTerms and Conditions,\u201d \u201cAdministrative Late Fee,\u201d and other clauses printed on the back of DIRECTV\u2019s invoice, there is no mention of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Mattingly paid the July 1999 late fee and his outstanding balance, then filed suit in an attempt to initiate a class action on behalf of other subscribers challenging the legality of the late fee. On August 6, 1999, he sued DIRECTV and Hughes claiming that (1) the DIRECTV invoices were mailed so late in the month that there was an unreasonably or unconscionably short period in which to make timely payment, resulting in frequent charges for an \u201cadministrative late fee,\u201d and (2) there was no reasonable relationship between the late payment fee and the actual administrative expenses incurred in processing late payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">On September 7, 1999, Mattingly amended his complaint, seeking certification as a class action. He asserted four counts in his First Amended Class Action Complaint: (1) violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, <em>codified at </em>Md.Code (1975, 2000 Repl.Vol, 2001 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 13-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d); (2) violations of Art. Ill, section 57 of the Maryland Constitution, which sets the legal rate of interest at six percent;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) violations of CL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>section 2-718, which prohibits penalties disguised as liquidated damages; and (4) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">DIRECTV and Hughes removed the case to federal court, but that court dismissed it on the ground that the claim did not meet the $75,000 amount in controversy requirement for federal diversity jurisdiction. When the case returned to circuit court, DIRECTV and Hughes promptly moved to dismiss Mattingly\u2019s claims on the ground that they are arbi-trable, or in the alternative, to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration. After a hearing on the motion, the court agreed that, under the terms of the 1997 Agreement and subsequent agreements, Mattingly was obligated to arbitrate his claims against both DIRECTV and Hughes. From a judgment dismissing his complaint without prejudice, Mattingly noted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The Circuit Court Erred In Finding That Mattingly Knowingly Agreed To Arbitrate His Claims Against DIRECTV</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Mattingly argues that the circuit court erred in concluding that he agreed to arbitrate his claims against DIRECTV. He concedes that, beginning with the 1997 Agreement that took effect less than one month after he subscribed to DIRECTV service, there was an arbitration clause in DIRECTV\u2019s customer agreement. He claims, however, that he did not knowingly agree to DIRECTV\u2019s addition of that clause. For this reason, he argues, his continued subscription to DIRECTV\u2019s services did not constitute his consent to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">The Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, states that \u201can agreement in writing to submit to arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>an existing controversy arising out of ... a contract [involving interstate commerce] ... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d The FAA is applicable to private contracts made and enforced in Maryland when, as in this case, the contract affects interstate commerce. <em>See Long v. Silver, </em>248 F.3d 309, 315-16 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 213, 151 L.Ed.2d 151 (2001); <em>Bischoff v. DirecTV, Inc., </em>180 F.Supp.2d 1097, 1102 (C.D.Cal.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Under the FAA, the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute in question is a matter of state law governing the formation of contracts. <em>See First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. 938, 943-44, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 1924, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995). Under both Maryland and federal law, arbitration is a purely consensual and contractual means of resolving disputes. <em>See id., </em>514 U.S. at 947, 115 S.Ct. at 1925; <em>Curtis G. Testerman Co. v. Buck, </em>340 Md. 569, 579, 667 A.2d 649 (1995); Md.Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-207 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d). For this reason, courts cannot compel arbitration unless the parties have voluntarily agreed to arbitrate their disputes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">It is axiomatic that an arbitration panel derives it authority to decide a given dispute from the disputing parties themselves.... \u201c \u2018The question is one of intention, to be ascertained by the same tests that are applied to contracts generally.... No one is under a duty to resort to ... [arbitration] tribunals, however helpful their processes, except to the extent that he has signified his willingness.\u2019 \u201d ... [A]bsent an arbitration agreement between the parties, an arbitration panel cannot validly assert jurisdiction to decide a dispute between them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-11\"><em>Stephen L. Messersmith, Inc. v. Barclay Townhouse Assocs., </em>313 Md. 652, 658, 547 A.2d 1048 (1988)(quoting <em>Continental Milling &amp; Feed Co. v. Doughnut Corp. of America, </em>186 Md. 669, 675, 48 A.2d 447 (1946)).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">\u201cWhether there is an agreement to arbitrate the parties\u2019 dispute is a legal question of contract interpretation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number><em>NRT Mid-Atlantic, Inc. v. Innovative Props., Inc., </em>144 Md. App. 263, 279, 797 A.2d 824 (2002). When the existence of an arbitration agreement is in dispute, that dispute must be resolved by a court. <em>See, e.g., </em>CJ \u00a7 3-207(b)(under Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, \u201cif the opposing party denies existence of an arbitration agreement, the court shall proceed expeditiously to determine if the agreement exists\u201d); <em>NRT Mid-Atlantic, </em>144 Md.App. at 278, 797 A.2d 824 (petition asking court to compel arbitration, when filed in response to complaint filed in court, is subject to provisions of Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act). When there is a dispute of fact material to determining whether there is an agreement to arbitrate, the court resolves that dispute before determining whether the agreement to arbitrate exists. <em>See Stephen L. Messersmith, </em>313 Md. at 664, 547 A.2d 1048 (\u201cAfter receiving ... evidence, the court shall decide by a preponderance of the evidence whether an agreement to arbitrate exists\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Mattingly asks us to hold that the circuit court erred in finding that he agreed to arbitrate his claims against DIRECTV. He first argues that a consumer cannot, merely by virtue of a \u201cchange of terms\u201d clause in a customer agreement, \u201cconstructively accept\u201d an amendment adding an arbitration clause. In his brief, Mattingly broadly suggests that as a matter of public policy, DIRECTV should not be permitted to amend its customer agreement by simply mailing a revised customer agreement that contains a new arbitration clause, in the same envelope along with its standard monthly billing invoice, with no other mention of arbitration. In effect, he advocates, courts should hold that, as a matter of law, and regardless of the contract terms they accepted when purchasing the product or service, consumers must be given a separate written notice conspicuously pointing out that the terms of the customer agreement have been changed to add an arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">DIRECTV interprets this argument as a broad attack on the entire concept of \u201cconstructive acceptance,\u201d and warns that Mattingly\u2019s argument \u201cthreaten[s][a] basic tool of modern commerce.\u201d Citing the strong public policy favoring arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>tion, it seeks to preserve the \u201cmethod of contract formation\u201d by which \u201c[t]he business provides the product or service and sends detailed contract terms for the customer\u2019s review,\u201d and then the customer decides whether to reject the contract terms by returning the product or cancelling the service. DIRECTV asserts that this is a time-honored, \u201csimple,\u201d \u201cconvenient,\u201d and \u201ccommon\u201d method of consumer contracting that has been upheld in \u201ccourts across the country.\u201d DIRECTV also posits that the logical corollary to forming an agreement through \u201cconstructive acceptance\u201d is that amending such agreements also may be accomplished by the same \u201cconstructive acceptance\u201d method. According to DIRECTV, Mattingly accepted not only the original 1996 Agreement in this manner, but also all of its subsequent customer agreements, including the 1997 Agreement that added the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The fairness and wisdom of this \u201cconstructive acceptance\u201d method for forming and amending consumer contracts has been the subject of scholarly, legislative, and judicial debate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It certainly raises important and interesting questions. Despite the parties\u2019 invitations to tackle some of them, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>we will not do so. To resolve this appeal, we need not decide whether Mattingly\u2019s global attack on this procedure for amending a consumer service agreement is legally or socially meritorious. We need only to decide a simple but dispositive matter of contract law raised by Mattingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Mattingly argues that, as a matter of fact, DIRECTV did not \u201csend [him] a written <em>notice describing the change </em>and its effective date,\u201d as the 1996 Agreement required \u201c[i]f any changes [were] made\u201d to it. (Emphasis added.) Absent such notice, Mattingly contends, he did not \u201cconstructively accept\u201d the arbitration clause. We agree. For the reasons detailed below, we conclude that, even assuming that the \u201cchange of terms\u201d clause in DIRECTV\u2019s customer agreements permitted DIRECTV to obtain Mattingly\u2019s \u201cconstructive acceptance\u201d of the newly added arbitration clause, DIRECTV failed to avail itself of the method that it established for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">According to an affidavit submitted by DIRECTV in support of its motion to dismiss, DIRECTV notified Mattingly of the new arbitration clause by sending him a copy of the 1997 Agreement in its March 1997 mailing. That mailing included its standard monthly billing invoice, which did not mention arbitration or otherwise alert Mattingly that changes had been made to the customer agreement. In fact, the only place where arbitration was mentioned was in the newly added arbitration clause itself. The clause was printed in regular type at paragraph 23, as a new last paragraph in the agreement. The new arbitration clause appears to be the only significant difference between the 1996 and 1997 Agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">DIRECTV argues that the circuit court correctly concluded that by sending Mattingly the 1997 Agreement containing the arbitration clause, it gave Mattingly notice of the newly added arbitration clause. Thus, we must decide whether the 1997 Agreement that DIRECTV mailed to Mattingly along with its regular March 1997 monthly billing invoice gave Mattingly \u201cwritten notice describing the change.\u201d We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>We read the terms of the 1996 Agreement objectively, through the eyes of a \u201creasonable person.\u201d <em>See, e.g., G.M.A.C. v. Daniels, </em>303 Md. 254, 261, 492 A.2d 1306 (1985)(\u201cthe true test of what is meant is ... what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought\u201d the contract meant). In doing so, we look to the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the agreement. <em>See Curtis G. Testerman, </em>340 Md. at 580, 667 A.2d 649; <em>The Redemptorists v. Coulthard Svcs., Inc., </em>145 Md.App. 116, 144-45, 801 A.2d 1104 (2002). In this case, our focus is on the \u201cnotice describing the change\u201d language in the change of terms clause. '</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">A \u201cnotice\u201d is commonly understood to be \u201ca note, placard, or the like conveying information or a warning.\u201d <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>986 (unabr.1973). \u201cDescribing\u201d something is \u201cto tell or depict in written or spoken words\u201d or to \u201cgive an account of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390. A \u201cchange\u201d occurs when \u201cthe content ... of (something)\u201d is made \u201cdifferent from what it is[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Applying the ordinary and common meaning of these words, we conclude that DIRECTV agreed that Mattingly would be bound by any changes that it made to the 1996 Agreement only if DIRECTV gave him some sort of written notice advising him about a particular change, and identifying that change clearly enough that he could find and review it in the revised agreement. Thus, DIRECTV obligated itself to send Mattingly enough information that he could exercise an informed decision as to whether he wished to continue DIRECTV service, with the understanding that he would be required to arbitrate any claims he might have against DIRECTV. Whether it did so by a separate mailing, or by a separate document sent along with the new agreement and the billing invoice, or otherwise by a separate provision in that invoice or another document, DIRECTV had a contractual duty to give Mattingly some written warning, <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cnotice\u201d) that the new 1997 Agreement included a new arbitration clause significantly limiting his right to litigate in court <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cdescribing the change\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>We reject DIRECTV\u2019s contention that the 1997 Agreement itself constituted adequate notice of this amendment. Merely sending Mattingly a new customer agreement, without identifying in any manner the subject matter, substance, or location of that change, cannot reasonably be characterized as \u201csending a written notice describing the change.\u201d Indeed, that construction would effectively negate that entire notice provision, by allowing DIRECTV to change the terms of its customer agreement without making any effort whatsoever to \u201cdes-crib[e] the change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">At oral argument, DIRECTV conceded that there is nothing else in this record to establish that it sent Mattingly any other document that could be construed as \u201ca notice describing the change.\u201d In the absence of any evidence that DIRECTV gave Mattingly such notice, we hold that the circuit court erred in concluding that Mattingly \u201cconstructively agreed\u201d to arbitrate his claims against DIRECTV.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Our holding is consistent with established principles of contract law. To be sure, under Maryland law, parties may change the terms of their contract by remaining silent if, in light of a previous course of dealing, the offeree was obligated to notify the offeror that he is not willing to accept the revised terms. <em>See Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters v. Willis Corroon Corp., </em>369 Md. 724, 738 n. 3, 802 A.2d 1050 (2002)(citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 69 (1981)); <em>Porter v. Gen. Boiler Casing Co., </em>284 Md. 402, 411-12, 396 A.2d 1090 (1979). When that course of dealing includes an explicit agreement that the offeree\u2019s continuation of a contractual relationship after receiving notice of the proposed change constitutes acceptance of the change, courts may enforce that agreement by finding that the offeree\u2019s silence constituted either actual or constructive acceptance of the contract change. <em>See Willis Corroon, </em>369 Md. at 738 n. 3, 802 A.2d 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>In order for the offeree\u2019s silence to be an assent to the revised terms of the contract, however, the offeree must have had actual or constructive knowledge that there was a proposal to change the contract terms. Even without a specific provision governing the nature of the notice to be given, we have required that notice of the change in contract terms must at least make the offeree aware that there <em>is </em>a change.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Dominion Natl Bank v. Sundowner Joint Venture, </em>50 Md.App. 145, 167, 436 A.2d 501 (1981)(refusing to \u201cstretch[ ] fiction\u201d of constructive notice when there is no notice of \u201ca most disadvantageous change in the contract that is in no way reflected or even hinted at in the new agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In this case, we need not decide whether the mere mailing of a new' customer agreement, with no accompanying notice that it changed the terms of a prior agreement, met the minimum threshold for notice, because here, the existing agreement between DIRECTV and Mattingly had a higher notice threshold. That agreement specifically assured Mat-tingly that, \u201c[i]f any changes are made,\u201d DIRECTV would \u201csend [him] a notice describing the change and the effective date.\u201d We may not simply ignore that language.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>We are not persuaded otherwise by the cases that DIRECTV cites in support of the proposition that Mattingly accepted the terms of the 1997 Agreement by continuing to receive DIRECTV service. A number of these cases turned on whether the consumer \u201cconstructively accepted\u201d an arbitration clause that was in the original customer agreement in effect at the time the purchase was made; in some, the agreement was delivered with the product, while in others it was sent to the customer shortly after the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">For example, in <em>Hill v. Gateway 2000, Inc., </em>105 F.3d 1147 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, 522 </em>U.S. 808, 118 S.Ct. 47, 139 L.Ed.2d 13 (1997), the question was whether the consumer who ordered a computer was bound by an arbitration clause in the customer agreement that was delivered with the computer, on the theory that consumer agreed in advance to the terms of the agreement, one of which stated that the consumer accepted those terms by failing to return the computer within 30 days. The Seventh Circuit decided that Hill had accepted the arbitration clause by retaining the computer. <em>See id. </em>at 1149. <em>See also Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, </em>499 U.S. 585, 590, 111 S.Ct. 1522, 1525, 113 L.Ed.2d 622 (1991)(question was whether consumer had sufficient notice of disputed forum selection clause in contract that cruise company sent when it delivered cruise tickets); <em>ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, </em>86 F.3d 1447, 1451 (7th Cir.l996)(question was whether buyer accepted terms of shrinkwrapped license in box containing software); <em>Bischoff v. DirecTV, Inc., </em>180 F.Supp.2d 1097, 1103-04 (C.D.Cal.2002)(question was whether DIRECTV subscriber accepted terms of customer agreement, which included an arbitration clause and was mailed to him after he subscribed over telephone).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">None of the cited cases involved the subsequent addition of an arbitration clause through \u201cconstructive acceptance.\u201d Notably, DIRECTV has cited no \u201carbitration amendment\u201d case to support the proposition it advocates in this case \u2014 that a consumer accepts the terms of an amendment adding an arbitration clause to a customer agreement merely by continuing to accept that service, <em>without regard to whether the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>consumer received notice of that amendment in accordance with the change of terms provision in the customer agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The \u201carbitration amendment\u201d cases cited by DIRECTV do not interpret comparable contract language requiring \u201cnotice describing the change.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Bank One, N.A. v. Coates, </em>125 F.Supp.2d 819, 826-27 (S.D.Miss.2001)(cardholders did not dispute that they actually received detailed notice of amendment adding arbitration clause to cardholder agreement); <em>Marsh v. First USA Bank, N.A., </em>108 F.Supp.2d 909, 917-19 (N.D.Tex.2000)(bank established by affidavits, deposition testimony, and documents that it provided detailed notice to credit cardholders that it was amending its cardholder agreement to add an arbitration clause, by placing a notice insert into two separate monthly billing statements, and plaintiffs failed to establish that they did not receive these notices); <em>Herrington v. Union Planters Bank, N.A., </em>113 F.Supp.2d 1026, 1031-32 (S.D.Miss.2000), <em>aff'd, </em>265 F.3d 1059 (5th Cir.2001)(bank adequately notified account holders about newly added arbitration provision by sending revised deposit account agreement with cover letter advising that it \u201ccontained \u2018Important information about [the depositor\u2019s] account\u2019 \u201d); <em>Stiles v. Home Cable Concepts, Inc., </em>994 F.Supp. 1410, 1413-17 (M.D.Ala.l998)(satellite television financier notified subseriber/borrower of newly added arbitration clause by sending detailed written notice of change, including opt out provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In all of these cases, courts found that the customer received adequate notice of the amendment, as required under the terms of the original customer agreement. In doing so, they inherently recognize as a minimum threshold to enforcing the arbitration clause that there must be adequate notice alerting the consumer to its presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Similarly, we are not persuaded by DIRECTV\u2019s warning about the dire consequences of holding that Mattingly cannot be compelled to arbitrate his claims. Our decision to enforce the notice requirement of the 1996 Agreement does not threaten a \u201cbasic tool of modern commerce.\u201d Rather, it affirms one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>of the fundamental precepts underlying all modern commercial transactions \u2014 that courts will enforce the terms of the parties\u2019 contract as they wrote it. Here, DIRECTV, as \u201cmaster of the offer, ... invite[d] acceptance by conduct, and ... propose[d] limitations on the kind of conduct that constitute[d] acceptance.\u201d <em>See ProCD, </em>86 F.3d at 1452. Consequently, DIRECTV cannot be heard to complain about our enforcement of the notice limitation that it created as a condition precedent to Mattingly\u2019s acceptance of the new arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Nor does our decision impose a commercially onerous burden on DIRECTV. We agree that \u201cit would be impossible for a company like DIRECTV to negotiate each and every term of its contracts over the phone[.]\u201d But our decision does not require DIRECTV to engage in individualized negotiations in order to amend its customer agreement. All the company had to do was to send a notice clearly telling its customers that the new customer agreement featured a new arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Finally, our decision does not undermine the strong federal and state policy favoring arbitration, under which arbitration clauses are to be liberally construed in favor of arbitrating. As the Court of Appeals has stated, that policy does not apply when the issue before the court is whether an agreement to arbitrate exists. <em>See Long, </em>248 F.3d at 316; <em>Curtis G. Testerman, </em>340 Md. at 580-81, 667 A.2d 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">For these reasons, we hold that, because DIRECTV failed to establish that Mattingly received notice that DIRECTV had added an arbitration clause to its customer agreement, Mat-tingly cannot be compelled to arbitrate his claims against DIRECTV. We shall vacate the circuit court\u2019s order dismissing Mattingly\u2019s claims against DIRECTV.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">The Court Properly Dismissed Mattingly\u2019s Claims Against Hughes</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Mattingly asks us to hold that because Hughes was not a party to any of the customer agreements, it cannot claim the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>benefit of any arbitration agreement that may have existed between Mattingly and DIRECTV. For this proposition, he relies on <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co v. Scarlett Harbor Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>346 Md. 122, 127, 695 A.2d 153 (1997), in which the Court of Appeals explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">\u201c[i]n the absence of an express arbitration agreement, no party may be compelled to submit to arbitration in contravention of its right to legal process.\u201d An arbitration agreement cannot impose obligations on persons who are not a party to it and do not agree to its terms. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\"><em>See also Curtis G. Testerman, 340 </em>Md. at 579-80, 667 A.2d 649 (holding that individual who signed, as agent for a fully disclosed corporate principal, contract with arbitration clause did not thereby agree to arbitrate claims in his individual capacity); <em>The Redemptorists v. Coulthard Svcs., Inc., </em>145 Md.App. 116, 135, 801 A.2d 1104 (2002)(holding that plaintiff who sued a corporate defendant with whom it had agreed to limited arbitration, as well as two of its individual principals, could not be compelled to arbitrate its claims against principal merely because claims were based on common facts and circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The circuit court did not explain the reason that it entered judgment in favor of Hughes. Hughes urges us to affirm the dismissal because Mattingly never advocated to the circuit court the \u201cno contract\u201d rationale- that it now offers on appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Our review of Mattingly\u2019s complaint, motion papers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>and oral argument to the circuit court not only confirms Hughes\u2019 contention, but also reveals that Mattingly has not asserted any cognizable claim against Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In fact, Mattingly\u2019s only direct reference to Hughes in the First Amended Class Action Complaint is in the allegations regarding \u201cParties and Jurisdiction,\u201d where Mattingly states that Hughes is DIRECTV\u2019s \u201cparent corporation,\u201d and that it \u201cacquired\u201d two other satellite broadcasting companies (United States Satellite Broadcasting Company, Inc. and PrimeStar, Inc.), neither of which Mattingly dealt with. The legal significance of those acquisitions is not clear because Mattingly also alleges that it was actually DIRECTV that \u201cconsolidated and/or merged with\u201d those two companies in 1999. In the ensuing \u201cClass Action Allegations,\u201d Mattingly asserts that the putative class \u201ccomprise[s] thousands of residential and commercial subscribers of the Defendant\u2019s [sic] DIRECTV, INC., UNITED STATES SATELLITE BROADCASTING COMPANY, INC., and PRIMESTAR, INC. satellite television services and programming throughout the State of Maryland[J\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Yet in none of the ensuing four causes of action did Mattingly actually identify Hughes as a defendant, assert that Hughes did anything wrong, assert any form of vicarious or derivative liability against Hughes, or otherwise request any relief against Hughes. If, as he alleged, DIRECTV \u201cconsolidated and/or merged with\u201d both of the other satellite companies, and \u201cregularly conduces] business\u201d in their names, then it would be DIRECTV that might be liable for the conduct of those companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In three of the four counts <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cUnlawful Liquidated Damages,\u201d \u201cLiquidated Damages Impermissible by Statute,\u201d and \u201cBreach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Dealing\u201d), Mattingly specifically identified DIRECTV as \u201cthe Defendant,\u201d and asked for a judgment and injunctive relief only \u201cagainst the Defendant DIRECTV[.]\u201d In the count entitled \u201cConsumer Protection Law\u201d violation, as in the preceding \u201cClass Action Allegations\u201d and \u201cBackground Facts\u201d paragraphs of Mattingly\u2019s complaint, all references in the allegations and prayer were to a singular \u201cDefendant.\u201d The identity of that defendant is clearly DIRECTV because the allegations relate solely to Mattingly\u2019s dealings with DIRECTV.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Moreover, in none of his written or oral arguments to the circuit court did Mattingly ever assert any legal basis upon which Hughes could be held liable to Mattingly or to the class. There were no arguments that Hughes was directly hable to Mattingly, or that it was somehow derivatively liable based on DIRECTV\u2019S conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In these circumstances, we see no error in the court\u2019s decision to dismiss the claims against Hughes without prejudice, because the facts alleged by Mattingly, even if taken as true, failed to state a claim against Hughes. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-322. When the circuit court does not state its reasons for granting the motion to dismiss, \u201cwe should affirm the judgment if our review of the record discloses that the court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Briscoe v. City of Baltimore, </em>100 Md.App. 124, 128, 640 A.2d 226 (1994). Our review of the record discloses that the court was legally correct, and therefore we shall affirm its judgment in favor of Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Mattingly\u2019s Alternative Defenses</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">As alternative grounds for reversing the circuit court, Mat-tingly argues that DIRECTV\u2019S arbitration clause is unenforceable because it is unconscionable. He lists four separate reasons that the provision is unconscionable: (1) it requires plaintiffs to pay excessive fees that prevent them from pursuing any remedy; (2) it forces the loser to pay all expenses and attorney\u2019s fees; (3) the arbitrator does not have power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>grant all the remedies to which he may be entitled; and (4) it prevents Mattingly from proceeding on a class action basis, thereby denying an effective remedy to class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Given our decisions that Mattingly cannot be compelled to arbitrate his claims against DIRECTV, and that he failed to state any claim against Hughes, it is unnecessary for us to resolve these alternative arguments. We note that because they were raised in but not decided by the circuit court, we do have discretion to address them here. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a). We decline to do so, however, because these issues may never arise again, and, if they do, we consider it more prudent to address them after full consideration and decision by the circuit court. <em>See Carrier v. Crestar Bank, N.A., </em>316 Md. 700, 725, 561 A.2d 227 (1989); <em>City of Baltimore v. New Pulaski Co. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>112 Md.App. 218, 234, 684 A.2d 888 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>344 Md. 717, 690 A.2d 523 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The Circuit Court Properly Declined To Enforce Mattingly\u2019s \u201cSettlement Offer\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Mattingly contends that he has a settlement agreement with DIRECTV and Hughes, and that the circuit court erred in refusing to consider or enforce it. DIRECTV and Hughes counter that the court properly declined to enforce Mattingly\u2019s so-called agreement because, as a matter of law, it was not a settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">The purported \u201cagreement\u201d consists of language that Mat-tingly\u2019s attorneys drafted, then pasted onto a copy of the 1996 Agreement. To \u201cprove the point\u201d that amending the customer agreement by inserting terms in small typeface into the midst of that agreement, and delivering the revised document without alerting the recipient to the change in terms, cannot fairly be deemed \u201cconstructive acceptance\u201d of those terms, Mattingly\u2019s attorneys typed the terms of an offer to settle this case for $600,000, which, if not rejected by a certain time and date, was deemed accepted, in the same typeface and format used in DIRECTV\u2019s customer agreement. They then pasted this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>language over other terms in the 1996 Agreement, which they attached as an exhibit to a copy of an affidavit by DIRECTV\u2019s director of customer communications. That affidavit originally had been prepared for and filed in federal court while this case was pending there. In circuit court, DIRECTV included a copy of this affidavit with an unaltered copy of the 1996 Agreement as an exhibit to its motion to dismiss. In opposition to DIRECTV\u2019s motion to dismiss, Mattingly attached the same affidavit, but this time with the altered agreement as its exhibit. Mattingly filed this opposition with the altered copy of the 1996 Agreement four days before the hearing on the motion to dismiss. Not until the hearing did Mattingly\u2019s attorney refer to the terms of the altered agreement, or otherwise alert DIRECTV\u2019s attorney to the settlement offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Whatever support this document might add to Mattingly\u2019s lack of notice argument, we agree with DIRECTV that the altered document was not an \u201coffer\u201d because DIRECTV and Hughes had no reason to believe that it existed, much less that it was truly intended as a settlement offer. <em>See Porter, </em>284 Md. at 411, 396 A.2d 1090 (an \u201coffer may be communicated by conduct or words, but must be communicated\u201d). The circuit court properly refused to entertain it as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">JUDGMENT DISMISSING CLAIMS AGAINST HUGHES ELECTRONIC CORPORATION WITHOUT PREJUDICE AFFIRMED; JUDGMENT DISMISSING CLAIMS AGAINST DIRECTV, INC. VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED FOR PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID 1/4 BY APPELLANT AND 3/4 BY DIRECTV, INC.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-8\">. This claim reflects the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>United Cable Television of Baltimore Ltd. P'ship v. Burch, </em>354 Md. 658, 681, 732 A.2d 887 (1999), holding that late fees charged by cable television providers could not exceed the legal rate of interest. In response to that decision, the General Assembly enacted statutory provisions regulating and authorizing late fees in consumer contracts such as the one at issue in this case. <em>See </em>2000 Md. Laws, ch. 59; <em>Dua v. Comcast Cable of Maryland, Inc., </em>370 Md. 604, 613-16, 805 A.2d 1061 (2002). This legislation stated that it would have retroactive effect. The retroactivity provision, in turn, extinguished Mattingly\u2019s cause of action in this case. As both parties here agree, however, Mattingly\u2019s claim has been revived to the extent that it covers claims arising before June 1, 2000, because the Court of Appeals recently struck down the retroactivity provision as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>violation of both ihe Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Constitution. <em>See Dua, </em>370 Md. 604, 610-11, 805 A.2d 1061.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b656-6\">.
