The appellant, Carol Marie McCarty (the Mother), and the appel-lee, Douglas Neal McCarty (the Father), were married on January 31, 1998. Jessica was born on August 8, 1999. The parties separated on November 17, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">The Father filed a motion in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, asking for both joint legal custody and joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>physical custody of his daughter. The Mother filed a counter-complaint in the same court, asking for a limited divorce and for sole custody, both legal and physical, of her daughter. After three rounds of hearings stretching from July 2, 2001, through February 25, 2002, Judge Ann N. Sundt, on March 4, 2002, awarded sole physical custody to the Mother but joint legal custody to the Mother and Father. The Mother has taken this appeal from that award of joint legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Joint Legal Custody Versus Joint Physical Custody</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Initially, it will be helpful to contrast joint legal custody and joint physical custody. Although the landmark case of <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>306 Md. 290, 508 A.2d 964 (1986), discusses both forms of joint custody, it is careful to distinguish the two from each other. Writing for the Court of Appeals, Judge McAuliffe, 306 Md. at 296, 508 A.2d 964, first described joint legal custody.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">[A] distinction must be made between sharing parental responsibility in major decision-making matters and sharing responsibility for providing a home for the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">Embraced within the meaning of \u201ccustody\u201d are the concepts of \u201clegal\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d custody. <em>Legal custody carries with it the right and obligation to make long range decisions involving education, religious training, discipline, medical care, and other matters of major significance concerning the child\u2019s life and welfare. </em>Joint legal custody means that both parents have an equal voice in making those decisions, and neither parent\u2019s rights are superior to the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Contrasted with joint legal custody is the very different phenomenon of joint physical custody.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\"><em>Physical custody, on the other hand, means the right and obligation to provide a home for the child and to make the day-to-day decisions required during the time the child is actually with the parent having such custody. </em>Joint physical custody is in reality \u201cshared\u201d or \u201cdivided\u201d custody. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Shared physical custody may, but need not, be on a 50/50 basis, and in fact most commonly will involve custody by one parent during the school year and by the other during summer vacation months, or division between weekdays and weekends, or between days and nights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">306 Md. at 296-97, 508 A.2d 964 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\"><em>Taylor v. Taylor </em>cautions, 306 Md. at 297, 508 A.2d 964, that it is vitally important to keep the two phenomena distinct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\"><em>Proper practice </em>in any case involving joint custody <em>dictates that the parties and the trial judge separately consider the issues involved in both joint legal custody and joint physical custody, </em>and that the trial judge state specifically the decision made as to each.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The only issue before us in this case is joint legal custody, and not joint physical custody. A cautionary note is in order in that many of the \u201cjoint custody considerations\u201d discussed and analyzed in <em>Taylor v. Taylor </em>are more pertinent to the issue of joint physical custody than they are to the distinct issue of joint legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">A Deferential Standard of Appellate Review</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">As we approach our review of Judge Sundt\u2019s award of joint legal custody, we observe that the standard of appellate review is both limited and deferential. As Judge Adkins explained for this Court in <em>Barton v. Hirshberg, </em>137 Md.App. 1, 24-25, 767 A.2d 874 (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-12\">Appellate review of a trial court\u2019s custody determination is limited. <em>The standard of review in custody cases is whether the trial court abused its discretion in making its custody determination. See Robinson v. Robinson, </em>328 Md. 507, 513, 615 A.2d 1190 (1992). In <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 372 A.2d 231, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 939, 98 S.Ct. 430, 54 L.Ed.2d 299 (1977), the Court explained that \u201cwhen the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the chancellor founded upon sound legal principles and based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, <em>the chancellor\u2019s decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. </em>at 126, 372 A.2d 231. Again, <em>\u201c[pjarticularly important in custody cases is the trial court\u2019s opportunity to observe the demeanor and the credibility of the parties and witnesses.\u201d Petrini v. Petrini, </em>336 Md. 453, 470, 648 A.2d 1016 (1994).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Leary v. Leary, </em>97 Md.App. 26, 35-39, 627 A.2d 30 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Significantly, in none of the three decisions we have found dealing with joint custody was the discretionary decision of the chancellor overruled as a clear abuse of discretion. In <em>Taylor v. Taylor </em>the precise decision made by the chancellor was unclear and the case was, therefore, remanded simply for a clarification. In both <em>Barton v. Hirshberg </em>and <em>Leary v. Leary, </em>the decisions of the chancellors were affirmed as not having been clear abuses of discretion. Although appellate opinions frequently give a lot of advice, they rarely, if ever, actually find a reversible abuse of discretion on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In dealing with the standard of appellate review for assessing discretionary rulings as to child custody generally, the Court of Appeals, speaking through Judge Digges, could not have been more emphatic in <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 131\u2014 32, 372 A.2d 231 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">A case such as this, where custody might well have been awarded to either parent, aptly demonstrates the advisability of leaving to the chancellor the delicate weighing process necessary in child custody cases; <em>to disturb the award here would require that we substitute our judgment for that of the chancellor, </em>and an appellate court sits in a much less advantageous position to assure that the child\u2019s welfare is best promoted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">In affirming another custody decision in <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 186, 372 A.2d 582 (1977), Judge Orth was equally emphatic about the highly deferential nature of appellate review of such discretionary decisions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>It is not enough that the appellate court find that the chancellor was </em>merely <em>mistaken </em>in order to set aside the custody award. <em>Rather, the appellate court must determine that the judicial discretion of the chancellor exercised was clearly abused. </em>This is the principle which controls the review of any matter within the sound discretion of a trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Petrini v. Petrini, </em>336 Md. 453, 470, 648 A.2d 1016 (1994); <em>Robinson v. Robinson, </em>328 Md. 507, 513-14, 615 A.2d 1190 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The Significance of Apparent Unwillingness To Participate in a Shared Custody Arrangement</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The Mother points to two factors to support her claim that Judge Sundt was guilty of a clear abuse of discretion in awarding joint legal custody. One is her own reluctance to share legal custody. One of the joint custody considerations . discussed by <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>306 Md. at 307-08, 508 A.2d 964, is the \u201cwillingness of parents to share custody.\u201d This is a factor that self-evidently applies to joint legal custody and joint physical custody alike. As <em>Taylor v. Taylor </em>discusses, 306 Md. at 307, 508 A.2d 964:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">Generally, the parents should be willing to undertake joint custody or it should not be ordered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">In <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>however, the Court of Appeals rejected the proposition \u201cthat a trial judge may never order joint legal custody over the objection of one parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It was unwilling to grant either parent \u201cveto power\u201d over such a possibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\"><em>[W]e are unwilling to fashion a hard and fast rule that would have the effect of granting to either parent veto power over the possibility of a joint custody award. </em>A caring parent, believing that sole custody is in the best interest of the child, may forcefully advance that position throughout the litigation but be willing and able to fully participate in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>joint custody arrangement if that is the considered decision of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">306 Md. at 308, 508 A.2d 964 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The Mother\u2019s reluctance to share legal custody, moreover, does not come across to us as an adamantine or Shermanesque refusal to participate in the event that such an arrangement were to be ordered by the court. She had moved, after all, for sole legal custody in herself and her position on joint custody, expressed in her brief, simply supports that position.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">All pleadings filed by Appellant in this matter have been uniform in <em>her belief that an award of joint legal custody in this matter is inappropriate </em>and not in Jessica\u2019s best interests. <em>Appellant\u2019s request for sole custody </em>is certainly supported by the parties inability to communicate, as set forth more fully above, and <em>should not have been discounted by the trial court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">(Emphasis supplied). A mere reluctance to participate in an arrangement is not tantamount to a refusal to participate and should not be given the same weight as the judge assesses the prospects for a successful resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The Ability to Communicate Effectively</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The other factor cited by the Mother as a contraindication of joint legal custody is the inability of the Mother and Father to communicate effectively with each other. This is a <em>Taylor v. Taylor </em>factor that is particularly pertinent to joint legal custody.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">This is clearly the most important factor in the determination of whether an award of joint legal custody is appropriate, and is relevant as well to a consideration of shared physical custody. <em>Rarely, if ever, should joint legal custody be awarded in the absence of a record of mature conduct on the part of the parents evidencing an ability to effectively communicate with each other concerning the best interest of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>the child, </em>and then only when it is possible to make a finding of a strong potential for such conduct in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">306 Md. at 304, 508 A.2d 964 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">It is that \u201crarely, if ever, ...\u201d dictum from <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>underlined above, on which the appellant essentially hinges this appeal. The trial judge would obviously need a substantial basis for looking beyond the surface appearance of poor communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In this case, the actual \u201ctrack record\u201d of the Mother and Father for effective communication had been, to be sure, abysmal. Indeed, on September 7, 2001, Judge Sundt deferred making a final decision on joint legal custody for six months and ordered both the Mother and the Father to \u201cwork with a parent coordinator, Dr. Linda Gordon,\u201d whose \u201cprimary purpose shall be to facilitate communication between the parties, to reduce the conflict between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">It was the relative optimism of Dr. Gordon, six months later, based on improvements in the attitude of both parties, that persuaded Judge Sundt to award joint legal custody. It was of the prognosis for communicative improvement based on the diminution of tension that <em>Taylor v. Taylor </em>spoke, 306 Md. at 307, 508 A.2d 964.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">Ordinarily the best evidence of compatibility with this criterion will be the past conduct or \u201ctrack record\u201d of the parties. We recognize, however, that <em>the tensions of separation and litigation will sometimes produce bitterness and lack of ability to cooperate or agree. The trial judge will have to evaluate whether this is a temporary condition, very likely to abate upon resolution of the issues, or whether it is more permanent in nature.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">(Emphasis\u2019 supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Notwithstanding an actual escalation of tension, <em>Barton v. Hirshberg, </em>137 Md.App. at 27, 767 A.2d 874, affirmed an award of joint custody on the basis of a trial judge\u2019s reasonable expectation of communicative improvement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Admittedly, tensions and disagreements between the parties have escalated. Nevertheless, <em>after hearing the testimony, and judging the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses, the trial court concluded that the parties could resolve their differences and act together </em>in [the child\u2019s] best interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ae-dedup-0\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In this case, Judge Sundt found that, after six months of the parties\u2019 working with Dr. Gordon, there had been \u201cenormous improvement\u201d in their ability and willingness to communicate with each other. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">[A]t this most recent hearing <em>what I heard was that there had been enormous improvement </em>in that respect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">Linda Gordon talked about the successes first, the fact that there had been sharing of information, and the way the she had institutionalized that was through faxes on a weekly basis, so that the parties could communicate as to what was going on with Jessica.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">She talked about the reduction of conflict and strategies that she had been working with the parties on, even small language strategies, so that Mrs. McCarty, who has demonstrated, by both experts\u2019 testimony, real learning skills in handing off Jessica \u2014 even there, in small nuances of language, could turn a phrase so that it might appear more positive than pejorative as she is getting Jessica ready to go on visits \u2014 and certainly with Mr. McCarty, who had a longer road to travel, doing whatever he could to, if not mask his hostility toward his wife, at least put on a civil face and address her and in a tone of voice that would not be threatening or would not be perceived as frightening.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afi\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">In a case in which there is not an established \u201ctrack record\u201d of good communication, <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>306 Md. at 307, 508 A.2d 964, stressed that the trial court must articulate the bases for any optimistic expectation on its part that the situation will improve.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">In the unusual case where the trial judge concludes that joint legal custody is appropriate notwithstanding the ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>sence of a \u201ctrack record\u201d of willingness and ability on the part of the parents to cooperate in making decision's dealing with the child\u2019s welfare, <em>the trial judge must articulate fully the reasons that suppoH that conclusion.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In this case, Judge Sundt did just that. She pointed to 1) the fact that the tensions of litigation were subsiding and 2) the continuing help of a third party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">With respect to legal custody, Linda Gordon acknowledges that the parties are having difficult making decisions, even communicating without the help of a third party now, but <em>it was her very clear statement that two factors </em>\u2014 (1) <em>Once the litigation subsides and (2) with the continuing help of a third party, they could make decisions together.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">And the alternative, in her mind, was far worse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">In terms of that third-party help, part of Judge Sundt\u2019s final order, moreover, was her firm directive that both parties must continue, at their own mutual expense, to work with Dr. Gordon for an additional six months in the effort to improve their communicative skills. Judge Sundt was emphatic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-11\">Neither one of you is to make a major decision without consulting the other, and, as I said, if you run into an impasse, that is the time you meet with Dr. Gordon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-12\">I want you to meet with her no fewer than 10 times over these six months. So, that is roughly every other week.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">Judge Sundt\u2019s final decision with respect to joint legal custody was clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-14\">I think you have made huge strides. I think that in the best of all worlds, some therapy for each of you could help you, but I am not going to order you into therapy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-15\"><em>I think you can do legal custody. </em>This is not the usual case, because the primary factor in joint legal custody has to do with valuing and respecting each other so that you can actually confer and consult.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>But <em>I am relying on Linda Gordon in this respect. </em>Her sense was that to the extent that it is situational, that is that the conflict is situational, and to the extent that you have been able to move past that and that there are ways of communicating without having to do it face-to-face and certainly not in Jessica\u2019s presence, it will come.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\">And I tend to adopt her view that the alternative is worse \u2014 that a period of time right now for one of you to be making the decisions without the other\u2019s input will be perceived as such disrespect and such disregard that the conflict will not abate \u2014 that the only way that conflict is going to abate is with your having to be civil, courteous, and respectful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">\n<em>I am going to keep Linda Gordon in the case for six months, and she will be the person to whom you funnel the impasse.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">We cannot say that Judge Sundt\u2019s decision constituted a clear abuse of discretion. The communicative situation, to be sure, was marginal. On the other hand, Judge Sundt, who had been closely in touch with the situation for over a year, was engaged in energetic measures \u2014 for six months prior to her award of joint legal custody and for a projected six months of post-award follow-up \u2014 to insure that the communicative situation was brought up to an acceptable level. That effort is highly commendable, and only time will tell whether it may turn out to be effective and ultimately beneficial to all parties, particularly Jessica. In the words of Judge Digges in <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. at 132, 372 A.2d 231, we will not \u201csubstitute our judgment for that of the chancellor.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
