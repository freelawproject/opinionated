Leadroot, appeals from an order of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, claiming that the circuit court\u2019s order constitutes an untimely and therefore improper \u201crevision\u201d of the parties\u2019 Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO). Her former husband, appellee Philip C. Leadroot, disagrees. He asserts that what appellant calls a revision was only a \u201cclarification\u201d of their QDRO; therefore, he claims, it was neither untimely nor improper. But, while appellee requests that we affirm the circuit court\u2019s \u201cclarification\u201d of the parties\u2019 QDRO, he asks that we reverse the court\u2019s denial of his request for \u201ccredit for taxes [he] paid on the pension arrearage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">After considering the parties\u2019 conflicting claims, we conclude that the circuit court\u2019s order did \u201crevise\u201d the QDRO, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>appellant contends. And because there was no evidence of fraud, mistake, or irregularity, we further conclude that the circuit court\u2019s belated revision of that QDRO was improper and should be reversed. On the other hand, we believe that the circuit court did not err in requiring appellee to pay appellant the pension benefits, withheld by him since his retirement, without crediting him for taxes paid on those benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">On February 4, 1974, appellee, as a member of the Uniform Secret Service, began- contributing to the District of Columbia Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement Relief Fund (D.C. Retirement System). Nineteen months later, on October 25, 1975, the parties married. During their nineteen-year marriage, the couple had three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In 1978, appellee was transferred to Chicago to work for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. To pay for the move to Chicago, appellee redeemed the monthly retirement contributions he had made between 1974 and 1978, or as he put it, \u201ccashed in\u201d his retirement for those years. Five years later, in 1983, he was hired as a criminal investigator.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His new position enabled him to participate in the Civil Service Retirement System.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">In 1991, the parties separated. On April 21, 1993, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County granted them a judgment of absolute divorce, and that judgment incorporated a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (\u201c1993 QDRO\u201d). The 1993 QDRO awarded appellant \u201cone-half <em>Qk) </em>of the marital property portion of each of Defendant\u2019s monthly [pension benefit] payments.\u201d It then declared</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">the marital portion shall be a fraction of the Defendant\u2019s full monthly benefit, the numerator of which shall be the number of months of Defendant\u2019s participation in the Plan from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>the date of the parties\u2019 marriage (October 25, 1975) through and including November 18, 1991 and the denominator of which shall be the total number of months of Defendant\u2019s participation in the Plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The period of time comprising the numerator ends on November 18, 1991, the termination date agreed upon by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In 1995, appellant filed the QDRO with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal government\u2019s human resources agency, to ensure that she would receive her portion of the pension when it was distributed. Four years later, unknown to appellant, appellee transferred his retirement funds back into the D.C. Retirement System and on October 5, 1999, appellee repurchased, with his own funds, the four years of government service<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he had redeemed during the marriage. For the sum of $8,687.87, he \u201cbought back\u201d his months of government service, from February 4, 1974 to February 11, 1978. By doing this, he significantly increased the total amount of annual pension benefits he would receive from the D.C. Retirement System.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The next month, appellee retired and began collecting his pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>When appellant learned appellee was retiring, she contacted the OPM to check on the payment of the pension\u2019s benefits. It was then that she learned appellee had transferred his pension to the D.C. Retirement System. When she contacted the D.C. Retirement System, she was informed that the 1993 QDRO was not acceptable in it's present form. To be accepted by that system, she was advised, the QDRO had to be separate from the parties\u2019 judgment of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">To resolve that problem, appellant filed a \u201cMotion for Entry of Judgment and Qualified Domestic Relations Order,\u201d requesting that the circuit court issue a separate QDRO. In that motion, she also requested, among other things, an award of the retirement benefits appellee had withheld since his retirement. On February 6, 2001, the parties filed a \u201cJoint Motion for Entry of Judgment and Qualified Domestic Relations Order,\u201d seeking the issuance of a separate QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Ultimately, the circuit court issued a separate QDRO (2001 QDRO) but reserved ruling on the pension arrearage until a hearing could be held. The new 2001 QDRO was not substantively different from the original 1993 QDRO with respect to the computation. The 2001 QDRO states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">The amount to be paid to the Alternate Payee shall be one-half (/\u00a3) of the marital property portion of each of the Employee\u2019s [Mr. Leadroot\u2019s] monthly payments. The marital property portion shall be a fraction of the Employee\u2019s full monthly benefit, <em>the numerator of which shall be the number of months of the Employee\u2019s qualifying participation between October 25, 1975, and November 18, 1991, inclusive, </em>and the denominator of which shall be the total number of months of the Employee\u2019s qualifying participation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">It did add the word \u201cqualifying\u201d to describe appellee\u2019s participation in the pension plan, but neither party claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the addition of that word changed the meaning of that paragraph. In fact both sides concede in their briefs that no substantive change in the QDRO occurred as a result of the re-issuance of the QDRO in 2001 as a separate document.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, appellee did not request, at that time, any change in the language of the QDRO to reflect his repurchase of the four years that he had \u201ccashed in\u201d when he and appellant moved to Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Six months later, however, appellee filed a motion to modify the QDRO claiming that \u201cthe original divorce decree and QDRO had an error as to the marital portion of the retirement benefits which are owing and due\u201d to appellant. He explained that because the parties had \u201creceived a complete payout\u201d of his benefits for \u201cthe time period from October 25, 1974 through 1978,\u201d and because he had, after the divorce, bought back those months, with his own funds, so that he could retire early, that time period should not be included in the calculation of the marital portion of his retirement benefits. The circuit court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">After a hearing, the circuit court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order holding that the redeemed months would not be included in the calculation of the marital portion of appellee\u2019s pension benefits because \u201cthere was a mutual mistake by the parties in their calculations concerning the pension.\u201d It then found that \u201cthe marital percentage of the pension\u201d was 53 percent and that appellant\u2019s portion was 26.5 percent. The exclusion of that time period resulted in a 4.82 percent reduction in appellant\u2019s share of her former husband\u2019s pension benefits, as she would otherwise have received 31.32 percent, and not 26.5 percent, of those benefits. The circuit court further found that appellee owed appellant pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>payments for the period from December 1999 through May 2001. The circuit court calculated the pension arrearage based on a percentage of the gross monthly retirement payment rather than the net amount as appellee requested. It explained that it did not have sufficient information to grant appellee\u2019s request that the amount of monies owed appellant be reduced by the amount of income tax appell\u00e9e had paid on those monies. It further observed that appellee could \u201camend his tax returns to recoup any overpayments\u201d of federal and state taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Challenging the circuit court\u2019s authority to modify a QDRO eight years after its issuance, appellant filed a \u201cMotion to Alter or Amend Memorandum Opinion and Order\u201d. In another motion, appellee asked the court to reconsider its decision not to \u201creduce monies owed by [him to appellant] by any federal or state income tax payments,\u201d claiming that he had since learned, contrary to what the circuit court had stated in its opinion, that he could not amend his returns to reflect these overpayments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both motions were denied and cross-appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">On appeal, appellant restates the argument she made below. She asserts that by excluding the redeemed months from the computation of the marital portion of appellee\u2019s pension benefits, the circuit court \u201crevised\u201d the parties\u2019 QDRO. That revision, according to appellant, violated Maryland Rule 2-535, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">(a) Generally. \u2014 On motion of any party filed within 30 days after entry of judgment, the court may exercise revisory power and control over the judgment and, if the action was tried before the court, may take any action that it could have taken under Rule 2-534.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>(b) Fraud, Mistake, Irregularity. \u2014 On motion of any party filed at any time, the court may exercise revisory power and control over the judgment in case of fraud, mistake, or irregularity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Because the \u201crevision\u201d occurred more that thirty days after entry of judgment and because, according to appellant, it was not supported by a finding of fraud, mistake, or irregularity, it was the product of judicial error. Appellee does not disagree if in fact the circuit court\u2019s order \u201crevised\u201d the parties\u2019 QDRO. But he insists that it did not. According to appellee, that order \u201cclarified\u201d but did not \u201crevise\u201d the parties\u2019 QDRO. This, however, was not how he framed the issue below.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In the circuit court, appellee moved not to \u201cclarify\u201d but to \u201calter or amend\u201d the parties\u2019 QDRO, claiming that the \u201cDivorce Decree and the Qualified Domestic Relations Order both have an error as to the marital portion of the retirement benefits which are owing and due\u201d to appellant. The error he maintained there was that the QDRO \u201chas the wrong beginning date.\u201d The numerator of the fraction used to compute the marital property portion of appellee\u2019s pension benefits, he explained, should not include the months redeemed by him during the marriage and later repurchased, with non-marital funds, after the divorce. He therefore asked the circuit court to amend the QDRO so that the numerator would not include those months. And that is what the circuit court did.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Declaring that \u201cthere was a mutual mistake by the parties in their calculations concerning the pension,\u201d the circuit court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">[T]he months redeemed by the parties must not be considered as part of the numerator in the fraction but, rather, the formula should be the number of months of the employee\u2019s qualifying participation between February 11, 1978 and November 18, 1991, a total of 165 months, as the numerator, and the denominator being the total number of months of the employee\u2019s qualifying participation, that is, 309 months, which include the redeemed months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Explaining why it was including the redeemed months in the denominator while removing those months from the numerator, the circuit court stated that, \u201c[a]lthough it appears to be somewhat contradictory, it should be remembered that after the divorce, [appellee] did repurchase the redeemed months\u201d and \u201cthat this time must be part of the [appellee\u2019s] qualifying participation.\u201d And it added that to rule otherwise would grant appellant a \u201cwind fall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Regardless of what appellee chooses to call it, the circuit court did in fact revise the fraction used to compute the marital portion of appellee\u2019s pension benefits. It did so to correct what it believed to be \u201ca mutual mistake by the parties.\u201d A clarification does not modify; it illuminates. And the circuit court, here, was engaged in more than simply illuminating the fraction at issue; it significantly altered that fraction so that it conformed with what the circuit court believed to be the parties\u2019 expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Using the almost identical formula approved by this Court in <em>Bangs v. Bangs, </em>59 Md.App. 350, 475 A.2d 1214 (1984), the QDRO stated that \u201cthe numerator ... shall be the number of months of the Employee\u2019s qualifying participation between October 25, 1975, and November 18, 1991, inclusive, and the denominator ... shall be the total number of months of the employee\u2019s qualifying participation.\u201d In other words, the numerator was to include all of the months between the date of the parties\u2019 marriage and the termination date agreed on by the parties. No distinction was made between redeemed and unredeemed months in computing the marital portion of appel-lee\u2019s pension benefits in 1993, when the QDRO was first issued, or in 2001, when it was re-issued as a separate order, after appellee repurchased his four years of service. Nor can we do so now without revising the parties\u2019 QDRO. To now qualify a term, which was left unqualified both in 1993 and in 2001, plainly constitutes a \u201crevision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Moreover, even if the circuit court is correct that \u201cwhen the divorce decree was entered in 1993,\u201d appellant had no \u201cexpectation that she would have been entitled to the months that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>had been redeemed during the marriage,\u201d that is irrelevant. What is relevant is that the parties agreed upon a formula that did not exclude such months if and when they were repurchased. Furthermore, the decision to repurchase the redeemed months was entirely under appellee\u2019s control. He presumably knew the terms of his retirement plan and that, at a time of his choosing, he could for a modest amount, $3,637.87, repurchase the four years of service that he and his wife had redeemed. The time he chose was after the date of the parties\u2019 divorce. And he did so knowing that the language of the QDRO did not exclude the redeemed months from the numerator. Moreover, when the circuit court subtracted the redeemed months from the numerator but left them in the denominator, it effectively ruled that the same term \u2014 \u201cqualifying participation\u201d meant something different in the denominator than it did in the numerator, an interpretation that defies a basic canon of contract interpretation: that the same terms are to be given the same meaning in the same document. <em>See </em>17A C.J.S., <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 322 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Nor can we accept the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that to include the redeemed months in the numerator would result in an unjustifiable \u201cwindfall\u201d to appellant, who had neither anticipated their inclusion nor participated in their repurchase. Appellee repurchased four years of service. For the exiguous sum of $3,637.87, he shall receive annually ten percent more in pension benefits for the rest of his life. Given the large return for such a small investment, we cannot but conclude that the repurchased benefits were really the product of his four years of government service, three of which were during the parties\u2019 marriage, and not the small sum he paid to re-initiate those benefits. We agree with appellant\u2019s assertion that, \u201cclearly, the service time, as opposed to the amount of the contribution, is by far the most important factor in determining the value of the benefits.\u201d In that light, it is hard to view their inclusion in the numerator as a windfall to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Nor does the fact that appellee made the repurchase with his own funds or that the increase in benefits occurred after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the parties\u2019, divorce affect our conclusion. Not only was the sum he paid for those benefits small but he could have avoided assuming the entire burdeii of the repurchase by simply contacting appellant and suggesting to her that it would be in their mutual interest to jointly repurchase the months of service. This he did not do, presumably in the hope of not having to share the increase in pension benefits with her. Moreover, this Court has repeatedly held that there is nothing inappropriate about a former spouse \u201creap[ing] the benefit of a post-divorce increase in the value of [a] pension.\u201d <em>Musick v. Musick, </em>144 Md.App. 494, 503, 798 A.2d 1213 (2002) (citing <em>Bangs, </em>59 Md.App. at 367, 475 A.2d 1214). Indeed, even if the inclusion of the redeemed months in the formula for computing appellant\u2019s share of appellee\u2019s pension would result in a \u201cwindfall\u201d to appellant, that would not alter the result we reach today, as that windfall is the product of a formula freely negotiated and agreed to by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">And finally we note that to affirm the circuit court\u2019s exclusion of the redeemed months in its calculation of the marital property portion of appellee\u2019s pension benefits may encourage others in similar situations to redeem part of their pension benefits during their marriage, in anticipation of repurchasing them after divorce and thereby placing them beyond the reach of their former spouses. This would be particularly unfortunate in instances where, as here, the pension benefits were largely earned during the marriage and then repurchased after the divorce for a nominal sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Having determined that the circuit court\u2019s order did in fact revise the parties\u2019 QDRO, we now turn to the question whether Maryland Rule 2-535 would permit such a revision. As previously noted, a motion to revise a judgment must be \u201cfiled within 30 days after entry of judgment.\u201d Md. Rule 2-535(a)(2002). That deadline has of course long since passed. Nonetheless, subsection (b) of that Maryland Rule provides that \u201cat any time, the court may exercise revisory power and control over the judgment in case of fraud, mistake, or irregularity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>But fraud, mistake or irregularity must be established by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Tandra S. v. Tyrone </em>W., 336 Md. 303, 314, 648 A.2d 439 (1994). And they \u201care to be narrowly defined and strictly applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315, 648 A.2d 439 (citing <em>Platt v. Platt, </em>302 Md. 9, 13, 485 A.2d 250 (1984)). \u201cThe rationale behind strictly limiting a court\u2019s revisory power is that in today\u2019s highly litigious society, there must be some point in time when a judgment becomes final.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 648 A.2d 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We recently stressed how strictly that rule was to be applied in <em>Thacker v. Hale, </em>146 Md.App. 203, 806 A.2d 751 (2002). In that case, the circuit court entered a final judgment granting the parties an absolute divorce. The judgment included a monetary award, which permitted Ms. Thacker to accelerate the balance of the award if her former spouse missed a payment. Twelve years later, after payment deadlines had repeatedly been ignored, Ms. Thacker moved to accelerate the unpaid balance of the award. The circuit court, however, found that such a provision was not permitted by the Family Law Article and declared that it constituted an irregularity under Rule 2-535(b). We disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Rejecting the circuit court\u2019s finding of \u201cirregularity,\u201d we held that the circuit court lacked the revisory power under Rule 2-535(b) to strike the acceleration provision. <em>Id. </em>at 226-27, 806 A.2d 751. In doing so, we overruled <em>McClayton v. McClayton, </em>68 Md.App. 615, 515 A.2d 231 (1986), to the extent that it \u201cstood for the proposition that the erroneous inclusion of an impermissible term in the monetary award provisions of the divorce judgment is an \u2018irregularity\u2019.\u201d <em>Thacker, </em>146 Md. App. at 219, 806 A.2d 751. An irregularity, we pointed out, \u201cusually means irregularity of process or procedure, and not an error, which in the legal parlance generally connotes departure from the truth or accuracy of which a defendant had notice and could have challenged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 806 A.2d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">We also rejected the contention that it was a \u201cmistake\u201d under Rule 2-535(b). <em>Id. </em>at 230, 806 A.2d 751. A \u201cmistake\u201d under Rule 2-535(b) is \u201climited to a jurisdictional error, i.e. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>where the court has no power to enter the judgment.\u201d <em>Tan-dra S., </em>336 Md. at 317, 648 A.2d 439. \u201cThe typical kind of mistake occurs when a judgment has been entered in the absence of valid service of process; hence, the court never obtains personal jurisdiction over a party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 648 A.2d 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Nonetheless, in this case, the circuit court found that \u201cthere was a mutual mistake by the parties in their calculations concerning the pension.\u201d That is obviously not the kind of mistake contemplated by Rule 2 \u2014 535(b); it has virtually nothing to with jurisdiction. Neither party has even questioned whether the circuit court had personal and subject matter jurisdiction here, which of course it did. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., (1999 RepLVol.) \u00a7 8-205 of the Pam. Law Article (\u201c(a) ... court may transfer ownership of an interest in a pension ... (b) The court shall determine ... the terms of the transfer of the interest in the pension.... \u201d). The \u201cmutual mistake\u201d the circuit court found had to do with what it believed was a misunderstanding between the parties as to which months to include in calculating the marital property portion of appellee\u2019s pension benefits; in short, it was at most a contractual not a jurisdictional mistake. We therefore hold that the circuit court erred in revising the 2001 QDRO because it lacked the authority to do so under Rule 2-535(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Appellee contends that the circuit court erred when it failed to give him credit for taxes paid on the pension arrearage. Because the D.C. Retirement System would not accept the 1993 QDRO, appellee collected the entire monthly retirement benefit from December 1999 until May 2001, without forwarding any portion of those payments to appellant. He did, however, pay taxes each month on the entire benefit received.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Nonetheless, the circuit court ordered him to pay the pension benefit arrearage to appellant based upon a percentage of the gross, not net, monthly benefit. Because he cannot now recoup the taxes he paid, he claims that it is unfair to require him to pay appellant a percentage of each month\u2019s gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>benefit. In response, appellant argues that \u201cthere was and is no evidence from which the trial judge could ascertain whether she would have paid as much in income taxes as did [appellee], had her court-ordered share of the pension benefits been paid directly to her prior to June 2001.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">\u201cOn appeal, we must uphold the evidentiary conclusions of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Strauss v. Strauss, </em>101 Md.App. 490, 508, 647 A.2d 818 (1994)(citing Md. Rule 8-131(c)). Here, the circuit court found that it could not \u201cdetermine federal and state income tax on monies not received by the Plaintiff without more information as to the Plaintiffs finances, which has not been provided.\u201d It also noted that appellee could \u201camend his tax returns to recoup any overpay-ments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Now appellee contends, as he previously did below, that he cannot recoup those payments by amending his tax returns. But it is clear to us that the circuit court\u2019s decision to base the calculation of the arrearage on the gross and not net amount of each monthly pension payment was the result of appellee\u2019s failure to provide any factual basis for it to do otherwise. Its observation that he could recoup the taxes paid on the gross amount of each payment was only that \u2014 an observation. When the circuit court was informed by appellee that he could not recoup the taxes paid, it did not alter its decision. In choosing not to do so, it did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
