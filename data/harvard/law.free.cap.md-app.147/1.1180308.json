The appellant, Tron\u00e9 Tyrone Ashford, was convicted by a Prince George\u2019s County jury, presided over by Judge William B. Spellbring, Jr., of first-degree felony murder and of the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. On this appeal, he raises three very generic contentions, each of which breaks down into a series of subcontentions. The generic challenges are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">1. that Judge Spellbring erroneously denied his pretrial motion to suppress based on an alleged Fourth Amendment violation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">2. that Judge Spellbring erroneously failed to exclude his incriminating statement, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-9\">3. that Judge Spellbring erroneously permitted the admission into evidence of an allegedly confidential spousal communication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">1. THE SEARCH AND SEIZURE ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">The appellant\u2019s contention that Judge Spellbring erroneously denied his motion to suppress the physical evidence (a shotgun that turned out to be the murder weapon) actually consists of the three subcontentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-12\">a. that the warrant application lacked probable cause because of its failure to establish the veracity of the confidential informant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-13\">b. that the \u201cgood faith exception\u201d to the exclusionary rule was not available to the State because of the police affiant\u2019s bad faith in applying for the warrant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-14\">c. that the appellant\u2019s inculpatory statement was the suppressible \u201cfruit of the poisonous [Fourth Amendment] tree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>All three subcontentions are based on the claim that the search and seizure warrant for the appellant\u2019s home was not supported by an adequate showing of probable cause. The application for the search warrant was not intended to be part of the investigation of this case. It was part of the investigation of an unrelated murderous episode that occurred one month after the murder in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The Investigation of a Second Murder Led to the Solution of the First Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">September-October of 1998 was an unusually busy time for the appellant, \u201cand thereby hangs [the] tale.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Late on the evening of September 12, 1998, the appellant and three of his colleagues stopped the Buick Regal in which they were riding on the side of Horsehead Road, just off Brandywine Road, in Prince George\u2019s County. The purpose of the stop was \u201cto rob someone, just to get some cash and leave.\u201d As a lure, they raised the hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">It was at that point that Jayson Brently Youmans drove up in a 1986 Ford Bronco. Youmans stopped in order to give the stalled car a jump start. One of the appellant\u2019s colleagues, \u201cTed,\u201d killed Youmans with a single blast from the shotgun owned by the appellant. Another colleague, \u201cJohn,\u201d then fired five shots into Youmans with \u201cTed\u2019s .45\u201d just \u201cto make sure he was dead.\u201d For a month, the Youmans murder, known in Prince George\u2019s County as the \u201cGood Samaritan Murder,\u201d remained unsolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">On October 15, the appellant and two colleagues perpetrated a double murder (plus a third attempted murder) in what came to be known in Prince George\u2019s County as the \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d murders. Ironically, it was the unraveling of the \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d murders that led to the appellant\u2019s being implicated in the \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d murder. The search warrant for the appellant\u2019s home in the \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d case produced the shotgun that was the murder weapon in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\u201cGood Samaritan\u201d case. The appellant\u2019s interrogation in the \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d case led to his confession in the \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d case.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The appellant was convicted on June 17, 1999, of felony murder and related offenses for his role in the \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d case. He received a life sentence without the possibility of parole. This Court affirmed those convictions in an unpublished opinion in <em>Ashford v. State </em>(No. 1342, September Term, 1999, filed on September 25, 2000). His sentence in this case of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is to be served consecutively to his sentence in the \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d case.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The Warrant Application</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">On the early evening of October 15, an individual who had witnessed the entire \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d criminal episode came into the Homicide Section Office of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department and gave a full firsthand account of the crime. In that witness\u2019s account, the nickname \u201cTron\u00e9\u201d refers to the appellant, Tron\u00e9 Tyrone Ashford. The warrant application recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">On October 15, 1998 at approximately 1900 hours, a witness that was present during this incident responded to the Homicide Section of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department and advised the following. The witness stated that he was present when three persons known to him as \u201cJohn Epps\u201d, \u201cTron\u00e9\u201d and \u201cAlicia\u201d, entered the Dunkin Donuts, John Epps was armed with a shotgun. The witness further advised that he saw \u201cJohn Epps\u201d jump over the counter top. All three victims were ordered to the rear of the store. The \u201cAlicia\u201d subject was seen by the witness, attempting to open the cash registers of the Dunkin Donuts. The Epps suspect then returned to the vehicle and retrieved a gas can. The witness also advised that he heard several gunshots coming from inside the Dunkin Donuts. \u201cJohn Epps\u201d, \u201cTron\u00e9\u201d and \u201cAlicia\u201d fled the store, after setting it on fire. All three entered a vehicle that was also occupied by this witness. While fleeing the scene, the witness was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>told by the \u201cTron\u00e9\u201d suspect that he \u201ckilled three people in there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-4\">The witness last saw the \u201cTron\u00e9\u201d suspect exit the suspect vehicle with the shotgun in hand. \u201cTron\u00e9\u201d entered his residence located at 4002 28th Avenue # 103, Temple Hills, Md. The witness had known the Epps subject for several years. He also knows the Tron\u00e9 and Alicia suspects. The witness had been in Trone\u2019s residence before in the recent past and had seen the shotgun inside the residence. The witness also identified the Epps and Tron\u00e9 suspects by photograph. The Epps suspect has been identified as (John Lemon Epps, B/M79-5-78). The Tron\u00e9 suspect has been identified as (Tron\u00e9 Tyrone Ashford, B/M/6-9-72). Warrants have been issued charging both Epps and Ashford with two counts each of First Degree Murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Largely on the basis of that eyewitness account, Judge Thomas J. Love issued a warrant, on October 16, for the search of the appellant\u2019s residence. The subsequent search produced the shotgun that had been used in the murder of Jayson Youmans, as well as in the \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d murders. In denying the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the shotgun in the present case, Judge Spellbring ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">Based on my review of the four corners of the warrant, I find that the warrant \u2014 the application for the warrant does contain probable cause; finding that the informant \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the correct term \u2014 the witness who reports the information to the police has \u2014 is competent, based on the allegations contained in the warrant; is reliable because he reports matters against his own interests; and consequently, there is sufficient probable cause within the four corners of the application for the signature of the warrant by Judge Love.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Invoking the <em>Merrick-Barber </em>Rule:</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The <em>\u201cMerrick-Barber </em>Rule\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">The appellant challenges the probable cause for the search warrant by invoking what he refers to as the <em>\u201cMerrick-Barber </em>Rule.\u201d Initially, we were somewhat non-plussed, never having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>heard of the <em>\u201cMerrick-Barber </em>Rule.\u201d The appellant refers to the opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Merrick v. State, </em>283 Md. 1, 389 A.2d 328 (1978) and the opinion of this Court in <em>Barber v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 613, 406 A.2d 668 (1979). From the two, the appellant distills the ostensible rule that if a confidential informant is not identified by name in a warrant application, then the fact that the information from the informant is a declaration against penal interest does not establish sufficient credibility to permit the information from the informant, standing alone, to constitute probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Just for the moment looking at the <em>Merrick </em>and <em>Barber </em>cases in their own right in their own time, we note immediately that the <em>\u201cMerrick-Barber </em>Rule\u201d is reduced to the <em>\u201cBarber </em>Rule.\u201d <em>Merrick </em>does not stand for the rule which invokes its name. In <em>Merrick, </em>the informant was identified by name. The issue before the Court of Appeals was limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u201cThe narrow issue in this appeal is whether the statements of one who admits involvement in a criminal enterprise meets the \u2018veracity\u2019 prong because the statements appear to amount to a declaration against penal interest.\u201d 283 Md. at 6 n. 4, 389 A.2d 328. The holding was that a declaration against penal interest <em>ipso facto </em>establishes the declarant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">[T]he probable credibility of the informant here was sufficiently shown on the sole basis of his statements against his penal interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">283 Md. at 16, 389 A.2d 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">The <em>Merrick </em>opinion expressly refrained from expressing an opinion on the subject for which the appellant cites it as authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">In the facts and circumstances of the case <em>sub judice, </em>we do not reach the question of the credibility of an <em>unidentified </em>informant on the sole basis of his declarations against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">283 Md. at 16 n. 11, 389 A.2d 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\"><em>Barber, </em>on the other hand, does stand for the proposition for which the appellant cites it. The informant was not identified by name. This Court held in <em>Barber </em>that in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>of an unidentified informant, the giving of a declaration against penal interest was not enough, standing alone, to establish the informant\u2019s veracity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">[W]e hold that an informant\u2019s credibility cannot be shown solely by declarations against penal interest where the informant has not been identified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">43 Md.App. at 620, 406 A.2d 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Without suggesting for a moment that the present case would have fallen under the <em>\u201cBarber </em>Rule\u201d even in 1979, the overarching and dispositive reality is that both <em>Merrick </em>and <em>Barber </em>lie on the far side of an unbridgeable doctrinal watershed. Both cases were inextricably rooted in the now abandoned two-pronged analysis of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>for testing hearsay information in a warrant application. Both opinions are redolent with the language and with the unmistakable mind-set of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli. </em>Both opinions shared the fate of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">As will be discussed, the very concept of examining an informant\u2019s veracity in a doctrinal vacuum chamber did not survive 1983. Quotations from <em>Merrick </em>and <em>Barber </em>are, therefore, sepulchral echoes from a mausoleum that has been shut tight for almost twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">The Two-Pronged Test of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>Is Dead</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">The infamous two-pronged test of <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964) and <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), has been dead for nineteen years. The appellant is calling to its ghost in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">The death of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test is a particularly poignant subject for this Court. We in Maryland, and this Court specifically, went as far as any state in the country in taking the Supreme Court\u2019s lessons to heart and in constructing a highly elaborate framework for applying the two-pronged test of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>in analyzing hearsay information in a warrant application. In <em>Stanley v. State, </em>19 Md.App. 507, 313 A.2d 847, <em>cert. denied, </em>271 Md. 745 (1974), this Court set out with elaborate specificity the various rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>and ramifications of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>two-pronged test. Indeed, as will be discussed, this Court\u2019s articulation of the test in <em>Stanley </em>played a not insignificant role in the overthrow of the entire <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>regime nine years later in <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">As the test was ultimately fully elaborated, hearsay information from a confidential informant had to satisfy, quite independently, both the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong (\u201cHow did the informant know what he was talking about?\u201d) and the \u201cveracity\u201d prong (\u201cWhy should we believe the informant?\u201d). The \u201cveracity\u201d prong, in turn, bifurcated into two disjunctive spurs, the inherent-credibility-of-the-informant spur and the reliability-of-the-information-on-the-particular-occasion spur. From <em>Spinelli, </em>moreover, we distilled two curative devices for initial flaws in the respective prongs of <em>Aguilar. </em>Independent police verification could shore up the reliability spur of the \u201cveracity\u201d prong. Self-verifying detail could shore up the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong. We distinguished between classes of informants, treating very differently, for example, \u201ccitizen-informers\u201d and those \u201cfrom the criminal milieu.\u201d With respect to the latter, we were obsessed with proven \u201ctrack records.\u201d Both in the caselaw and on the continuing legal education circuit, <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>was a burgeoning cottage industry and we in Maryland exploited it to the fullest.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">That now almost incomprehensible world came to an abrupt end on June 8, 1983, with the filing of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Illinois v. Gates. </em>The opinion for the Court by Justice Rehnquist, excoriating the hypertechnicality that <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>had spawned, singled out this Court and our opinion in <em>Stanley v. State </em>as the <em>ne plus ultra </em>of \u201ca labyrinthine body of judicial refinement\u201d that \u201cbears [little] relationship to familiar definitions of probable cause.\u201d 462 U.S. at 240-41, 103 S.Ct. 2317. Justice Rehnquist\u2019s opinion mentioned <em>Stanley v. State </em>by name on four occasions and quoted from it extensively. In only one minor regard did <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 229 n. 4, 103 S.Ct. 2317, note agreement with the Maryland Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The decision in <em>Stanley, </em>while expressly approving and conscientiously attempting to apply the \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d observes that \u201c[t]he built-in subtleties [of the test] are such, however, that a slipshod application calls down upon us the fury of Murphy\u2019s law.\u201d 19 Md.App. at 528, 313 A.2d 847.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Indeed, the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois in <em>People v. Gates, </em>85 Ill.2d 376, 53 Ill.Dec. 218, 423 N.E.2d 887 (1981), that was reversed by <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>had itself relied on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Stanley v. State, </em>citing it and quoting from it on four occasions. It also had relied on Moylan, <em>Hearsay and Probable Cause: An Aguilar and Spinelli Primer, </em>25 Mercer L.Rev. 741 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\"><em>Illinois v. Gates </em>expressly \u201cabandoned\u201d the <em>Aguilar-Spinel-li </em>two-pronged test, with its distinct diagnosis of each prong independently, and substituted a \u201ctotality of circumstance\u201d approach.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">For all these reasons, we conclude that <em>it is wiser to abandon the \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d established by our decisions in Aguilar and Spinelli. </em>In its place we reaffirm the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis that traditionally has informed probable-cause determinations. The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical commonsense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \u201cveracity\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. And the duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a \u201csubstantial basis for ... concluding]\u201d that probable cause existed. We are convinced that <em>this flexible, easily applied standard will better achieve the accommodation of public and private interests that the Fourth Amendment requires than does the approach that has developed from Aguilar and Spinelli.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">462 U.S. at 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">\u2022 In <em>West v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 314, 328-29, 768 A.2d 150 (2001), Judge Thieme described the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>analysis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Occasionally in the law, </em>as elsewhere, <em>there is a house cleaning. </em>Old concepts are discarded or dusted off and refurbished, and space is vacated in order to make room for new theories. Such was the case when it became apparent that the structured nature of these guidelines often undermined law enforcement to an extent greater than the Supreme Court believed necessary. In <em>Gates, </em>Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, expressed concern over the difficulty faced by non-lawyer magistrates in applying the complex set of analytical and evidentiary rules that had developed under the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. Reasoning that a less rigid common sense analysis would help alleviate this problem, <em>the Supreme Court abandoned these strict guidelines in favor of a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><em>Illinois v. Gates </em>was a sharp and decisive break with the past. In <em>Massachusetts v. Upton, </em>466 U.S. 727, 104 S.Ct. 2085, 80 L.Ed.2d 721 (1984), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, however, had attempted to take the moderating position espoused by the appellant in this case. Because 1) the informant in the <em>Upton </em>case was \u201canonymous\u201d or unidentified and 2) the informant\u2019s \u201cstatement was not against penal interest,\u201d the Massachusetts high court ruled that the \u201cveracity\u201d prong had not been satisfied. The Massachusetts court chose to read <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>however, as merely ameliorating the rigors of the two-pronged test by providing that adequate police corroboration could make up for an initial deficit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">\u201cThe informant\u2019s veracity and the basis of his knowledge are still important but, where the tip is adequately corroborated, they are not elements indispensible to a finding of probable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">390 Mass, at 568, 458 N.E.2d at 721. In much the same manner, the appellant here seeks to soft-pedal the crack of doom. (\u201cThe Supreme Court parted ways, however, with the strict <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>calculus in the case of <em>Illinois v. Gates.\u201d). </em>\u201cParted ways ... with the strict ... calculus\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The Supreme Court, however, resoundingly repudiated the effort by Massachusetts to equivocate as to the import of <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>or to salvage any part of the \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">We think that <em>the Supreme Judicial Comt of Massachusetts misunderstood our decision in Gates. We did not merely refine or qualify the \u201ctwo-pf,onged test. \u201d We rejected it, </em>as hypertechnical and divorced from \u201cthe factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">466 U.S. at 732, 104 S.Ct. 2085 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">As it plainly said, the Supreme Court \u201cdid not merely refine or qualify.\u201d It \u201crejected.\u201d If <em>Gates </em>was the obituary for the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, <em>Upton </em>.was the stake to its heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The appellant in this case, relying exclusively on two anachronistic Maryland cases from the heyday of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli, </em>focuses in on the erstwhile \u201cveracity\u201d prong as if <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>were little more than a minor bump in the road. Thoroughly chastened by <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>however, this Court is an unlikely candidate to be tempted to salvage any relic from that now thoroughly discredited <em>anden regime. </em>R.I.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">The Maryland Case Law Confirms The Death of <em>Aguilar-Spinelli</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">In making his preliminary argument that the <em>AguilarSpinelli </em>framework of analysis still retains some residual vitality, the appellant cites <em>Trussell v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 23, 506 A.2d 255 (1986); <em>State v. Lee, </em>330 Md. 320, 624 A.2d 492 (1993); and <em>Winters v. State, </em>301 Md. 214, 482 A.2d 886 (1984). Those cases, however, do not provide the solace he claims to find in them. In <em>Trussell, </em>this Court pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-11\"><em>Illinois v. Gates </em>substituted this looser [totality of circumstances] approach for the earlier and more rigorous \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d of <em>Aguilar v. Texas </em>and <em>Spinelli v. United States.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>67 Md.App. at 29, 506 A.2d 255. The case does not support an independent analysis of veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In <em>State v. Lee, </em>the holding first by this Court, 93 Md.App. 408, 613 A.2d 395 (1992), and then by the Court of Appeals was that probable cause had not been established. The \u201cunidentified confidential informant\u201d in <em>Lee </em>did not speak from personal knowledge but simply passed on information from a more remote unidentified individual. As Judge Bloom pointed out for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">The bulk of the evidence contained in the affidavit relates to the statements of an unidentified confidential informant whose information stems not from personal knowledge, but from the uncorroborated statements of yet another unidentified \u201cunwitting individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">93 Md.App. at 417, 613 A.2d 395. In affirming the decision of this Court, Chief Judge Robert Murphy observed for the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">The factual predicate set out in Mathew\u2019s application for a warrant, to which we must confine our review, consisted essentially of a second-hand rumor: the officer merely recounted information about Lee passed through the informant from his brother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">330 Md. at 326-27, 624 A.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">The fault of the affidavit in <em>Lee </em>was not that it failed to satisfy the \u201cveracity\u201d prong independently, but that, even under the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d approach mandated by <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>it did not establish either the source\u2019s veracity or his basis of knowledge. It was the sum total that was lacking, not a severable part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">The affidavit did not explain how the brother obtained the incrimination information about Lee. The affidavit did not describe how the brother concluded he could buy drugs from Lee. To be sure, since <em>Gates, </em>the law of search warrants no longer insists upon the strict two-prong test of an informant\u2019s knowledge and credibility derived from <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964) and <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969). Yet the veracity and basis of knowledge of the informant clearly remain relevant to a probable cause determination. <em>Winters, supra, </em>301 Md. at 227, 482 A.2d 886. <em>The affidavit failed entirely to address either factor in the instant case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">330 Md. at 327, 624 A.2d 492 (emphasis supplied). In the case now before us, by contrast, the informant witnessed the crime and spoke from detailed firsthand knowledge. The basis of knowledge was abundantly overflowing. <em>State v. Lee </em>does not stand for the proposition that veracity should be analyzed independently, the proposition for which the appellant, of necessity, cites it.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\"><em>Winters v. State </em>not only does not support, but squarely refutes, the appellant\u2019s position in this case. In that case, as in this, the defendant sought to analyze the veracity of the critical informant in a vacuum.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\"><em>Appellant\u2019s basic argument is that if the information obtained from Eader is not a declaration against penal interest, then the veracity and reliability of this source is not demonstrated </em>in the affidavit; the foundation for this reasoning are the principles set forth in <em>Aguilar v. Texas </em>and <em>Spinelli v. United States.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">301 Md. at 227, 482 A.2d 886 (emphasis supplied). The Court of Appeals squarely rejected that approach of looking at veracity and basis of knowledge as separate and unrelated issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">[Ajppellant\u2019s singular reliance on <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>is unfounded in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gates.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\"><em>Gates </em>replaced the rigid technical analysis of the reliability of informant data in <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>with a more flexible approach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">Most pertinently for the case now before us, the Court of Appeals in <em>Winters </em>then pointed out that an arguable deficiency as to the proof of veracity can be compensated for by a strong showing, as in this case, with respect to the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u201cVeracity,\u201d \u201creliability,\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d are still considered relevant inquiries. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 233, 103 S.Ct. at 2329, 76 L.Ed.2d at 545. However, <em>rather than give them independent status, they are to be considered in the \u201ctotality of circumstances </em>analysis that traditionally has guided probable cause determinations: <em>a deficiency in one may be compensated for, </em>in determining the overall reliability of a tip, <em>by a strong showing as to the other, </em>or by some other indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In the <em>Winters </em>case, just as in the case now before us, the informant had \u201cprovided a significant amount of detailed information in the affidavit, most of which was observed firsthand.\u201d 301 Md. at 228, 482 A.2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">As to the compensatory and carry-over capacity of detailed firsthand knowledge, <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>provided an emphatic endorsement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">Conversely, even if we entertain some doubt as to an informant\u2019s motives, <em>his explicit and detailed description of alleged wrongdoing, along with a statement that the event was observed firsthand, entitles his tip to greater weight than might otherwise be the case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">462 U.S. at 234, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (emphasis supplied). Indeed, the statement by this Court in <em>Stanley, </em>19 Md.App. at 530, 313 A.2d 847, that one analysis could not borrow from another prompted the express disapproval of the Supreme Court in <em>Illinois v. Gates:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">One frequently cited decision, <em>Stanley v. State, supra </em>at 530, 313 A.2d 847, remarks that \u201cthe dual requirements represented by the \u2018the two-pronged test\u2019 are analytically severa-ble and an \u2018overkill\u2019 on one prong will not carry over to make up for a deficit on the other prong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">462 U.S. at 230 n. 5, 103 S.Ct. 2317. <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>took precisely the opposite tack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>We do not agree, however, that these elements should be understood as entirely separate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">462 U.S. at 230, 103 S.Ct. 2317.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Even in the cross hairs of a precedential juggernaut, however, the appellant maintains a cheerful outlook on the benign effect of <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>that is as remarkable as it is delusional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">Even under the <em>Gates </em>totality-of-the-circumstances test, however, the <em>Merrick-Barber </em>rule of informant credibility remains as possibly the last bright-line rule in determining probable cause within warrant applications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The <em>\u201cMerrick-Barber </em>Rule\u201d As a Stealth Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The <em>\u201cMerrick-Barber </em>Rule\u201d appears to have been as unfamiliar to the appellant at the time of the suppression hearing as it was to us until this appeal. In the brief argument before Judge Spellbring, neither case was mentioned by name or even alluded to. There was no argument about the propriety of using the declaration against penal interest rationale as a device to bolster challenged credibility. In the context of declarations against penal interest, there was no mention of <em>Barber\u2019s </em>distinction between a declarant named in the warrant application and an unnamed declarant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>We are not going to dismiss the <em>\u201cMemck-Barber\u201d </em>argument on the ground of non-preservation, however, lest it give rise to the false impression that the argument might have had merit if it had been preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The Totality of Circumstances Was Bounteous</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Under the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d approach of <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>the warrant application in this case satisfied all current requirements <em>magna cum laude. </em>Quite aside from the fact that a number of the witness\u2019s descriptions of the crime were fully corroborated by independent police observations at the crime scene,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the eyewitness account bore every indication of authenticity.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>In terms of the contribution it made to the totality, the eyewitness\u2019s \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d in this case was a cornucopia. The informant witnessed the crime at close hand and from start to finish. He knew all three of the perpetrators by name and by past acquaintanceship. He saw all three enter the Dunkin Donuts shop, one of them armed with a shotgun. He saw \u201cJohn Epps\u201d jump over the counter top, and he saw \u201cAlicia\u201d attempting to open the cash registers. He saw Epps go to the car for a gas can, and he saw the three perpetrators set the Dunkin Donuts shop on fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Moving outside, he heard several gunshots coming from inside the store. The three perpetrators and the witness left the scene in the same vehicle. Whether the \u201cwitness\u201d was an accomplice or whether he was simply well enough known to the perpetrators that they saw no necessity to eliminate him as a witness is not known. While driving away from the crime scene, the appellant told the witness that he had \u201ckilled three people in there.\u201d The witness saw the appellant leave the automobile and go into his residence with the shotgun in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">When within hours of a high-profile multiple murder, the police obtain a firsthand account with both the certain identification of the perpetrators and the pin-point location of the murder weapon, a judge\u2019s declination to issue a search warrant for the murder weapon on such a predicate would amount to a dereliction of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Under the circumstances, it is not even necessary to mention the strong presumption of validity that warrants enjoy or the highly deferential standard of review that suppression hearing judges and appellate judges alike must apply to another judge\u2019s earlier decision to issue a warrant. Judge Spellbring was eminently correct in denying the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>A Defense in Depth: The \u201cGood Faith\u201d Exception to the Exclusionaiy Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Even though the State does not need a second line of defense to fall back upon in this case, it is still reassuring to know that it is there. Even if, <em>arguendo, </em>the probable cause for the search warrant were to be deemed to have fallen short, the application for the warrant was not so pitifully bereft of substance as to be laughed out of court. Under the circumstances, it would clearly have been reasonable for the officers to have relied upon the warrant, and the exclusion of the evidence would serve no deterrent purpose. <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984); <em>Massachusetts v. Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 104 S.Ct. 3424, 82 L.Ed.2d 737 (1984). As an exercise in caution, Judge Spellbring ruled that the second line of defense was impregnably in place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">I also find that even if someone were to find that the application does not contain sufficient probable cause, under <em>Leon </em>the police would certainly have a good faith basis to rely on Love\u2019s signing of the warrant and its execution pursuant to his signature of the warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">As to the efficacy of that second line of defense, our observation in <em>Herbert v. State, </em>136 Md.App. 458, 488, 766 A.2d 190 (2001), well describes the lay of the tactical terrain.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">A second strong incentive for searching with warrants is <em>the almost \u201cfail-safe\u201d security of being able to fall back on the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception </em>to the Exclusionary Rule. <em>Massachusetts v. Sheppard </em>(1984); <em>United States v. Leon </em>(1984). <em>Even when the warrant is bad, the mere exercise of having obtained it will salvage all but the rarest and most outrageous of warranted searches. </em>The \u201cgood faith\u201d exception, by contrast, is almost universally unavailable in warrantless contexts. See <em>Arizona v. Evans, </em>514 U.S. 1, 115 S.Ct. 1185, 131 L.Ed.2d 34 (1995). <em>Under the Sheppard Leon \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the Exclusionary Rule, it is hard for the State to lose a suppression hearing. </em>It is equally hard to figure out why the State would not do everything in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>power to exploit that overwhelming advantage whenever possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">(Emphasis supplied). Even if the warrant here were arguably-flawed, it would hardly qualify for what <em>Herbert </em>referred to as one of \u201cthe rarest and most outrageous of warranted searches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\"><em>Leon </em>and <em>Sheppard </em>created the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule. Because it is generally a cautious practice for an appellate court \u201cnever to say \u2018never,\u2019 \u201d <em>Leon </em>added that there could be rare and extreme situations in which an officer might forfeit his claim to the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception. Leon\u2019s brief list of those rare and extreme situations is now religiously intoned in every appellate opinion and is promiscuously invoked by every defendant faced with the foreclosing effect of the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception. The actual appearances of such extreme situations, however, are about as rare as the appearances of Halley\u2019s Comet.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">Here, the erroneous finding of probable cause within the warrant was most likely the product of unfamiliarity on the part of the police and the magistrate with the <em>Merrick-Barber </em>rule. Nevertheless, the absence of the informant\u2019s identify, in the instant case, prohibited a finding of probable cause. This is a simple and basic rule that has remained virtually unchanged for over twenty years. Thus, the warrant was \u201cbased on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">The appellant goes on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">Here the <em>Barber </em>case placed law enforcement on notice that warrants like the one in the present case inherently lack probable cause. ... It is not unreasonable to expect reasonably well-trained officers to know of, as well as understand the commonsense basis for, the <em>Merrick-Barber </em>rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">With defense counsel apparently ignorant of the so-called <em>\u201cMerrick-Barber </em>Rule\u201d at the time of the suppression hearing and with ourselves utterly oblivious to the very existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>such a \u201crule,\u201d it would be the height of ill grace to hold that Detective Piazza was unreasonable for being equally unenlightened. Even if, <em>arguendo, </em>the probable cause showing here was marginally short (it was not), this would not have been an instance where the \u201caffidavit [was] so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d 468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The Non-Poisoned Fruit Of the Non-Poisonous Tree</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">As a final Fourth Amendment claim, the appellant contends that if the search that produced the shotgun was unconstitutional, then his confession that followed in its wake should also have been suppressed as the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The quick answer might be that this claim was never raised below and is utterly unpreserved for appellate review. An even quicker answer, however, is that, as we have discussed at length, there was no Fourth Amendment violation. There being no poisonous tree, there could be no poisoned fruit. <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975), and <em>Ryon v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 62, 349 A.2d 393 (1975), both relied on by the appellant and both dealing with the attenuation of taint, are, therefore, irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">2. THE CONFESSION ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The appellant\u2019s contention that Judge Spellbring erroneously denied his motion to suppress his written statement actually consists of the four subcontentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">a. that the written statement was the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d to wit, the unattenuated product of an antecedent <em>Miranda </em>violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">b. that the written confession was also the fruit of the antecedent <em>Miranda </em>violation under Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-12\">c. that he never effectively waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights before making the written statement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>d. that the written statement was involuntary under 1) Maryland non-constitutional law, 2) the Due Process Clause of the federal Fourteenth Amendment, and 3) Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The Inquisitorial Sequence</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">On October 19, 1998, the appellant was in lawful police custody for his involvement in the \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d case. At about 5:00 p.m. that day, the appellant was transported from the County Detention Center in Upper Marlboro to the Homicide Division in Landover. At approximately 5:15, Sergeant Norman Miller began to interrogate the appellant. Initially, the appellant seemed eager to talk, in the apparent belief that the interrogation was to be about the \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d case. At about 5;40, Sergeant Miller indicated that he wanted to talk about another case. When he left the interview room at 5:44, he indicated that he wanted to get a photo to show the appellant and that he wanted to talk to some people.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The initial phase of the interrogation lasted until shortly before 9:00 p.m., although Sergeant Miller broke it off and left the room for an hour between 5:44 and 6:44 and for another half an hour between 7:33 and 8:00. At 6:17, Sergeant Miller returned briefly to the room to show the appellant a photograph of Donnie Comber, who was involved in the killing of Youmans. When Sergeant Miller came back into the room at 6:44, it was to tell the appellant that the police were talking with the appellant\u2019s wife and with another person about \u201cthe killing of the white guy\u201d and not about the \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d case. It was only when Sergeant Miller, at some time after 8:15, informed the appellant that the appellant\u2019s wife had implicated him and others in the killing of Youmans that the appellant first acknowledged his involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">That was the moment when Sergeant Miller broke off the interrogation, indicated that he wanted to get the appellant\u2019s statement in writing, and proceeded to advise the appellant of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and to take the appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>written waiver of those rights. Until that moment, the appellant had not been <em>Mirandized.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">With ample support in the testimony of Sergeant Miller, Judge Spellbring found that the appellant\u2019s admission prior to receiving the <em>Miranda </em>warnings was not in a traditional sense involuntary. Because of the <em>Miranda </em>violation, however, that initial acknowledgment of guilt was ruled to be inadmissible in the State\u2019s case in chief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">I must find that the statements made prior to the advice of rights and waiver form received as State\u2019s Exhibit number 1, <em>I find that they are voluntary </em>based on the evidence before me, <em>but I find that they are inadmissible in the State\u2019s case in chief </em>based upon the failure of the police to advise Mr. Ashford of his rights under <em>Miranda, </em>and to take an appropriate waiver of those rights under <em>Miranda.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\"><em>Miranda </em>was violated. That is beyond dispute. What remains to be seen is what, if any, adverse impact the antecedent <em>Miranda </em>violation will have on the post 9:00 p.m. written statement that was taken after the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given and the appellant then waived any rights under <em>Miranda.'</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u201cFruit of the Poisonous Tree\u201d Doctrine: Federal</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">In this case, Judge Spellbring found as a matter of fact that the earlier <em>Miranda </em>violation did not taint the subsequent <em>Mirandized </em>statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">[T]hat statements [were] taken without advisement and waiver of the rights contained within the <em>Miranda </em>decision does not in and of itself cause any subsequent statements which are made after an advisement and waiver of the rights in the <em>Miranda </em>decision to be suppressed as fruits of the poisonous tree. This is a fact that must be considered, with all of the other facts, to determine whether the subsequent statement is a voluntary statement or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">But it is not a controlling fact in determining the admissibility of any subsequent statements. I find that, based upon the willingness and desire even of Mr. Ashford to talk to the Prince George\u2019s County Police on October 19th, that the statements taken without advisement and waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights do not effect the voluntariness of the statements that I have received as State\u2019s Exhibit number 2, the written statement and the question and answer statement of Mr. Ashford.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">I find that because of his willingness and desire as expressed to the police to talk to them on that night, that the statement received as State\u2019s Exhibit number 2 is a voluntary statement made after the appropriate advice and waiver of the rights under the <em>Miranda </em>decision as contained within State\u2019s Exhibit number 1, and for the reasons contained herein I will deny the defense motion to suppress State\u2019s Exhibit number 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Having failed to persuade Judge Spellbring that the earlier <em>Miranda </em>violation tainted the subsequent written confession as a matter of fact, the appellant now seeks to convince us that the subsequent statement was conclusively tainted as a matter of law. He urges that we apply the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine, with the <em>Miranda </em>violation as the primary taint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>and the subsequent statement as a clearly unattenuated consequence.'<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The appellant relies on \u201cthe cat out of the bag\u201d notion as coined by Justice Jackson in <em>United States v. Bayer, </em>331 U.S. 532, 67 S.Ct. 1394, 91 L.Ed. 1654 (1947). In <em>Bayer, </em>there had been an admittedly improper first confession because it had been taken in violation of <em>McNabb v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819 (1943), requiring that an arrestee be taken promptly before a magistrate. There was a subsequent properly obtained confession. The issue was whether the second confession had been irrevocably tainted by the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The trial court had admitted the second confession. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, 156 F.2d 964, 970, citing <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>251 U.S. 385, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319 (1920), and <em>Nardone v. United States, </em>308 U.S. 338, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307 (1939), and holding that the second confession was \u201cpatently the fruit of the earlier one.\u201d The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari. </em>The appellant now quotes four sentences from the Supreme Court opinion of Justice Jackson and relies heavily on them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">Of course, after an accused has once <em>let the cat out of the bag </em>by confession, no matter what the inducement, he is never thereafter free of the psychological and practical disadvantages of having confessed. <em>He can never get the cat back in the bag. </em>The secret is out for good. In such a sense, a later confession always may be looked upon as fruit of the first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">331 U.S. at 540, 67 S.Ct. 1394 (emphasis supplied). The appellant neglects to quote the very next sentence, which turns a dramatic \u201cabout face\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">But this Court has never gone so far as to hold that making a confession under circumstances which preclude its use, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>perpetually disables the confessor from .making a usable one after those conditions have been removed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">331 U.S. at 540-41, 67 S.Ct. 1394. In <em>Bayer, </em>the Supreme Court actually reversed the Second Circuit and held that \u201cthe admission of the confession was not in error.\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6\">The appellant nonetheless relies on the power of the metaphor. \u201cOnce the cat is out of the bag, it cannot be put back in.\u201d \u201cOnce the toothpaste is squeezed out, it can never be put back in the tube.\u201d The question remains, however, whether these metaphoric conclusions are sometimes true, as a matter of fact, or always true, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">A. <em>Oregon v. Elstad</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The appellant, in arguing for exclusion as a matter of law, immediately confronts two closely related problems. One is the ambiguous and indeterminate constitutional status of <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>generally. The second problem for the appellant is <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985), specifically. An understanding of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>troubled history is necessary to place <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>in a more intelligible context. Before trying to put the whole issue of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>quasi-constitutional status in historic perspective, we shall decide this issue on the basis of <em>Oregon v. Elstad. Oregon v. Elstad </em>is clearly and straightforwardly dispositive, whether one enjoys the longer view as to its place in history or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Michael Elstad, an eighteen-year-old suspected of burglary, was arrested at his home. He was questioned in his living room without having been given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. He admitted his involvement in the burglary. An hour later, at the station house, he was <em>Mirandized </em>and gave a fuller written confession. The trial judge excluded the first confession but admitted the second. The Oregon Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>reversed, holding that the brief period of time between the two confessions did not attenuate the taint. Citing <em>United States v. Bayer, </em>the Court of Appeals concluded that the \u201ccat was sufficiently out of the bag to exert a coercive impact on [Elstad\u2019s] later admissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In a 6-3 decision with the majority opinion authored by Justice O\u2019Connor, the Supreme Court reversed the Oregon court. Justice O\u2019Connor initially noted that Elstad\u2019s arguments \u201crely heavily on metaphor.\u201d 470 U.S. at 303, 105 S.Ct. 1285. She cautioned that both the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d metaphor and the \u201ccat out of the bag\u201d metaphor \u201cshould not be used to obscure fundamental differences between the role of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule and the function of Miranda.\u201d 470 U.S. at 304, 105 S.Ct. 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In cautioning against too facile a reliance on \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d cases involving Fourth Amendment violations, Justice O\u2019Connor pointed out that the Fifth Amendment is concerned with the ultimate trustworthiness of the evidence, whereas the Fourth Amendment is concerned with deterring unreasonable police behavior. As long as the confession itself is trustworthy, it is not the function of exclusion to sanction the police for having failed to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Judicial disapproval of the police behavior has no part to play in determining admissibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">[A]s we explained in <em>Quarles </em>and <em>Tucker, </em>a procedural <em>Miranda </em>violation differs in significant respects from violations of the Fourth Amendment, which have traditionally mandated a broad application of the \u201cfruits\u201d doctrine. The purpose of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is to deter unreasonable searches, no matter how probative their fruits. \u201cThe exclusionary rule, ... when utilized to effectuate the Fourth Amendment, serves interests and policies that are distinct from those it serves under the Fifth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af\">470 U.S. at 306, 105 S.Ct. 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\"><em>Elstad </em>further reasoned that only a constitutional violation <em>per se </em>will trigger exclusion under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><em>Respondent\u2019s contention </em>that his confession was tainted by the earlier failure of the police to provide <em>Miranda </em>warnings and must be excluded as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d <em>assumes the existence of a constitutional violation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">470 U.S. at 305, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (emphasis supplied). It went on to point out that a <em>Miranda </em>violation is not necessarily a constitutional violation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\"><em>The Miranda exclusionary rule </em>serves the Fifth Amendment and <em>sweeps more broadly than the Fifth Amendment itself. It may be triggered even in the absence of a Fifth Amendment violation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">470 U.S. at 306, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (emphasis supplied). The opinion reinforced that conclusion with earlier Supreme Court precedents.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">Justice Stevens expresses puzzlement at our statement that a single failure to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings is not in itself a violation of the Fifth Amendment. Yet the Court so held in <em>New York v. Quarles </em>and <em>Michigan v. Tucker.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">470 U.S. at 306 n. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">The Supreme Court took pains to explain that a <em>Miranda </em>violation can occur even when the confessions in issue would not be deemed to have been taken in violation of due process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">The Court in <em>Miranda </em>required suppression of many statements that would have been admissible under traditional due process- analysis by presuming that statements made while in custody and without adequate warnings were protected by the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">470 U.S. at 304, 105 S.Ct. 1285. A <em>Miranda </em>violation is not <em>ipso facto </em>a constitutional violation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-12\"><em>Miranda\u2019s </em>preventive medicine provides <em>a remedy even to the defendant who has suffered no identifiable constitutional harm.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">470 U.S. at 307, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (emphasis supplied). A statement taken in violation of <em>Miranda </em>is not <em>ipso facto </em>a coerced statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The failure of police to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not mean that the statements received have actually been coerced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">470 U.S. at 310, 105 S.Ct. 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Justice O\u2019Connor made it clear that a subsequent statement must be assessed in terms of its own inherent voluntariness and is not automatically tainted by an antecedent <em>Miranda </em>violation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\"><em>If errors are made by law enforcement officers in administering the prophylactic Miranda procedures, they should not breed the same MTemediable consequences as police infringement of the Fifth Amendment itself </em>. It is an unwarranted extension of <em>Miranda </em>to hold that <em>a simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion </em>or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\u2019s ability to exercise his free will, so taints the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period. <em>Though Miranda requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">470 U.S. at 309, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">The Supreme Court then came to grips with a nuanced variation on the cause-and-effect theme. Even if the earlier <em>Miranda </em>violation did not directly produce the subsequent <em>Mirandized </em>statement, the earlier statement itself, taken in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>might have its own catalytic effect under the \u201ccat out of the bag\u201d theory. It is not, under this variation of the theory, \u201ccause # 1\u201d that produces \u201ceffect # 2,\u201d but \u201ceffect # 1\u201d that produces \u201ceffect # 2.\u201d The Supreme Court summarized this nuanced argument.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">The Oregon court nevertheless identified <em>a subtle form of lingering compulsion, the psychological impact of the suspect\u2019s conviction that he has let the cat out of the bag and, in so doing, has sealed his own fate. </em>But endowing the psychological effects of <em>voluntary </em>unwarned admissions with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>constitutional implications would, practically speaking, disable the police from obtaining the suspect\u2019s informed cooperation even when the official coercion proscribed by the Fifth Amendment played no part in either his warned or unwarned confessions. As the Court remarked in <em>Bayer:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">\u201c[A]fter an accused has once let the cat out of the bag by confessing, no matter what the inducement, he is never thereafter free of the psychological and practical disadvantages' of having confessed. He can never get the cat back in the bag.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">470 U.S. at 311, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The Supreme Court refused to allow an earlier statement that was voluntary, even if taken in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>to serve as a trigger for secondary exclusion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\"><em>This Court has never held that the psychological impact of voluntary disclosure of a guilty secret qualifies as state compulsion </em>or compromises the voluntariness of a subsequent informed waiver. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">There is a vast difference between the direct consequences flowing from coercion of a confession by physical violence or other deliberate means calculated to break the suspect\u2019s will and the uncertain consequences of disclosure of a \u201cguilty secret\u201d freely given in response to an unwarned but noncoercive question, as in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">470 U.S. at 312, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">The Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>was unequivocal that a second statement, following a mere <em>Miranda </em>violation, will not be automatically excluded and will be assessed in terms of its own inherent voluntariness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">We must conclude that, absent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement, the mere fact that a suspect has made an unwarned admission does not warrant a presumption of compulsion. <em>A subsequent administration of Miranda warnings to a suspect who has given a voluntary but unwarned statement ordinarily should suffice to remove the conditions that precluded admission of the earlier statement. </em>In such circumstances,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the finder of fact may reasonably conclude that the suspect made a rational and intelligent choice whether to waive or invoke his rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">470 U.S. at 314, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">B. The 34-Year Road From <em>Miranda </em>to <em>Dickerson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Faced with the apparently dispositive effect of <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>the appellant seeks to deflect it by arguing that the decision of the Supreme Court two years ago in <em>Dickerson v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000), undercut most, if not all, of <em>Oregon v. Elstad\u2019s </em>supporting rationale. Inexorably ingrained in that argument is the constitutional status of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Is the Supreme Court\u2019s prescription that the warnings must be given in cases of custodial interrogation something that is constitutional; non-constitutional; or, perhaps, quasi-constitutional?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The clash between <em>Miranda </em>and the position taken by the Fourth Circuit in <em>Dickerson </em>was 34 years in the making, but could have been anticipated from the beginning. The confrontation between the two diametric approaches cannot, however, be truly understood in a legal vacuum chamber. The vicissitudes displayed by the Supreme Court in its handling <em>Miranda </em>can only be understood against the larger backdrop of American political history, notwithstanding institutional protests that the political macrocosm has no bearing on the judicial microcosm.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The criminal law phase of the larger \u201cWarren Court Revolution\u201d lasted for almost precisely a decade. It may conveniently be measured as having run from the promulgation of <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, in June of 1961, through the promulgation of <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564, in June of 1971. <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>came at just about the midpoint of that turbulent decade. The Warren Court majority was fairly perceived, by friend and foe alike, as liberal on the subject of defendants\u2019 rights and as activist in its approach to constitutional interpretation. <em>Miranda, </em>with its prescribed catechism <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>of four warnings, soon came to be looked on as the leading exemplar of that court\u2019s judicial activism.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">By the time of the presidential election campaign of 1968, a significant body of antagonism had built up, nationwide, against the perceived activism of the Warren Court. The symbol for that Court that 'took on a talismanic quality came to be not <em>Mapp v. Ohio </em>or the school prayer cases, but <em>Miranda v. Arizona. </em>For better or for worse, Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign plank of anti-Warren Court, generally, and <em>anti-Miranda, </em>specifically, \u201cplayed well in Peoria.\u201d In a brief 18-month period in 1970-71, moreover, then President Nixon got the opportunity to remake the Supreme Court, with four new appointees including the new chief justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The question inevitably soon arose as to what impact, if any, the larger political fortunes would have on <em>Miranda v. Arizona. </em>During the life of the Warren Court, three cases had come before it involving <em>Miranda </em>issues. The defendants won all three. It is not without significance that in all three cases, <em>certiorari </em>had been granted at the request of the defense. <em>Miranda v. Arizona; Mathis v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1503, 20 L.Ed.2d 381 (1968); <em>Orozco v. Texas, </em>394 U.S. 324, 89 S.Ct. 1095, 22 L.Ed.2d 311 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">By 1971, the political complexion of the Supreme Court had, as a result of the 1968 election, changed dramatically. It was even called by some the \u201cBurger' Nixon Court.\u201d To the surprise of almost all observers, however, the new court did not overrule <em>Miranda. </em>What it did do was to chip away at <em>Miranda, </em>1) holding it to be inapplicable in a wide variety of circumstances; 2) holding it to be, even when applicable, easily satisfied or waived; and 3) consigning it to less than full constitutional status in an ambiguously lesser role as an \u201cimplementing\u201d or \u201cprophylactic\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">In the decade between 1971 and the filing of <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378, in 1981, eleven Miranda^-related cases came before the new Supreme Court. The prosecution won eleven out of eleven. Perhaps even more significantly, <em>certiorari </em>had been granted at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>request of the prosecution in nine out of the eleven cases. <em>Miranda </em>was clearly suffering disfavored status. Indeed, in <em>Dickerson v. United States, </em>Chief Justice Rehnquist, after expressing some doubt as to \u201c[wjhether or not we would agree with Miranda\u2019s reasoning and its resulting rule, were we addressing the issue in the first instance,\u201d 530 U.S. at 443, 120 S.Ct. at 2336, 147 L.Ed.2d at 419, explained why there was no compelling need to overturn 34 years of <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">If anything <em>our subsequent cases have reduced the impact of the Miranda rule on legitimate law enforcement, </em>while reaffirming the decision\u2019s core ruling that unwarned statements may not be used as evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">530 U.S. at 443, 120 S.Ct. at 2336, 147 L.Ed.2d at 420 (emphasis supplied). The Court apparently felt that it had chained the tiger.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">During that initial decade of unrelieved disfavor, <em>Miranda </em>was held to be inapplicable because of the absence of custody in three situations. <em>Beckwith v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 341, 96 S.Ct. 1612, 48 L.Ed.2d 1 (1976); <em>United States v. Manduja-no, </em>425 U.S. 564, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 48 L.Ed.2d 212 (1976); <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977). It was found to be inapplicable because of the absence of interrogation in <em>Rhode Island, v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The <em>Miranda </em>rights were held not to have been adequately invoked in [Warden] <em>Fare v. Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979). They were held' to have been easily waived in <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975), and <em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979). A <em>Miranda </em>violation was given diminished status in federal habeas corpus appeals in [Warden] <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In that decade of unbroken disfavor, the three cases most erosive of the constitutional status of <em>Miranda </em>were the three where there were found to have been violations of <em>Miranda </em>calling for the exclusion of statements from the prosecution\u2019s case in chief. In none, however, was the <em>Miranda </em>violation then held to have been of sufficient gravity to trigger the exclusion of either 1) derivative evidence or 2) the subsequent use of the Miranda-yiolative statement. In <em>Michigan v. Tucker, </em>417 U.S. 433, 94 S.Ct. 2357, 41 L.Ed.2d 182 (1974), Justice Rehnquist wrote for the Court in holding that a <em>Miranda </em>violation was not enough to trigger second-level exclusion under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. He distinguished police conduct that \u201cdirectly infringed upon respondent\u2019s right against compulsory self-incrimination\u201d and the \u201cseparate question\u201d of \u201cwhether it instead violated only the prophylactic rules developed to protect that right.\u201d 417 U.S. at 439, 94 S.Ct. 2357. The opinion went on to announce that the \u201cprocedural safeguards\u201d created by <em>Miranda </em>\u201cwere not themselves rights protected by the Constitution but were instead measures to insure that the right against compulsory self-incrimination was protected\u201d and to \u201cprovide practical reinforcement for the right.\u201d 417 U.S. at 444, 94 S.Ct. 2357. <em>Michigan v. Tucker </em>concluded that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asa\"><em>police conduct </em>at issue here did not abridge respondent\u2019s constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, but <em>departed only from the prophylactic standards </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>later <em>laid doivn </em>by this Court <em>in Miranda to safeguard that privilege.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">417 U.S. at 446, 94 S.Ct. 2857 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), a Miranda-violative statement was excluded from the prosecution\u2019s case in chief. As a mere <em>Miranda </em>violation, however, it could still be used for impeachment purposes in rebuttal. <em>Harris v. New York </em>must be contrasted with <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978). In <em>Mincey, </em>a statement was excludable from the prosecution\u2019s case in chief because it was involuntary. As a true violation of a core constitutional principle, the statement, under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine, could not be used for any purpose, including impeachment. The \u201cmere <em>Miranda\u201d </em>violation in <em>Harris </em>had no such toxic powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\"><em>Oregon v. Hass, </em>420 U.S. 714, 95 S.Ct. 1215, 43 L.Ed.2d 570 (1975), was another case in which a statement had violated <em>Miranda </em>but was nonetheless deemed voluntary. Although it could not be used in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief, it could be used for impeachment purposes. The Court contrasted statements obtained in actual violation of the privilege against compelled self-incrimination \u201cas opposed to [those] taken in violation of <em>Miranda.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Even after that initial decade of disfavor, the Supreme Court caselaw regularly continued to distinguish between true constitutional principles and the \u201cprophylactic rules\u201d of <em>Miranda. </em>See <em>Withrow v. Williams, </em>507 U.S. 680, 690-91, 113 S.Ct. 1745, 123 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) <em>(\u201cMiranda\u2019s </em>safeguards are not constitutional in character.\u201d); <em>Connecticut v. Barrett, </em>479 U.S. 523, 528, 107 S.Ct. 828, 93 L.Ed.2d 920 (1987) (\u201c[T]he <em>Miranda </em>Court adopted prophylactic rules designed to insulate the exercise of Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d); <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 457-58, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994); <em>Duckworth v. Eagan, </em>492 U.S. 195, 203, 109 S.Ct. 2875, 106 L.Ed.2d 166 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>In <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984), the Supreme Court reiterated that the \u201cprophylactic <em>Miranda </em>warnings ... are not themselves protected by the Constitution.\u201d 467 U.S. at 654, 104 S.Ct. 2626. In recognizing the \u201cpublic safety exception\u201d to the \u201cprophylactic rules enunciated in Miranda,\u201d 467 U.S. at 653, 104 S.Ct. 2626, the Supreme Court expressly acknowledged that if the <em>Miranda </em>warnings had been an imperative of the Fifth Amendment itself, such an exigency exception would have been impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">As already discussed, <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>is peppered with such characterizations of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>less than full constitutional status. Indeed, in his dissent in <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>Justice Brennan accurately summed up what the Supreme Court had done, for better or for worse, with <em>Miranda v. Arizona.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqO\">[T]he Court has engaged of late in a studied campaign to strip the <em>Miranda </em>decision piecemeal and to undermine the rights <em>Miranda </em>sought to secure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">470 U.S. at 319, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (dissenting opinion by Brennan, J.). In his dissent in <em>Dickerson v. United States, </em>Justice Scalia agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">Despite the Court\u2019s Orwellian assertion to the contrary, it is undeniable that later cases have \u201cundermined <em>[Miranda\u2019s </em>] doctrinal underpinnings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">530 U.S. at 461, 120 S.Ct. at 2346, 147 L.Ed.2d at 431 (dissenting opinion by Scalia, J.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">C. <em>Dickerson </em>at the Fourth Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">The Supreme Court\u2019s relegation of <em>Miranda, </em>over the decades, to .something less than full constitutional status rendered inevitable the question that ultimately came before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>166 F.3d 667 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">In the first wave of virulent anti <em>-Miranda </em>feeling following the case\u2019s promulgation in 1966, the Congress of the United States enacted in 1968 what became 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501. That provision made the admissibility of confessions in federal trials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>turn exclusively on traditional voluntariness. Both the Fourth Circuit in its <em>Dickerson </em>opinion and the Supreme Court in <em>Dickerson v. United States, </em>530 U.S. at 436, 120 S.Ct. at 2332, 147 L.Ed.2d at 415, recognized that Congress\u2019s intent had been to overrule <em>Miranda:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\"><em>Given \u00a7 8501\u2019s </em>express designation of voluntariness as the touchstone of admissibility, its <em>omission of any warning requirement, </em>and the instruction for trial courts to consider a nonexclusive list of factors relevant to the circumstances of a confession, <em>we agree with the Court of Appeals that Congress intended by its enactment to overrule Miranda.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4\">(Emphasis supplied). For 30 years, that Congressional act was essentially overlooked, largely because the Justice Department steadfastly refused to invoke it.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Initially, Dickerson had been indicted for bank robbery in northern Virginia. He was questioned by the F.B.I. without having been first <em>Mirandized. </em>The statement he gave was nonetheless deemed voluntary in traditional terms. The federal District Court suppressed that statement because of the <em>Miranda </em>violation. The government took an interlocutory appeal to the Fourth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">At the Fourth Circuit, the theory raised by the court <em>sua sponte </em>was that since the <em>Miranda </em>catechism was simply a set of \u201cimplementing\u201d or \u201cprophylactic\u201d rules, it represented nothing more than the Supreme Court\u2019s acting in its supervisory capacity. In that capacity, of course, such rules could be overridden by an act of Congress. As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Dickerson v. United States, </em>530 U.S. at 436, 120 S.Ct. at 2332, 147 L.Ed.2d at 415:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">Congress retains the ultimate authority to modify or set aside any judicially created rules of evidence and procedure that are not required by the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The theory continued that in enacting \u00a7 3501, Congress had overridden <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">The issue before the Fourth Circuit was clear. If <em>Miranda </em>were, indeed, constitutional, 1) it could not be modified by an act of Congress and 2)it was binding on the states. If, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>other hand, <em>Miranda </em>were not constitutional, 1) the Congress could override it with an enactment such as \u00a7 3501 and 2) the states were at liberty to ignore it.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The Fourth Circuit concluded that both the wording of the <em>Miranda </em>opinion itself and its subsequent characterizations by the Supreme Court indicated that <em>Miranda </em>was not of full constitutional stature.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">[W]hether Congress has the authority to enact \u00a7 3501 turns on whether the rule set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Miranda </em>is required by the Constitution. Clearly it is not. <em>At no point did the Supreme Court in Miranda refer to the warnings as constitutional rights. ... Since deciding Miranda, the Supreme Court has consistently referred to the Miranda warnings as \u201cprophylactic\u201d and \u201cnot themselves rights protected by the Constitution.\u201d </em>We have little difficulty concluding, therefore, that \u00a7 3501, enacted ... pursuant to Congress\u2019s unquestioned power to establish the rules of procedure and evidence in the federal courts, is constitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">166 F.3d at 672 (emphasis supplied). The Fourth Circuit forced the Supreme Court to confront its own awkward handling of an embarrassing precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">D. <em>Dickerson </em>at the Supreme Court</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">As the <em>Dickerson </em>case arrived at the Supreme Court, the inertial weight attaching to the' 34-year-old precedent was extremely heavy. After acknowledging that the Court might not \u201cagree with <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>reasoning and its resulting rule, were [it] addressing the issue in the first instance,\u201d 530 U.S. at 443, 120 S.Ct. at 2336, 147 L.Ed.2d at 419, the Court went on nonetheless to observe that \u201cthe principles of <em>stare decisis </em>weigh heavily against overruling it now.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In concluding that there was no compelling reason to overrule <em>Miranda, </em>even if as a purely academic matter it had been wrongly decided, Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out two factors in favor of not disturbing the <em>status quo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>One was that \u201cour subsequent cases have reduced the impact of the <em>Miranda </em>rule on legitimate law enforcement.\u201d 530 U.S. at 443, 120 S.Ct. at 2336, 147 L.Ed.2d at 420. The need was not as great as it might have been in 1966. The other was that, even for those who dislike <em>Miranda, </em>the cure might prove to be worse than the disease.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">[E]xperience suggests that the totality-of-the-circumstances test which \u00a7 3501 seeks to revive is more difficult than <em>Miranda </em>for law enforcement officers to conform to and for courts to apply in a consistent manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">If <em>Miranda </em>were overruled, challenges to confessions would return to the <em>pre-Miranda </em>\u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d test for assessing either 1) compulsion under the Fifth Amendment or 2) voluntariness under the Fourteenth Amendment (they are precisely the same thing). Suppression hearings that now take an hour could again, as they once did, take a day or a day and a half. In any event, the Supreme Court declined the invitation to overrule <em>Miranda.

Without then bringing itself to say that <em>Miranda </em>was, indeed, constitutional, the Court was content to observe that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4E\">the majority opinion [in <em>Miranda </em>] is replete with statements indicating that <em>the majority thought it was announcing a constitutional rule.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">530 U.S. at 439, 120 S.Ct. at 2333, 147 L.Ed.2d at 417 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Then engaging in what Justice Scalia denigrated as \u201cbootstrapping,\u201d the majority opinion predicated much of its argument for <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>constitutionality on the fact that <em>\u201cwe </em>have consistently applied <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>rule to prosecutions arising in state courts.\u201d 530 U.S. at 438, 120 S.Ct. at 2333, 147 L.Ed.2d at 416. The argument was that <em>Miranda </em>must be constitutional or the Court would not have been able to apply it to the states. There is an element there for reasoning backward from the effect to the cause. The impression is unmistakable that the affirming of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>constitutional status came through clenched teeth.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Through clenched teeth or not, the <em>Dickerson </em>decision is clear. Whether denominated as \u201cconstitutional\u201d <em>per se </em>or as \u201cprophylactic rules implementing a constitutional protection,\u201d the <em>Miranda </em>rules are both 1) constitutionally binding on the states and 2) beyond the power of the national Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>gress to modify or abrogate. Whether the rules are constitutional or quasi-constitutional, a violation of them, unlike a violation of the Fourth Amendment, is not so grave as 1) to prevent secondary use of a statement for purposes such as impeachment or 2) to trigger the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Thus, the continuing vitality of cases such as <em>Hams v. New York, Michigan v. Tucker, </em>and <em>Oregon v. Hass </em>is not in any way compromised by <em>Dickerson v. United States. </em>More pertinently, <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>has not, to the appellant\u2019s chagrin, suffered any doctrinal erosion. Chief .Justice Rehnquist\u2019s majority opinion expressly reaffirmed that decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">The Court of Appeals also noted that in <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>we stated that \u201c[t]he <em>Miranda </em>exclusionary rule ... services the Fifth Amendment and sweeps more broadly than \u2022 the Fifth Amendment itself. <em>Our decision in that case-refusing to apply the traditional fruits\u2019 doctHne developed in Fourth amendment cases </em>\u2014 does not prove that <em>Miranda </em>is a nonconstitutional decision, but <em>simply recognizes the fact that unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment are different from unwarned interrogation under the Fifth Amendment. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">530 U.S. at 441, 120 S.Ct. at 2335, 147 L.Ed.2d at 418 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\"><em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>therefore, is just as foreclosing to the appellant\u2019s present subcontention as if <em>Dickerson v. United States </em>had never been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">E. The Maryland Caselaw on \u201cMere <em>Miranda </em>\u201d Violations</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Both the Court of Appeals and this Court have regularly subscribed to <em>Oregon v. Elstad\u2019s </em>holding that a mere <em>Miranda </em>violation, not amounting to. undergirding involuntariness, does not trigger exclusion under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. In <em>Williams v. State, </em>342 Md. 724, 761, 679 A.2d 1106 (1996), Judge Chasanow stated for the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>We also reject Williams\u2019s contention that the \u201cillegality\u201d of the first, pr <em>e-Miranda </em>statement \u201ctainted\u201d the second and third statements. Assuming the first statement was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>it was not coerced or involuntarily made. Since the second and third statements were made voluntarily after Williams received a <em>Miranda </em>warning, any \u201cillegality\u201d did not taint those subsequent statements. <em>See Oregon v. Elstad.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In <em>Thomas v. State, </em>128 Md.App. 274, 295, 737 A.2d 622 (1999), Judge Bloom observed for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">[E]ven if the hospital conversation had been excluded, appellant\u2019s confession after receiving the standard <em>Miranda </em>warning would have been admissible in the absence of evidence that either it or the hospital conversation had been coerced. <em>See Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985), in which the Supreme Court held that a subsequent confession after <em>Miranda </em>warnings was not rendered inadmissible by prior uncoerced remarks in response to interrogation without <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In <em>Brashear v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 709, 721-22, 603 A.2d 901 (1992), Judge Garrity wrote for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">[T]he Supreme Court has ruled that \u201ca suspect who has once responded to unwarned, yet uncoercive, questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite <em>Miranda, </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 318, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 1298, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985). Thus, if the appellant did make an inadmissible statement to Corporal Smith, the statement, by virtue of the <em>Elstad, </em>holding, did not taint the later statements given at the police station.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Ironically, even if <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>had never been written, our result would not be different. In four <em>pre-Elstad </em>decisions, this Court anticipated the <em>Elstad </em>result and held that a mere <em>Miranda </em>violation would not trigger the exclusion of derivative evidence under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>In <em>Bartram v.

State, </em>29 Md.App. 62, 67, 349 A.2d 393 (1975), <em>aff'd, </em>278 Md. 302, 363 A.2d 243 (1976), Chief Judge Orth stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">Thus, evidence obtained without full compliance with the <em>Miranda </em>dictates is not, for that reason, always to be excluded. So ... the failure to advise an accused during a custodial interrogation ... of his right to appointed counsel, did not in the circumstances existent, infringe against the right against compulsory self-incrimination but only violated the prophylactic rules developed to protect that right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">In <em>In Re Appeal No. 245, </em>29 Md.App. 131, 349 A.2d 434 (1975), we distinguished between a mere <em>Miranda </em>violation, which would not trigger the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine, and a truly involuntary confession, which would. In <em>Fried v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 643, 402 A.2d 101 (1979), Judge Lowe expressly rejected reliance on <em>United States v. Bayer, </em>331 U.S. 532, 67 S.Ct. 1394, 91 L.Ed. 1654 (1947), on which the appellant bases much of his argument in this case, and held to the contrary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">[W]e have held that the doctrine of taint, <em>i.e., </em>the fruit of the poisonous tree, does not follow from a \u201cmere <em>Miranda </em>\u201d violation, but applies only to confessions involuntarily obtained as by improper inducements and coercion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">42 Md.App. at 646, 402 A.2d 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">As these cases illustrate, Maryland is obviously not following <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>grudgingly. It is rather the case that <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>has confirmed the correctness of what was Maryland\u2019s predisposition in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u201cFruit of the Poisonous Tree\u201d Doctrine: Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The appellant makes an alternative argument that even if his written confession were not excludable under the federal Fifth Amendment, it should, because of the antecedent <em>Miranda </em>violation, be nonetheless deemed the excludable \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d under Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. He is asking us to base a decision in his favor on \u201cindependent state grounds.\u201d What he is actually urging, however, is \u201cindependent state grounds\u201d with a bizarre twist.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Independent state grounds means that a sovereign state may adopt its own constitutional protections which are broader than those provided by the United States Constitution. The state may then, by statute and caselaw, develop its own rules and procedures for administering such constitutional provisions. The concept of independent state grounds was badly perverted in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s, however, when some state courts, chagrined at what they felt to be a conservative turn by the United States Supreme Court away from its prevailing philosophy of the 1960\u2019s, used the doctrine to rally around dissenting Supreme Court opinions as to federal law rather than follow prevailing Supreme Court opinions with which they disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The appellant similarly is asking us, under the guise of independent state grounds, to reject the opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>and to apply, in Maryland, the dissenting opinion of Justice Brennan in that case. We are being asked to modify the Supreme Court\u2019s mandated procedures for applying the federal \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine for derivative evidence resulting from a violation of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The perversion of \u201cindependent state grounds\u201d occurs when the concept is used not to interpret and apply genuinely independent state law, but when it is misused to adopt a preferred, but minority, version of federal law over the prevailing, but non-preferred, version of that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>A. <em>Lodowski v. State</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">An insurmountable impediment to so radical a proposal is the opinion of Judge Orth for the Court of Appeals in <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>307 Md. 233, 513 A.2d 299 (1986). In <em>Lodowski, </em>the appellant, frustrated by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986), asked the Court of Appeals to interpret Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights more liberally than the Supreme Court had interpreted the Fifth Amendment. Judge Orth first explained the sound historic reasons for holding the two constitutional provisions to be <em>in pari materia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">Generally, comparable provisions of the two constitutions are deemed to be in <em>pari materia. </em>Here the relevant comparable provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions were adopted in times not far removed from each other____ [T]he concern with self-incrimination, assistance of counsel and due process of law was shared by those who framed the Federal Constitution and those who framed the Maryland Constitution. This' concern on the part of the drafters of each constitution was implanted in the same climate and nurtured by the same hopes and fears. The provisions, so alike in aim and content, were proposed and accepted' by those anxious to preserve the freedom and rights they had so arduously won----We cannot say, in the frame of reference here, that the Federal provisions and the State provisions are to be construed and applied differently. This view is amply supported by what we have said in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">307 Md. at 245-46, 513 A.2d 299. The Court of Appeals then went on to reject the suggestion that Maryland diverge from the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-11\">Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights declares \u201c[t]hat no man ought to be compelled to give' evidence against himself in a criminal case.\u201d We said in <em>Blum v. State </em>that the Fifth Amendment was in <em>pari materia </em>with Article 22. We iterated this view in <em>Richardson v. State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>stating that \u201cthe privilege against compelled self-incrimination in Article 22 ... has long been recognized as being in <em>pari materia </em>with its federal counterpart.\u201d <em>See also State v. Panagoulis; Brown v. </em>State....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">Lodowski urges that we diverge from the rationale of the holding in <em>Burbine </em>as to the Fifth Amendment and hold that under Article 22 his statement was inadmissible because the conduct of the police negated any ability he had to waive effectively his privilege against self-incrimination.... We decline to deviate on a State level under Article 22 from the rationale of <em>Burbine </em>regarding the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">307 Md. at 246-47, 513 A.2d 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\"><em>Lodowski v. State, </em>of course, is binding authority on us. Even if it were not, we would choose to follow it, because we subscribe to its rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">B. Independent State Grounds and Reinventing the Wheel</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Beyond <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>there is a vaporous unreality about what the appellant is asking us to do. The request illustrates a chronic problem with most latter-day champions of independent state grounds. They wander randomly back and forth across the state-federal line as if that boundary did not exist. They commingle the two bodies of law as if they were part of a single amalgamated whole. In this case, unlike <em>Lodowski, </em>the appellant is not asking for a more expansive interpretation of a Maryland constitutional provision. He is asking us to modify an exclusively federal procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">This alternative argument made by the appellant is exclusively procedural. The thing the appellant would like us to modify, by overriding <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>in the operation of the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. That doctrine, dealing with the exclusion of secondary or derivative evidence, does not even come into play until there is established the so-called primary taint, to wit, a constitutional violation calling for the exclusion of the direct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The major premise for the appellant\u2019s exclusionary syllogism in this case was the violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona. Miranda, </em>however, is exclusively federal law. A <em>Miranda </em>violation cannot trigger an exclusively Maryland-based exclusionary procedure. Maryland has no local counterpart of <em>Miranda. </em>If the Supreme Court overruled <em>Miranda </em>tomorrow, there would be no residual <em>Miranda </em>law in Maryland. There is no local prescribed catechism of rights and advisements. We could, by statute or caselaw, have created such a body of Maryland law, of course, but we never have. <em>Miranda </em>and its vast implementing progeny are exclusively federal phenomena. Even if we had a home-grown Maryland \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine, it would have to be triggered by a Maryland constitutional violation. A Maryland exclusionary syllogism cannot start with a <em>Miranda </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">If the fact that a <em>Miranda </em>infraction is not a violation of Maryland law were- not foreclosing enough to the appellant\u2019s independent state grounds argument, the <em>coup-de-grace </em>would be that neither is the entire \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. The two definitive examinations of that doctrine were those by Chief Judge Orth for this Court in <em>Ryon v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 62, 63-72, 349 A.2d 393 (1975), and by Judge Cole for the Court of Appeals in <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>301 Md. 542, 547-50, 483 A.2d 1255 (1984). They both made it transparently clear that it is a federal exclusionary doctrine imposed on Maryland from above and not a doctrine that has any local roots.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">There is no Maryland counterpart to <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>251 U.S. 385, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319 (1920). There are no Maryland counterparts to <em>Nardone v. United States, </em>308 U.S. 338, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307 (1939), and <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). If the Supreme Court were to overrule <em>Silverthome Lumber Co., Nardone, </em>and <em>Wong Sun </em>tomorrow, there would be no mechanism for the exclusion of derivative evidence in Maryland. It might be wise to investigate what Maryland law really is before opting for independent state grounds. Defendants had best be careful what they wish for, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>for significant chunks of our truly independent state law come out of the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s, and that was not a happy time for criminal defendants. That state of the law, however, is what independent state grounds might be sending defendants back to, and not to a dissenting opinion by Justice Brennan in <em>Oregon v. Elstad.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Indeed, our Court of Appeals regularly rejected the reception of even the federal \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine in Maryland, <em>Prescoe v. State, </em>231 Md. 486, 191 A.2d 226 (1963); <em>Mefford v. State, </em>235 Md. 497, 201 A.2d 824 (1964), until it recognized in <em>Everhart v. State, </em>274 Md. 459, 479 n. 4, 337 A.2d 100 (1975), that it had no choice but to accept it. See also <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>301 Md. at 547 n. 2, 483 A.2d 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">If we, in flight from <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>were to look at independent Maryland law, therefore, we might not be modifying the operation of the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. We might well be rejecting it in its entirety. If we had ever promulgated our own \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine, we could, of course, modify it, but we have never had such doctrine as a part of Maryland law. We may not modify a procedure that is not ours.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Voluntariness of the <em>Miranda </em>Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Before making the written confession now in issue, the appellant, at approximately 9:00 p.m., was advised of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>and he agreed to waive those rights. This particular subcontention is that his waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Just prior to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, to be sure, the appellant, while still <em>unMirandized, </em>had, according to his interrogator, \u201chung his head down and said, \u2018Yeah, they were broken down on the side of the road, and that\u2019s when this white guy came up to give them a jump start, and the other people with him shot the man and took his truck.\u201d At that moment, the interrogator told the appellant that he \u201cneeded to get that in writing.\u201d The <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waiver immediately followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The appellant claims that, under those circumstances, the waiver was not voluntary. That may well be so, but it does not follow as a matter of law. The hearing judge found that the waiver was voluntary, and there was abundant evidence to support such a finding. The appellant signed and initialed a Waiver of Rights form which was introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Most significant, there was only one witness who testified at the suppression hearing. He was Defective Sergeant Norman P. Miller, who conducted the interrogation. He testified to an atmosphere that was cordial, relaxed, and cooperative. With respect to his credibility, Judge Spellbring found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">[Hjaving had the opportunity to observe Detective Miller when he testified, I find Detective Miller\u2019s testimony to be credible. And I do believe and give credence to the testimony that he gave in this hearing on May 6th, 1999.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The only person who might have testified to the contrary was the appellant himself. If the appellant felt too pressured to resist, realistically only the appellant could have told the judge that. The appellant chose not to testify. There was no testimony, therefore, to refute that of Sergeant Miller. Fully supported by Sergeant Miller\u2019s testimony, Judge Spellbring found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">Mr. Ashford was advised of his rights under the <em>Miranda </em>decision pursuant to the Prince George\u2019s County Police form that was received as State\u2019s Exhibit Number 1.... The form was begun at approximately 8:56 p.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">Pursuant to that form that had been received, Mr. Ash-ford was advised of his rights. He waived those rights by marking the appropriate yes or no block after the questions and then initialing that line. He then signed the form also, indicating that he had a 12th grade education. The statement was then begun with the first paragraph on the first page being written by Mr. Ashford.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Judge Spellbring\u2019s ruling with respect to the voluntariness of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver inevitably followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">Based on these findings of fact, I find that Mr. Ashford was advised fully of his rights under the <em>Miranda </em>decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>pursuant to State\u2019s Exhibit number 1; that he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived those rights pursuant to the responses to the waiver questions on State\u2019s Exhibit number 1 and his initials and signature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">There is no conceivable way that we could reverse that ruling. Accordingly, we hereby affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Voluntariness of the Statement</p>\n<p id=\"A5M\">For essentially the same reasons that we affirmed Judge Spellbring\u2019s ruling that the appellant\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was voluntary, we also affirm Judge Spellbring\u2019s ruling that the ensuing statement itself was voluntary. There is almost a Newtonian principle at work that the voluntariness that validated the <em>Miranda </em>waiver continued unabated through the immediately ensuing statement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Once again, the only witness at the suppression hearing with respect to the statement was Sergeant Miller. Not surprisingly, his testimony described an interrogation session overflowing with bonhomie. Once again, Judge Spellbring found Sergeant Miller\u2019s testimony to have been fully credible. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Judge Spellbring\u2019s findings-of first-level facts, fully supported by Sergeant Miller\u2019s testimony, are accepted for purposes of this review as gospel. <em>Marr v. State, </em>134 Md.App. 152, 163, 759 A.2d 327 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">When the issue is voluntariness, rather than <em>Miranda </em>compliance, moreover, the failure of a defendant to testify almost forecloses any chance of prevailing. If the issue is <em>Miranda </em>compliance, by contrast, the testimony of the defendant is not nearly so critical. The purely objective issues of 1) whether the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given, 2) precisely when they were given, and 3) what the warnings consisted of can be attacked by forceful cross-examination of the interrogating officer or by getting two officers to contradict each other. The voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s response to possible pressures, on the other hand, is very subjective. Only the defendant can truly tell us what was going on in the defendant\u2019s mind. Without such testimony, there is usually no direct evidence of involuntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The appellant grandly quotes <em>Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 483, 536 A.2d 622 (1988), for the proposition that a confession is inadmissible if it has been \u201cinduced by force, undue influence, improper promises, or threats.\u201d That unremarkable proposition is then left hanging there, as he offers no shred of evidence of any \u201cforce\u201d or of \u201cundue influence\u201d or. of \u201cimproper promises\u201d or of \u201cthreats\u201d or, indeed, of having had his confession \u201cinduced by\u201d anything. He asks us to guess what was in his head. He actually asks us to second-guess Judge Spellbring for not having guessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">As Judge Spellbring found, the appellant, when interrogated, was in lawful custody for the \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d case. The appellant was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The appellant was given cigarettes, a Coca Cola, a hamburger, and water during the .interview. Most significant, Judge Spellbring found that the appellant had affirmatively expressed a desire to talk to the officers. ' In rendering his opinion, Judge Spellbring observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">The statement was then begun with the first paragraph on the first page being written by Mr. Ashford.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The question and answers subsequent to that paragraph were in the handwriting of Detective Miller, the statement was concluded at 2:48 a.m. on October 20th. Detective Miller denies that any promises, threats, or inducements were made to Mr. Ashford to obtain this statement. <em>He testified that Mr. Ashford said that he ivas glad to talk to him.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">(Emphasis supplied). Judge Spellbring expressly found that at the very outset of the interrogation, \u201cMr. Ashford told Detective Miller that he did want to speak to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Even with respect to the earlier statements, suppressed because of the <em>Miranda </em>violation, Judge Spellbring nonetheless found \u201cthat they are voluntary based on the evidence before me.\u201d The earlier <em>Miranda </em>violation had no adverse impact on the voluntariness of the subsequent statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3\">I find that based upon the willingness and desire even of Mr. Ashford to talk to the Prince George\u2019s County Police on October 19th, that the statements taken without advisement and waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights do not affect the volun-tariness of the statements that I have received as State\u2019s Exhibit number 2, the written statement and the question and answer statement of Mr. Ashford.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Judge Spellbring\u2019s final ruling was amply supported by his findings of fact and by the evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">I find that because of his willingness and desire as expressed to the police to talk to them on that night, that the statement received as State\u2019s Exhibit number 2 is a voluntary statement made after the appropriate advice and waiver of the rights under the <em>Miranda </em>decision as contained without State\u2019s Exhibit number 1, and for the reasons contained herein I will deny the defense motion to suppress State\u2019s Exhibit number 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">We affirm that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">3. THE TESTIMONIAL PRIVILEGE ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">The appellant\u2019s contention that Judge Spellbring erroneously permitted a testimonial reference by a police sergeant to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>statement made by the appellant\u2019s wife actually consists of the two subcontentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">a. that the State violated the testimonial privilege protecting confidential communication between husband and wife, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">b. that the declaration by the appellant\u2019s wife contained hearsay within inadmissible hearsay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">As the State was attempting to qualify the appellant\u2019s written confession for admission into evidence, Sergeant Miller was on the stand explaining the circumstances of the interrogation session. Initially the appellant had denied any involvement in the Youmans murder. It was only when Sergeant Miller confronted the appellant with the fact that his wife had revealed to the police his involvement in the murder that the appellant broke down and admitted that involvement. The critical testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">[The State]: Okay. And initially, what did [appellant] say to you during the initial stages of the conversation that you had with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">[Sgt. Miller]: Okay; In the initial statement he stated he had nothing to do with it. And then after that, after I told him that we heard from his wife, who was involved in it\u2014 [Defense Counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">[Sgt. Miler]: After I told him that, the statement was then taken and he admitted to his involvement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">[The State]: Specifically, what did you tell [appellant] regarding the conversation with his wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">[Sgt. Miller]: <em>I told him his wife had already told us </em>that\u2014 [Defense Counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-13\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-14\">[Sgt. <em>Miller]: </em>\u2014 that <em>[appellant] was involved with this, with Ed, Donnie and John, who are associates of his.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-15\">[The State]: And after you told [appellant] that, what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>[Sgt. Miller]: After that I read him his rights and took a statement from him, where he admitted to his involvement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The Testimonial Privilege For Confidential Spousal Communications</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The appellant now claims that his privilege to exclude a confidential communication between husband and wife was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">A. Which Spousal Privilege Is Being Invoked?</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Just for quick orientation, it behooves us to note that there are in Maryland two spousal privileges. The first concerns protecting confidential communication between husband and wife. Both its history and its contours were thoroughly explored by Judge Wilner in <em>Brown v. State, </em>359 Md. 180, 753 A.2d 84 (2000). It was first enacted by the Maryland General Assembly in 1864, was apparently inadvertently repealed in 1876, and was reenacted in 1888. It is now codified as Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 9-105.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">One spouse is not competent to disclose any confidential communication between the spouses occurring during their marriage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">That privilege is available in civil and criminal trials alike and may be asserted by the spouse who uttered the confidential communication. See <em>Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 380 A.2d 49 (1977); <em>State v. Enriquez, </em>327 Md. 365, 609 A.2d 343 (1992). See also Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook, </em>\u00a7 904(B), pp. 322-23; Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>(1st ed.1987), Sect. 505.2, pp. 548-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">The second spousal privilege, limited to criminal trials only, provides that one spouse, albeit competent to testify if he or she wishes to do so, is, generally speaking, not a compellable witness against the other spouse who is on trial for a crime. That privilege was thoroughly explored by Judge Hollander in <em>Hagez v. State, </em>110 Md.App. 194, 207-27, 676 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>A.2d 992 (1996). That privilege is codified in <em>Courts Article, </em>\u00a7 9-106, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">(a) In general. \u2014 The spouse of a person on trial for a crime may not be compelled to testify as an adverse witness unless the charge involves:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">(1) The- abuse of a child under 18; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">(2) Assault in any degree in which the spouse is a victim if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">(i) The person on trial was previously charged with assault in any degree or' assault and battery of the spouse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">(ii) The spouse was sworn to testify at the previous trial; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">(iii) The spouse refused to testify at the previous trial on the basis of the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">See Murphy, \u00a7 904(A), p. 322; McLain, \u00a7 505.1, pp. 545-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">The difference between the two spousal privileges is well explained by Murphy, <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook, </em>\u00a7 904, p. 321.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-13\">Sections 9-105 and 9-106 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article contain <em>the spousal privileges. There are two. </em>One is held by the potential witness who is called to testify for the state in a criminal prosecution of his or her present spouse. <em>One is held by the person who seeks to prohibit disclosure of confidential communications between husband and wife at a time when they were married to one another. </em>C. J. 9-106 does not apply unless the witness and defendant are husband and wife at the moment when the' witness is called to the stand by the state. C.J. 9-105 applies to all confidential communications that occurred during the marriage regardless of whether the marital relationship has been terminated before trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">It is the confidential communication privilege, pursuant to \u00a7 9-105, that is being invoked by the appellant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>B. Testimonial Privileges Generally Are Disfavored</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">To place the issue, one involving the privilege for confidential spousal communications, in its proper framework, we begin with the universally recognized principle enunciated by Lord Chancellor Hardwicke in 1742 that \u201cthe public has a right to every man\u2019s evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 443, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 1655, 32 L.Ed.2d 212, 216 (1972); <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 688, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 2660, 33 L.Ed.2d 626, 644 (1972). The fundamental nature of this obligation<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the generally dim view taken by the common law toward any exemptions from this general obligation were well summarized by Dean Wigmore in 8 <em>Wigmore </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>on Evidence </em>(McNaughton rev. 1961), \u00a7 2192, \u201cDuty to give testimony,\u201d at 70:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">\u201cFor more than three centuries it has now been recognized as a fundamental maxim that the public (in the words sanctioned by Lord Hardwicke) has a right to every man\u2019s evidence. When we come to examine the various claims of exemption, we start with the primary assumption that there is a general duty to give what testimony one is capable of giving and that <em>any exemptions, which may exist are distinctly exceptional, being so many derogations from a positive general rule.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In <em>Ellison v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 321, 325-26, 500 A.2d 650 (1985), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>310 Md. 244, 528 A.2d 1271 (1987),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this Court explored the general disfavor with which testimonial privileges are viewed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">Following from this general obligation to assist the search for truth with all available knowledge, the ancillary principle is also well settled that <em>all of the various testimonial privileges, as derogations from full and accurate fact finding, are looked upon with disfavor. </em>Dean McCormick surveyed the landscape in his article <em>The Scope of Privilege in the Law of Evidence, </em>16 Tex. L.Rev. 447 (1938), and observed, at 468, \u201cThe courts often say that <em>privileges, since they curtain the truth from disclosure, should be strictly construed.\u201d </em>He went on more fully, at 469:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">\u201cThe development of judge-made privileges halted a century ago. The manifest destiny of evidence law is a progressive lowering of the barriers to truth. Seeing this tendency, the commentators who take a wide view, wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>er from the bench, the bar, or the schools, seem generally to advocate a narrowing of the field of privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">He concluded, \u201cOne may hazard a guess ... that in a secular sense privileges are on the way out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted in <em>In Re Cueto, </em>554 F.2d 14, 15 (2d Cir.1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">\u2022 \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of law that the public has a right to every persons\u2019 evidence. There are a small number of constitutional, common-law and statutory exceptions to that general rule, but <em>they have been neither \u2018lightly created nor expansively construed, for they are in derogation of the search for truth.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">The same general approach to testimonial privileges was followed by the Supreme Court in <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 690 n. 29, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972). \u201cThe creation of new testimonial privileges has been met with disfavor by commentators since such privileges obstruct the search for truth.\u201d <em>See also </em>Mason Ladd, <em>Privileges, </em>1969 Law &amp; Soc. Ord. 555; <em>Falsone v. United States, </em>205 F.2d 734 (5th Cir.1953). And see <em>Matthews v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 488, 503, 598 A.2d 813 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Murphy, <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook, </em>\u00a7 900, p. 312, speaks to the same effect.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-12\">It is obvious that evidence excluded on grounds of privilege increases the danger of an incorrect verdict. <em>The privilege laws are therefore given a narrow, strict construction.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 501.1, p. 463, has similarly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-15\">Not only are those statutory privileges which did not exist at common law strictly construed because they are in dero<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>gation of the common law, but <em>all privileges are strictly construed because they exclude relevant, reliable evidence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asi\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">1 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>(4th ed. by J.W. Strong, 1992), p. 275, also comments on the strict construction given to testimonial privileges.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">\u201cSince privileges operate to deny litigants access to every man\u2019s evidence, <em>the courts have generally construed them no more broadly than necessary to accomplish their basic purposes. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In <em>United States v. Mandel, </em>415 F.Supp. 1025, 1030 (D.Md. 1976), the federal District Court of Maryland also took note of the disfavored status of privileges generally.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">Since privileges by their very nature take from the trier of fact\u2019s consideration evidence which is frequently relevant, and are therefore considered to be in \u201cderogation of the search for truth\u201d, <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 709, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974), the law sustains a claim of privilege only when necessary to protect and preserve the interest of significant public importance that the specific privilege is designed to serve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">Dean Wigmore has pointed out not only that these exceptions from the general duty are \u201cto be discountenanced\u201d and \u201cshould be recognized only within the narrowest limits\u201d but also that, sometimes caught up in an apparently lofty purpose and losing their larger perspective, \u201cjudges and lawyers are apt to forget this exceptional nature.\u201d The appropriate attitude toward the testimonial privileges was unmistakably prescribed in 8 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>(McNaughton rev.1961), \u00a7 2192, \u201cDuty to give testimony,\u201d at 73:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\"><em>\u201c[A]ll privileges of exemption from this duty are exceptional, and are therefore to be discountenanced. </em>There must be good reason, plainly shown, for their existence. In the interest of developing scientifically the details of the various recognized privileges, judges and lawyers are apt to forget this exceptional nature. The presumption against their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>extension is not observed in spirit. The trend of the day is to expand them as if they were large and fundamental principles, worthy of pursuit into the remotest analogies. This attitude is an unwholesome one. The investigation of truth and the enforcement of testimonial duty demand the restriction, not the expansion, of these privileges. <em>They should be recognized only within the narrowest limits required by principle. Every step beyond these limits helps to provide, without any real necessity, an obstacle to the administration of justice.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Keeping in the forefront of the mind the appreciation that testimonial privileges are disfavored, rather than favored, and are to be strictly construed, rather than liberally construed, is important because that decided \u201ctilt\u201d may well be dispositive in close or ambiguous cases. As this Court observed in <em>Ellison v. State, </em>65 Md.App. at 326-27, 500 A.2d 650:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">[A] brief word is in order as to why it is important for us to determine whether testimonial privileges are in favor or disfavor. <em>In an otherwise close case </em>for the application of a testimonial privilege, a case that could plausibly go either way, <em>the \u201ctilt\u201d to be taken by the court is critically important. </em>If testimonial privileges are determined to be in favor, our \u201ctilt\u201d toward finding the privilege applicable could well be decisive in that direction. <em>If, </em>on the other hand, <em>testimonial privileges are determined to be in disfavor, our \u201ctilt\u201d toward finding the privilege inapplicable could well be decisive </em>in the other direction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">With that universally recognized \u201ctilt\u201d clearly in mind, we turn our attention to the information furnished to Sergeant Miller by the appellant\u2019s wife and to its admissibility under the circumstances of this case. The appellant\u2019s subcontention is flawed in a number of respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">C. The Privilege Was Never Invoked</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">First and foremost among the things that one claiming a privilege must do is actually to assert the privilege. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>this case, the appellant never did. Twice during the critical direct examination of Sergeant Miller, appellant\u2019s counsel said the single word, \u201cObjection.\u201d The most likely basis for such an objection was that the sergeant was testifying to a hearsay declaration by the appellant\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In no event was the subject of a confidential communication between the appellant and his wife alluded to nor was \u00a7 9-105 even mentioned. The privileged status of a confidential spousal communication as the basis for the objection was by no means apparent, for the entitlement to such a privilege would not be automatic but would require at least several preliminary showings.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">In <em>Matthews v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 488, 598 A.2d 813 (1991), an issue was whether the defendant had adequately invoked the privilege for a confidential spousal communication. This Court held that he had, based on the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">Prior to Ms. Matthews taking the stand before the jury, <em>appellant objected to her testimony on </em>both <em>confidential communication </em>and voluntariness <em>grounds. Specifically with respect to confidential communications, defense counsel stated:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\"><em>\u201cI want to state for the record my position regarding confidential communications. </em>My client is not waiving any privilege that he has in having those confidential communications with this witness excluded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">89 Md.App. at 500, 598 A.2d 813 (emphasis supplied). Under those circumstances, we held that the subject had been properly brought to the trial judge\u2019s attention.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\"><em>Clearly, the confidential communication issue was brought to the trial judge\u2019s attention, </em>and he overruled the objection on a continuing basis. This issue has been preserved for our review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">By contrast with <em>Matthews, </em>the unilluminating word \u201cobjection\u201d in this case, even repeated a second time, does not pass muster. A trial judge does not have to guess about the possibility of a testimonial privilege\u2019s being invoked. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the very issue of a testimonial privilege for a confidential spousal communication appears to be just as much an appellate afterthought as was the previously discussed <em>\u201cMerrick-Barber </em>Rule\u201d for unnamed confidential informants.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">D. The Wife\u2019s Information Was Not Shown to Have Been Based on a Communication</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Because a testimonial privilege is a disfavored departure from the norm, the burden is on the party asserting the privilege to prove each and every element necessary to establish entitlement to the privilege. <em>In Re Criminal Investigation No. 1/242Q, </em>326 Md. 1, 11, 602 A.2d 1220 (1992) (\u201c[T]he burden of establishing a privilege rests on the party asserting the privilege.\u201d). Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>(2d ed., 2001) states at \u00a7 501.1c, p. 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">The party or person seeking to invoke the privilege has the burden of proving necessary preliminary facts, to the trial judge\u2019s satisfaction under Md. Rule 5-104(a), by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Rule 504(a), in turn, provides that a trial judge may not relax the \u201cstrict application of the rules of evidence\u201d when dealing with \u201cthe existence of a privilege.\u201d And see <em>Hagez v. State, </em>110 Md.App. 194, 210 n. 5, 676 A.2d 992 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">At the outset, it was not established at the time the objection was ruled on that the police had necessarily even talked to the appellant\u2019s wife. Sergeant Miller had not testified that he had talked to the appellant\u2019s wife. He simply told the appellant that he had. It is a familiar interrogation technique to mislead a suspect and to deceive him into believing 1) that a confederate has implicated him, <em>Frazier v. Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 739, 89 S.Ct. 1420, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969); 2) that a relative has \u201cgiven him up;\u201d or 3) that even a non-existent witness has identified him as having been at the scene. In no event would the privilege extend to merely fabricated disclosures of a confidential communication, when a fabrication is used to stimulate a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Even assuming that the report from the appellant\u2019s wife were genuine, however, there was no showing that the wife\u2019s knowledge of her husband\u2019s involvement in the Youmans murder was based on any communication, let alone a confidential communication, from him to her. The burden, of course, was at all times on the appellant to establish his entitlement to the privilege by showing each and every necessary element.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Sergeant Miller\u2019s reference to what the wife had said consisted of a single sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">I told him his wife had already told us that he was involved with this, with Ed, Donnie, and John, who are associates of his.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">There is nothing in that sentence about the basis of the wife\u2019s knowledge. She may have seen her husband return home with the shotgun on the night of the murder. She may have seen him and his confederates dividing the spoils from the robbery of Youmans. She may have heard an account of what happened from Ed or from Donnie or from John. She may have overheard the group or some of the group discussing what had happened. She may have pieced together various fragments of information to form her conclusion as to the appellant\u2019s involvement. The burden of proving that the wife\u2019s knowledge was based on a communication from the appellant was on him, and he never carried that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">In his appellate brief, to be sure, the appellant points to clues in this regard that could be gleaned from the contents of his written confession. That confession, however, was not yet in evidence and its contents were not before Judge Spellbring as he made his ruling. Our job, of course, is not to ferret out the ultimate historic basis of the wife\u2019s knowledge, but only to determine whether Judge Spellbring was in error in making an evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">E. If There Was a Communication, It Was Not Shown to Have Been Confidential</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">Even if, <em>arguendo, </em>the wife\u2019s knowledge of the appellant\u2019s involvement were based on what he had said to her, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>would not by any means establish that the communication had necessarily been confidential. The burden of establishing the element of confidentiality was also on the appellant. It was not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">If the appellant had spoken to his wife in the presence of a third person, for instance, his communication would not be deemed to have been confidential. <em>Master v. Master, </em>223 Md. 618, 623, 166 A.2d 251 (1960) (\u201cWe find nothing confidential in the challenged communication of the husband to the wife. It was made in the presence of children old enough to understand fully what was being said.\u201d); <em>Gutridge v. State, </em>236 Md. 514, 516, 204 A.2d 557 (1964) (\u201cThe message sought to be sent to the appellant\u2019s wife through another cannot be regarded as confidential.\u201d); <em>Mulligan v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 600, 615, 252 A.2d 476 (1969) (\u201cThe admission made by the appellant to his wife in the presence of the police when he saw her in the room in the police station was not a confidential communication ..., as it was made in the hearing of a third person.\u201d). The burden is not on the State to establish the presence of third persons; it is on the appellant to establish their absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Groping, after the fact, to establish confidentiality, the appellant points to a single question and answer in the course of his written confession. As we have already discussed, the content of that confession has no bearing on the correctness of Judge Spellbring\u2019s evidentiary ruling because it was not something before him as he made that ruling. Just out of academic interest, however, we shall for a moment indulge the appellant, because his conclusion by no means ineluctably follows from his premises. The Q. and A. in the written statement was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">Q. Who else was told about this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">A. Nobody but my wife and Alicia. Alicia heard me say to John that he always likes to shoot somebody like he did that white guy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">From that, the appellant spins the following conclusion with absolute certainty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">Appellant\u2019s answer makes it clear that the appellant told his wife of his involvement, and furthermore on a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>occasion, Alicia overheard a conversation between appellant and an accomplice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">What is there so clear to the appellant is by no means so clear to us. The appellant\u2019s brief and ambiguous answer does not yield any certain conclusion that he was describing two separate conversations or that he spoke to his wife alone in one such conversation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The disfavor with which the law looks on testimonial privileges dictates that we resolve an ambiguity against the privilege, rather than in its favor. Again, however, this brief excursus is only academic, for none of this was before Judge Spellbring when he made the eviden-tiary ruling now in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">F. Testimonial Privilege Only Applies to Act of Testifying</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">What \u00a7 9-105 establishes, moreover, is not an undifferentiated shield against the disclosure of a confidential spousal communication, but only a testimonial privilege. The appellant could have invoked the privilege if his wife had opted to take the stand to testify as to statements that he had made to her in confidence. She never did so, however, and the privilege, even if <em>arguendo </em>satisfied in all other regards, has no bearing on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Although dealing with the privilege of one spouse not to be compelled to testify against the other spouse in a criminal case, now codified as \u00a7 9-106, rather than the confidential communication privilege, now codified as \u00a7 9-105, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Metz v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 15, 262 A.2d 331 (1970), sheds light on the principle that a testimonial privilege deals with testimony and not. with out-of-court disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Metz\u2019s wife invoked her privilege not to testify against her husband and it was honored. When a state trooper, however, went to testify as to what the wife had told him about Metz\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>guilt, defense counsel objected. When asked the basis for the objection, counsel\u2019s reply very much resembled the argument made by the appellant in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">Defense counsel replied, \u201cYour Honor, I am objecting on the grounds that Mrs. Metz has exercised her right not to testify against her husband and by allowing this statement in the Court will be allowing her to testify indirectly when she has refused to testify for the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">9 Md.App. at 18, 262 A.2d 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Metz\u2019s argument on appeal very much resembled the appellant\u2019s argument in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">Appellant claims that the admission of the wife\u2019s statements was error, relying on Code, Art. 35, \u00a7 4 [now \u00a7 9-106]. He argues that to allow the wife\u2019s statements in evidence through the officer, in the light of her refusal to testify, defeats the entire purpose of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Judge Orth, writing for the Court, held that the statutory privilege concerned testimony and not out-of-court statements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6J\">Mrs. Metz invoked her statutory right not to testify and it was honored. <em>We construe the statute to mean exactly what it says, that a husband or wife shall not be compelled \u201cto testify </em>as an adverse party or witness.\u201d <em>Mrs. Metz was not compelled to testify </em>and there was therefore no error. We are not persuaded that we should otherwise construe the specific and unambiguous language of the statute or convinced that we have the power, in any event, to depart from what we believed, to be the clear legislative intent. <em>We do not find that it was the legislative intent to exclude statements, </em>otherwise admissible, <em>voluntarily made by one spouse to police officers, </em>simply because that spouse refuses to testify against the other. We hold that Code, Art. 35, \u00a7 4 [now \u00a7 9-106] does not preclude the admission of the challenged statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">9 Md.App. at 19-20, 262 A.2d 331 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\"><em>Chase v. State, </em>120 Md.App. 141, 706 A.2d 613 (1998), deals directly with the spousal confidential communication privilege, codified as \u00a7 9-105. Judge Alpert there framed the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>May the State use evidence otherwise protected by the marital communication privilege, codified in Md.Code \u00a7 9-105 (1995 Repl.Vol.) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, in a determination of whether it has probable cause for an arrest or a search?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">120 Md.App. at 144, 706 A.2d 613. As we proceed to examine the Court\u2019s resolution of that question, we see no difference between using the revelation of a confidential communication to develop probable cause, as in that case, and to use it in the course of an interrogation, as in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Both probable cause to arrest Chase warrantlessly and probable cause for a warrant to search his home were predicated in significant measure on inculpatory statements that Chase had made to his wife and that the wife, in turn, revealed to the police. The appellant\u2019s argument there replicated precisely the appellant\u2019s argument here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\"><em>Appellant points out that the police relied </em>not just on the earring, but also <em>on the statement by appellant to Mrs. Chase that he had taken the jewelry from two young girls. Appellant argues that that statement was privileged under \u00a7 9-105, </em>and that the police were therefore not entitled to rely on it, in them probable cause assessment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">120 Md.App. at 146, 706 A.2d 613 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">This Court\u2019s holding was clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">We do not read \u00a7 9-105 to prohibit the use of privileged marital communications in a probable cause determination. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s argument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">Judge Alpert\u2019s opinion found support in the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Mazzone, </em>336 Md. 379, 389, 648 A.2d 978 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-13\">Our interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 9-105 and 9-106 is also strongly supported by the ruling of the Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Mazzone. </em>There, one of the primary issues was whether \u00a7 9-105 prohibits the State from eavesdropping and intercepting confidential communications between spouses. <em>The </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>Court ruled that \u00a7 9-105 only \u201cconcerns the competency of spouses to testify as to marital communications; </em>it does not prohibit or even mention eavesdropping.\u201d The Court also noted that <em>any attempt to broaden the reach of \u00a7 9-105 beyond the context of a judicial proceeding must be effectuated by the legislature, and not the courts.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">120 Md.App. at 147, 706 A.2d 618 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Both spousal privileges were held to be limited to testimony by witnesses in judicial proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">[I]t is clear that <em>\u00a7\u00a7 9-105 and 9-106 apply only to witnesses in judicial proceedings, and not to police investigations </em>of criminal activity. This interpretation is supported by the fact that <em>these two provisions are located in Title 9, which governs witnesses injudicial proceedings.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Hearsay: \u201cAn Assertion Offered For the Truth of the Thing Asserted\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">As an alternative subcontention, the appellant complains that Sergeant Miller\u2019s testimony with respect to the appellant\u2019s wife was inadmissible hearsay. The appellant mischaracterizes the problem, even if we were to accept his best scenario, as a problem of \u201chearsay within hearsay.\u201d He relies on Maryland rule 5-805, dealing with \u201cHearsay within hearsay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">A. At Most, This is a Hearsay Problem, Not a Hearsay Within Hearsay Problem</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">Sergeant Miller was a witness on the stand, under oath and subject to cross-examination. <em>Arguendo, </em>he testified as to something told to him by the appellant\u2019s wife. That statement by the wife, depending on the purpose for which it was offered, could be primary hearsay. <em>Arguendo, </em>the wife told the sergeant about something earlier told to her by her husband. That statement, from husband to wife, would be secondary hearsay or hearsay within hearsay. At best from the appellant\u2019s point of view, the scenario would look like this:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Witness On Stand (SgtMiller)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">I spoke to the wife and she said,</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Primary Hearsay Declarant (Wife)</p>\n<p id=\"AqG\">\u201cI spoke to my husband and he said,</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Secondary Hearsay Declarant (Husband)</p>\n<p id=\"AA\">T did it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">In that scenario, there would be no problem with the admissibility of the secondary hearsay or hearsay within hearsay because it, as an admission by a party-opponent, would qualify as a firmly-rooted exception to the Rule Against Hearsay, now codified as Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 803(a)(1). An inculpatory declaration by the husband/appellant would be deemed trustworthy with flying colors.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">The admissibility problem would be with the primary hearsay declaration by the wife, which would not seem to qualify as trustworthy under any of the recognized exceptions to the Hearsay Rule. The fact that the wife\u2019s hearsay declaration included hearsay within hearsay would be beside the point. Her hearsay declaration would have been equally inadmissible whether it asserted, \u201cI know my husband was involved because he told me he was involved,\u201d or, \u201cI know my husband was involved because I saw him do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Thus, preliminarily, our issue is a simple hearsay problem and not a hearsay within hearsay problem. The wife\u2019s assertion is the only one that matters. The question is whether the wife\u2019s out-of-court assertion was, indeed, hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">B. The Purpose For Which the Wife\u2019s Assertion Was Offered</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">Maryland Rule 5-801 (c) defines hearsay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-14\">\u201cHearsay\u201d is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">That is completely in line with the long established law school understanding of hearsay as \u201can out-of-court assertion offered in court for the truth of the thing asserted.\u201d Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Sergeant Miller even spoke to the appellant\u2019s wife, anything that she told him was an out-of-court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>assertion. As part of his testimony, it was offered in court by Sergeant Miller. Whether it was, in the last analysis, hearsay depends on the purpose for which it was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In <em>Richardson v. State, </em>324 Md. 611, 621, 598 A.2d 180 (1991), Judge Chasanow stressed that an out-of-court statement\u2019s status as hearsay depends on what it was offered to prove.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">In ruling on the admissibility of hearsay evidence, <em>the trial judge must examine the nature of the out-of-couH statements, as well as what they are offered to prove. </em>Without objection, defense counsel elicited from Marll that McCoy told Marll that he had a phone call from Richardson at 7 a.m. and met with Richardson at 8 a.m. The purpose of offering McCoy\u2019s hearsay was not to establish <em>what </em>McCoy heard from Richardson, but was to establish <em>when </em>McCoy heard from Richardson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">In <em>Ali v. State, </em>314 Md. 295, 304, 550 A.2d 925 (1988), Judge McAuliffe stressed the point that out-of-court statements, even when offered in court, are frequently not hearsay at all.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An_\">Logically, <em>the first inquiry ought to be whether the words are hearsay at all. </em>If they are not, their admission would not offend the hearsay rule. If they are, a further analysis must be undertaken to determine whether there exist separate circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness sufficient to permit their admission as an exception to the hearsay rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">Hearsay is generally defined as a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Thus, <em>when a statement is offered for some purpose other than to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein, it is 'not hearsay.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 157-58, 729 A.2d 910 (1999); <em>Stewart v.

State, </em>118 Md.App. 225, 234, 702 A.2d 444 (1997), Judge Deborah Eyler wrote for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">[W]hether an out-of-court statement is hearsay depends upon the purpose for which the statement is offered at trial. <em>A statement that is offered substantively, to prove the truth of its contents, is hearsay, </em>and is not admissible unless an exception to the rule against hearsay applies or admission into evidence is constitutionally required or statutorily allowed. Maryland Rule 5-802; <em>Stewart v. State, </em>342 Md. 230, 236, n. 1, 674 A.2d 944, 947, n. 1 (1996). By contrast, <em>a statement that is offered for a purpose other than to prove its truth is not hearsay at all.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Judge Thieme explained in <em>Daniel v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 576, 589, 753 A.2d 545 (2000), how statements made by witnesses to police officers, recounted in court by the police to explain the course of the investigation, are frequently not hearsay at all.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">Assuming Sergeant Pellegrini\u2019s testimony was based on Bailey\u2019s statements, <em>appellant\u2019s contention </em>that the testimony was \u201cbased upon hearsay\u201d <em>rests on the assertion that Bailey\u2019s statements were \u201chearsay. \u201d This is simply not the case. </em>As the trial court correctly reasoned, what the officer \u201cdraws upon to make his decisions as an investigator as to arrest or not arrest, is not to adhere to the same rules that we do here.\u201d In other words, <em>an interviewee\u2019s statements to an investigating police officer are not \u201chearsay\u201d unless and until they are offered into evidence for their truth. </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-9\"><em>McCray v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 513, 518, 581 A.2d 45 (1990), deal with a similar non-hearsay statement offered by a police officer to explain the course of his investigation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">It is clear to us that the testimony complained of was not hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">Hearsay is an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <em>The testimony given by Trooper Johnson was not offered to prove the truth of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>matter asserted, rather it was offered to explain how Trooper Johnson was able to make contact with McCray and then with Betters.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">With respect to the single brief allusion to the appellant\u2019s wife, Sergeant Miller was clearly not testifying, at that point in the trial, about the ultimate merits of guilt or innocence. He was attempting to get the appellant\u2019s statement introduced into evidence. For several hours, the appellant had been denying his involvement in the Youmans murder. At approximately nine p.m., he suddenly admitted his involvement. It was necessary for the State to show a plausible reason for that sudden change of heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The fact that his wife had implicated him in the crime was the catalyst. Sergeant Miller\u2019s words to the effect, \u201cYour wife has told me you were involved,\u201d were offered not to show the appellant\u2019s involvement but to show why the appellant\u2019s resistance suddenly cracked. The assertion by the wife was offered to show not the truth of the thing asserted, but simply to show that the appellant heard that assertion and reacted to it. The assertion in question was not hearsay, and Judge Spellbr-ing was not in error in overruling the appellant\u2019s objections to Sergeant Miller\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-9\">.

At oral argument, we pressed the State as to why it ran the risk of interrogating the appellant without <em>Mirandizing </em>him first. He was in custody and he was being interrogated. <em>Miranda, </em>therefore, applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Obviously, the Slate was seeking some psychological edge by getting him to admit guilt orally before having the interrogation take on a more formal tone. To do so, however, was to run a serious risk. If the hearing judge were to find no causal connection between the earlier violation and the subsequent statement, the State would survive the gamble. There is always the danger, however, that a suppression hearing judge, emotionally irate at the tactic, might find the later statement to have been the tainted product of the earlier violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">What, if anything, an appellate court could do about such a finding would depend, of course, upon the nature of the finding. If the hearing court found taint as a matter of law, the appellate court, invoking <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>would probably reverse and remand for a finding as a matter of fact. If the hearing judge found taint as a matter of fact, however, that finding would be, for all intents and purposes, unassailable.

Most American prosecutors were initially adamantly opposed to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>in significant measure because it was a high-profile symbol of Warren Court activism.

That essential identity of issues is why, as a general rule, whenever <em>Miranda </em>is both 1) applicable and 2) satisfied, the voluntariness test is <em>ipso facto </em>satisfied at the same time. There need only be one inquiry instead of two. There are some rare situations calling for special treatment. See, e.g., <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991); <em>Illinois v.
