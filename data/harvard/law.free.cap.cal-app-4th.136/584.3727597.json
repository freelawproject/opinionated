J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1y\">In 2004, the Legislature enacted substantial changes in workers\u2019 compensation law. The legislative vehicle for these changes was Senate Bill No. 899 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) (Sen. Bill 899), enacted as an urgency measure on April 19, 2004. Most of the legislation was effective immediately, but the portion at issue in this case, relating to medical evaluation and reporting when the employee is represented by counsel, is only operative for injuries occurring on or after January 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Under the former version of Labor Code section 4060,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a represented employee and his or her employer could each select a reporting medical evaluator when compensability of industrial injury was disputed. If liability was admitted by the employer and the dispute involved other issues, the parties were required to attempt selection of an agreed medical evaluator, and if unsuccessful, each side was entitled to select its own reporting medical evaluator under the former version of sections 4061 or 4062.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Sen. Bill 899 imposed a new procedure to resolve these disputes, but with limitations in its application. Under this procedure, the represented employee and employer are required to attempt to reach agreement on a reporting medical evaluator. But if they are unsuccessful, either party may ask the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation to assign the names of three possible reporting medical evaluators for the case. Each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>side is permitted to strike one, and the one remaining becomes the reporting medical evaluator. If a party does not timely choose to exercise the right to strike a name, the other party is entitled to choose the evaluator from among the three names.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">There is a significant limitation to this new procedure, which is at the core of the present dispute. Section 4062.2, subdivision (a), provides; \u201cWhenever a comprehensive medical evaluation is required to resolve any dispute arising out of an injury or a claimed injury occurring on or after January 1, 2005, and the employee is represented by an attorney, the evaluation shall be obtained only as provided in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The issue before us is what procedure, if any, applies where the employee is represented and the injury occurred before January 1, 2005. The statute does not spell out the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Lourdes Nunez, the petitioner and represented employee in this case, takes the position that the new medical evaluation and reporting procedure applies to her industrial injury of July 15, 2002, notwithstanding the provision limiting its application to cases where the date of injury is subsequent to 2004. Assoluto, Inc., her employer and the respondent in this case, argues that the former procedure applies in this situation. The workers\u2019 compensation administrative law judge (WCJ) in this case agreed with Assoluto and, more importantly, this also is the position taken by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) in an earlier published decision, and implicitly in this case as shown by its decision not to remove this case to itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">We believe the Board has the better of the argument. We are led to that position by the illogic of allowing a vacuum in which the employer would have no right to have a medical evaluation performed, the plain language of the new statute, which confines its application in represented cases to injuries occurring after 2004, and by deference to the Board, a constitutional agency, which is charged with construction and application of workers\u2019 compensation law and administration of the workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">For these reasons, as we shall explain, we shall affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Petitioner, Lourdes Nunez, claimed that she sustained injuries from a fall while working for Assoluto on July 15, 2002. Assoluto provided workers\u2019 compensation benefits, including medical treatment, temporary disability indemnity and vocational rehabilitation. When Assoluto objected to continuing medical treatment and disability and the parties could not agree on a physician to conduct a medical evaluation, Assoluto arranged for Nunez to be evaluated by Richard Zapanta, M.D., under the procedure of former sections 4061 or 4062.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In a workers\u2019 compensation form answer served in response to Nunez\u2019s claim, Assoluto placed an \u201cx\u201d on the line for denial of the July 15, 2002, industrial injury. However, Assoluto qualified its denial on the adjacent line by adding the words \u201cNature and extent.\u201d Assoluto also scheduled a reevaluation with Dr. Zapanta for January 10, 2005, which Nunez did not attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">On January 25, 2005, Assoluto served by mail a \u201cPetition For Order Compelling Attendance At Medical Examination.\u201d Assoluto\u2019s petition alleged that Nunez had failed to attend the January 10, 2005, evaluation with Dr. Zapanta. The petition included a proposed order to be signed by the WCJ. The order compelled Nunez to attend a rescheduled evaluation, and for suspension of proceedings for the collection of compensation under section 4054<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> should Nunez not attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">On January 26, 2005, Assoluto submitted its petition and proposed order to the WCJ, utilizing the Board\u2019s \u201cwalk-through\u201d procedure. The WCJ signed the proposed order the same day, but lined out the warning that failure to attend the ordered evaluation would bar disability payments under section 4054.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Nunez filed a timely petition for reconsideration or removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She contended that Assoluto denied industrial injury, so that the medical evaluator should be selected under sections 4060 and 4062.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The WCJ reported to the Board that the medical evaluation procedure of former section 4060 applies, based on <em>Simi </em>v. <em>Sav-Max Foods, Inc. </em>(2005) 70 Cal.Comp.Cases 217 <em>(Simi). Simi </em>is an en banc decision in which the Board granted removal and the employer\u2019s petition to compel a defense medical evaluation for a 2002 admitted injury under former section 4062. The Board reasoned that \u201cthe Legislature created a new procedure for obtaining medical-legal reports for injuries on or after January 1, 2005, but it did not retain any procedure for injuries before January 1, 2005.\u201d Nevertheless, former section 4062 applies where the employee is represented and the date of injury occurred prior to January 1, 2005. The Board relied on the rationale of <em>Godinez v. Buffets, Inc. </em>(2004) 69 Cal.Comp.Cases 1311, in which it applied former section 4645 to find an appeal of a Rehabilitation Unit decision timely, since section 139.5, subdivision (c), which was repealed in 2003 and reenacted under Sen. Bill 899, expressly refers to former sections 4642 and 4644.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The WCJ also recommended against removal to the Board because Nunez was not substantially prejudiced or irreparably harmed. The WCJ concluded that Nunez was required to attend a medical examination under section 4050.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A decision on whether the resulting examining physician\u2019s report is admissible could be deferred until trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The Board dismissed Nunez\u2019s petition for reconsideration and denied her request for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">In her petition for writ of review, Nunez challenges the Board\u2019s rulings and argues that since Assoluto denied industrial injury and Sen. Bill 899 repealed former section 4060, current sections 4060 and 4062.2 apply. She argues further that the WCJ\u2019s unauthorized order of a medical evaluator chosen solely by Assoluto results in substantial prejudice or irreparable harm, and deprives her of the substantial right to participate in the selection of the medical evaluator. Nunez also claims that she was denied due process, since there was no notice or opportunity to respond to Assoluto\u2019s petition or ex parte appearance before the WCJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Assoluto answers that the industrial injury is admitted and Nunez is being reevaluated under former section 4062, which applies under <em>Simi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Generally, factual findings that are supported by substantial evidence are affirmed upon review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We review governing statutes de novo, but we accord considerable weight to the Board\u2019s interpretation and application of workers\u2019 compensation law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In interpreting and applying legislation de novo, we first determine the Legislature\u2019s intent from the plain or ordinary meaning of the statutory language, unless the language is uncertain or ambiguous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the statutory language is uncertain, ambiguous or conflicting, the statute is interpreted consistent with its purpose and the statutory scheme, using rules of construction or legislative history to implement the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Nunez contends that Assoluto\u2019s form answer denied compensability of the industrial injury, and former section 4060 upon which the WCJ relied was repealed by Sen. Bill 899. She argues that the medical evaluation and reporting procedure of section 4062.2 is applicable because section 4060 expressly applies \u201cto disputes over the compensability of any injury\u201d (\u00a7 4060, subd. (a)), and \u201ca medical evaluation to determine compensability shall be obtained only by the procedure provided in Section 4062.2\u201d (\u00a7 4060, subd. (c)). She argues further that <em>Simi </em>does not apply because in that case injury was admitted and only former section 4062 was addressed. Assoluto answers that Nunez\u2019s industrial injury was admitted, benefits were provided, and former section 4062 applies according to <em>Simi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\n<em>A. Former or Amended Section 4060 Does Not Apply</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Nunez\u2019s premise that Assoluto\u2019s form answer denied compensability of the July 15, 2002, industrial injury is contrary to the record. The form answer indicates that the denial was limited to the nature and extent of the injury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>There is no reason to dispute nature and extent if industrial injury is denied. Moreover, Assoluto provided benefits, evaluated Nunez under former sections 4061 or 4062, and represents to this court that the industrial injury was admitted. While Nunez argues that the WCJ confirmed Assoluto\u2019s denial of compensability by applying former section 4060, the WCJ provided no explanation for this conclusion and it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Since compensability of the industrial injury was admitted by Assoluto, former or the amended version of section 4060 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">B. <em>Former Section 4061 or 4062 </em>Applies<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Even if Assoluto had denied compensability, sections 4060 and 4062.2 would not apply. Nunez contends that the medical evaluation and reporting procedure of section 4062.2<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is applicable because it is incorporated into section 4060.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\n                   Although Nunez acknowledges that the Legislature intended the statutes to be read together under the statutory scheme, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ignores the plain language of section 4062.2, subdivision (a), which confines its application to represented cases where the date of injury occurs on or after January 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Since Assoluto admitted compensability of the industrial injury, we must address whether the procedure of former or the amended version of sections 4061 or 4062 is applicable. As with former section 4060, former sections 4061 and 4062 were amended under Sen. Bill 899 to apply the medical evaluation and reporting procedure of section 4062.2.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, just as with section 4060, section 4061 or 4062 does not apply because the statutes are limited in represented cases to a date of injury on or after January 1, 2005. This either leaves the medical evaluation and reporting procedure of former sections 4061 or 4062 in place, or leaves a void in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Although the Board stated in <em>Simi, supra, </em>70 Cal.Comp.Cases at page 221, that under Sen. Bill 899 the Legislature \u201cdid not retain any procedure for injuries before January 1, 2005,\u201d the Board concluded that the procedure of former section 4062 remains operative since the Legislature has extensively regulated medical evaluation and reporting in workers\u2019 compensation since 1991. The Board\u2019s reasoning in applying former section 4062 in <em>Simi, </em>and extending its reasoning to this case, is sound.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Legislature did not intend total deregulation of the abuses historically associated with medical evaluation and reporting in workers\u2019 compensation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, the statutory scheme should not be interpreted so that either side is arbitrarily deprived of the right to medical evaluation or reporting. \u201cWhen a statute is capable of more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>one construction, \u201c[w]e must . . . give the provision a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the lawmakers, practical rather than technical in nature, which upon application will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Reeves </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 765, 771, fn. 9 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 4, 110 P.3d 1218].)  We therefore accept the Board\u2019s interpretation that the Legislature intended former sections 4060 et seq. to remain operative for represented cases with a date of injury before January 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">This conclusion is also consistent with section 47 of Sen. Bill 899, which states in part: \u201cThe amendment, addition, or repeal of, any provision of law made by this act shall apply prospectively from the date of enactment of this act, regardless of the date of injury, unless otherwise specified. . . .\u201d (Underscoring added.) Section 4062.2 otherwise specified that the statute is confined to represented cases with a date of injury on or after January 1, 2005.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Nunez also contends that removal or reconsideration should have been granted because the WCJ relied on repealed section 4060 in ordering an evaluation with a physician chosen solely by Assoluto.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Since we have concluded that former sections 4061 or 4062 applies, the WCJ\u2019s order does not result in substantial prejudice, irreparable harm or deprivation of a substantial right as argued by Nunez. In addition, the WCJ deferred admissibility of Dr. Zapanta\u2019s report until trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">A. <em>Section 4050 Was Not a Basis for Denying Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">The WCJ alternatively reasoned that Nunez is not substantially prejudiced or irreparably harmed and subject to removal since Assoluto is entitled to an examination with Dr. Zapanta under section 4050 and the medical report therefore could be admissible.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While a medical report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>obtained under section 4050 has been held to be admissible under certain circumstances,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Board has ruled more recently that a section 4050 examination may not circumvent the medical evaluation and reporting procedure of former section 4061 for unrepresented workers.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We agree that the Legislature did not intend the medical evaluation and reporting procedures of former section 4060 et seq. to be circumvented by a medical examination under section 4050 in represented cases. Moreover, when Assoluto petitioned to compel the medical evaluation under former sections 4061 or 4062, the WCJ lined out reference to section 4054 in the proposed order and Assoluto does not argue that section 4050 et seq. apply. Accordingly, the Board did not abuse its discretion by denying removal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">B. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Nunez also alleges that she had no opportunity to respond to Assoluto\u2019s petition since the WCJ issued the order ex parte during the \u201cwalk-through\u201d procedure under California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 10890, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> one day after the petition was mailed. She claims this procedure denied the opportunity to be heard or present evidence, which violates due process and requires reversal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The short answer to this claim is that Nunez had the opportunity to present her position in the petition for reconsideration or removal, and did so. There is no showing that she was actually prejudiced by the procedures utilized in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The Board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Hastings, J., and Curry, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-11\"> All further statutory reference is to the Labor Code unless stated otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b496-9\"> Section 4054 provides: \u201cIf the employee fails or refuses to submit to examination after direction by the appeals board, or a referee thereof, or in any way obstructs the examination, his right to the disability payments which accrue during the period of such failure, refusal or obstruction, shall be barred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b496-10\"> Section 5310 provides: \u201cThe appeals board may . . . remove to itself ... the proceedings on any claim.\u201d A discovery order may be subject to removal or review. <em>(Allison v.

An objection or agreement to a medical evaluator before a party could select a medical evaluator was subject to statutory time limits. We are unable to determine which section applies in this case because the Board\u2019s record does not include correspondences and medical reports generated before the medical evaluation was scheduled with Dr. Zapanta.
