Thompson, Aster Kifle-Thompson, and the corporations they had formed were found to have violated Insurance Code section 1871.7, subdivision (b), by submitting fraudulent claims for compensation proscribed by Penal Code section 550. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>appeal, defendants contend that the case should have been dismissed because (1) it belonged exclusively in a workers\u2019 compensation forum, (2) the People failed to meet the statutory prerequisites for bringing the lawsuit, and (3) defendants\u2019 conduct was not unlawful. Defendants further contend that the trial court should have applied a \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard of proof, that joint and several liability was inappropriate on the facts of the case, and that the damages imposed were unauthorized and excessive. We find no error and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The People<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> initiated this action against defendants for restitution, civil penalties, and an injunction under Insurance Code section 1871.7 of the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act and under Business &amp; Professions Code section 17200 et seq. The People alleged that the individual defendants\u2014 Steven Thompson; his wife, Aster Kifle-Thompson; Charles Salzberg, M.D.; Joseph Greenspan, M.D.; and Julius Mueller, M.D.\u2014had participated in a scheme in which they submitted false claims for workers\u2019 compensation payments from relator Monterey Mushrooms, Inc., a self-insured employer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the complaint, Thompson, who had been convicted in 1997 of seven counts of filing false workers\u2019 compensation claims (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1871.4, subd. (a)(2)), had organized two corporations, Peninsula Medical Group, P.C. (PMG), and Integrated Family Medical Group, P.C. (IFMG), using Salzberg and Greenspan, respectively, as medical directors. Contrary to laws governing the structure of medical corporations and medical practice, these physicians exercised \u201cabsolutely no control, supervision or management\u201d of the corporations they purported to own and operate. Meanwhile, Thompson and Kifle-Thompson represented these corporations and their affiliated clinics to the public and to Monterey Mushrooms as providers of medical services. In biffing for treatment of Monterey Mushrooms employees, defendants prepared fraudulent claims for workers\u2019 compensation payments for unnecessary and excessive chiropractic treatment, frequently submitting \u201cat least two, and often three\u201d separate claim forms for a single patient visit. Meanwhile, Thompson and Kifle-Thompson maintained control of PMG and IFMG, respectively, through their management corporation, Nevada Practice Management Systems, Inc., in order to \u201csiphon off the profits\u201d earned by PMG and IFMG.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Defendants demurred, asserting lack of jurisdiction and collateral estoppel. They argued that (1) Insurance Code section 1871.7, subdivision (h)(2)(A), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>barred the action; (2) the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) had exclusive jurisdiction over the claims asserted; and (3) the issue of entitlement to benefits as to one employee had already been decided by the WCAB, and therefore the issue as to <em>any </em>employee was precluded by collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The trial court overruled the demurrers, and defendants answered. Both sides then moved for summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication. The court denied summary judgment but limited plaintiff\u2019s claims to Insurance Code section 1871.7, subdivision (b). The cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 was determined to be preempted by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (WCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">A court trial on liability took place between September 11 and 24, 2002. The court granted nonsuit in favor of Mueller, and both Greenspan and Salzberg settled with plaintiff. However, Thompson, Kifle-Thompson, and the corporate defendants were found to be liable for having \u201cset up sham corporations, with medical doctors as ostensible owners, that presented to the public as full-service medical clinics. In reality, the medical doctors were essentially a series of absentee figureheads who gave no consideration for their ownership interests and, for the most part, had no meaningful role in the direction of patient care or general clinic operation.\u201d The purpose of these corporations was to allow these defendants to \u201cacquire patients and refer them for chiropractic treatment and to present fraudulent claims for services to third-party payors.\u201d The result was that patients were \u201cinevitably being directed to chiropractic \u2018treatment,\u2019 where they were grossly over[-]treated. Bills were generated for these patient visits, and in some cases more than one claim was made for a single session.\u201d The court found this to be a \u201csophisticated, formalized and well-concealed strategy\u201d that enabled Thompson and Kifle-Thompson to \u201cmaximize the number of patients and the amount [that] could be billed for visits, without due regard for patient care and needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Trial on the remedies portion of the litigation was held on November 6, 2002. On December 3, 2002, the court ruled that the Thompson defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were jointly and severally liable for civil penalties in the amount of $479,115.29. The court also granted plaintiff\u2019s request for injunctive relief and subsequently awarded plaintiff attorney fees in the amount of $1,230,040.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">1. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation as an Exclusive Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Citing Labor Code sections 3602, 3820, and 5300, defendants first renew their argument that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over this lawsuit because all of the issues of \u201calleged billing fraud\u201d arose from a workers\u2019 compensation claim and had to be resolved by the WCAB.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendants rely on <em>Charles J. Vacanti, M.D., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 800 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 562, 14 P.3d 234] <em>(Vacanti), </em>where the Supreme Court set forth a two-part analysis to help determine whether a cause of action is barred by the exclusivity of the WCA. A court is called upon first to determine \u201cwhether the alleged injury falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions.\u201d <em>(Vacanti, </em>at p. 811.) If the injury \u201cis collateral to or derivative of a personal \u2018injury sustained and arising out of the course of employment,\u2019 \u201d then a cause of action arising from that injury may be subject to the exclusivity bar. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 812.) Secondly, the court will consider \u201cwhether the alleged acts or motives that establish the elements of the cause of action fall outside the risks encompassed within the compensation bargain.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 811-812.) \u201cWhere the acts are \u2018a \u201cnormal\u201d part of the employment relationship\u2019 [citation], or workers\u2019 compensation claims process [citation], or where the motive behind these acts does not violate a \u2018fundamental policy of this state\u2019 [citation], then the cause of action is barred\u201d by the exclusivity provisions of the WCA. <em>(Vacanti, </em>at p. 812.) As we will explain, however, <em>Vacanti </em>does not bar the present action brought under the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Defendants maintain that this case amounted to \u201ca billing overcharge dispute\u201d that had to be litigated within the confines of the workers\u2019 compensation system. In their view, \u201cthis case proved nothing more, than that the plaintiff was unhappy with the defendants\u2019 billing practices.\u201d Defendants point out that Labor Code section 3820, subdivision (d), already provides for civil penalties for fraudulent claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But in that provision the Legislature expressly acknowledged that other penalties may exist, and it stated that the penalty set forth in subdivision (d) may be imposed \u201cin addition to any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>penalties that may be prescribed by law.\u201d And in subdivision (a) of Labor Code section 3820 the Legislature expressly recognized \u201cthat the conduct prohibited by this section is, for the most part, already subject to criminal penalties pursuant to other provisions of law.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The application of Insurance Code section 1871.7, subdivision (b), was clearly authorized in this case. As the trial court recognized, this statute was intended to encompass fraudulent claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. It specifically provides for civil penalties for claims for compensation under Labor Code section 3207, which is part of the WCA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, in enacting the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, the Legislature clearly expressed its intent to promote the investigation and prosecution of insurance fraud, including workers\u2019 compensation fraud, which \u201charms employers by contributing to the increasingly high cost of workers\u2019 compensation insurance and self-insurance and harms employees by undermining the perceived legitimacy of all workers\u2019 compensation claims.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1871, subd. (d).) \u201cPrevention of workers\u2019 compensation insurance fraud may reduce the number of workers\u2019 compensation claims and claim payments thereby producing a commensurate reduction in workers\u2019 compensation costs. Prevention of workers\u2019 compensation insurance fraud will assist in restoring confidence and faith in the workers\u2019 compensation system, and will facilitate expedient and full compensation for employees injured at the workplace.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e).)  Lest there be any residual confusion over the authority to proceed, Insurance Code section 1871.7, subdivision (k), makes it clear that the remedies it provides are \u201cin addition to any other remedies provided by existing law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Furthermore, Penal Code section 550, on which the Insurance Code section 1871.7 allegations were predicated in this case, prohibits the knowing submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment of health care benefits. The statute specifically defines \u201ca claim for payment of a health care benefit\u201d to include a \u201cclaim for payment submitted by or on the behalf of a provider of any workers\u2019 compensation health benefits under the Labor Code.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 550, subd. (a)(10).)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The express inclusion of workers\u2019 compensation claims thus demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intention to allow civil actions under Insurance Code section 1871.7 arising from fraudulent acts made unlawful by Penal Code section 550, notwithstanding applicability of the WCA. None of the cases cited by defendants compels or suggests a different conclusion. We therefore agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the exclusivity provisions of the WCA did not bar this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">2. <em>Res Judicata</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">At trial defendants relied on the theory that all of the treatment and charges targeted by the People\u2019s lawsuit had already been found reasonable and necessary by the WCAB. Defendants asked the court to enter a finding consistent with that result. The People responded that in this context the conduct could not be considered reasonable and necessary if the treatment and billing had been performed by an illegal medical corporation. The trial court agreed with the People that collateral estoppel did not apply, as this case was based on Insurance Code section 1871, and \u201c[t]he workers^] compensation board did not have before it the broad pattern of conduct that is alleged here.\u201d Subsequently the court declined defendants\u2019 request to admit workers\u2019 compensation records of four patients showing \u201cthe issues that were presented to, or could have been presented to the workers\u2019] compensation court. . . that the court actually decided, or that the court could have decided, had they been argued in those cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">On appeal, defendants contend that the principles of res judicata preclude this action because Monterey Mushrooms had already litigated the claims of patients treated at the Thompson clinics and those claims had been decided in a workers\u2019 compensation forum. Beyond this vague assertion defendants do not explain how the court erred in rejecting a res judicata defense on the facts of this case. They have not supplied pertinent authority, record references, or reasoning to show that these were the same causes of action that were addressed in the WCAB proceedings. Their claim that plaintiff \u201cwas entitled to one, and only one, remedy for its alleged injuries, and to one judgment\u201d is not helpful, as this action involved a different plaintiff seeking a different remedy under a different statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">As to collateral estoppel, defendants do not address the requirements for establishing this theory or even acknowledge the distinction between the \u201cclaim preclusion\u201d and \u201cissue preclusion\u201d aspects of res judicata.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They complain about the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the patient records, but they fail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>to argue, much less show, how the evidentiary ruling constituted an abuse of discretion, nor do they discuss how those records would have established \u201cnot just the substantial, but the complete, likeness of the issues\u201d litigated in the workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. The action was properly allowed to go forward notwithstanding defendants\u2019 assertions of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">3. <em>Abatement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Among the motions in limine presented by the parties was a defense request for an order of abatement, based on the pendency of two claims then pending in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. The trial court eventually denied the request. On appeal, defendants argue that abatement was called for here, as the WCAB \u201chad long since acquired jurisdiction over every case described by the complaint,\u201d and it was empowered to \u201cdispose of an entire controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">This argument must be rejected for the same reasons that pertain to defendants\u2019 theory of res judicata. This was a different controversy involving different alleged wrongs which were prosecuted in accordance with a different statutory authority. Defendants have failed to show that abatement was required or even appropriate in these procedural circumstances, or that they would have obtained a more favorable disposition of this action had their abatement request been granted. (See <em>Plant Insulation Co. </em>v. <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 787 [274 Cal.Rptr. 147] [abatement not appropriate where the first action cannot provide the relief sought in the second]; <em>People ex rel. Garamendi v. American Autoplan, Inc. </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 772 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 192] [trial court error in determining application of the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction is reversible only where the error results in a miscarriage of justice or prejudice to the party asserting the rule].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">4. <em>Jurisdiction Under Insurance Code Section 1871.7, Subdivision (h)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Defendants further contend that this action was unauthorized under the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act because its strict requirements for jurisdiction were not met. Insurance Code section 1871.7, subdivision (h)(2)(A), on which defendants rely, states that a court has no jurisdiction over an action brought under that section if the action is <em>\u201cbased upon the public disclosure </em>of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing in a legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>bringing the action is an <em>original source </em>of the information.\u201d (Italics added.) Defendants argue that this action was beyond the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction because it was derived from the public records of workers\u2019 compensation proceedings, publicly disclosed information in patient treatment records, or publicly disclosed transactions involving the corporate defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The trial court ruled that Monterey Mushrooms was an \u201coriginal source of the information on which this case is based.\u201d The term \u201coriginal source\u201d as used in Insurance Code section 1871.7, subdivision (h)(2)(A), means \u201can individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the district attorney or commissioner before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1871.7, subd. (h)(2)(B).) Defendants fail to point to anything in the record that refutes or even acknowledges the trial court\u2019s factual finding that Monterey Mushrooms had \u201cdirect and independent knowledge of the defendants\u2019 conduct\u201d and therefore met the jurisdictional threshold of the statute as an \u201coriginal source.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Defendants\u2019 opposition to the court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction resembles that of the defendants in <em>People ex rel. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Weitzman, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th 534. There, construing the same provision at issue here, the Second Appellate District, Division Five, held that the relator, Allstate Insurance Company, had surmounted the jurisdictional bar of subdivision (h)(2) of Insurance Code section 1871.7 and could be deemed an \u201coriginal source\u201d of the information leading to its allegations of insurance fraud. The court discerned the purpose of this provision to be \u201cto prevent qui tarn actions brought by persons who, like the relator in <em>U.S. ex rel. Marcus </em>v. <em>Hess </em>[(1943)] 317 U.S. [537, 545-548] [87 L.Ed. 443, 63 S.Ct. 379], simply copied allegations from a criminal indictment on file, learned of the specific fraudulent conduct at issue through public channels, and . . . had not contributed or assisted in a material way in exposing the fraud. [Citations.] The California Legislature, in adopting subdivision (h)(2), intended to bar parasitic or opportunistic actions by persons simply taking advantage of public information without contributing to or assisting in the exposure of the fraud.\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Weitzman, supra, </em>at p. 564.) Allstate had not simply taken advantage of publicly disclosed information from another insurer\u2019s prior lawsuit; it met the legislative goal of encouraging insurers to help combat insurance fraud by conducting its own investigation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>expending its own resources to expose hundreds of fraudulent insurance claims. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 566.) Although the public disclosure of the fraud ring at issue may have prompted Allstate to investigate whether it had been a target of the fraud, \u201cit was only through Allstate\u2019s own considerable efforts that the facts specific to frauds perpetrated on it came to light.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 565.) To bar Allstate from the action \u201cwould be contrary to the legislative goal of encouraging insurers to participate in the battle against automobile insurance fraud by bringing section 1871.7 actions; [would] undermine the legislative intent that insurers assist in the prevention, identification, investigation, and prosecution of automobile insurance fraud; and would diminish realization of the legislative goal of coordinated efforts by law enforcement agencies and insurers to deal with the serious and prevalent insurance fraud problem.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 565; cf. <em>City of Hawthorne ex rel. Wohlner v. H&amp;C Disposal Co. </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1668, 1683 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 312] [applying similar public-disclosure provision in California False Claims Act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">In their reply brief, defendants illogically and irrelevantly argue that Monterey Mushrooms cannot be deemed a relator because \u201cit is not an individual and only an \u2018individual\u2019 can be an original source. Correspondingly, only an original source can be a relator.\u201d As this point was not urged in their opening brief and was only indirectly (and unnecessarily) addressed by the People, we need not consider it. We parenthetically observe, however, as did the trial court, that the Legislature specifically designated an insurer as a \u201cperson bringing the action\u201d under Insurance Code section 1871.7. (\u00a7 1871.7, subd. (e)(1).) In our view, to construe \u201coriginal source\u201d to be solely a human \u201cindividual\u201d would render meaningless the condition that the \u201cperson bringing the action\u201d be \u201can original source of the information.\u201d (\u00a7 1871.7, subd. (h)(2)(A).) Although the question was not raised in <em>Weitzman, </em>the implicit premise of its holding was that an insurance company can be deemed an original source even though it is not a live person.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Defendants thus offer no reason to reach a different result in this case. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court correctly applied Insurance Code section 1871.7, subdivision (h), consistently with the purpose of the provision and the facts before it, to find that it had jurisdiction to rule on the allegations against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">5. <em>Legal Basis for Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Defendants next contend that the complaint should have been dismissed because plaintiff failed to show that defendants knowingly presented false or fraudulent claims. According to defendants, the Corporations Code does not mandate any specific \u201cmethod\u201d of billing or \u201cform for use in submitting a health provider\u2019s invoice.\u201d The only restriction that applied to them, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>insist, was the limitation on the number of shares they could own, as set forth in Corporations Code section 13401.5.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">In making this argument defendants ignore the essence of the allegations against them. They were charged not merely with corporate procedural irregularities, but with serious violations of Penal Code section 550, which the trial court found true. Defendants fail to address these elements except to protest, contrary to the trial judge\u2019s factual findings, that plaintiff failed to prove \u201cintent to deceive . . . because defendants\u2019 conduct was legal.\u201d They also assert, again contrary to the verdict and without acknowledging the standard of review on appeal, that \u201cthe uncontroverted evidence\u201d showed that the physicians affiliated with the medical corporations \u201cdelivered <em>medical </em>services of all kinds at the Thompson-related clinics, though without question the offices specialized in the musculo-skeletal type of complaint.\u201d Having generated a \u201cstraw man\u201d argument instead of accurately citing the pertinent facts and applicable law, defendants provide no basis for finding error based on the allowable billing methods, \u201cstyle of business operation,\u201d and delivery of medical services at their clinics.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">6. <em>Corporate Control</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Defendants further argue that plaintiff \u201cfailed to establish that California law requires a particular system of \u2018control\u2019 over the daily operation of a multi-disciplinary medical corporation.\u201d The Corporations Code, they claim, \u201cdoes not proscribe [szc] rules for operation of an MDZDC corporation.\u201d Defendants also maintain that plaintiff \u201cfailed to introduce evidence that the medical treatment of any of the patients involved in the case was at all affected by the control systems that in fact were used at Peninsula [Medical Group].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Their assertion is supported by neither citation to pertinent authority nor the facts found true by the trial court. As in the previous argument, defendants fail even to acknowledge the substantial evidence rule. Only in their reply brief do they attempt to challenge the adequacy of plaintiff\u2019s proof. This belated effort, however, does not comport with this court\u2019s function on review; it consists of rhetorical challenges to the plaintiff\u2019s representation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the facts and presents a slanted account of the evidence more appropriate in a closing argument to the trier of fact. (Cf. <em>Nwosu v. Uba </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1246 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 416] [attack on the evidence without a fair statement of the evidence is entitled to no consideration when substantial amount of evidence was received on behalf of the respondent].) Were we to address defendants\u2019 untimely argument on the merits in accordance with the proper standard of review,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we would nonetheless conclude, having examined the extensive testimony and exhibits in the record, that substantial evidence supported the factual findings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">7. <em>Liability of Nontreating Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Defendants next contend that Kifle-Thompson and IFMG should have been dismissed as defendants because they had not treated any of the patients who were identified in the complaint. Again they ignore the allegations, the evidence presented, and the trial court\u2019s findings. This case was not merely about the submission of false or excessive treatment claims regarding specific employees; it embraced an entire scheme in which Kifle-Thompson, on her own and through IFMG, helped defraud Monterey Mushrooms, the workers\u2019 compensation system, and the public. The trial testimony and documentary evidence convinced the trial court as fact finder that Kifle-Thompson and her husband had set up illegal corporate medical practices, \u201caffecting not just a single patient or employer or even solely patients with industrial injuries.\u201d They gave physicians ostensible ownership of these corporations while retaining full control over the structure, finances, and operation of each corporation, including patient care. They managed to deceive the Secretary of State and the medical board by representing that PMG and IFMG would be engaged in the practice of medicine and then portrayed these entities as medical clinics to the public, to insurers, and to the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">It is clear from the record that Kifle-Thompson was an active part of the conspiracy enabling them to achieve these objectives through PMG, IFMG, and Nevada Practice Management Systems, Inc., their \u201cmanagement service\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>or \u201cshell\u201d corporation. Defendants do not mount a challenge asserting insufficient evidence to support this factual conclusion. Because their argument is premised on a version of the facts that is inconsistent with the evidence and findings of the court, it must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">8. <em>Standard of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Echoing a motion in limine made by Mueller and their own motion for a new trial, defendants contend that the trial court should have applied a higher standard of proof, that of clear and convincing evidence. We disagree. Evidence Code section 115, which describes the applicable burdens of proof,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> states: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, the burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (See <em>Conservatorship of Wendland </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 519, 546 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 28 P.3d 151] [default standard of proof in civil cases is preponderance of the evidence].) \u201cGenerally, a higher burden of proof applies only where particularly important individual interests or rights, which are more substantial than the loss of money, are at stake. [Citations.] Thus, for example, the clear and convincing evidence burden of proof has been applied where constitutional due process rights or important general public policy considerations are implicated.\u201d <em>(Baxter Healthcare Corp. </em>v. <em>Denton </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 333, 365 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 430].)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Defendants suggest no law\u2014statutory, decisional, or constitutional\u2014 that imposes a burden to show liability under Insurance Code section 1871.7 by clear and convincing evidence. They cite <em>Liodas </em>v. <em>Sahadi </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 278 [137 Cal.Rptr. 635, 562 P.2d 316], but only for the observation that statutory exceptions may elevate the standard for civil fraud from preponderance of the evidence. Defendants merely assert that Insurance Code section 1871.7, subdivision (b), \u201cis just such an exception,\u201d without giving any reason to justify imposing a higher standard. (See <em>In re Marquis D. </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1813, 1827 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 198] [where one statute requires clear and convincing proof and a related statute is silent regarding the burden of proof, preponderance standard applies to related statute absent other considerations]; accord, <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp. </em>v. <em>Denton, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at p. 366.) They point to no sentence in Insurance Code section 1871.7 that indicates a higher standard of proof here, and they offer no due process or public policy considerations at stake. We therefore have no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>to disagree with the conclusion of <em>People ex. rel. Allstate Insurance Co. v. Muhyeldin </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 604, 610-611 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 492] (not mentioned by defendants) that preponderance of the evidence is the appropriate standard of proof for liability under Insurance Code section 1871.7. The trial court correctly applied this standard in weighing the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">9. <em>Joint and Several Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">As noted earlier, the Thompson defendants (Thompson, Kifle-Thompson, and their corporate entities) were found jointly and severally liable for civil penalties. Defendants contend that this ruling was \u201cagainst the law\u201d because it was not specifically authorized by Insurance Code section 1871.7. According to defendants, a corporate director or executive \u201ccannot be held personally liable for injury that the corporation inflicts upon a third party, unless in some fashion he intentionally participated in the company\u2019s alleged wrongdoing. . . . Similarly, principles of <em>respondeat superior </em>hold the corporate employer liable for the negligent torts of its employees which occur within the course and scope of their employment.\u201d Defendants do not explain how this case has anything to do with negligent torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Attempting to apply these principles to the present case, defendants argue that Kifle-Thompson and IFMG should not have been found liable because they had not participated in the diagnosis and treatment of the patients named in the complaint, and \u201c[n]either of these defendants ever submitted a bill for services rendered to any of the patients.\u201d In non sequitur fashion, defendants then conclude: \u201cTherefore, even if there existed some operational defect at [IFMG], and none was proved at trial, it could not possibly have caused damage to Monterey Mushrooms. The trial court consequently erred when it held her <em>[sic] </em>jointly and severally liable for the damages, fines and penalties that it imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Defendants offer no factual or legal support for any of the individual assertions they make, much less show how these assertions form a coherent argument. They oversimplify their conduct and completely ignore Kifle-Thompson\u2019s participation in the fraudulent scheme. They also overlook both the content and purpose of Penal Code section 550 and Insurance Code section 1871.7. Defendants\u2019 patchwork contention must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">10. <em>Amount of Penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Defendants further complain that the damages imposed, $479,115.29, were improper and excessive. In their view, \u201c[i]t is an uncontested fact in this case that services billed by the defendants to Monterey Mushrooms were in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>available and were delivered to its employees.\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[pjlaintiff proved no injury to the public from defendants\u2019 conduct, since the evidence admitted pertained only to former or existing employees of Monterey Mushrooms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">We find no error. Defendants\u2019 argument once again depends on a version of the facts that is inconsistent with the findings of the trier of fact. We will not reweigh the evidence on which these findings were based. Moreover, the penalties imposed under Insurance Code section 1871.7 could have been much higher. The statute authorized a penalty of $5,000-$10,000 for each fraudulent claim. That formula would have resulted in a $3,515,000 penalty, which the court believed would have been punitive rather than remedial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court declined to impose any additional amount against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Defendants also take issue with the number of claims on which damages were based. In their view, the court should have considered four claims, not 703. Of the 703 claim forms introduced at trial, \u201conly 297 show [PMG] as the care provider. The other 406 . . . have a licensed provider name . . . which states the physician or supplier\u2019s name. If the provider is a licensed person\u2014 not [PMG], then the court could not have properly considered the claim as \u2018fraudulent\u2019 on the plaintiff\u2019s (unproved) theory that Peninsula was a \u2018sham\u2019 corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We find no merit in this contention. The penalty imposed under Insurance Code section 1871.7, subdivision (b), is based on the number of claims submitted, not the number of patients involved.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Penal Code section 550 also makes it clear that defendants committed a crime each time they made or submitted <em>\u201cany </em>false or fraudulent claim\u201d for compensation. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 550, subds. (a)(6), (a)(7).) The court properly imposed a penalty for each violation of Penal Code section 550\u2014that is, for each false or fraudulent claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">11. <em>Attorney fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Defendants request a hearing to determine the amount of attorney fees they should recover under Insurance Code section 1871.7, subdivision (g)(5). Their request, however, is premised on reversal of the judgment. As we have found no ground for reversal, defendants are not entitled to attorney fees and there is no need for a hearing to determine the appropriate amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Premo, Acting P.
