We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">Under California law, when a party to an arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action with a third party, and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact, the court has several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>options. It may refuse to compel arbitration, or it may stay either the arbitration or the court proceeding pending completion of the proceedings in the other forum. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281.2, subd. (c) (section 1281.2(c).) Under the Federal Arbitration Act, title 9 United States Code section 1 et seq. (FAA), the court\u2019s only option in these circumstances is to stay the court proceeding and compel the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">In <em>Cronus Investments, Inc. v. Concierge Services </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 376 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 540, 107 P.3d 217] <em>(Cronus), </em>the parties to an arbitration agreement had contracted to utilize California law, but had also agreed the designation of California law would not \u201c \u2018preclude application of the [FAA], if it would be applicable.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 380.) Under these contract provisions, our Supreme Court held section 1281.2(c) was not preempted by the FAA. <em>Cronus </em>reasoned the parties had chosen California law to govern their agreement, the procedural sections of the FAA were not \u201capplicable,\u201d and thus the competing choice-of-law contract provisions were not in conflict. Because the parties had made a clear choice of California procedural law to govern their arbitration, <em>Volt Info. Sciences v. Leland Stanford Jr. U </em>(1989) 489 U.S. 468 [103 L.Ed.2d 488, 109 S.Ct. 1248] <em>(Volt) </em>controlled. Under <em>Volt, </em>section 1281.2(c) was not otherwise preempted by the procedural sections of the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\"><em>Cronus </em>explained, however, that the parties to an arbitration agreement may <em>\u201cexpressly </em>designate that any arbitration proceeding should move forward under the FAA\u2019s procedural provisions rather than under state procedural law.\u201d <em>(Cronus, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 394.) We hold the parties in the instant case did just that, and accordingly the court erred when it denied ATI\u2019s petition to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">In a single lawsuit, plaintiffs Perry Rodriguez and Kathy Rodriquez sued ATI for professional negligence, and several insurance companies for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. The professional negligence cause of action asserted ATI was hired by a defendant insurance company to \u201cperform remediation and repairs to the insured premises,\u201d but ATI negligently performed its duties. Plaintiffs asserted they were forced to sell their house on an \u201cas is\u201d basis for a price \u201cfar below its market value\u201d and to dispose of \u201c[u]nsalvageable items\u201d of personal property. Kathy Rodriguez claimed to have suffered illness and personal injury due to \u201cexposure to mold and mold contamination.\u201d The complaint also alleged the insurance companies refused to pay adequate benefits for water damage and mold contamination under all-risk policies covering plaintiffs\u2019 home and personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>ATI performed the remediation and repair work on plaintiffs\u2019 home pursuant to a Work Proposal and Authorization contract which, inter alia, included the following arbitration clause: \u201cARBITRATION: Pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, any controversy or claim arising [out] of or related to this Agreement or the breach of any provision thereof shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association currently in effect, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.\u201d Although the contract contains references to certain provisions of California law regarding ATI\u2019s lien rights, it contains no express choice-of-law provision designating California law generally, and the American Arbitration Association\u2019s Construction Industry Arbitration Rules are silent as to the procedure to be followed when related litigation involves third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1280 et seq.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ATI petitioned to compel arbitration and stay the judicial proceeding. Plaintiffs opposed the motion, relying, inter alia, on section 1281.2(c), and arguing \u201ca motion to compel arbitration should be denied when a party to an arbitration agreement is also a party to litigation with a third party that: (1) arises out of the same transaction or series of related transactions, and (2) presents a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.\u201d Plaintiffs contended arbitration against ATI and litigation against the insurers could result in inconsistent rulings on common issues of law and fact. ATI responded that the arbitration agreement was governed by the FAA, and therefore section 1281.2(c) did not apply. The court denied the petition based on section 1281.2(c) and <em>Whaley v. Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 479 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 88] <em>(Whaley)</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">\n<em>Because the Arbitration Agreement Is Governed by Federal Law, Arbitration Cannot be Stayed Under Section 1281.2(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">ATI contends the parties expressly agreed the FAA would govern arbitration of disputes under the contract. ATI concludes section 1281.2(c) is inapplicable to the contract and the court therefore had no discretion to deny the petition to compel arbitration. For reasons we explain, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">A court\u2019s order denying arbitration under section 1281.2(c) is \u201cordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>(Whaley, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at p. 484.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>But the issue presented here\u2014whether federal law governs the arbitration agreement\u2014is a question of law involving interpretation of statutes and the contract (with no extrinsic evidence). We therefore apply a de novo standard of review. <em>(People ex rel. Lockyer </em>v. <em>Shamrock Foods Co. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 415, 432 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 11 P.3d 956]; <em>Parsons v.

Under section 1281.2(c), if a party to an arbitration agreement is also a party to related litigation with a third party that creates the risk of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact, \u201cthe court (1) may refuse to enforce the arbitration agreement and may order intervention or joinder of all parties in a single action or special proceeding; (2) may order intervention or joinder as to all or only certain issues; (3) may order arbitration among the parties who have agreed to arbitration and stay the pending court action or special proceeding pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding; or (4) may stay arbitration pending the outcome of the court action or special proceeding.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> Thus, while the FAA does not \u201cdeal with the special practical problems that arise in multiparty contractual disputes when some or all of the contracts at issue include agreements to arbitrate^] California has taken the lead in fashioning a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>legislative response to this problem, by giving courts authority to consolidate or stay arbitration proceedings ... in order to minimize the potential for contradictory judgments.\u201d <em>(Volt, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 476, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">2.

In litigation involving the parties to the contract <em>and </em>third parties, a California trial court denied a motion to compel arbitration and stayed the arbitration proceedings pursuant to section 1281.2(c). <em>(Volt, </em>at p. 471.) The California Court of Appeal affirmed, holding \u201cthat by specifying that their contract would be governed by [California law], the parties had incorporated the California rules of arbitration, including \u00a7 1281.2(c), into their arbitration agreement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 472.) The United States Supreme Court affirmed the California Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court held \u201capplication of the California statute is not preempted by the [FAA] in a case where the parties have agreed that their arbitration agreement will be governed by the law of California.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 470.) The Supreme Court reasoned: \u201cJust as [parties] may limit by contract the issues which they will arbitrate [citation], so too may they specify by contract the rules under which that arbitration will be conducted. Where, as here, the parties have agreed to abide by state rules of arbitration, enforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of the FAA, even if the result is that arbitration is stayed where the [FAA] would otherwise permit it to go forward.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>In <em>Mount Diablo, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th 711, the contract included a choice-of-law clause specifying the agreement\u2019s \u201c \u2018validity, construction, interpretation and enforcement\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 716) were governed by California law, and an arbitration provision requiring controversies were to be resolved by \u201carbitration under the appropriate rules of the American Arbitration Association.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 716, fn. 4.) In a lawsuit involving the parties to the contract and third parties, the trial court denied a motion to compel arbitration, relying on <em>Volt, supra, </em>489 U.S. 468 and section 1281.2(c). <em>(Mount Diablo, </em>at pp. 715-716.) Affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling, the Court of Appeal applied a two-step inquiry asking (1) whether the choice-of-law\u2019s language was \u201cbroad enough to include state law on the subject of arbitrability,\u201d and if so, (2) whether section 1281.2(c) reflected \u201ca hostility to the enforcement of arbitration agreements that the FAA was designed to overcome.\u201d <em>(Mount Diablo, </em>at p. 724.) The <em>Mount Diablo </em>court answered the first question in the affirmative, interpreting the choice-of-law provision\u2019s \u201cexplicit reference to enforcement [to] reasonably [include] such matters as whether proceedings to enforce the agreement shall occur in court or before an arbitrator.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 722.) The court then concluded that section 1281.2(c) did not contravene the FAA\u2019s policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements: \u201cSection 1281.2(c) is not a provision designed to limit the rights of parties who choose to arbitrate or otherwise to discourage the use of arbitration. Rather, it is part of California\u2019s statutory scheme designed to enforce the parties\u2019 arbitration agreements, as the FAA requires. Section 1281.2(c) addresses the peculiar situation that arises when a controversy also affects claims by or against other parties not bound by the arbitration agreement. The California provision giving the court discretion not to enforce the arbitration agreement under such circumstances\u2014in order to avoid potential inconsistency in outcome as well as duplication of effort\u2014does not contravene the letter or the spirit of the FAA.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Mount Diablo, </em>at p. 726.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Finally, <em>Cronus, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th 376, involved several contracts whose choice-of-law clauses stated the agreements would be \u201c \u2018construed and enforced\u2019 \u201d in accordance with California law, \u201c \u2018without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.\u2019 \u201d (Id. at p. 381.) But the contracts\u2019 arbitration provisions appeared to limit or condition the choice of California law, specifying that the \u201c \u2018designation of a situs or specifically a governing law\u2019 \u201d for the contracts did not \u201c \u2018preclude application of the [FAA], if it would be applicable.\u2019 \u201d (Id. at p. 381, fn. 3.) The arbitration clauses further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>stated arbitration would be conducted under the \u201c \u2018Rules for Commercial Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In litigation (including cross-complaints) involving the parties to the contracts and third parties, the trial court denied a motion to compel arbitration and stayed the arbitration proceedings under section 1281.2(c). <em>(Cronus, </em>at pp. 381-382.)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The California Supreme Court affirmed, employing a two-step analysis similar to that employed in <em>Mount Diablo. </em>\u201cUnder United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, we examine the language of the contract to determine whether the parties intended to apply the FAA to the exclusion of California procedural law and, if any ambiguity exists, to determine whether section 1281.2(c) conflicts with or frustrates the objectives of the FAA.\u201d <em>(Cronus, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 383.) Examining the contract language, the court and parties agreed the scope of the choice-of-law clause incorporating California rules was \u201c \u2018limited by applicable provisions of the FAA\u2019 and [was] nullified \u2018only where the FAA\u2019s provisions are inconsistent with the [California Arbitration Act].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 387.) Having found an ambiguity in the contract as to the parties\u2019 intentions, the court proceeded to the second prong of the inquiry and examined whether section 1281.2(c) conflicts with the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\"><em>Cronus </em>analyzed the FAA\u2019s substantive and procedural provisions separately, and summarized the FAA\u2019s <em>procedural </em>sections as follows: \u201cSection 3 of the FAA concerns the enforcement of arbitration agreements in a pending lawsuit. It requires the \u2018courts of the United States\u2019 to grant a party\u2019s request for a stay of litigation on an arbitrable issue, pending completion of the arbitration. [Citation.] Section 4 of the FAA concerns petitions for enforcement of an arbitration agreement where one party refuses to arbitrate. It requires a \u2018United States district court\u2019 to entertain an application to compel arbitration.\u201d <em>(Cronus, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 388, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Based on the language of the statutes and legislative history, the <em>Cronus </em>court concluded the FAA\u2019s procedural provisions generally do <em>not </em>apply to state court proceedings. Thus, the court implicitly concluded sections 3 and 4 of the FAA were not \u201capplicable\u201d within the meaning of the contract\u2019s arbitration clause. The court\u2019s conclusion was bolstered by the statement of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Volt </em>that \u201c \u2018[w]hile we have held the FAA\u2019s \u2018substantive\u2019 provisions\u2014\u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2\u2014are applicable in state as well as federal court [citation], we have never held that \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4, which by their terms appear to apply only to proceedings in federal court [citations], are nonetheless applicable in state court.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cronus, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 389.) <em>Cronus </em>noted that in <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 681 [134 L.Ed.2d 902, 116 S.Ct. 1652], the United States Supreme Court had reaffirmed <em>\u201cVolt\u2019s </em>distinction between the procedural and substantive aspects of the FAA [by describing] section 1281.2(c) as \u2018determining] only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>efficient order of proceedings [and] not affect[ing] the enforceability of the arbitration agreement itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cronus, </em>at p. 390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Turning to the FAA\u2019s substantive provisions, <em>Cronus </em>addressed the question whether section 1281.2(c)\u2019s \u201capplication would undermine and frustrate . . . section 2\u2019s policy of enforceability of arbitration agreements.\u201d <em>(Cronus, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 391.) <em>Cronus </em>quoted <em>Volt\u2019s </em>conclusion that the California arbitration rules \u201c \u2018generally foster the federal policy favoring arbitration\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cronus, </em>at p. 392) and \u201c <em>\u2018are manifestly designed to encourage resort to the arbitral process.\u2019 \u201d (Id. </em>at p. 391.) Distinguishing <em>Mastrobuono, supra, </em>514 U.S. 52, the <em>Cronus </em>court stated \u201csection 1281.2(c) is <em>not </em>a special rule limiting the authority of arbitrators,\u201d but is instead \u201can evenhanded law that allows the trial court to stay arbitration proceedings while the concurrent lawsuit proceeds <em>or </em>stay the lawsuit while arbitration proceeds to avoid conflicting rulings on common issues of fact and law amongst interrelated parties.\u201d <em>(Cronus, </em>at p. 393.) Having found that section 1281.2(c) does <em>not </em>conflict with the FAA\u2019s applicable procedural and substantive rules, the <em>Cronus </em>court concluded: \u201cThus, we need not construe any ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration provision against the application of section 1281.2(c).\u201d <em>(Cronus, </em>at p. 393.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">But then the <em>Cronus </em>court added this caveat: \u201c[P]arties to an arbitration agreement [may] <em>expressly </em>designate that any arbitration proceeding should move forward under the FAA\u2019s procedural provisions rather than under state procedural law.\u201d <em>(Cronus, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 394.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">3. <em>The Rodriguez/'ATI Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">As noted at the outset of this opinion, the parties to the arbitration provision here at issue agreed to arbitrate claims arising out of the contract, \u201c[p]ursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act,\u201d and \u201cin accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\u201d The contract contains no overarching choice-of-law provision, although it references a number of specific California statutes relating to hens and home solicitation contracts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The American Arbitration Association\u2019s Construction Industry Arbitration Rules are silent as to the procedure to be followed when related litigation involves third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">As instructed by <em>Cronus, </em>\u201cwe examine the language of the contract to determine whether the parties intended to apply the FAA to the exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>of California procedural law.\u201d <em>(Cronus, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 383.) The contract specifies that claims shall be arbitrated \u201cpursuant to the FAA.\u201d In common understanding, the phrase \u201cpursuant to\u201d means \u201cin conformance to or agreement with\u201d and \u201caccording to.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (2002) p. 1848.) Plainly, the language of the contract requires the parties to arbitrate \u201cin conformance to\u201d and \u201cagreement with\u201d the FAA. There is <em>no </em>other contract provision suggesting the parties intended to incorporate California arbitration law, nor is there any language suggesting the parties intended to arbitrate \u201cin conformance to\u201d some provisions of the FAA but not others. The phrase \u201cpursuant to the FAA\u201d is broad and unconditional, unlike the <em>Cronus </em>clause, which deferred to the contract\u2019s California choice-of-law provision by invoking only \u201capplicable\u201d provisions of the FAA. <em>(Cronus, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Thus, there is no ambiguity regarding the parties\u2019 intent. They adopted the FAA\u2014all of it\u2014to govern their arbitration. The FAA controls, including section 3 which requires the court to stay the judicial proceeding and compel arbitration. Although section 3 may not generally apply to state courts, here the parties did as <em>Cronus </em>suggested they could: They expressly designated <em>their </em>arbitration proceeding \u201cshould move forward under the FAA\u2019s procedural provisions rather than under state procedural law.\u201d <em>(Cronus, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 394.)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Thus, the court erred by denying ATI\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and stay the court proceeding as to plaintiffs and ATI. In accordance with the agreement of the parties, section 3 of the FAA required the court to compel arbitration between plaintiffs and ATI and to stay the court proceeding with respect to their disputes with each other. While we may question the wisdom of the parties\u2019 choice, and decry the potential for inefficiency, delay, and conflicting rulings, the parties were free to choose their arbitration rules. The court will not rewrite their contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">We note in this regard, although the contract did not invoke California arbitration law, such law remains applicable to the pending court action as to the defendant insurance companies, which are <em>not </em>subject to arbitration under the FAA. Thus, in order to avoid conflicting rulings, on remand the court may consider whether to exercise its discretion under section 1281.2(c) to stay the action as to the insurance companies pending the outcome of the arbitration. Alternatively, if <em>any </em>party to the court proceeding moves to stay the litigation pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4, the court must order a stay, except to the extent that arbitrable issues are severable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (See <em>Marcus v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number><em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 204, 209 [141 Cal.Rptr. 890] [party moving to stay action under section 1281.4 need not be a party to arbitration agreement].) Thus, the insurance company defendants may move to stay the action under section 1281.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">\n<em>The Parties Designated the Arbitrator to Determine the Scope of the Arbitration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The contract\u2019s arbitration clause applies to claims \u201carising [out] of or related to\u201d the agreement. Plaintiffs contend two of their grievances fall outside the clause\u2019s scope\u2014specifically their claims ATI offered to buy their home \u201cas-is\u201d and made a \u201clow-ball\u201d bid to perform new work.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">Although the scope of an arbitration clause is generally a question for judicial determination, the parties may, by clear and unmistakable agreement, elect to have the arbitrator, rather than the court, decide which grievances are arbitrable. <em>(AT &amp; T Technologies </em>v. <em>Communications Workers </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 643, 649 [89 L.Ed.2d 648, 106 S.Ct. 1415].) Here, the parties clearly and unmistakably agreed to have the arbitrator determine the scope of the arbitration clause. The contract mandates arbitration in accordance with the American Arbitration Association\u2019s Construction Industry Rules. Rule 8(a) of those rules specifies the \u201carbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, <em>scope </em>or validity of the arbitration agreement.\u201d (Italics added.) By incorporating rule 8(a) into their agreement, the parties clearly evidenced their intention to accord the arbitrator the authority to determine issues of arbitrability. (See <em>Shaw Group Inc. v. Triplefine Intern. Corp. </em>(2d Cir. 2003) 322 F.3d 115, 124\u2014125.) Thus, any issues concerning the scope of the arbitration clause should be determined by the arbitrator in the arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">\n<em>The Arbitration Clause Was Not Inconspicuous</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Plaintiffs also contend the arbitration clause was \u201cplaced inconspicuously on the back of the form.\u201d Relying on <em>Windsor Mills, Inc. v. Collins &amp; Aikman Corp. </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 987 [101 Cal.Rptr. 347] <em>(Windsor Mills), </em>they argue \u201can offeree, regardless of apparent manifestation of his consent, is not bound by inconspicuous contractual provisions of which he was unaware, <em>contained in a document whose contractual nature is not </em>obvious.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 993, italics added.) <em>Windsor Mills </em>involved printed forms entitled \u201cAcknowledgment of Order\u201d that were sent to the buyer as each order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>merchandise was received and did not require the buyer\u2019s signature. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 989-990.) The court found the \u201cforms were not contractual in form\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 996), and thus not binding on the buyer. It is nevertheless true, however, that \u201cordinarily one who signs an instrument which on its face is a contract is deemed to assent to all its terms.\u201d <em>(Marin Storage &amp; Trucking, Inc. v. Benco Contracting and Engineering, Inc. </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1049 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 645].) \u201cAn exception to this general rule exists when the writing does not appear to be a contract and the terms are not called to the attention of the recipient.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1049-1050 [citing <em>Windsor Mills </em>as an example].)</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Here, the agreement is titled \u201cWORK PROPOSAL AND AUTHORIZATION,\u201d and is signed by ATI\u2019s representative and by Kathy Rodriguez underneath a line stating \u201cAccepted by Client.\u201d The document has provisions labeled \u201cCONTRACT TIME\u201d and \u201cCONTRACT SUM,\u201d and it looks like a contract. Clearly stated on the front page, above the signature lines, is the clause: \u201cREVERSE SIDE TERMS: The Terms and conditions on the reverse side of this Proposal are incorporated herein by reference.\u201d The arbitration clause on the reverse side is labeled with the heading, \u201cARBITRATION,\u201d in bold capital letters. We conclude ATI and at least Kathy Rodriguez assented to the contract and its arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">\n<em>Whether Perry Rodriguez Is Bound by His Wife\u2019s Execution of the Arbitration Agreement Is a Remaining Issue for the Trial Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Although the contract identified both Perry and Kathy Rodriguez as \u201cclients,\u201d only Kathy Rodriguez signed the agreement. Plaintiffs therefore assert Perry Rodriguez is not bound to arbitrate the dispute. ATI, on the other hand, contends Perry Rodriguez is bound by the arbitration clause under theories of actual or ostensible agency, ratification, and/or third party beneficiary. In light of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the application of section 1281.2(c), it did not make findings on these issues. Because the court below has not yet decided whether Perry Rodriguez is bound by the contract, including its arbitration clause, and because \u201cthe existence of agency is generally a question of fact\u201d <em>(Brokaw v. Black-Foxe Military Institute </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 274, 278 [231 P.2d 816]), we remand this issue to the trial court for its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">The order denying ATI\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and stay judicial proceedings is reversed and the matter remanded for the trial court to determine whether Perry Rodriguez is bound by the arbitration agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>The court is directed to enter a new order granting the motion to compel arbitration of plaintiff Kathy Rodriquez\u2019s claims against ATI and to stay judicial proceedings as to those claims. If the court determines Perry Rodriguez is bound by the arbitration agreement, it shall enter the same order as to his claims. If tiie court determines Perry Rodriguez is not bound by the arbitration agreement, it shall reinstate the order denying arbitration as to his claims. ATI shall recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">O\u2019Leary, Acting P.
