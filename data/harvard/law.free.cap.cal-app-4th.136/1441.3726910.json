Code, \u00a7\u00a7 51.7, 52.1) may be asserted as a separate cause of action in an action alleging wrongful termination and employment discrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court ruled these sections were part of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (the Act) and, thus, were inapplicable in the employment context. We conclude there is no bar to asserting violations of sections 51.7 and 52.1 in employment cases. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order sustaining real parties in interest\u2019s demurrer and granting their motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">Kenny-Shea-Traylor-Frontier-Kemper, JV, and Traylor Bros., Inc. (collectively Traylor), is a mining company that employed petitioner Robert Stamps as a tunnel miner. Stamps sued Traylor and his supervisor, Travis Thompson, alleging he was subjected to retaliation, violence, and intimidation by threat of violence. Stamps, an. African-American, further alleged Thompson verbally harassed him with racist remarks, yelled at him in an intimidating manner, threatened him with physical violence for not completing work assignments, and generally placed him in unsafe work situations without proper equipment and training, all on account of his race. Thompson\u2019s alleged lack of concern for Stamps\u2019s safety resulted in an injury that caused several of Stamps\u2019s toes to be amputated. Stamps was terminated as a result of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">The operative pleading was the first amended complaint, which alleged three causes of action: (1) wrongful termination in violation of public policy, (2) retaliation in violation of public policy, and (3) violation of sections 51.7 and 52.1. Traylor and Thompson (collectively real parties) demurred and filed a motion to strike. Among their contentions, real parties argued the third cause of action failed because sections 51.7 and 52.1 are part of the Act and the Supreme Court held in <em>Rojo v. Kliger </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 65 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373] <em>(Rojo), </em>that the Act does not apply to employment cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">The trial court agreed with real parties and sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action without leave to amend. The court also struck Stamps\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>request for attorney fees and penalties under sections 51.7 and 52.1. On Stamps\u2019s petition, we issued an alternative writ of mandate and heard oral argument. As we will discuss, we hold Stamps properly stated a cause of action; the trial court, therefore, erred in its rulings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">We organize our opinion by first providing an overview of the applicable legislation and its history. We then conclude that sections 51.7 and 52.1 are not part of the Act, the Supreme Court in <em>Rojo </em>did not adopt a rule barring employment cases from being founded on the two statutes, and there is no other reason to preclude such statutory claims in employment cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">\u201cAs the issues presented are all entirely legal in nature, we employ our independent judgment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Gatto v.

Sections 51.7 and 52.1: Overview. </em>Section 51.7 broadly provides that all persons have the right to be free from violence and intimidation by threat of violence based on, among other things, race, religion, ancestry, national origin, political aflSliation, sex, or position in a labor dispute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The rights protected by section 51.7 may be enforced by a private action for damages.

The section also provides criminal sanctions for violations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Attorney fees may be awarded under both statutes. (\u00a7\u00a7 52, subd. (b)(3), 52.1, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\"><em>B. Sections 51.7 and 52.1: Legislative History. </em>The history of section 51.7 indicates the legislation was referred to as the Ralph Civil Rights Act and enacted in 1976 as part of Assembly Bill No. 2986 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) (Assembly Bill No. 2986). An Assembly Committee report stated that while there were \u201cnumerous state and federal laws providing for full and equal civil rights protections in employment, housing, and access to public accommodations and facilities,\u201d there was no specific prohibition protecting individuals from \u201cviolence because of their race, religion, color, ancestry, or national origin.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Labor Relations, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2986, <em>supra, </em>Apr. 20, 1976, p. 1.) The report continues, \u201cAlthough it is impossible to estimate the instances of violence against persons in California because of race, color, religion or other factors, there have been enough occurrences such as the one in Taft, California last year where Black college students were threatened with violence and chased out of town to signify a possible need for greater protection of this fundamental right. . . . This measure declares that all persons have a right to be free from violence or threat of violence committed against their persons or property because of race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, political affiliation, or position in a labor dispute.\u201d (Ibid.; see also <em>Venegas v. County of Los Angeles </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 820, 845-848 <em>[11 </em>Cal.Rptr.3d 692, 87 P.3d 1] <em>(Venegas) </em>(conc. opn. of Baxter, 1), [describing the historical background of the \u201cRalph Civil Rights Act\u201d]; <em>In re Joshua H. </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1734, 1748, fn. 9 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 291] [referring to section 51.7 as the \u201cRalph Civil Rights Act\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>As noted by an Assembly committee report, a central feature of section 51.7 was to afford an individual the opportunity to file immediately a private civil action at the same time he or she pursued a complaint with the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC). (Assem. Com. on Labor Relations, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2986, <em>supra, </em>Apr. 6, 1976, p. 1.) Previously, a person filing a complaint with the FEPC would have been precluded from concurrently initiating a private civil action on the same matter. Assembly Bill No. 2986 allowed for both a private civil remedy and the enforcement mechanisms of the FEPC. <em>(Ibid.; </em>Assem. Office of Research, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2986, <em>supra, </em>as amended Aug. 16, 1976; Legis. Analyst, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2986, <em>supra, </em>as amended Apr. 30, 1976, p. 2; Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2986, <em>supra, </em>as amended May 25, 1976, p. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">The second statute on which Stamps\u2019s third cause of action was based, section 52.1, was enacted a decade later as part of Assembly Bill No. 63 (1987-1988 Reg. Sess.) (Assembly Bill No. 63) and is known as the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act. It was intended to supplement the Ralph Civil Rights Act as an additional legislative effort to deter violence. (See Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 63, <em>supra, </em>as amended Mar. 2, 1987, p. 1.) The stated purpose of the bill was \u201cto fill in the gaps left by the Ralph Act\u201d by allowing an individual to seek relief to prevent the violence from occurring before it was committed and providing for the filing of criminal charges. (Assem. Com. on Ways and Means, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 63, <em>supra, </em>as amended Apr. 6, 1987, p. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">The Assembly Committee on Public Safety reported, \u201cThe Attorney General\u2019s office states that the number of crimes which are committed because of the victim\u2019s racial, ethnic, religious, or other minority status are increasing, that members of minority groups increasingly believe they are threatened by attack or harassment, and that existing law is inadequate to protect them. They also stated that existing civil rights statutes do little to deter hate violence because there are no criminal penalties. Existing criminal statutes (trespass, vandalism, etc.) do not reflect the seriousness of the problem of racially motivated violence. The purpose of this bill is to give law enforcement officials clear effective authority to prevent acts of hate violence, and to deter such conduct by establishing serious criminal penalties\u201d and by \u201c[a]llow[ing] an individual, or the Attorney General, district attorney, or city attorney, to bring an action to enjoin crimes of hate violence where they are threatened.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 63, <em>supra, </em>as amended Mar. 2, 1987, pp. 1-2; see also <em>Venegas, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at pp. 845-848 (conc. opn. of Baxter, J.) [describing the historical background of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act]; <em>In re Joshua H., supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1739, 1748, fn. 9 [referring to section 52.1 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>Penal Code section 422.7 as the \u201cTom Bane Civil Rights Act,\u201d and stating that, along with the Ralph Civil Rights Act and related statutes, it is California\u2019s response to the increase in hate crimes]; <em>Cabesuela </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Industries of California, Inc. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 101, 110 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 60] [section 52.1 part of Tom Bane Civil Rights Act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">The legislative history reveals that the broad and plain language of sections 51.7 and 52.1 was chosen to provide protection from discriminatory violence and intimidation, and from threats, intimidation and coercion that denied the civil rights of others. The creation of civil causes of action by victims of such conduct was at the heart of the legislation. Neither the words of the statutes nor their lineage reflects an explicit intent by the Legislature either to include or exclude sections 51.7 and 52.1 from the realm of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\"><em>C. The Act. </em>Section 51 provides in relevant part, \u201cAll persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, [or] medical condition . . . are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.\u201d (\u00a7 51, subd. (b).) The statute\u2019s prefatory clause states \u201cThis <em>section </em>shall be known, and may be cited, as the Unruh Civil Rights Act.\u201d (\u00a751, subd. (a), italics added.) The act traces its origins to similar legislation enacted in 1901 and again in 1905. (See Historical Note, 6 West\u2019s Annot. Civ. Code (1982 ed.) foil. \u00a7 51, p. 312.) Its purpose is \u201cto compel recognition of the equality of all persons in the right to the particular service offered by an organization or entity covered by the act.\u201d <em>(Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 712, 733 [195 Cal.Rptr. 325]; see also <em>Marina Point, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Wolfson </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 721, 738 [180 Cal.Rptr. 496, 640 P.2d 115].) As part of the 1959 amendments, it was named after California\u2019s former Speaker of the House, Jesse Unruh.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">Although the breadth of the Act is wide, its mission explicit, and is to be liberally construed <em>(Koire v. Metro Car Wash </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 24, 28 [219 Cal.Rptr. 133, 707 P.2d 195]), our Supreme Court has stated that the Act \u201chas no application to employment discrimination.\u201d <em>(Rojo, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>p. 77; see also <em>Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 500 [86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216] <em>(Alcorn).) </em>In <em>Alcorn, </em>an employment discrimination case, the Supreme Court concluded that, notwithstanding the statute\u2019s extensive reach, \u201cthere is no indication that the Legislature intended to broaden the scope of section 51 to include discriminations other than those made by a \u2018business establishment\u2019 in the course of furnishing goods, services or facilities to its clients, patrons or customers.\u201d <em>(Alcorn, </em>at p. 500; see also <em>Isbister </em>v. <em>Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz, Inc. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 72, 83, fn. 12 [219 Cal.Rptr. 150, 707 P.2d 212] [\u201cemployer-employee relationship\u201d is not covered by the Act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">3. <em>Interplay Among the Act and the Ralph and Tom Bane Civil Rights Acts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">In their opposition to the petition for extraordinary writ, real parties state their principal argument in words that could not be clearer: \u201cCivil Code sections 51.7 and 52.1 are part of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civil Code sections 51 et seq.\u201d From this proposition, real parties argue that since the two statutes in question are part of the Act and since <em>Rojo </em>holds the Act does not apply to employment cases, it flows that Stamps cannot base his third cause of action on sections 51.7 and 52.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">We find two flaws in this argument. First, neither legislative history nor case law supports the conclusion that sections 51.7 and 52.1 are included in what is known as the Act. Second, even if the Act\u2019s reach did extend to these two statutes, there is nothing in <em>Rojo </em>that suggests the Supreme Court intended to preclude employment cases from being founded on sections 51.7 and 52.1 even if they may not be predicated on section 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">A. <em>The Act does not include the Ralph or Tom Bane Civil Rights Acts. </em>The parties vigorously debate whether the sections under consideration are or are not part of the Act. Before we reach our destination, we gently observe a point that is beyond controversy: The courts generally have done a poor job of describing the various components of the Act. Not until 2002 did an appellate court tackle the issue head on. In <em>Gatto, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th 744, the court was confronted with determining the statute of limitations for actions under sections 51 and 51.7. The case had nothing to do with employment discrimination; rather, a Hell\u2019s Angel was ejected from a county fair for not removing his motorcycle club vest. The court refused to assume that the statutes of limitations for the two sections were necessarily the same.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, it initially reflected on the lack of precision in describing the components of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1450\">*1450</page-number>\u201cBy its own terms, the Unruh Civil Rights Act comprises <em>only </em>section 51. Subdivision (a) of section 51 states: \u2018This <em>section </em>shall be known, and may be cited, as the Unruh Civil Rights Act.\u2019 (Italics added.) The courts, however, have consistently described as Unruh Civil Rights Act claims causes of action based under seemingly related provisions set forth in sections of the Civil Code that follow section 51. <em>West Shield </em>is a good example. That case presented no claim of denial of full and equal accommodations in violation of section 51; however, the court treated causes of action alleging interference with the exercise of constitutional rights under section 52.1, and sexual harassment under section 51.9 as Unruh Civil Rights Act claims. Similarly, section 51.9 was treated as an \u2018Unruh Civil Rights Act claim\u2019 in <em>Brown v. Smith </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 767, 774-775 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 301], as was section 54.1 in <em>Independent Housing Services </em>[(1993)] 840 F.Supp. 1328. Citing several state and federal opinions, the court in <em>Doe v. Petaluma City School Dist. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1993) 830 F.Supp. 1560 stated that \u2018[i]t appears that section 52.1 is at least a \u201ccomponent\u201d of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1581.) It is noteworthy, however, that in construing section 52.1, our Supreme Court explained that it was enacted by the Legislature \u2018to stem a tide of hate crimes\u2019 <em>(Jones v. Kmart Corp. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 329, 338 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 949 P.2d 941]) and never referred to it as part of the Unruh Civil Rights Act which, at least originally, dealt only with the issue of equal accommodations. Other courts have referred to section 52.1 and related statutes, including section 51.7, as part of the Bane Act. (See, e.g., <em>Bay Area Rapid Transit Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 141, 144 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 887]; <em>Boccato v. City of Hermosa Beach </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1797, 1809 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 282].) <em>In re Joshua H. </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1734 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 291] also refers to section 52.1 as part of the Bane Act but refers to section 51.7 as the \u2018Ralph Civil Rights Act.\u2019 <em>(Boccato, </em>at p. 1748, fn. 9.) HO Reference to a statute or statutory scheme by the name of its author does not influence the meaning and effect of the enactment, but an erroneous denotation that includes one measure as part of another may obscure differences that are legally very significant. This is what appears to have happened to the Unruh Civil Rights Act, which is increasingly treated as an omnibus antidiscrimination statute no longer limited to merely ensuring equal access to accommodations. For purposes of determining the applicable statute of limitations, this creates a problem, for the provisions now seen as parts of the Unruh Civil Rights Act do not all share the same common law provenance.\u201d <em>(Gatto, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th 744, 757-758.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1451\">*1451</page-number>Although the <em>Gatto </em>court does not unequivocally hold that sections 51.7 and 52.1 are not part of the Act, we are not so reserved: We conclude neither section is part of a properly denominated Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This conclusion is based largely on the legislative history that we have described <em>ante </em>and is consistent with that reached by two commentators in the civil rights litigation field. Their treatise devotes entire sections to two subjects: \u201cRalph Act is not part of the Unruh Act or FEHA,\u201d and \u201cBane Act is not part of the Unruh Act, the Ralph Act or another statute.\u201d (Kahn &amp; Links, Cal. Civil Practice: Civil Rights Litigation (2005) \u00a7 314, p. 27, \u00a7 327, p. 50.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1452\">*1452</page-number>The authors observe that several cases \u201chave erroneously referred to the Ralph Act as the Unruh Act. [Citations.] . . . Although the Ralph Act and the Unruh Act are codified near each other in the Civ. Code, and both share the same remedy statute, Civ. Code, \u00a7 52, there are significant differences between them. The Ralph Act focuses on violence or intimidation by threat of violence, while those concepts are absent in the Unruh Act. The Unruh Act, Civ. Code, \u00a7 51, is a public accommodations statue that focuses on discriminatory behavior by business establishments, while the Ralph Act has nothing to do with public accommodations or business establishments.\u201d (Kahn &amp; Links, Cal. Civil Practice: Civil Rights Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 314, p. 28.) Similarly, many \u201ccases have referred to a Bane Act claim as an Unruh Act claim and/or stated that the Bane Act is a component of the Unruh Act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 327, at p. 51.) This, the authors assert, is \u201cerroneous.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We agree.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\"><em>B. Real parties\u2019 authorities are not persuasive. </em>The cases on which real parties rely to support their argument that section 51.7 and 52.1 are part of the Act do not so hold. As <em>Gatto </em>observes, those cases generally reflect a \u201clack of clarity as to which provisions of [the Civil Code] actually comprise the Unruh Civil Rights Act . . . .\u201d <em>(Gatto, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 759.) For the most part, these authorities do not even discuss sections 51.7 or 52.1 and had no cause to decide what provisions actually comprise the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">For example, in <em>Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority v. Superior Court </em>(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 261 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 92], the court was confronted with whether Government Code section 818 prohibiting punitive damages against public entities applied to section 52, subdivision (b)(2) which allows for a $25,000 civil penalty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal framed the case thusly: \u201cIn this writ proceeding, we are asked to address the novel question of whether section 818 precludes the award of the civil penalty specified in the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51 et seq. [Unruh Act]) for the violation of certain of its provisions.\u201d <em>(Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority v. Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 264.) Neither in its prefatory statement nor in connection with the several other occasions where it used the term \u201cUnruh Act\u201d did the court have occasion to consider whether sections 51.7 or 52.1 were part of the Act. That determination was not germane to the issue of whether the California Tort Claims Act forbade the civil penalty from being imposed against the municipal defendant. If the court had eliminated all references to \u201cthe Unruh Act\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1453\">*1453</page-number>instead had identified the statutes only by their code section, its analysis would have been intact. (See also <em>Schifando v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1089 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 457, 79 P.3d 569] (Schifando) [referring to the Act as \u201cCiv. Code, \u00a7 51.7 et seq.\u201d]; <em>Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Assn. </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618, 622 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 237] [\u201cUnruh Civil Rights Act. (Civ.

There the precise issue was whether the Government Code section that precluded civil lawsuits for failure to provide police protection applied to claims under sections 51.7 and 52. The court answered the question affirmatively. <em>(Gates, supra, </em>at pp. 512-513.) As was the case in <em>Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority v. Superior Court, </em>the court of appeal made repeated references to \u201cthe Unruh Act.\u201d But again, whether or not individual code sections were or were not part of the Act had no bearing on its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Finally, references to the \u201cUnruh Act\u201d are found in <em>West Shield, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at pages 951-954, in the same context as the other appellate decisions cited <em>ante. </em>The issue there was whether a one-year (personal injuries) or three-year (liability founded on a statute) statute of limitations applied to claims under sections 51.9 and 52.1.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In concluding that the one-year statute applied, the Court of Appeal noted that what it called the various Unruh Act statutes were all rooted in the common law and hence did not qualify for the longer limitations period. Again, the analysis did not turn on whether a particular statute was or was not properly included in the legislative short title.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">Real parties also rely on several federal cases that discuss the relationship of the various statutes starting with section 51. <em>McCalden </em>v. <em>California Library Ass\u2019n </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 955 F.2d 1214, 1220-1221, is arguably the most helpful to their position. There, a \u201cHolocaust revisionist\u201d brought suit in federal court. He included a claim under section 51.7, in which he claimed intimidation because of his political beliefs. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1454\">*1454</page-number>Ninth Circuit assumed that section 51.7 was part of the Act, stating: \u201cThe California courts, however, have considered \u00a7 51.7 to be a \u2018component\u2019 of the earlier-enacted Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 51. See <em>Long v. Valentino, </em>216 Cal.App.3d 1287, 1293 [265 Cal.Rptr. 96] (1989).\u201d <em>CMcCalden, </em>at pp. 1220-1221.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>McCalden </em>does use section 51 authority to support its conclusion that the various categories enumerated in section 51.7 (e.g., race, national origin) are not exclusive and the protected classes include membership in political groups. <em>(McCalden, </em>at p. 1222.) Again, however, there is no effort to analyze how section 51.7 is or is not part of the Act. The fact that closely related statutes may be used to assist in statutory interpretation does not mean that one is included in the other. Rather, <em>McCalden </em>s approach was an application of a venerable method of statutory construction. (See <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>E.T. Legg Associates </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 496, 505 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 10] [\u201c \u2018a statute is not to be read in isolation; it must be construed with related statutes and considered in the context of the statutory framework as a whole\u2019 \u201d].) Unquestionably, sections 51.7 and 52.1 are related to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\"><em>Waters v. U.S. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1993) 812 F.Supp. 166, 169, also cited by real parties, involved a section 51.7 action in the employment context, the setting present here. However, the court dismissed the case without a discussion of the merits of the controversy, as the plaintiff had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">Remarkably, real parties also direct our attention to <em>Taormina </em>v. <em>California Dept. of Corrections </em>(S.D.Cal. 1996) 946 F.Supp. 829, 833-834 <em>(Taormina). Taormina </em>involves a federal civil rights action against a state correctional facility over an injury to an inmate. The opinion addresses pendent state claims which appear to be based primarily on sections 51, 51.5 (arbitrary discrimination in business establishments), and 51.7. (946 F.Supp. at p. 833.) The court described the plaintiff\u2019s complaint as follows: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s fifth cause of action (interference with statutory and constitutional rights) is premised on the Banes [\u00edzc] Act, Cal.Civ.Code section 51 et seq. . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In omitting reference to the \u201cUnruh Act,\u201d the opinion not only misidentifies section 51, it does so by misspelling the name of the author of section 52.1.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number><em>C. Rojo does not address whether employment discrimination cases may be based on sections 51.7 or 52.1. </em>Real parties\u2019 central assertion is that the Supreme Court case of <em>Rojo, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d 65, compels the ruling of the trial court. Their argument is founded on (1) the assumption that sections 51.7 and 52.1 are part of the Act, and (2) <em>Rojo\u2019s </em>statement that \u201cthe Unruh Civil Rights Act has no application to employment discrimination.\u201d (52 Cal.3d at p. 77; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 74.) As we have already discussed, sections 51.7 and 52.1 are not part of the Act, thus kicking out the underpinnings of real parties\u2019 contention. More fundamentally, <em>Rojo </em>has nothing to do with the statutes involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">The issues articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Rojo </em>were whether the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.) \u201cprovides the exclusive remedy for injuries relating to sex discrimination in employment; whether an employee must exhaust the administrative remedies under the FEHA as a prerequisite to pursuing a civil action; and whether sex discrimination in employment may give rise to a claim of wrongful discharge in contravention of public policy.\u201d <em>(Rojo, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 70.) These subjects are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">As to the code sections that comprise the Act, the Supreme Court mentioned the statute by name five times. Twice, it was with specific reference to section 51 <em>(Rojo, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 76, fn. 5, 77); twice to both sections 51 and 52 (52 Cal.3d at p. 78); and once without reference to any code section at all <em>(id. </em>at p. 79). Concerning the language seized upon by real parties in support of their position here, the Supreme Court expressly referred to section 51: \u201cNo specific mention was made of Civil Code section 51, because none was needed: the Unruh Civil Rights Act has no application to employment discrimination.\u201d (52 Cal.3d at p. 77.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\"><em>Rojo </em>stands for the proposition that violations of section 51 may not be asserted in the employment context. This rule is consistent with Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1456\">*1456</page-number>Court precedent cited in <em>Rojo. </em>(See <em>Isbister </em>v. <em>Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz, Inc., supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 72, 83, fn. 12 [219 Cal.Rptr. 150]; <em>Alcorn, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 500; see also <em>Alch, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.4th at p. 391.) But <em>Rojo </em>does not mention either section 51.7 or section 52.1, and the two earlier Supreme Court decisions were authored before either statute had become law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">The rule that employment cases cannot be based on section 51 is explained simply: Section 51, on its face, applies to \u201caccommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments.\u201d As the court in <em>Alcorn </em>stated, \u201cthere is no indication that the Legislature intended to broaden the scope of section 51 to include discriminations other than those made by a \u2018business establishment\u2019 in the course of furnishing goods, services or facilities to its clients, patrons or customers.\u201d <em>(Alcorn, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 500.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">Thus, even if we were to conclude that sections 51.7 and 52.1 were part of the Act (which we do not), the rule expressed in <em>Rojo </em>would have no application to the present case, as neither statute contains the limiting statutory language of section 51 that was instrumental to <em>Rojo\u2019s </em>holding. (See <em>Little </em>v. <em>Auto Stiegler, Inc. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1064, 1081 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 892, 63 P.3d 979] [cases are not authority for propositions not considered].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">4. <em>Sections 51.7 and 52.1 Authorize a Private Cause of Action in Employment Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">In the preceding sections we have held that sections 51.7 and 52.1 are not part of the Act and neither <em>Rojo, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d 65, the cases on which it is based, nor any other authorities cited by real parties prohibit a statutory claim in employment cases. Our inquiry is not over. Ultimately, the question before us is whether the statutes in question <em>do </em>create a private cause of action in the employment field. At its core, this is a matter for the Legislature. \u201cThe question of whether a regulatory statute creates a private right of action depends on legislative intent.\u201d <em>(Goehring </em>v. <em>Chapman University </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 353, 375 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 39].) The Legislature also has the power to limit private statutory civil actions to, for example, certain classes of individuals or types of claims. (See <em>Faria v. San Jacinto Unified School Dist. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1939, 1946 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 72].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1457\">*1457</page-number>Here, there is no doubt that private causes of action are expressly authorized by both sections 51.7 and 52.1. A civil action under section 51.7 is provided for in section 52, subdivision (b), which provides that anyone who commits an act proscribed in section 51.7 is liable \u201cfor the actual damages suffered by any person denied that right.\u201d Additional private remedies include punitive damages, a civil penalty and attorney fees. (\u00a7 52, subd. (b)(1)\u2014(3).) These rights are separate from those given to the Attorney General and other prosecutors, who may seek certain relief. (\u00a7 52, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">Section 52.1 provides that any individual whose rights under the statute have been interfered with \u201cmay institute and prosecute in his or her own name and on his or her own behalf a civil action for damages.\u201d (\u00a7 52.1, subd. (b).) A plaintiff may recover damages, obtain an injunction, other equitable relief and attorney fees (\u00a7 52.1, subd. (h)), and his or her right to proceed is independent of relief available under section 51.7 (\u00a7 52.1, subd. (g)). The Attorney General and other prosecutors likewise have standing. (\u00a7 52.1, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">Private causes of action under sections 51.7 and 52.1 have been recognized by the appellate courts. (See <em>Venegas, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at pp. 841-842; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Kmart Corp., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 332; <em>Bay Area Rapid Transit Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 144\u2014145; <em>Boccato, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th 1797; <em>Winarto v. Toshiba America Electronics Components, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 274 F.3d 1276, 1288-1290, &amp; fn. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">Since private civil remedies have been expressly authorized by the two statutes, we turn to whether there is anything in these laws that evinces an intent by the Legislature to prohibit their use in actions involving discrimination and other wrongdoing in the employment sector. We find nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">On their face, neither section 51.7 nor section 52.1 is restricted to certain types of cases as long as the proscribed conduct is involved. These statutes were designed to stem the number of hate crimes which the Legislature recognized had grown to an alarming proportion. (See Assem. Com. on Labor Relations, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2986, <em>supra, </em>Apr. 20, 1976, p. 1; Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 63, <em>supra, </em>as amended Mar. 2, 1987, pp. 1-2; see also <em>Venegas, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at pp. 845-848 (conc. opn. of Baxter, J.).) Sadly, hate does not end when an employee walks through the door of his or her place of employment. The staggering impact of cases of workplace violence based on race, religion and other classifications described in these statutes is unfortunately known to us too well. (See generally Nat. Insts. Health, Civil &lt;http://civil.nih.gov/whatis.html&gt; [as of Feb 27, 2006].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>Given this obvious state of affairs, we would find it odd that the Legislature intended to exclude employment discrimination, workplace violence and similar cases based on race or other characteristics from the protections of these statutes. The legislative history reveals no such intent. Assembly Bill No. 2986, which eventually became section 51.7, was assigned to the Assembly Committee on Labor Relations, a committee whose responsibilities included employment matters. A report from that committee acknowledged that, at the time of drafting, there were numerous laws protecting civil rights in \u201cemployment, housing and access to public accommodations and facilities.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Labor Relations, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2986, <em>supra, </em>Apr. 20, 1976). Nevertheless, the report expressed concern that there was no specific prohibition protecting individuals from \u201cviolence because of their race, religion, ancestry, or national origin.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Since \u201cemployment\u201d was expressly mentioned in the report, it appears obvious that cases of this sort were intended to be included within the act\u2019s coverage. One of the specific advantages of the proposed legislation was that an individual could immediately file a private civil action while at the same time pursuing a complaint with the FEPC. (Assem. Com. on Labor Relations, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2986, <em>supra, </em>Apr. 6, 1976.) Obviously, FEPC complaints included workplace matters. Similarly, the breadth of the assembly report for Assembly Bill No. 63, which eventually became section 52.1, reflects the continuing concern over hate-crime violence. Nothing suggests an intent to exclude the workplace. (See Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 63, <em>supra, </em>as amended Mar. 2, 1987, pp. 1-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">We have found no California case that squarely upholds a private action under either section 51.7 or 52.1 in the employment context. Our Supreme Court in <em>Schifando, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 1074, seems to have assumed such a cause of action exists. The more narrow issue addressed by the court in <em>Schifando </em>was whether a city employee was required to exhaust both FEHA and the city charter administrative remedies as a condition to filing his employment discrimination suit. In the course of its discussion, the court stated: \u201cIn other words, although the FEHA does not limit the application of other state statutes (e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7 51.7), or constitutional provisions involving discrimination, it expressly preempts local governmental laws, regulations, and procedures that would affect the rights included in its provisions.\u201d (31 Cal.4th at p. 1082.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">The same assumption was made in <em>24 Hour Fitness, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1199, 1210 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 533], in which the appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>court affirmed an order compelling arbitration of the plaintiff\u2019s claims. One of the causes of action ordered into arbitration was a section 51.7 claim against the plaintiff\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">In <em>Winarto v. Toshiba America Electronics Components, Inc., supra, </em>274 F.3d at pages 1288-1290, the Ninth Circuit upheld a jury verdict based on, among other things, sections 51.7 and 52.1 for workplace violence motivated by gender and national origin bias. The court construed the statutes broadly in keeping with their statutory purpose. \u201c[Tjhere is no requirement that the violence be extreme or motivated by hate in the plain language of the sections, or in the cases construing them; there is also no requirement that the act constitute a crime. If the California legislature wanted to limit the reach of the statute to extreme, criminal acts of violence, it could have explicitly said so. What it did instead was create civil liability which sweeps more broadly than the common, colloquial meaning of the phrase \u2018hate crime.\u2019 \u201d (274 F.3d at p. 1289.) There was no discussion that the statutes could not be used in a private civil action for workplace violence or intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">Finally, in <em>Diem </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(N.D. Cal. 1988) 686 F.Supp. 806, 812, the plaintiff filed a religious discrimination claim against his former employer. The defendant claimed a cause of action based on section 51.7 was preempted by FEHA. The United States District Court denied motions for judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment on the statutory claim, holding: \u201cThis civil code section asserts that California residents have a right to be free from violence or threats of violence directed against them on account of, among other factors, their religion. Civil Code \u00a7 52(b) permits anyone whose rights under Section 51.7 have been violated to collect both actual and statutory damages. Sections 52(e) and (f) specifically provide that this statute furnishes an independent basis for recovery apart from the Fair Employment and Housing Act. Plaintiff has alleged sufficient threats of violence, notwithstanding the time-barred assault, to state a cause of action under this section.\u201d <em>(Diem, supra, </em>686 F.Supp. at p. 812; see also <em>Burnette </em>v. <em>Godshall </em>(N.D. Cal. 1993) 828 F.Supp. 1439, 1446 [private cause of action under section 51.7 based on workplace assault by coworker not preempted].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">We conclude that nothing in either the language of sections 51.7 and 52.1 or in their history expresses a legislative intent to exclude employment discrimination or other employment cases from their ambit. On the contrary, given the need for employees to be protected from the conduct condemned by the Ralph Civil Rights Act of 1976 and the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act, limitations as suggested by real parties would do serious disservice to the effectiveness of this legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">The petition is granted.

Considering that the voters chose the initiative language in order to subject insurance companies to Civil Code sections 51 to 53 and other consumer laws, and not to delineate what statutes should be considered within the scope of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, we conclude the broad reference to the Act reflected the same sort of confusion the <em>Gatto </em>court identified in judicial opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1237-8\"> At least one state and one federal court have agreed with the limited extent of the Act.

More fundamentally, although section 51.7 is mentioned in the opinion, <em>Long </em>is more accurately analyzed as a typical section 51 case of denial of public accommodations\u2014there, a public conference\u2014based on an arbitrary group classification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1240-7\"> Section 52.1 was not involved in <em>Taormina, </em>although section 51.7 was.

Taormina\u2019s </em>incorrect use of the \u201cBanes Act\" seems to be derived from an earlier opinion of the court in <em>Gaston v.

The state case referred to in <em>Gaston </em>was <em>Boccato </em>v. <em>City of Hermosa Beach, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th 1797, 1809 <em>(Boccato). </em>That court correctly referred to section 52.1 as the Bane Act (see <em>id. </em>at p. 1808, fn. 3) but also mentioned other parts of the Bane Act not relevant here (Pen. Code, \u00a7 422.6 et seq.). (See <em>Boccato, </em>at p. 1809.) Ultimately, the <em>Boccato </em>court concluded that section 52.1 must be read \u201cin conjunction with the other statutory provisions of which that section is part,\u201d specifically referring to section 51.7. <em>(Boccato, </em>at p. 1809.) <em>Boccato </em>makes no reference to the \u201cUnruh Act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1241-9\"> Consistent with the <em>Gatto </em>court\u2019s admonition that courts need to be more careful in describing the scope of the Act, we note that the publisher\u2019s <em>headnote </em>in <em>Rojo </em>reflects an expanded citation for the Act.
