The alleged statutory violations were based on DCC\u2019s use of tubular steel in the exhaust manifolds of certain of its vehicles instead of more durable and more expensive cast iron. We affirm because plaintiffs failed to state a claim under any of those causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">There are two lines of appellate opinions addressing the definition of \u201cunfair\u201d within the meaning of the UCL in consumer actions. One line defines \u201cunfair\u201d as prohibiting conduct that is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers and requires the court to weigh the utility of the defendant\u2019s conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim. <em>(Smith v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 700, 718-719 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 399] (Smith); <em>Pastoria v. Nationwide Ins. </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1498 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 148].) The other line of cases holds that the public policy which is a predicate to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>consumer unfair competition action under the \u201cunfair\u201d prong of the UCL must be tethered to specific constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provisions. <em>(Scripps Clinic v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 917 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 101] <em>(Scripps); Gregory v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc. </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 845 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 389] <em>(Gregory).) </em>In this opinion, we analyze both tests, apply each to the allegations of the second amended complaint, and conclude the allegations do not satisfy either one. We respectfully suggest that our Legislature and Supreme Court clarify the definition of \u201cunfair\u201d in consumer actions under the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">The \u201cfraud\u201d prong of the UCL requires that \u201c \u2018members of the public are likely to be deceived\u2019 \u201d by the challenged conduct <em>(Schnall v. Hertz Corp. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1144, 1167 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 439]). The second amended complaint did not allege facts showing that members of the public would assume or expect DCC to use cast-iron exhaust manifolds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for violation of the CLRA fails because the second amended complaint did not allege facts showing DCC was bound to disclose its use of tubular steel exhaust manifolds or the failure to disclose that fact would be otherwise misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">Finally, because plaintiffs\u2019 claims for unfair competition and violation of the CLRA fail, plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action for declaratory relief also fails to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">The Allegations of the Second Amended Complaint and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">Kurt Cotton and Josh Avery filed a proposed class action against DCC in November 2003. In December 2003, Cotton and Avery filed a first amended complaint which alleged five causes of action, including claims for violation of the UCL, violation of the CLRA, and declaratory relief. DCC demurred to the first amended complaint; the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend based on the statute of limitations. Cotton and Avery moved for leave to file a second amended complaint to substitute Joshua Bardin for Kurt Cotton as the proposed class representative. The trial court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">Bardin and Avery\u2019s second amended complaint contained claims only for violation of the UCL, violation of the CLRA, and declaratory relief. The second amended complaint alleged: (1) DCC \u201cdesigned, manufactured, marketed, distributed and/or sold 4.0 liter, 6.0 cylinder Jeep Grand Cherokees for model years 1991 through early-1999, and Jeep Cherokees and Jeep Wranglers for model years 1991 through 1999\u201d (the vehicles), which contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>exhaust manifolds made of tubular steel rather than cast iron; (2) \u201cthe standard in the industry for vehicles such as Jeeps has been to use cast iron exhaust manifolds, given the pronounced durability and longevity of cast iron\u201d; (3) DCC \u201cchose to utilize less expensive tubular steel exhaust manifolds in the VEHICLES which [DCC] knew prematurely cracked and failed much earlier than would a cast iron manifold\u201d; (4) DCC \u201cconcealed these facts from the public for the purpose of (a) reaping excessive profits to the detriment of Plaintiffs ... by selling replacement parts, and (b) gaining an unfair advantage over [DCC\u2019s] competitors by reducing the cost of goods sold, increasing profits and gaining market share\u201d; (5) DCC \u201cknew as early as 1991 that the tubular steel exhaust manifolds .. . would not last as long as the conventional cast iron exhaust manifolds\u201d and \u201cwould fail at unacceptably high rates\u201d; (6) DCC concealed these facts from plaintiffs and the public \u201cin order to sell replacement parts, increase profits and gain market share\u201d; (7) because DCC \u201comitted and concealed material facts about the exhaust manifolds from the public, members of the public were likely to have been deceived about the quality, performance, and durability of those manifolds\u201d; (8) DCC \u201cgained an unfair competitive advantage over other vehicle manufacturers and sellers who did not engage in the same deceptive conduct, and reaped additional profits through the sale of vehicles less expensive to make, and the sale of replacement parts\u201d; (9) DCC did not disclose that it attempted to and did redesign the tubular steel manifold in or about 1998, \u201csecretly withdrew the original tubular steel manifold from the market and ceased selling the same,\u201d and \u201cultimately abandoned the use of the cracked prone tubular steel manifold, . . . returning to the accepted industry standard of a more expensive and durable two-piece cast iron exhaust manifold\u201d; (10) \u201cPlaintiffs are lay persons and consumers, who reasonably rightfully assumed that the manifolds in [DCC\u2019s] vehicles were quality components and that, if not, [DCC] would comply with [its] obligations under the law to fully and promptly disclose the known defect in the inferior tubular steel exhaust manifold by fair notice\u201d; (11) Bardin purchased and owns a 1998 Jeep Wrangler for which he paid $801 to replace the exhaust manifold discovered in August 2002 to be cracked; (12) $556 of the $801 Bardin paid to replace the exhaust manifold \u201cwent to [DCC] for the cost of the replacement part\u201d; (13) Avery purchased and owns a 1993 Jeep Cherokee Sport; and (14) in July 2003, Avery was advised the exhaust manifold of that vehicle was cracked, but he has not had it repaired or replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">DCC demurred to the second amended complaint. The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, stating, \u201c \u2018[i]t is not necessary for a business practice to be \u201cunlawful\u201d in order to be subject to an action under the unfair competition law. \u201cThe \u2018unfair\u2019 standard, the second prong of [Business and Professions Code] section 17200, also provides an independent basis for relief. This standard is intentionally broad.\u201d The test of whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>business practice is unfair \u201cinvolves an examination of [that practice\u2019s] impact on its alleged victim, balanced against the reasons, justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer. In brief, the Court must weigh the utility of the Defendant\u2019s conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim . . . [Citations.]\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] [f] An \u2018unfair\u2019 business practice occurs when the practice offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers. [Citation.] [][] Here, the alleged business practice is not \u2018unfair\u2019 for purposes of [Business and Professions Code section] 17200. The exhaust manifolds were not guaranteed to last as those contained in other automobiles. As discussed in regard to prior demurrers, there cannot be a cause of action for breach of warranty with regard to the exhaust manifolds. ffl Plaintiffs claim the unfair business practice here is the failure [of] Defendant to disclose the exhaust manifolds were not made from the cast iron, but from tubular steel, and that they had a higher than normal rate of premature failure. The failure to disclose such facts is not immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers in order to maintain a cause of action under [section] 17200. The burden on automobile manufacturers to disclose alternative mediums used in component parts or other cost savings measures used in the manufacture of automobiles would be huge compared to the benefit received by the automobile purchasing public, [f] Because there is nothing inherently \u2018unfair\u2019 about Defendant\u2019s conduct, the causes of action for declaratory relief and CLRA fail.\u201d Plaintiffs appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cWe treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.

(See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc. </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 509, 530 [206 Cal.Rptr. 164] [\u201can \u2018unfair\u2019 business practice occurs when it offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers\u201d]; <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1104 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 229] [\u201c \u2018the court must weigh the utility of the defendant\u2019s conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">In <em>Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th 163, the California Supreme Court analyzed the definition of the term \u201cunfair\u201d in the context of a UCL action brought by several businesses against a competitor. The defendant, Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Company (L.A. Cellular), was licensed by the federal government to provide cellular telephone service in the Los Angeles area. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 169.) In addition to selling cellular telephone service, L.A. Cellular sold cellular telephones. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Several companies (the plaintiffs), which were not licensed to provide cellular service and only sold cellular telephones, sued L.A. Cellular for, inter alia, violation of the UCL on the ground L.A. Cellular \u201c \u2018formulated a strategy of selling cellular telephones below cost in order to increase the number of subscribers to its cellular telephone service.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 168-169.) Following the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief, the trial court granted L.A. Cellular\u2019s motion for judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 631.8, finding that because the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the Unfair Practices Act failed, their UCL claim \u201cnecessarily failed.\u201d <em>(Cel-Tech, </em>at p. 170.) The appellate court reversed the judgment as to the UCL claim only, and remanded that claim for retrial on the ground L.A. Cellular\u2019s actions might have resulted in a violation of the UCL. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">In <em>Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th 163, 180, the California Supreme Court discussed the broad scope of the UCL and how, unlike the Unfair Practices Act, \u201cit does not proscribe specific practices. Rather, ... it defines \u2018unfair competition\u2019 to include \u2018any unlawM, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.\u2019 [Citation.] [Fn. omitted.] Its coverage is \u2018sweeping, embracing \u201c \u2018anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citations.] It governs \u2018anti-competitive business practices\u2019 as well as injuries to consumers, and has as a major purpose \u2018the preservation of fair business competition.\u2019 [Citations.] By proscribing \u2018any unlawful\u2019 business practice, \u2018[Business and Professions Code] section 17200 \u201cborrows\u201d violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices\u2019 that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable. [Citations.] [|] However, the law does more than just borrow. The statutory language referring to \u2018any unlawful, unfair <em>or </em>fraudulent\u2019 practice . . . makes clear that a practice may be deemed unfair even if not specifically proscribed by some other law. \u2018Because Business and Professions Code section 17200 is written in the disjunctive, it establishes three varieties of unfair competition\u2014acts or</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>practices which are unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent. \u201cIn other words, a practice is prohibited as \u2018unfair\u2019 or \u2018deceptive\u2019 even if not \u2018unlawful\u2019 and vice versa.\u201d \u2019 \u201d  The court further stated the Legislature intentionally made the UCL broad \u201c \u2018to enable judicial tribunals to deal with the innumerable \u201c \u2018new schemes which the fertility of man\u2019s invention would contrive.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 181 [\u201c \u2018 \u201cWhen a scheme is evolved which on its face violates the fundamental rules of honesty and fair dealing, a court of equity is not impotent to frustrate its consummation because the scheme is an original one\u201d \u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">The Supreme Court acknowledged, \u201c[although the unfair competition law\u2019s scope is sweeping, it is not unlimited. Courts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair.\u201d <em>(Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 182.) The court criticized prior appellate court definitions of \u201cunfair\u201d in <em>People v. Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc., supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d at page 530 and <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at page 1104, as \u201ctoo amorphous\u201d and providing \u201ctoo little guidance to courts and businesses.\u201d <em>(Cel-Tech, </em>at pp. 184\u2014185.) The court stated, \u201c[v]ague references to \u2018public policy,\u2019 for example, provide little real guidance. \u2018 \u201c[P]ublic policy\u201d as a concept is notoriously resistant to precise definition, and . . . courts should venture into this area, if at all, with great care and due deference to the judgment of the legislative branch, \u201clest they mistake their own predilections for public policy which deserves recognition at law.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] These concerns led us to hold that to establish the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, the public policy triggering the violation must be tethered to a constitutional or statutory provision [citation] or a regulation carrying out statutory policy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 185.) The court further stated, \u201c[a]n undefined standard of what is \u2018unfair\u2019 fails to give businesses adequate guidelines as to what conduct may be challenged and thus enjoined and may sanction arbitrary or unpredictable decisions about what is fair or unfair. In some cases, it may even lead to the enjoining of procompetitive conduct and thereby undermine consumer protection, the primary purpose of the antitrust laws. ... [1] Accordingly, we believe we must devise a more precise test for determining what is unfair under the unfair competition law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">The court held, \u201cto guide courts and the business community adequately and to promote consumer protection, we must require that any finding of unfairness to competitors under [Business and Professions Code] section 17200 be tethered to some legislatively declared policy or proof of some actual or threatened impact on competition. We thus adopt the following test: When a plaintiff who claims to have suffered injury from a direct competitor\u2019s \u2018unfair\u2019 act or practice invokes section 17200, the word \u2018unfair\u2019 in that section means conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.\u201d <em>(Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 186-187.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">In a footnote, the court added, \u201c[t]his case involves an action by a competitor alleging anticompetitive practices. Our discussion and this test are limited to that context. Nothing we say relates to actions by consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair competition law such as \u2018fraudulent\u2019 or \u2018unlawful\u2019 business practices or \u2018unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 187, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Following the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th 163, appellate court opinions have been divided over whether the definition of \u201cunfair\u201d under the UCL as stated in <em>Cel-Tech </em>should apply to UCL actions brought by consumers. (Compare, e.g., <em>Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 720, fn. 23 [\u201cwe are not to read <em>Cel-Tech </em>as suggesting that such a restrictive definition of \u2018unfair\u2019 should be applied in the case of an alleged <em>consumer </em>injury\u201d] with <em>Scripps, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at p. 940 [applying to consumer UCL action requirement set forth in <em>Cel-Tech </em>that a UCL claim be tethered to a legislatively declared policy].) We do not need to decide whether <em>Smith </em>or <em>Scripps </em>applied the correct definition of \u201cunfair\u201d in UCL actions brought by consumers because, as discussed <em>post, </em>the second amended complaint failed to allege unfair conduct under both the <em>Smith </em>and <em>Scripps </em>lines of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\"><em>The second amended complaint did not allege unfair conduct under </em>Smith, supra, <em>93 Cal.App.4th 700.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">In sustaining DCC\u2019s demurrer, the trial court relied on the definition of \u201cunfair\u201d applied in <em>Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th 700. Citing footnote 12 of <em>Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at page 187, in which the Supreme Court expressly limited its discussion in that case to UCL actions brought by competitors, the appellate court in <em>Smith </em>held the <em>Cel-Tech </em>definition of \u201cunfair\u201d should not be applied to UCL actions brought by consumers. <em>(Smith, </em>at p. 720, fn. 23; see also <em>South Bay Chevrolet v. General Motors Acceptance Corp. </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 861, 887, fn. 24 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 301] [Supreme Court\u2019s criticism of definition of \u201cunfair\u201d in <em>Cel-Tech </em>\u201cwas expressly limited to the competitor context and specifically stated not to relate to \u2018actions by consumers\u2019 \u201d]; <em>People ex rel. Bill Lockyer </em>v. <em>Fremont Life Ins. Co. </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 508, 516, fn. 4 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 463] [in <em>Cel-Tech, </em>California Supreme Court \u201cdeveloped a definition but expressly limited it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>anticompetitive cases and excluded cases such as the one at bar involving injury to consumers\u201d]; <em>Gafcon, Inc. v. Ponsor &amp; Associates </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1425, fn. 15 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 392].) Agreeing with <em>Smith </em>that the <em>Cel-Tech </em>definition of \u201cunfair\u201d should not be applied to consumer cases, the appellate court in <em>Progressive West Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 263, 286 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 434], stated, \u201cwe believe [Business and Professions Code] section 17200\u2019s \u2018unfair\u2019 prong should be read more broadly in consumer cases because consumers are more vulnerable to unfair business practices than businesses and without the necessary resources to protect themselves from sharp practices. One of the major purposes of section 17200 is to protect consumers from nefarious business practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">In its amicus curiae brief in this case, Consumer Attorneys of California argues <em>Cel-Tech\u2019s, </em>definition of \u201cunfair\u201d only makes sense in the limited context of a UCL action brought by a competitor: \u201cBecause the Supreme Court was so rigorous in expressly confining this new definition of unfair conduct to actions brought by direct competitors for antitrust-like activity, it would violate all the usual principles of case interpretation to extend that rule to other actions.\u201d Consumer Attorneys of California further argues, \u201cthe Supreme Court in <em>Cel-Tech </em>was very rigorous in limiting its discussion about what constitutes unfairness to the context of the case, i.e., anti-competitive conduct alleged by a competitor. Tethering the definition of what constitutes \u2018unfair\u2019 conduct in that context to the antitrust laws themselves obviously pushes the definition of unfair toward the \u2018unlawful\u2019 end of the continuum: It\u2019s not actually unlawful, but it looks, smells and feels like the conduct is unlawful. ...[][] But to extend that limited definition of what constitutes unfair conduct to the general consumer\u2019s interest is not only unwarranted, it essentially writes the unfair prong out of the statute. Although there are a number of consumer protection laws to which the unfair prong could be tethered, there is just as much reason to expect that businesses that want to engage in \u2018sharp practices\u2019 will find ways around those laws and will engage in conduct that is not even the general subject of any law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">Citing the holding of <em>People v. Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc., supra, </em>159 Cal.App.3d 509, the court in <em>Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at pages 718-719, stated, \u201c \u2018an \u201cunfair\u201d business practice occurs when that practice \u201coflfends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.\u201d \u2019 \u201d The appellate court in <em>Smith </em>also cited the holding of <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v.

The court held, \u201c[s]uch conduct is at least generally alleged by plaintiffs and, it is also alleged, was done for the purpose of requiring insureds to purchase more uninsured motorist coverage than was needed, all to the alleged increased premium benefit of the defendant insurers and to the injury and damage of insureds who were faced with the choice of paying wasteful increased premiums or going without <em>any </em>uninsured motorist coverage. [Fn. omitted.] We have no trouble concluding, given our review of the authorities discussed above, that such conduct, if proven, would constitute an unfair business practice actionable under the UCL.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 721.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>Here, the second amended complaint did not contain sufficient allegations to satisfy the definition of \u201cunfair\u201d set forth in <em>Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at pages 718-719. The second amended complaint alleged an impact on plaintiffs in the form of the cost for the repair or replacement of the tubular steel exhaust manifold after an indeterminate number of miles. The second amended complaint alleged DCC\u2019s use of the less durable tubular steel exhaust manifolds was to earn \u201cexcessive profits ... by selling replacement parts\u201d and to gain \u201can unfair advantage over [DCC\u2019s] competitors by reducing the cost of goods sold, increasing profits and gaining market share.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">Does the use of less expensive and less durable materials in the manufacture of DCC\u2019s vehicles to make more money violate public policy? No. The second amended complaint did not allege DCC made any representations regarding the composition of the exhaust manifolds. Plaintiffs did not allege any personal injury or safety concerns related to DCC\u2019s use of tubular steel exhaust manifolds. The second amended complaint did not allege DCC\u2019s use of tubular steel exhaust manifolds violated any warranty or other agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs have not cited any legal authority supporting the position that DCC\u2019s use of the less expensive and less durable tubular steel exhaust manifolds violated public policy. Our research has not revealed any authority which supports plaintiffs\u2019 position. Indeed, the California Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Seely v. White Motor Co. </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 9, 18 [45 Cal.Rptr. 17, 403 P.2d 145], supports the opposite position. Although in the context of a breach of warranty case, the Supreme Court in <em>Seely </em>stated the general public policy that a consumer can be \u201cfairly charged with the risk that the product will not match his economic expectations unless the manufacturer agrees that it will. Even in actions for negligence, a manufacturer\u2019s liability is limited to damages for physical injuries and there is no recovery for economic loss alone.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As discussed <em>ante, </em>there are no allegations DCC ever made any representations regarding the performance of the tubular steel exhaust manifolds, and plaintiffs did not seek any damages for physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">Furthermore, we agree with the trial court that nothing about DCC\u2019s use of tubular steel exhaust manifolds, as alleged by plaintiffs in the second amended complaint, supports the conclusion DCC\u2019s conduct was immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers. As stated in <em>Community Assisting Recovery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aegis Security Ins. Co. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 886, 894-895 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 304], in the context of applying the <em>Smith </em>definition of \u201cunfair,\u201d \u201c[w]e recognize that unfair competition statutes have always been framed in \u2018broad, sweeping language, precisely to enable judicial tribunals to deal with the innumerable \u201c \u2018new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>schemes which the fertility of man\u2019s invention would contrive.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] And we are mindful that what is unfair or fraudulent, unlike unlawfulness, is a question of fact, which involves an equitable weighing of all the circumstances, a process which usually precludes the court from sustaining a demurrer. [Citation.] However, we will affirm a judgment of dismissal where the complaint fails to allege facts showing that a business practice is unfair, unlawful or fraudulent.\u201d Here, plaintiffs failed to plead facts to show DCC engaged in an unfair business practice under <em>Smith.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\"><em>The second amended complaint did not allege unfair conduct under </em>Scripps, supra, <em>108 Cal.App.4th 917.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">In <em>Gregory, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.4th 845, 854, the appellate court disagreed with the use of the <em>pxe-Cel-Tech </em>definition of \u201cunfair\u201d in <em>Smith, </em>stating, <em>\u201cCel-Tech, </em>however, may signal a narrower interpretation of the prohibition of unfair acts or practices in all unfair competition actions and provides reason for caution in relying on the broad language in earlier decisions that the court found to be \u2018too amorphous.\u2019 [Fn. omitted.] Moreover, where a claim of an unfair act or practice is predicated on public policy, we read <em>Cel-Tech </em>to require that the public policy which is a predicate to the action must be \u2018tethered\u2019 to specific constitutional, statutory or regulatory provisions.\u201d (See also <em>Schnall </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1166 <em>[Cel-Tech </em>holding that <em>\u201cany </em>claims of unfairness under the UCL should be defined in connection with a legislatively declared policy\u201d also applied to UCL actions brought by consumers]; <em>Textron Financial Corp. v.

After the plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice action against two physicians affiliated with Scripps, Scripps informed the plaintiffs that it was exercising its right under its contract with Health Net to have the plaintiffs transferred to another medical group. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 926-927.) Health Net transferred the plaintiffs to University of California at San Diego Health Network. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 927.) The plaintiffs sued Scripps and one of its employees, contending, inter alia, Scripps violated the UCL. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court denied the motion for summary adjudication as to Scripps, and Scripps filed a petition for a writ of mandate. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">The appellate court in <em>Scripps, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th 917, 941, held the trial court erred by not granting summary adjudication of the unfair competition claim. The court stated, <em>\u201cCel-Tech </em>has left it unclear whether we still rely upon the earlier definitions of \u2018unfair,\u2019 which it criticized. We agree with the <em>Gregory </em>court, which found that <em>Cel-Tech </em>narrowed the expansive earlier interpretations of the term \u2018unfair\u2019 . . . . to require that the public policy which is a predicate to the action must be \u201ctethered\u201d to specific constitutional, statutory or regulatory provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 940.) The plaintiffs argued Scripps\u2019s transfer policy was unfair because it impeded a patient\u2019s right to sue for malpractice, in violation of his or her constitutional right to seek redress in the courts. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The appellate court disagreed, stating, \u201cScripps does not interfere with the malpractice action; it merely chooses not to treat the litigants once the decision to litigate has been communicated to Scripps.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Scripps </em>court further stated, \u201c[t]he right upon which the [plaintiffs] actually rely is a patient\u2019s right to continuity of care from a physician of her choosing. But there is no such right. The physician-patient relationship is a contractual one. [Citations.] As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>discussed above, a physician can lawfully withdraw from treating a patient after notice and a reasonable time to secure another physician.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">Applying the definition of \u201cunfair\u201d set forth in <em>Scripps </em>and related cases, we conclude the second amended complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to satisfy that definition as well. Here, plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim is based on the allegations that DCC knowingly used tubular steel exhaust manifolds in the vehicles without affirmatively advising customers of that fact; consequently, the exhaust manifolds of the vehicles required earlier repair or replacement than would have been the case had cast-iron exhaust manifolds been used instead. The second amended complaint did not allege the UCL claim is tethered to any constitutional, statutory or regulatory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">As in Scripps, the \u201cright\u201d upon which plaintiffs actually rely here\u2014the right to have a vehicle containing an exhaust manifold that lasts as long as an \u201cindustry standard\u201d cast-iron exhaust manifold\u2014is one based on a contract such as a warranty, not on a legislatively declared policy. No law generally requires a manufacturer to use the most expensive or most durable materials in the manufacture of its products. Therefore, even if the trial court should have applied the <em>Scripps </em>definition of \u201cunfair,\u201d the complaint failed to state a claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\"><em>Significant questions raised by </em>Cel-Tech <em>and the subsequent conflicting lines of appellate court authority.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">Even though the allegations of facts of this case have made it unnecessary for us to decide which definition of \u201cunfair\u201d in the UCL applies in consumer actions, our discussion shows the widening divide among appellate courts regarding this issue. In summary, one line of cases relies heavily on the Supreme Court\u2019s language in footnote 12 of <em>Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at page 187, that <em>\u201c[njothing </em>we say relates to actions by consumers\u201d (italics added), while the other line strongly relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s unqualified criticism in <em>Cel-Tech </em>of the definitions of \u201cunfair\u201d as set forth in <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at page 1104 and <em>People v.

Was the Supreme Court expressing the view that regulation of competitive conduct is contained in existing legislation, but there is no analogous law pertaining to consumers? Should a broader definition of \u201cunfair\u201d apply in consumer actions because consumers require more protection than competitors even though such a distinction between consumers and competitors is not reflected in the language of the statute? Is the <em>Cel-Tech </em>definition of \u201cunfair\u201d too narrow to sufficiently protect consumers? Is the definition of \u201cunfair\u201d applied in <em>Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th 700 too amorphous in the consumer context, and does it provide \u201ctoo little guidance to courts and businesses\u201d? <em>(Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 184-185.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">In light of the uncertain state of the law regarding the proper definition of \u201cunfair\u201d in the context of consumer UCL actions, we urge the Legislature and the Supreme Court to clarify the scope of the definition of \u201cunfair\u201d under the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">\n<em>Plaintiffs Did Not State a Cause of Action for Unfair Competition Based on the \u201cFraud\u201d Prong of the UCL.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">Plaintiffs allege the trial court erred by sustaining DCC\u2019s demurrer to the UCL claim because the second amended complaint \u201calleged that members of the public were likely to be deceived by DCC\u2019s business practices in connection with the sale of Jeep vehicles and that DCC had thus engaged in a fraudulent business act or practice\u201d within the meaning of the \u201cfraud\u201d prong of the UCL. \u201cIn order to state a cause of action under the fraud prong of the UCL a plaintiff need not show that he or others were actually deceived or confused by the conduct or business practice in question. \u2018The \u201cfraud\u201d prong of [the UCL] is unlike common law fraud or deception. A violation can be shown even if no one was actually deceived, relied upon the fraudulent practice, or sustained any damage. Instead, it is only necessary to show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Schnall </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1167.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>The second amended complaint stated, \u201c[b]ecause [DCC] ha[d] omitted and concealed material facts about the exhaust manifolds from the public, members of the public were likely to have been deceived about the quality, performance, and durability of those manifolds.\u201d But this statement merely concludes the public would likely be deceived, without pleading any facts showing the basis for that conclusion.

[Citations.] The burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Blank v. Kirwan, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) Plaintiffs do not argue the trial court should have granted them leave to amend the second amended complaint, and they do not otherwise argue there is a reasonable possibility the defects in their pleading of their claims can be cured by amendment. We therefore conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by sustaining DCC\u2019s demurrer to the claims without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">The judgment is affirmed.

Such a practice, the appellate court held, \u201cfits the language often used in conjunction with unfair business practices as \u2018 \u201cimmoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, as discussed <em>ante, </em>the second amended complaint is devoid of allegations which state a basis for claiming DCC engaged in an unfair business practice under <em>Smith, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th 700.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1059-10\"> We may affirm the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrer for failure to allege facts sufficient to state a claim, based on the application of the definition of \u201cunfair\u201d not relied upon by the trial court. \u201cWe affirm the judgment if it is correct on any ground stated in the demurrer, regardless of the trial court\u2019s stated reasons.\u201d <em>(Wolkowitz </em>v. <em>Redland Ins.
