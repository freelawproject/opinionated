J.</author>\n<p id=\"b1121-11\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-12\">Plaintiff Daniel Lyons (Lyons) appeals from a postjudgment order of the San Francisco Superior Court denying his motion for attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> following entry of a stipulated judgment and permanent injunction in Lyons\u2019s lawsuit against defendant Chinese Hospital Association (CHA). By this judgment, CHA was \u201cpermanently enjoined\u201d from violating specific asbestos laws concerning notification, training and surveying at CHA-owned buildings, including the Chinese Hospital, a medical office building and six other specified buildings. The injunction also required CHA to retain and pay North Tower Environmental, a certified asbestos consulting firm, to monitor CHA\u2019s compliance with the asbestos laws, reporting annually to the court regarding CHA\u2019s compliance for a period of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>The trial court denied the fee request on the grounds that Lyons was not a successful party under the statute; that Lyons failed to demonstrate that a fee award was appropriate because of the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement; that the district attorney instituted a parallel prosecution of defendant, also obtaining a stipulated injunction; and that Lyons failed to establish that the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d required defendant to pay his fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">Lyons contends that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to award him fees and costs. We shall conclude the trial court abused its discretion in denying attorney fees to Lyons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Facts<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">A. <em>Underlying Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">In late 1998, CHA and Daniel Lyons doing business as Daniel Lyons Builders entered a contract under which the latter agreed to remodel certain portions of the first floor of the Chinese Hospital building. The remodeling required some demolition work, including removal of floor tile. At a prebid meeting on December 14, 1998, and again at a preconstruction meeting on February 24, 1999, a question was asked about the presence of asbestos-containing material in the construction area. CHA chief engineer Sam English and a representative of the project architect, Gordon H. Chong and Partners, informed Lyons that an asbestos survey of the hospital had been performed and that the construction area was free of asbestos-containing material. After seven months of demolition and construction, Lyons saw material that he suspected contained asbestos and asked English to show him the asbestos survey. When English did not produce the survey, Lyons took samples of the materials and had them tested himself. The results showed that asbestos was present throughout the construction site, in the vinyl floor tile, floor mastic, insulation wrap on heating, ventilation, and air conditioning boxes, and the core of doors. Appellant Daniel Lyons and his brother Morgan (plaintiffs) had personally removed floor tile manually by chipping and prying it with large demolition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>bars and scraper blades. The arbitrator found that demolition of the floor tile exposed the pair to airborne asbestos. Lyons produced evidence that the release of asbestos occurred directly adjacent to the hospital lobby, in which CHA employees worked and members of the general public congregated, and through which patients, employees and members of the public walked on a daily basis. However there was no finding that employees, patients or the public were actually exposed to asbestos. Upon receiving the test results, Lyons immediately shut down the construction, refusing to return until CHA conducted a thorough and complete asbestos survey of the construction area. Lyons also demanded that CHA notify state authorities about the disturbance of asbestos in the hospital, citing to various regulations CHA had violated in misleading him about having a survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">It is undisputed that Lyons spoke with \u201ctwo or three . . . asbestos lawyers\u201d to try to find a lawyer to pursue the hospital. They each refused to take the case because plaintiffs would not know for at least 20 years whether they would become sick as a result of the asbestos exposure. The lawyers told Lyons \u201cthe case was just too complex to bring, particularly with uncertain damages.\u201d In late spring of 2000, Attorney Richard Nelson, who had recently left the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, agreed to represent Lyons. Nelson knew that the costs of litigation would be high, and that there was only a \u201cslight chance of a significant monetary recovery\u201d by Lyons. Nelson convinced his law firm to take the case on a contingency fee, with the main focus of the representation being an effort to encourage the government to prosecute CHA. Nelson enlisted Jeff Hallam as cocounsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">During the spring and summer of 2000, counsel and Lyons contacted federal and state authorities. The case was initially presented to federal prosecutors and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA ultimately referred Lyons to the San Francisco District Attorney\u2019s Office. In August 2000, counsel and Lyons met with Assistant District Attorney Ross Mirkarimi. However, when Mirkarimi did not respond to followup messages and in light of the statute of limitations on some of the personal injury causes of action, plaintiffs filed the civil action herein against CHA, English and others (collectively defendants) on November 1, 2000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>The complaint contained five causes of action seeking tort damages for exposure to asbestos,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> one cause of action seeking declaratory relief for indemnity against future liability the plaintiffs might incur related to demolition and removal of asbestos-containing material from the hospital, and one cause of action for unfair business practices (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200) seeking injunctive relief to require CHA to comply with specified asbestos laws and regulations and for attorney fees pursuant to section 1\u00d321.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">During discovery, it was disclosed that CHA was not in compliance with many asbestos regulations, including requirements regarding notice to employees and employee asbestos awareness training. On March 29, 2001, the hospital\u2019s director of human resources provided a declaration th\u00e1t no asbestos notice had ever been given to its employees, despite the October 2000 receipt by hospital department heads of an e-mail from English concerning the presence of asbestos-containing materials in the hospital. Nor had the hospital provided any asbestos awareness training materials to its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">On April 9, 2001, Lyons filed a motion for a preliminary injunction before the Honorable A. James Robertson II, to require CHA to provide the required notice and training. On April 12, 2001, CHA filed opposition, arguing Lyons lacked standing, that he had unclean hands and that the motion was moot because CHA was scheduling asbestos awareness training for hospital engineers and housekeepers to be completed within 60 days and because it planned to send within the week a written notice to each employee informing the employee of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in the hospital and medical office building.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>On April 23, 2001, the day before the hearing on the preliminary injunction, Judge Robertson issued a tentative ruling, continuing the hearing to May 15, 2001, to permit CHA to comply with its asbestos notification and training obligations and stating that the court would issue an order granting the motion if CHA did not provide the required notification and training by May 15. Thereafter, CHA filed declarations stating that employees and tenants of the hospital and medical office building were notified about the presence of asbestos in those buildings on April 17 and 19, 2001, and that asbestos awareness training had been provided to custodial and engineering staff on May 1-3, 2001. Based upon these declarations, the court denied the preliminary injunction motion as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">However, CHA had distributed the written notices to its employees only in English. Depositions of Chow Ming Cheung and Kwok Sun Wong, two CHA housekeepers who cleaned asbestos-containing materials such as floor tiles as part of their duties, disclosed that neither read English. Both required a Cantonese interpreter for their depositions. Cheung testified that he did not recognize the notice and Wong testified that he received only an English version that required translation by his son. On August 23, 2001, Lyons again moved for a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause as to why a preliminary injunction should not issue requiring CHA to provide the asbestos notice in a language readily understandable to all CHA employees, as required by law. CHA opposed the motion, arguing that the law did not require notice to foreign-speaking employees in their native languages and that it had provided its hospital supervisors with Cantonese translations of the notice to distribute to those employees they believed did not speak English well enough to understand. After Judge Robertson issued an order to show cause and set the preliminary injunction for hearing on September 10, 2001, CHA delivered a copy of the asbestos notice translated into Cantonese to all of its employees. Judge Robertson denied the motion for preliminary injunction without prejudice to bring it again should plaintiffs find other employees requiring foreign language notice in a language other than English or Cantonese.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">B. <em>District Attorney Becomes Involved</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">In September 2001, after CHA served a subpoena on the district attorney in connection with plaintiffs\u2019 action, Lyons\u2019s counsel contacted June Cravett, the head of the environmental crime section of the district attorney\u2019s office. Cravett informed him that Mirkarimi had taken a leave of absence in the summer of 2000, and that she knew nothing about the case. However, when she expressed interest in learning more, counsel sent her copies of depositions and some of the critical documents produced in discovery. Assistant District Attorney James Thompson was then assigned to gather more information to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>determine whether prosecution was warranted. Nelson met with Thompson more than a dozen times and supplied copies of depositions and videotapes of depositions. Thompson spent days at Nelson\u2019s office reviewing boxes of documents that had been produced during discovery and making copies of documents that he wanted. In 2002, the district attorney\u2019s office notified CHA and Sam English that it would be pursuing charges against them. Ultimately, CHA and Thompson agreed to a stipulated judgment and permanent injunction. The judgment and injunction was entered in May 2003. <em>(People v. Chinese Hospital Association, Sam English </em>(Super. Ct. S.F. City and County, 2002, No. 419508.) The injunction involved two main issues: notification to contractors about asbestos in the hospital and disposal of asbestos in approved hazardous waste facilities. Defendants did not admit liability, and the stipulated injunction provided it was not to be used as evidence or admission of liability. The main provisions of that injunction permanently enjoined CHA, English and their representatives and successors \u201cfrom violating any provision ... of California Code of Regulations, Title 8, section 1529,\u201d and imposed a $10,000 civil penalty (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25189) upon English for violations involving false statements and illegal disposal of hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">C. <em>Arbitration of Tort Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">On September 20, 2001, the superior court granted CHA\u2019s renewed petition to compel arbitration in the case filed by Daniel and Morgan Lyons, submitting all causes of action except for the alleged violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 to arbitration. The arbitration was conducted in May and June 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">On July 28, 2003, in a written final arbitration award, the arbitrator found that defendants CHA and English had negligently misrepresented that asbestos-containing material was not present at the hospital and that an asbestos survey had been performed. The arbitrator also found that the statements had been made with intent to induce reliance and that plaintiffs had justifiably relied upon them. However, the arbitrator also found the misrepresentations had been negligent only and not intentional. The evidence did not prove that CHA or English had actual knowledge that the hospital building contained asbestos materials and consequently, that \u201cthe representations about the absence of asbestos in the construction area did not constitute fraud or any type of intentional tort, including the intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d Although the arbitrator had found negligent misrepresentation and reliance, he also found that plaintiffs had failed to prove they suffered damage as a result of the misrepresentation. Plaintiffs were unable to present evidence quantifying their increased risk of contracting mesothelioma and so had \u201cfailed to establish that [they] faced a significant risk or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>quantifiable risk at all of contracting an asbestos related disease as a result of their exposure to asbestos at the hospital building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">The arbitrator therefore determined that plaintiffs should recover nothing from defendants and awarded neither plaintiffs nor defendants \u201cindemnity against either of the others.\u201d The arbitration award provided that both plaintiffs and defendants bear their own costs and attorney fees and that both should bear equally the cost of the arbitrator\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">D. <em>Stipulated Judgment and Injunctive Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1127-7\">Upon conclusion of the arbitration, plaintiff Morgan Lyons dismissed his remaining unfair competition cause of action against defendants. Plaintiff and appellant Daniel Lyons moved to set his remaining claim for unfair competition and injunctive relief for trial. Over defendants\u2019 opposition, the superior court (Hon. Donna Hitchens) set Lyons\u2019s injunctive relief claim for trial on February 2, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-8\">On January 6, 2004, Lyons deposed Karen Chow, an officer of CHA. Chow admitted that CHA had surveys of asbestos in other CHA-owned buildings and had reviewed the report in January 2002; CHA had not provided the required written asbestos notice to custodians, tenants and residents of any of those other CHA-owned buildings that had been found to contain asbestos; and no training had been provided to persons performing housekeeping services at those other CHA-owned buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-9\">Shortly thereafter, the parties agreed to entry of a \u201cStipulated Judgment and Permanent Injunction\u201d that was approved by Judge Hitchens on January 29, 2004, and entered on February 6, 2004. Neither party was named the prevailing party therein and defendants did not admit fault. The permanent injunction provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-10\">\u201c4. CHA shall be permanently enjoined from violating California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 25914 et seq.; 8 CCR \u00a7\u00a7 1509, 3203, 5203, 5208; Bay Area Air Quality Management District Regulation 11, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7401 et seq., at CHA-owned buildings, including the Chinese Hospital, located at 845 Jackson Street, a Medical Office Building, located at 835 Jackson Street, and buildings located at 734 Bush Street, 716-722 Jackson Street, 20 Wentworth Street, 506-510 Grant Street, 842-848 Washington Street, and 603-609 Jackson Street in San Francisco, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-11\">\u201c5. CHA shall retain and pay North Tower Environmental to monitor CHA\u2019s compliance with the asbestos laws and report to the Court regarding CHA\u2019s compliance. The first such report shall be made within two months of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>the entry of this Stipulated Judgment by the Court, and then annually for three years thereafter, with the Court retaining jurisdiction for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this Stipulated Judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">The stipulated judgment also provided that plaintiff\u2019s attorney fee request was to be resolved by the superior court law and motion department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">Pursuant to the terms of the permanent injunction, North Tower Environmental filed its first compliance report with the court on April 5, 2004. It detailed the actions taken by CHA to comply with asbestos laws, including notification of employees, tenants and contractors bidding on and performing work at the CHA-owned buildings, training of custodial, housekeeping, and engineering staff performing work at CHA-owned buildings; identification of asbestos through asbestos inspections; reviewing, monitoring, updating and streamlining CHA\u2019s in-place asbestos program and records related thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-6\">E. <em>Attorney Fee Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-7\">On May 5, 2004, Lyons moved for an award of attorney fees of approximately $1 million under section 1021.5. Following a hearing, the trial court issued a minute order denying the motion on June 7, 2004, but failing to state reasons for doing so. Lyons sought clarification of the order and, on August 6, 2004, the court filed its order clarifying its denial of Lyons\u2019s motion. In its entirety, the order states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-8\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees is denied for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-9\">\u201cPlaintiff is not a successful party within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1021.5. Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s assertions, this case was not primarily directed at achieving a public benefit by forcing defendant Chinese Hospital Association to comply with laws regulating asbestos. The lawsuit was primarily about recovering damages, and in that regard it was unsuccessful. Plaintiff filed his lawsuit because he wanted damages for exposure to asbestos during work performed on defendant\u2019s property. He failed in the six causes of action directed at that goal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-10\">\u201cOn his claim for violation of Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200, plaintiff was successful to the extent that defendant Chinese Hospital Association stipulated to an injunction requiring it to refrain from certain activities and comply with the law. This limited success, is outweighed by the lack of success on other scores.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>\u201cPlaintiff has failed to demonstrate that a fee award is appropriate because of the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement. The test is whether the achievement of the public benefit outweighs plaintiff\u2019s personal stake in the outcome. Here it does not. The fees and costs incurred in this case were primarily directed at the recovery of damages on the claims that were arbitrated. Plaintiff\u2019s personal stake in the outcome of that aspect of the case was quite substantial and included a demand for punitive damages. In addition, the necessity of private enforcement is questionable because the record shows that the district attorney of San Francisco instituted a parallel prosecution of the defendant for violation of asbestos laws and achieved the same result, a stipulated injunction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-5\">\u201cFinally, Plaintiff has not established that the interests of justice require that defendant pay his fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">A. <em>Issues and Scope of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-9\">\u201cAttorney fees are recoverable under section 1021.5 (1) by a successful party, (2) in an action that has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest, (3) if a significant benefit has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and (4) the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate. The statute\u2019s purpose is to encourage public interest litigation that might otherwise be too costly to pursue. <em>(Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. Board of Supervisors </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 505, 511 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 205].)\u201d <em>(Bowman v. City of Berkeley </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 173, 176-177 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 447] <em>(Bowman).)</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>\u201c \u2018The trial court is to assess the litigation realistically and determine from a practical perspective whether [the statutory] criteria have been met.\u2019 <em>(Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 511.) Rulings under section 1021.5 are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>(Graham </em>v. <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp. </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 578 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 331, 101 P.3d 140].) The questions are whether the court applied the proper legal standards under section 1021.5 and, if so, whether the result was within the range of the court\u2019s discretion <em>(City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Drew </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1287, 1298 [255 Cal.Rptr. 704]), i.e., whether there was a reasonable basis for the decision <em>(Westside Community for Independent Living, Inc. v. Obledo </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 348, 355 [188 Cal.Rptr. 873, 657 P.2d 365]).\u201d <em>(Bowman, supra, </em>131 Cal.App.4th at pp. 176-177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">\u201cAlthough [section] 1021.5 is phrased in permissive terms (the court \u2018may\u2019 award), the discretion to deny fees to a party that meets its terms is quite limited. The [S]upreme [C]ourt in <em>Serrano v. Unruh (Serrano IV) </em>(1982) 32 [Cal. 3d] 621, 633 [186 Cal.Rptr. 754] . . . , noted that the private attorney general theory, from which [section] 1021.5 derives, requires a full fee award \u2018unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u2019 \u201d (Pearl, Cal. Attorney Fee Awards (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 2005) \u00a7 4.42, p. 132; accord, <em>Hammond v. Agran </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 115, 129 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 646].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">In <em>Lealao v. Beneficial California, Inc. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 19 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 797] <em>(Lealao), </em>we agreed with <em>City of Sacramento v. Drew, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d 1287, that the \u201c \u2018scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied, i.e., in the \u201clegal principles governing the subject of [the] action . . . .\u201d Action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>\u201cabuse\u201d of discretion.\u2019 <em>(City of Sacramento v. Drew[, supra,] </em>207 Cal.App.3d [at p.] 1297.)\u201d <em>(Lealao, </em>at p. 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">Accordingly, the question before us is whether the trial court\u2019s refusal to award fees was consistent with the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">CHA does not dispute that this case involved enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest. Nor does CHA contend that a significant benefit was not conferred on the general public or on a large class of persons. Indeed, at the fee hearing, Judge McBride stated that he was \u201cnot too worried about those two [factors].\u201d Nevertheless, the trial court found that the other prerequisites for the award\u2014the successful party and private burden requirements\u2014were not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">It is undisputed that relief obtained through a settlement may qualify a plaintiff as the prevailing party, even in the presence of a stipulation disclaiming liability on the merits. (See, e.g., <em>Santisas v. Goodin </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 621-622 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399]; <em>Folsom v. Butte County Assn, of Governments </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 668, 671 [186 Cal.Rptr. 589, 652 P.2d 437]; <em>Planned Parenthood </em>v. <em>Aakhus </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 162, 174 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 510]; Pearl, Cal. Attorney Fee Awards, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.23, p. 58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-8\">B. <em>Prevailing Party</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\">Lyons contends that the court abused its discretion in determining that he was not a \u201csuccessful party\u201d because he succeeded in obtaining only injunctive relief and because he did not achieve the damage award that the court found to be his primary litigation objective. There is no question that Lyons was unsuccessful in obtaining damages for his asbestos exposure. He prevailed on only one of the six causes of action in his mandate petition. Lyons points out that the court could award attorney fees for that partial success. \u201cIt is well settled that partially successful plaintiffs may recover attorney fees under section 1021.5. (See 1 Manaster &amp; Selmi, Cal. Environmental Law &amp; Land Use Practice (2005) \u00a7 13.10(3)(b), pp. 13\u201418 and cases cited; Pearl, Cal. Attorney Fee Awards (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 2004) \u00a7 2.19, pp. 49-50 and cases cited.) \u2018 \u201c[A] party need not prevail on every claim presented in an action in order to be considered a successful party within the meaning of the section. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Wallace v. Consumers Cooperative of Berkeley, Inc. </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 836, 846 [216 Cal.Rptr. 649].) Rather, \u201cwhen a plaintiff is successful within the meaning of the section, the fact that he or she has prevailed on some claims but not on others is a factor to be considered in determining the <em>amount </em>of the fee awarded.\u201d \u2019 <em>(ComputerXpress, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1019 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 625].)\u201d <em>(Bowman, supra, </em>131 Cal.App.4th at pp. 177-178, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>The \u201csuccessful party\u201d concept is not so narrow as the court\u2019s clarification suggests.

(213 Cal.App.3d at p. 242.)

(229 Cal.App.3d at p. 636.) Four months later the San Francisco District Attorney filed a similar, but not identical, action. The cases were consolidated. After a judgment against the defendant, the plaintiffs requested attorney fees pursuant to section 1021.5. The trial court denied the plaintiffs fees on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 action was not necessary because the district attorney had filed a parallel action. (229 Cal.App.3d at pp. 636-637.) We reversed, concluding that the plaintiffs were not barred from recovery of attorney fees by reason of the government\u2019s participation in the litigation. We remanded the issue to the trial court, instructing the court to consider the following in determining whether the services of the plaintiffs were necessary: \u201c(1) Did the private party advance significant factual or legal theories adopted by the court, thereby providing a material non de minimis contribution to its judgment, which were nonduplicative of those advanced by the governmental entity? (2) Did the private party produce substantial evidence significantly contributing to the court\u2019s judgment which was not produced by the governmental entity, and which was neither duplicative of nor merely cumulative to the evidence produced by the governmental entity?\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 642-643.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">On the record before us in this case, we believe these questions could only have been answered in the affirmative. It is undisputed that Lyons and counsel repeatedly sought to involve public authorities in prosecution of defendants. The record provides no reason to believe that there would have been any prosecution without plaintiffs\u2019 efforts. Not only did plaintiffs initiate the action that resulted in the district attorney becoming involved nearly a year after plaintiffs had first sought the district attorney\u2019s assistance, but they also shared with the district attorney the voluminous information they had obtained during a lengthy discovery process in plaintiffs\u2019 civil action. In addition, Lyons\u2019s counsel met with the prosecutor assigned to the case more than a dozen times to discuss the case and highlight the evidence and case law supporting the elements in the case the district attorney could bring against defendants. There is no indication in the record that the district attorney\u2019s office conducted any independent investigation or discovery in its action, and Lyons\u2019s counsel avers that he is aware of none. Lyons\u2019s contribution to the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>attorney\u2019s action was more than merely helpful or even substantial; it was necessary to the ultimate success of the public prosecution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">Moreover, the injunction obtained by the district attorney in its action against defendants in many important respects was not duplicative of that subsequently obtained by Lyons. The district attorney\u2019s injunction enjoined defendants from violating title 8 California Code of Regulations section 1529. Section 1529 is focused on a building owner\u2019s responsibility to disclose and remove asbestos-containing materials before and during construction activities in a building and with the safety of workers, employees and others during construction. By contrast, the injunction obtained by Lyons addressed broader requirements under Health and Safety Code section 25914 et seq. (asbestos and hazardous substance removal contracts); title 8 California Code of Regulations sections 1509 (injury and illness prevention program), 3203 (same), 5203 (reporting use of regulated carcinogens) 5208 (occupational exposures to asbestos); Bay Area Air Quality Management District Regulation 11 (setting emission/performance standards for hazardous pollutants, including asbestos); and title 42 United States Code section 7402 (air quality and emissions limitations). Indeed, title 8 California Code of Regulations section 5208 specifically provides that it does <em>not </em>apply to most construction work, as \u201c[ejxposure to asbestos in construction work other than spraying is covered by [California Code of Regulations,] title 8, Section 1529\u201d\u2014the provision referenced in the district attorney\u2019s injunction. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The only other remedy provided in the district attorney\u2019s injunction was the $10,000 fine against English for false statements and illegal disposal of hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">Remedies obtained through Lyons\u2019s injunction required CHA to provide asbestos notice to current and new employees and tenants, whether or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>construction was occurring; provide asbestos awareness training to its custodians and engineers; post notices during construction about the dangers of exposure to asbestos fibers; and report to the Division of Occupational Safety and Health Standards of the Department of Industrial Relations if asbestos is disturbed. In addition, the permanent injunction required CHA to retain and pay for a certified asbestos consultant to monitor CHA\u2019s compliance and to report annually to the court for the next three years. There is no provision for supervision in the district attorney\u2019s injunction. Although there may be areas of overlap between the two injunctions, they are fundamentally nonduplicative in the circumstances they cover and the relief they provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">We believe, in the circumstances presented and on the record before us, that the trial court abused its discretion in denying fees on the ground that the need for private enforcement of the asbestos laws was \u201cquestionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">2. The trial court also determined that Lyons had failed to demonstrate that a fee award was appropriate \u201cbecause of the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement.\u201d In so finding, the court articulated and applied an erroneous test, stating: \u201cThe test is whether the achievement of the public benefit outweighs plaintiff\u2019s personal stake in the outcome. Here it does not.\u201d The court then proceeded to find that the fees and costs incurred were \u201cprimarily directed\u201d toward recovery of money damages on the arbitrated claims, and that Lyons\u2019s \u201cpersonal stake in the outcome of [the damage claims] was quite substantial and included a demand for punitive damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">As stated above, \u201c[u]nder the private burden prong of section 1021.5, fees are recoverable \u201cwhen the cost of the claimant\u2019s legal victory transcends his personal interest, that is, when the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff \u2019out of proportion to his individual stake in the matter.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 <em>(Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. v. City Council[, supra,] </em>23 Cal.3d [at p.] 941.) \u2018If the enforcement of the public interest is merely \u201ccoincidental to the attainment of . . . personal goals\u201d [citation] or is \u201cself serving,\u201d [citation], then this requirement is not met.\u2019 <em>(California Common Cause v.

This is because the purpose of section 1021.5 is to encourage public interest litigation by offering the \u2018bounty\u2019 of a court-ordered fee. (188 Cal.App.3d at p. 10), and the focus of that incentive is on the point in time when vital litigation decisions are being considered.\u201d <em>(Beasley </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1407, 1414 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 459] <em>(Beasley).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\"><em>Los Angeles Police Protective League, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d 1, and <em>Beasley, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 1407, each adopted a two-step process for determining the \u201cestimated value\u201d of the case. <em>Beasley </em>described that process as follows: \u201cFirst, the court must determine the monetary value of the \u2018gains actually attained\u2019 by the successful litigants. Second, the court \u2018must discount these total benefits by some estimate of the probability of success at the time the vital litigation decisions were made . . . .\u2019 <em>(Los Angeles Police Protective League, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d at p. 9.) This \u2018discount\u2019 is essential because of the purpose of encouraging public interest litigation as of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>the time vital litigation decisions are being considered. Thus, for example, if the plaintiffs had only a one-third probability of ultimate victory, the estimated value of the case was only one-third the actual recovery. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">\u201cOnce estimated value is determined, it is compared to actual litigation costs. In general, a fee award will be appropriate unless estimated value \u2018exceeds by a substantial margin the actual litigation costs.\u2019 <em>([Los Angeles Police Protective League, supra,] </em>188 Cal.App.3d at p. 10.) In other words, unless the estimated value of the case was sufficient to absorb actual litigation costs and still provide an incentive to litigate, fees may be awarded under section 1021.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">\u201cAlso, the financial burden criterion is interrelated with the other pertinent criteria under section 1021.5. If public benefits are very significant, it is more important to encourage litigation, and thus it may be appropriate to award fees under section 1021.5 \u2018even in situations where the litigant\u2019s own expected benefits exceed its actual costs by a substantial margin.\u2019 <em>(Los Angeles Police Protective League, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d at p. 10.) In contrast, if public benefits are modest, \u2018the courts should award fees only where the litigant\u2019s own expected benefits do not exceed its costs by very much (or possibly are even less than the costs of the litigation).\u2019 <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">\u201cThus, the following rule may be extrapolated from the <em>Los Angeles Police Protective League </em>opinion: If the estimated value of a class action common fund recovery, determined as of the time the vital litigation decisions were being made, does not exceed actual litigation costs by a substantial margin, the financial burden of private enforcement is such as to make it appropriate to award attorney fees under section 1021.5. In contrast, if estimated value is substantially more than actual litigation costs, there should be no award under section 1021.5 unless public benefits are very significant.\u201d <em>(Beasley, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1414-1415.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-8\">Following <em>Beasley, </em>the appellate court in <em>Notrica </em>v. <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 911, 955 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 89], discussed the method for assessing whether the attorney fees incurred by the party seeking fees were in proportion to that party\u2019s individual stake in the litigation. The jury had awarded compensatory damages in the net amount of $325,994 and punitive damages of $20 million. The trial court awarded attorney fees of $300,000. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 920 &amp; fn. 2.) On appeal, the judgment was affirmed, except that the $20 million award was reversed and remanded subject to the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of a reduction in the punitive damages to $5 million. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 956.) In rejecting a financial burden proportionality challenge to the fee award, the appellate court stated: \u201cIn assessing this ratio, the court must look at the estimated value of the case when the critical litigation decisions were being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>made, not the actual recovery after trial. <em>(Beasley[, supra,] </em>235 Cal.App.3d [at p.] 1414.) Notrica alleged in its complaint that it had suffered proximate damages of $100,000 or more, asking leave to allow amendment of the number. This disparity between damages and some $300,000 in attorney fees satisfies the purpose of Section 1021.5 to encourage litigation in the public interest by covering such fees. (235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1414.)\u201d <em>(Notrica </em>v. <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund, </em>at p. 955.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">In weighing only the public benefit against the plaintiff\u2019s personal stake, the court below applied an erroneous test. The private financial burden test does not require a comparison of public benefits achieved to the plaintiff\u2019s personal stake in the case. Rather, it mandates a comparison between the estimated value of the plaintiff\u2019s individual stake in the action (which may be nonpecuniary) and the cost of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">We recognize that the statutory criteria for a fee award under section 1021.5 are somewhat interrelated. (Pearl, Cal. Attorney Fee Awards, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4.41, p. 131.) The appellate court in <em>Beasley, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 1407, observed that the financial burden criteria could be impacted by \u201cother pertinent criteria under section 1021.5\u201d <em>(Beasley, </em>at p. 1415.) As described in <em>Beasley, </em>the public benefit factor comes into play <em>after </em>the court has determined whether expected personal benefits exceed the actual costs of litigation. Whether the litigant has achieved a \u201cmodest\u201d or a \u201cvery significant\u201d public benefit will impact the fee award where the costs of litigation do not significantly exceed the expected personal benefits. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1415.) In a case such as this, where litigation costs greatly exceeded Lyons\u2019s expected personal benefit, and where the issue of \u201csignificant benefit\u201d to the public appears to have been conceded by CHA and recognized by the court, the denial of attorney fees based on a weighing of the public benefit versus the plaintiff\u2019s personal stake was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">We conclude that the trial court erred in looking at the damages plaintiffs sought in their tort action, while failing to discount such sum by the likelihood of success on those claims and by \u201cwhat the plaintiffs reasonably hoped to achieve.\u201d <em>(Beasley, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1416.) Had the trial court compared the estimated value of Lyons\u2019s personal stake in the matter to the actual litigation costs to determine whether Lyons had sufficient personal incentive to bring the litigation notwithstanding the costs, it could not reasonably have concluded other than that the litigation costs far exceeded the estimated value of the case. Indeed, Lyons was told this at the outset by several attorneys who refused to take the case. Both Lyons\u2019s declaration and that of his counsel aver that they knew they were unlikely to achieve success on Lyons\u2019s tort damages claims. Moreover, Lyons continued to pursue the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>injunctive relief cause of action even after the arbitrator denied him any recovery on the tort claims and he no longer had any personal stake in the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">Actual litigation costs were significant. Attorney fees and costs were approximately $1 million. The court found that \u201c[t]he fees and costs incurred in this case were primarily directed at the recovery of damages on the claims that were arbitrated.\u201d This finding is relevant to the question of the <em>amount </em>of attorney fees to be awarded, not to the question of whether an award of fees was warranted under section 1021.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">D. <em>Interests of Justice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">The trial court concluded that \u201c[p]laintiff has not established that the interests of justice require that defendant pay his fees.\u201d CHA seizes upon this finding as an independent basis upon which to support the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">CHA emphasizes that the Chinese Hospital is a private nonprofit institution, \u201cdedicated to providing extensive charitable health care and services to the vulnerable and poor, not just in Chinatown, but throughout the greater San Francisco community. Within the last five years, the hospital has devoted an average of $2 million dollars per year to providing free medical care to San Francisco residents.\u201d CHA argues the public benefit of these services outweighs any public benefit obtained by the stipulated injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">CHA also challenges both the reasonableness of the amount of fees incurred and contends that Lyons was \u201cnot forthright\u201d with the trial court in his fee calculation, failing to credibly set forth the allocation of attorney time and costs attributable to noncompensable tort claims for damages (Lyons claimed to have incurred approximately $80,000 in fees pursuing the tort claims in arbitration), and that of the claim for injunctive relief (which time Lyons claimed was spent on issues of law and fact \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with those of his tort damages claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">These arguments must fail in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition in <em>Press </em>v. <em>Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 311, that \u201c[subdivision (c) of section 1021.5, which requires that \u2018such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any\u2019 is inapplicable here since plaintiffs\u2019 action did not produce any monetary recovery.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 318, fn. 5.) Clearly, \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d language of subdivision (c) was aimed at permitting the recovery of attorney fees even in circumstances where a monetary recovery was obtained, but should not \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d be the source of such fees. As Lyons obtained no monetary recovery, the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d provision of subdivision (c) is not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>Nor do the cases recognize the justifications posited by CHA for denying all fees to Lyons. Not only public entities and agencies, but also private defendants are often required to pay attorney fees pursuant to section 1021.5 where the statutory prerequisites are met. (See, e.g., <em>Graham </em>v. <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp., supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 553 [section 1021.5 fee award against private automobile manufacturer]; <em>Beasley, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 1407 [section 1021.5 fee award against bank]; <em>Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 633 [award against private counseling facility]; <em>Braude v. Automobile Club of Southern Cal. </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 994, 1000, 1010-1014 [223 Cal.Rptr. 914] [abuse of discretion to deny section 1021.5 attorney fees against nonprofit mutual benefit corporation].) Such a distinction between private and public defendants would be inconsistent with the purposes underlying section 1021.5. Where the statutory requisites are otherwise met, the fact that the entity from whom fees are sought is private and nonprofit does not warrant a denial of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">Nor do CHA\u2019s assertions that the amount of fees sought were \u201cunreasonable\u201d or that Lyons was \u201cnot forthright\u201d in allocating his fees between the causes of action for tort damages and that seeking injunctive relief warrant the denial of fees. To the degree that Lyons may have incurred unreasonable fees litigating the case, the problem is self-correcting. On remand, the trial court will be charged with determining the <em>reasonable </em>hours spent to prosecute the successful claim. <em>(Hammond </em>v. <em>Agran, supra, </em>99 Cal.App.4th 115, 133; see <em>Lealao, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 19, 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">Insofar as Lyons established he was entitled to an attorney fee award under the statutory criteria, the trial court here erred in requiring Lyons to shoulder the <em>additional </em>burden, not contemplated by the statute, of showing that the award of attorney fees was \u201cin the interests of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">We conclude that in the circumstances presented, the trial court abused its discretion in denying Lyons an attorney fee award under section 1021.5. We express no opinion as to the amount of a reasonable fee in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">Lyons requests an award of his attorney fees on this appeal. We conclude that, as at the trial level, he is entitled to an award of attorney fees on appeal under section 1021.5. (See <em>Serrano IV, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 621, 637-639; <em>Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at pp. 522-523 [successful appellant is entitled to a \u00a7 1021.5 attorney fee award for both the trial and appeal of the attorney fee issue itself].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">The order denying attorney fees to Lyons is reversed, and the cause remanded to the trial court to make an award of attorney fees and costs consistent with the views set forth in this opinion. Lyons is awarded his attorney fees and costs on this appeal. On remand, the trial court is directed to determine reasonable attorney fees in connection with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">Lambden, J., and Ruvolo, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">Respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 24, 2006, S142372.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1121-13\"> All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1122-8\"> In a letter filed less than one week before oral argument, defendant CHA advised this court of its intent to rely at oral argument upon three cases relating to the issue of the retroactive application of Proposition 64.

She declared that CHA had waited until that survey was complete to schedule the trainings so that the program could address asbestos-containing materials in both the Chinese Hospital and the medical office building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-8\">Lyons points out that such compliance occurred <em>11 </em>years after CHA learned that asbestos was present in the basement of the medical office building, <em>18 months </em>after CHA\u2019s consultants confirmed the existence of asbestos on the first floor of the hospital, <em>seven months </em>after CHA\u2019s own consultant told it in writing how to comply with the asbestos laws, and <em>five months </em>after CHA\u2019s consultant provided it with employee notification letters ready for distribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1129-10\"> Section 1021.5 provides: \u2019\u2019Upon motion, a court may award attorneys\u2019 fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement, or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity, are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any. With respect to actions involving public entities, this section applies to allowances against, but not in favor of, public entities, and no claim shall be required to be filed therefor, unless one or more successful parties and one or more opposing parties are public entities, in which case no claim shall be required to be filed therefor under Part 3 (commencing with Section 900) of Division 3.6 of Title 1 of the Government Code.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1130-6\"> \u201cThe statutory criteria of section 1021.5 are qualified by the permissive \u2018may,\u2019 suggesting that the statute delegates authority to deny attorney fees in special circumstances notwithstanding that the criteria are found to apply. (See generally, <em>Serrano v. Unruh[, supra,) </em>32 Cal.3d [at pp.] 633-639 (\u2018special circumstances\u2019).) However, the contrary conclusion is supported on the grounds that section 1021.5 codifies whatever equitable discretion is delegated to the courts and that California courts have uniformly evaluated fee awards pursuant to the measure \u2018whether or not the statutory criteria have been met.\u2019 <em>(Baggett </em>v. <em>Gates </em>[(1982)] 32 Cal.3d [128,] 142 [185 Cal.Rptr. 232, 649 P.2d 874]; ... see also <em>Schmid </em>v. <em>Lovette </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 466, 473-475 [201 Cal.Rptr. 424]; but see <em>Bartling v.

Accordingly, we read \u2018may\u2019 in section 1021.5 as simply signifying that a court has discretion to act <em>within </em>the criteria of section 1021.5.\u201d <em>(City of Sacramento v.
