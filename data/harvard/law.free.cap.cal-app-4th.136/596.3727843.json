J.</author>\n<p id=\"As7-\">Both this case and its companion case, <em>Nunez </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 584 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 914] <em>(Nunez), </em>concern the procedure to be applied for medical evaluation of a represented employee where the date of an industrial injury precedes January 1, 2005. In <em>Nunez, </em>we rejected the argument that the procedure enacted under Senate Bill No. 899 (Senate Bill 899) applies to such cases. In this case, we reject the claim that neither the new nor the former <em>procedure applies.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Manuel Cortez petitions this court to annul the order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board), which compels a medical evaluation by his employer, respondent C.T. &amp; R, Inc., under former section 4062.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cortez contends that there is no applicable medical evaluation and reporting procedure since his industrial injury occurred in 1999 and he is represented by counsel. The procedure of former section 4062 was repealed and replaced by the procedure of section 4062.2 under Sen. Bill 899, which states under subdivision (a) that, \u201cWhenever a comprehensive medical evaluation is required to resolve any dispute arising out of an injury or a claimed injury occurring on or after January 1, 2005, and the employee is represented by an attorney, the evaluation shall be obtained only as provided in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">For the reasons stated in <em>Nunez, </em>we conclude that the medical evaluation and reporting procedure of former section 4062 applies where the employee is represented and the date of the industrial injury is prior to January 1, 2005. We affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Petitioner, Manuel Cortez, sustained an industrial back injury on June 29, 1999, while working as a laborer for respondent, C.T. &amp; R, Inc. The employer provided medical treatment and orthopedic consultation with Richard Feldman, M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">On October 24, 2001, Cortez and the employer entered into stipulations with request for award. The parties stipulated to 37 percent permanent disability based on the opinion of Dr. Feldman, and that future medical care beyond conservative treatment would be determined by orthopedist Andrew Sew Hoy, M.D., as an agreed medical evaluator.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Cortez filed a timely petition to reopen the stipulated award. He alleged new and further temporary and permanent disability, psychiatric disability, and the need for medical treatment and vocational rehabilitation. Cortez also procured medical treatment from orthopedist Archie Mays, M.D. Dr. Mays recommended psychological consultation for heightened anxiety.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">The parties also obtained a medical report from Dr. Sew Hoy as an agreed medical evaluator. Dr. Sew Hoy recommended work restrictions that rated 48 percent permanent disability, but did not address psychiatric consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>The employer objected to the psychological consultation recommended by Dr. Mays, and offered Cortez the choice between three physicians as an agreed medical evaluator, including psychiatrist Solomon Perlo, M.D. Cortez did not respond, and the employer scheduled a medical evaluation with Dr. Perlo under the procedure of former section 4062.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Cortez informed the employer by letter that he would not attend the evaluation with Dr. Perlo because \u201c. . . there are no statutory rules applicable to med-legal evaluations for represented workers with dates of injury prior to January 1, 2005.\u201d Cortez explained that the medical and evaluation procedures under former section 4060 et seq. had been repealed by Sen. Bill 899 and replaced by section 4062.2, which applies only to claims with a date of injury on or after January 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The employer petitioned the workers\u2019 compensation administrative law judge (WCJ) for an order compelling Cortez to attend a rescheduled evaluation with Dr. Perlo. The petition alleged that Cortez refused to attend the evaluation which would address the nature and extent of injury, causation, and the claim for various benefits. The appointment letters and Cortez\u2019s letter response were included as exhibits. The petition also included a proposed order that would suspend any proceeding for the collection of compensation under section 4053,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and bar the right to disability payments under section 4054,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> should Cortez fail to attend the ordered evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The WCJ set the matter for conference and the parties appeared. The WCJ approved the employer\u2019s petition, adding a citation to section 5701<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Cortez petitioned the Board for reconsideration or removal under section 5310.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He contended that the procedure for medical evaluation in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>represented case under former section 4060 et seq. had been repealed and replaced by section 4062.2, which is limited to a date of injury on or after January 1, 2005. The WCJ could have ordered a status examination under section 4050,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but a medical report for monitoring an employee\u2019s medical condition is not admissible for addressing the issues raised by the employer\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The employer filed opposition arguing that the new procedure under Sen. Bill 899 is limited to a date of injury on or after April 19, 2004. The employer also argued that a defense medical evaluation report is admissible under other statutes such as section 4050.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The WCJ reported to the Board that reconsideration was inappropriate since the order to compel the employer\u2019s medical evaluation was a discovery order, not a \u201cfinal\u201d order, and that removal also should be denied because the employer is entitled to a medical evaluation with Dr. Perlo under former section 4062 and <em>Simi v. Sav-Max Foods, Inc. </em>(2005) 70 Cal.Comp.Cases 217 <em>(Simi).</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The Board agreed with the WCJ that the order compelling a medical evaluation is a discovery order and not a \u201cfinal\u201d order, and dismissed the petition for reconsideration. The Board also concluded that there was no substantial prejudice or irreparable harm for the reasons stated by the WCJ, and denied removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Cortez petitions for writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The employer has not filed a responsive pleading, although the employer\u2019s position is set forth in the opposition to Cortez\u2019s petition for reconsideration or removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Generally, factual findings that are supported by substantial evidence are affirmed upon review.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We review governing statutes de novo, but we accord considerable weight to the Board\u2019s interpretation and application of workers\u2019 compensation law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Cortez argues that since former section 4062 was repealed and section 4062 expressly limits a represented case to the procedure of section 4062.2, which applies only to a date of injury on or after January 1, 2005,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> no applicable procedure remains in a represented case with a date of injury before January 1, 2005, and reliance on <em>Simi </em>was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">For the reasons stated in <em>Nunez, </em>we conclude that the medical evaluation and reporting procedure of former section 4062 applies to represented cases with a date of injury before January 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Cortez contends further that the WCJ\u2019s reliance on repealed law in ordering the medical evaluation with Dr. Perlo results in substantial prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>and irreparable harm. Since we agree with the Board that the medical evaluation and reporting procedure of former section 4062 is applicable, the WCJ\u2019s order does not result in substantial prejudice or irreparable harm as argued by Cortez. We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s denial of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\n<em>Sections 4050 and 5701 Are Not Authority for Granting the Employer\u2019s Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Cortez argues that the WCJ had authority to order a medical examination with Dr. Perlo under section 4050, even though the resulting report would not have been admissible at trial to address the issues raised by the employer in its petition. The WCJ agreed and added section 5701 to the employer\u2019s proposed order as authority for ordering the medical evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Although the proposed order referred to sections 4053 and 4054, the issues raised by the employer in its petition addressed former section 4062. For the reasons we stated in <em>Nunez, </em>section 4050 may not be utilized to circumvent the medical evaluation and reporting procedure of former section 4062.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">For the same reasons, section 5701 should not be utilized to order a medical evaluation that appears to violate former section 4062 and may generate an inadmissible report at trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Absent additional documentation that indicates compliance with the applicable statute, the order could result in undermining the Legislature\u2019s goal of avoiding unnecessary and costly medical evaluations and reports, and may be an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The Board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Hastings, J., and Curry, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-10\"> Former Labor Code section 4062 was amended on April 19, 2004, as part of the comprehensive workers\u2019 compensation reform under Sen.

The Board explained that under Sen. Bill 899, \u201cthe Legislature created a new procedure for obtaining medical-legal reports for injuries on or after January 1, 2005, but it did not retain any procedure for injuries before January 1, 2005.\u201d The Board reasoned that former section 4062 applied for injuries prior to January 1, 2005, under the reasoning of <em>Godinez v. Buffets, Inc.
