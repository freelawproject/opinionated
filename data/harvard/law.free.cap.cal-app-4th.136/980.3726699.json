J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apj\">The trial court in October 2001 granted the motion of Deborah Rowe Jackson to terminate her own parental rights to her two children, Michael Joseph Jackson, Jr., and Paris Michael Katherine Jackson, giving sole responsibility for the two children to their father, Michael J. Jackson. In April 2004 the trial court declared the October 2001 termination order void and in October 2004 denied Michael\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motion to vacate that part of the April 2004 order declaring the earlier termination of parental rights void. Michael appeals, contending the trial court properly terminated Deborah\u2019s parental rights in 2001. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">1. <em>Termination of Deborah\u2019s Parental Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">In October 1999 Deborah and Michael, married at the time, entered into a stipulation for judgment providing Michael would have sole legal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>physical custody of their two children, Michael, Jr., and Paris; Deborah was granted visitation rights. Deborah and Michael\u2019s marriage was dissolved in April 2000. Approximately six months later Deborah decided to stop visiting the children because, according to her, the visitation \u201cwas not working out for various reasons.\u201d Deborah agreed to a modification of the earlier child custody judgment, relinquishing her visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">In October 2001 Deborah filed a motion to terminate her parental rights. Deborah\u2019s declaration in support of her motion stated, \u201cMICHAEL has been a wonderful father to the children and I do not wish to share parenting responsibilities with MICHAEL because he is doing so well without me. HQ ... I want to forever give up any and all rights pertaining to the children because I believe that by doing so, it is in the children\u2019s best interests.\u201d Deborah also stated she fully understood the implications of relinquishing her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">At the hearing on Deborah\u2019s motion, which Michael did not attend, Michael\u2019s counsel stated Michael did not oppose Deborah\u2019s motion and counsel was there \u201cto facilitate a record that will allow the motion to be not only granted but enforceable.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Deborah was examined under oath by her counsel, as well as by Michael\u2019s counsel, to ensure she in fact wanted her parental rights terminated and fully understood the consequences of her action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court granted Deborah\u2019s motion, finding that, \u201c[Deborah] has left the minor children in [Michael\u2019s] exclusive custody for a period in excess of one year. During such period, [Deborah] has not communicated with the children. [Deborah] believes that it is in the best interest of the minor children that her parental rights be terminated.. . . [f] . . . Based on [Deborah\u2019s] belief that it is in the best interest of the minor children that they remain in [Michael\u2019s] exclusive custody without contact by [Deborah], the Court finds that there is clear and convincing evidence to terminate [Deborah\u2019s] parental rights pursuant to Family Code \u00a7 7822(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>2. <em>Deborah\u2019s Ex Parte Application for an Order to Show Cause for Modification of Among Other Things, Child Custody and Child Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">More than two years after Deborah\u2019s motion to terminate her parental rights had been granted, she filed an ex parte application for an order to show cause seeking, among other things, temporary exclusive custody of the children pending completion of a psychiatric evaluation to assist in determining what permanent custody would be in the best interest of the children. The application stated Deborah now sought temporary custody because of concerns arising from Michael\u2019s criminal prosecution and press reports Michael had associated with the Nation of Islam, whose members Deborah believed do \u201cnot like Jews.\u201d Because she is Jewish, Deborah feared the children might be mistreated if Michael continued his association with the Nation of Islam. Michael opposed Deborah\u2019s ex parte application in part on the ground Deborah lacked standing to request the court make any orders regarding the children because the court had previously terminated her parental rights <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">After several rounds of extensive briefing on a myriad of legal theories and following oral argument, the court on April 2, 2004 granted in part and denied in part Deborah\u2019s ex parte application. The court found its earlier order terminating Deborah\u2019s parental rights (the termination order) void because it had failed to order an investigation or consider appointment of counsel for the children, as required by Family Code sections 7850 and 7861. However, the court found there was no basis at that time to permit Deborah visitation or contact with the children. The court also ruled Deborah\u2019s request for psychiatric evaluation was not an emergency warranting ex parte relief but could be renewed through a properly noticed motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">3. <em>Michael\u2019s Motion to Vacate the Portion of the Court\u2019s Order Declaring the Termination Order Void</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">On September 16, 2004, after retaining new counsel, Michael moved to vacate that portion of the court\u2019s April 2, 2004 order declaring the termination order void on the ground the order was final and could not be directly or collaterally attacked. In response Deborah argued a void order could be collaterally attacked at any time. Relying on <em>In re Marriage of Goodarzirad </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1020, 1026 [230 Cal.Rptr. 203] <em>(Goodarzirad) </em>(\u201cstipulations between parents involving the minor children which attempt to divest the court of jurisdiction are void\u201d), Deborah asserted for the first time the termination order was void because it had been impermissibly based on Michael\u2019s and her stipulation to terminate her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The court denied Michael\u2019s motion to vacate, finding that, even though Michael had not stipulated in writing to the termination of Deborah\u2019s parental rights, the termination proceeding \u201cwas the functional equivalent of a stipulated proceeding/stipulated agreement between the parties\u201d and as such void under <em>Goodarzirad. </em>Notwithstanding its own statement in October 2001 that termination was in the best interest of the children, the court found in fact no best-interest inquiry had been made by the court at that time. The court explained, \u201cNot a single thing was done to enlighten the trier of fact as to the best interests of the children. The children\u2019s interests were not brought forth through any of the means that our codes provide. And <em>[Goodarzirad] </em>stands for the proposition that parties cannot by themselves stipulate to termination of parental rights. If there ever was a case where the parties stipulated to the termination of parent rights and nothing further was done, this was such a case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Michael contends (1) he did not stipulate to the termination of Deborah\u2019s parental rights and the termination order is therefore not void or otherwise subject to collateral attack; and (2) the failure of the court to follow proper procedures in conducting the inquiry into termination was invited error and, in any event, harmless.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">1. <em>The Trial Court Had Jurisdiction to Decide Deborah\u2019s Collateral Attack on the October 2001 Judgment Terminating Her Parental Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Deborah contends, because the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction in entering the October 2001 termination order, that order is void and properly subject to collateral attack. Although collateral attacks on judgments are disfavored (see, e.g., <em>Robert J. </em>v. <em>Leslie M. </em>(1997) 51 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>Cal.App.4th 1642, 1647-1648 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 905]), in some cases, if the court has awarded relief to one of the parties the law declares cannot be granted, as Deborah contends occurred here, that judgment may be collaterally attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Lack of jurisdiction in the \u201cmost fundamental or strict sense means an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case, an absence of authority over the subject matter or the parties. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Abelleira v. District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 288 [109 P.2d 942]; <em>Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 196 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 298, 106 P.3d 958] [\u201cin the absence of subject matter jurisdiction, a trial court has no power \u2018to hear or determine [the] case.\u2019 [Citation.] And any judgment or order rendered by a court lacking subject matter jurisdiction is \u2018void on its face . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d].) In a broader sense, lack of jurisdiction also exists when a court \u201cmake[s] orders which are not authorized by statute.\u201d <em>(Polin v. Cosio </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1451, 1454-1455 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 714].) \u201c \u2018[I]t seems well settled . . . that when a statute authorizes prescribed procedure, and the court acts contrary to the authority thus conferred, it has exceeded its jurisdiction ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Abelleira, </em>at p. 290; see <em>Polin, </em>at pp. 1455-1457 [judgment awarding custody exceeded statutory authority]; <em>Goodarzirad, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1024-1027 [stipulated judgment to terminate paternity was void and subject to collateral attack].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">If the trial court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear or determine a case and personal jurisdiction over the parties, an order or judgment rendered in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction, such as by its failure to follow fundamental procedures prescribed by statute, remains valid but voidable. <em>(Neumann </em>v. <em>Melgar </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 152, 164 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 754]; <em>In re Andres G. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 476, 482-483 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 285].) A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>stipulated judgment or other order in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction may not be collaterally attacked absent unusual circumstances or compelling policy considerations, <em>(In re Marriage of Hinman </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 711, 718, fn. 2 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 245].) Thus, appellate courts have repeatedly allowed acts in excess of jurisdiction to stand when the acts were beneficial to all parties and did not violate public policy <em>(In re Andres G., </em>at p. 482; see, e.g., <em>Cowan v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 367, 370-376 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 458, 926 P.2d 438] [trial court allowed defendant to plead guilty to a time-barred lesser included offense]) or when allowing objection would countenance a wholly unacceptable trifling with the courts. (See, e.g., <em>Kristine H. v. Lisa R. </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 156, 166 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 81, 117 P.3d 690]; <em>In re Griffin </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 343, 346-347 [62 Cal.Rptr. 1, 431 P.2d 625] [trial court as a result of defendant\u2019s actions revoked probation after expiration of probation period].) On the other hand, appellate courts have voided acts in excess of jurisdiction when the irregularity was too great or when the act violated a comprehensive statutory scheme or offended public policy. <em>(Goodarzirad, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1024-1027 [stipulation of parties to deprive court of authority to modify child custody and visitation orders in dissolution proceeding]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendez </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1773, 1778-1784 [286 Cal.Rptr. 216] [reducing felony conviction to misdemeanor and sealing conviction record]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Blakeman </em>(1959) 170 Cal.App.2d 596, 598 [339 P.2d 202] [banishment as condition of probation].) Whether the voidable order is enforced depends, in large part, on the degree of the procedural irregularity and whether the court\u2019s act violated a comprehensive statutory scheme or offended public policy. <em>(In re Andres G., </em>at p. 483; <em>Adoption of Matthew B. </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1239, 1269 [284 Cal.Rptr. 18].)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">As we discuss below, the termination order exceeded the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction and contravenes \u201cthe public policy favoring that a child has two parents rather than one.\u201d <em>(Kristine H. </em>v. <em>Lisa R., supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 166.) Accordingly, Deborah\u2019s collateral attack on that order is not precluded.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>2. <em>The Termination Order Was Impermissibly Based on the Parties\u2019 Agreement to Terminate Deborah\u2019s Parental Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">A court cannot enter a judgment terminating parental rights based solely upon the parties\u2019 stipulation that the child\u2019s mother or father relinquishes those rights. <em>(Kristine M. v. David P. </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 783, 791 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 748] [\u201cthe public policies favoring creation of a father-child relationship as a source of emotional and financial support . . . trump any policy that would favor private ordering of parenthood <em>after </em>the birth of a child\u201d]; <em>Goodarzirad, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at p. 1026; <em>In re Matthew S. </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 315, 320 [247 Cal.Rptr. 100].)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">In <em>Goodarzirad </em>the trial court approved a stipulation in a divorce proceeding in which the husband relinquished his custody and visitation rights in return for the wife\u2019s waiver of her right to collect all child support, both delinquent amounts currently due and any future support. <em>(Goodarzirad, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1023-1024.) After the trial court denied the husband\u2019s subsequent motion to vacate the judgment terminating his parental rights, the Court of Appeal reversed, holding the stipulation attempted to divest the court of jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 minor children and was, therefore, void on public policy grounds. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1026-1027.) \u201c \u2018This continuing jurisdiction is vested in the court, and is to be exercised, in the interests of children. It is their right to have the court hear and determine all matters which concern their welfare and they cannot be deprived of this right by any agreement of their parents. The welfare of children is of interest to the state. The Legislature has fixed the period within which such powers may be exercised by the courts as that of the minority of the children, and it is not within the power of the court to fix a shorter period. In every decree of divorce which has provisions respecting the custody and support of children the law becomes a part thereof and the decree is subject to the further order of the court, whether or not it is so stated. . . .\u2019 [Citation.] [][] \u2018While parents have a right to contract with each other as to the custody and control of their offspring and to stipulate away their respective parental rights [citation], this right so to stipulate is subject to the control of the court in which the matter affecting the child is pending, and the court is not required to award the custody in conformity with such stipulation.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Where the welfare of children is involved as in divorce cases, parents cannot by contract so bind themselves as to foreclose the court from an inquiry as to what that welfare requires.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1027; accord, <em>Kristine M. v. David P., supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 789 [\u201cThe [Uniform Parentage Act] protects the child\u2019s right to establish paternity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>obtain support irrespective of the parent\u2019s intent to foreclose that right.\u201d]; see also <em>In re Marriage of Lambe &amp; Meehan </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 388, 392 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 641] <em>[Goodarzirad </em>and similar cases \u201cconvince us that the policy underlying stipulations involving minor children must be extended to adult indigent children\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Michael contends the public policy underlying <em>Goodarzirad </em>is inapplicable in this case because he did not stipulate to terminate Deborah\u2019s parental rights: He did not sign any document agreeing to the termination; he did not attend the hearing on Deborah\u2019s motion to terminate; and he did not have any advance notice Deborah intended to move to terminate her parental rights. Thus, Michael argues, there is no basis for the court\u2019s finding the termination hearing \u201cwas the functional equivalent of a stipulated proceeding/stipulated agreement between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s finding the termination hearing was a stipulated proceeding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018A stipulation is \u201c[a]n agreement between opposing counsel . . . ordinarily entered into for the purpose of avoiding delay, trouble, or expense in the conduct of the action,\u201d [citation] and serves \u201cto obviate need for proof or to narrow [the] range of litigable issues\u201d [citation]\u2019 [Citation.] \u201cA stipulation in proper form is binding upon the parties if it is within the authority of the attorneys.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Mileikowsky </em>v. <em>Tenet Healthsystem </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 278 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 831].) Although Michael did not attend the proceeding, clearly he was aware in advance of the October 17, 2001 hearing date that Deborah sought to terminate her parental rights,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he agreed with her decision and he authorized his counsel to attend the hearing and ensure the enforceability of the termination order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the outset of the hearing Michael\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cWe have not filed any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>opposition or paperwork. We do not oppose it. And I\u2019m here to facilitate a record that will allow the motion to be not only granted but enforceable.\u201d In fact, Michael\u2019s counsel examined Deborah at the hearing on her motion, testing her resolve to terminate her rights. And significantly, when the court announced its findings, it characterized the hearing as a \u201cstipulated proceeding.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although Michael\u2019s counsel may not have realized the import of the court\u2019s characterization, he did not object it was inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Additionally, the same highly experienced retired superior court judge who had granted Deborah\u2019s motion to terminate in October 2001 heard Deborah\u2019s ex parte application in April 2004 and Michael\u2019s October 2004 motion to vacate. That judge was familiar with the history between the parties and fully understood the factual context in which the court had approved the parties\u2019 agreement. At the hearing on Michael\u2019s motion to vacate, the court explained, \u201cIt was an arranged deal from the beginning. The terms of the deal were in flux. They changed. Part of what was happening was that they were changed in a way that Ms. Rowe didn\u2019t like. This was not mom and dad saying, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s have a family that we\u2019re going to raise.\u2019 When you start with an understanding of what went on between Ms. Rowe and Mr. Jackson, you then see what progressed to the October 2001 hearing, and what progressed to the October 2001 hearing was what I would have to find factually was a deemed stipulated hearing, and I do so find. . . . There was never a question in this judge\u2019s mind, in my mind, that I was going to have to make a factual decision based upon any evidence that would be produced at that hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>There was never a question in my mind that I was going to have to take notes so that I could make sure that I found the right facts in order to support a decision. It was a preordained hearing. The ruling was preordained. How much of this had been worked out by [counsel] in advance, ... I don\u2019t know. I have no idea that is based in fact. I have a good idea based in reality and based in common sense, but I certainly can\u2019t say I have any hard evidence to support it. But there was never a single suspicion that this hearing was going to be anything other than what you might call a gimme. Ms. Rowe was going to come in. She was going to recite the things that she had to recite. [Michael\u2019s counsel], representing bis client, made sure that everything he thought had to be there was going to be there. He didn\u2019t examine her in the sense of trying to have the court come up with a finding contrary to what Ms. Rowe wanted. They were both after the same thing. Ms. Rowe was there seeking termination, and Mr. Jackson was there seeking termination. There is no question about it. So I have to agree with [Ms. Rowe] that this was for all purposes a stipulated hearing, that this was a hearing based upon an agreement of the parties . . . that Ms. Rowe\u2019s parental rights would be terminated, and we did it in a manner that was inconsistent with the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s finding, \u201cIf there ever was a case where the parties stipulated to the termination of parental rights and nothing further was done, this was such a case.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Even if Michael were correct, however, and he did not effectively stipulate with Deborah for the termination of her parental rights, the result would be no different if, based solely on Deborah\u2019s uncontested motion to terminate her parental rights, the trial court had granted the requested termination without first ordering an investigation of the children\u2019s circumstances by the Department of Children and Family Services or other appropriate agency as required by Family Code section 7850; considering appointment of counsel for the children pursuant to Family Code section 7861; and actually considering the long-term interest of the children involved. (See <em>Kristine M. </em>v. <em>David P., supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 791 [\u201cit is only under specified circumstances, and upon specific findings that include the interests of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>child, that a court has authority to terminate parental rights\u201d]; <em>Neumann v. Melgar, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at p. 162 [\u201cStatutes authorizing an action to free a child from parental custody and control are intended foremost to protect the child.\u201d]; see Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7800 [\u201cThe purpose of this part is to serve the welfare and best interest of a child by providing the stability and security of an adoptive home when those conditions are otherwise missing from the child\u2019s life.\u201d], 7801 [\u201cThis part shall be liberally construed to serve and protect the interests and welfare of the child.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The fundamental problem in <em>Goodarzirad, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d 1020, was not simply that the trial court had entered an order based on the parties\u2019 agreement, but that it did so without itself evaluating what would serve the best interest and welfare of the parties\u2019 minor children. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1026, 1029 [\u201c[Former] Civil Code sections 232 et seq. contain very precise criteria and procedures which must be followed before parental custody and control can be terminated. It is clear that the Legislature wanted these specific procedures followed without deviation from the statutory scheme.\u201d; \u201cThe foremost interest in termination proceedings is to serve and protect the welfare and interests of the child. [Citation.] The fundamental rights of the parent and child should not be allowed to be tampered with by a confession of judgment which removes all determinations surrounding the propriety of the action.\u201d].) Indeed, should a mother and father stipulate to terminate one or both parents\u2019 rights, if the court follows all the procedures mandated by the Family Code, orders an independent investigation and then bases its findings of best interest and the order of termination on the investigator\u2019s report and other evidence presented at the hearing, it would be difficult to argue either considerations of policy or the analysis or holding of <em>Goodarzirad </em>authorizes a collateral attack on the court\u2019s judgment. Simply put, it is the court\u2019s total abdication of its responsibilities, not the mere fact that the parties agree, that makes a stipulated judgment to terminate parental rights invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">3. <em>Deborah\u2019s Challenge to the October 2001 Termination Order Is Not Barred by Judicial Estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The doctrine of judicial estoppel has frequently been invoked to bar a party from contesting the validity of a judgment procured by that party. <em>(Kristine H. v. Lisa R., supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 162; see <em>In re Griffin, supra, 61 </em>Cal.2d at p. 347.) Whether estoppel will actually be applied depends on the significance of the procedural irregularities, whether the court\u2019s act violated a comprehensive statutory scheme and considerations of public policy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number><em>(Neumann v. Melgar, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at p. 164; <em>Adoption of Matthew B., supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at p. 1269.) We agree with Michael that Deborah\u2019s actions \u201c \u2018 \u201ctrifle with the courts\u201d \u2019 \u201d and to a limited extent also contravene public policy favoring speedy determinations of parentage and \u201cthe finality of paternity judgments.\u201d (See <em>Adoption of Matthew B., </em>at p. 1269.) Nonetheless, compelling policy considerations militate against applying judicial estoppel here. <em>(Ibid.) </em> As explained by the <em>Goodarzirad </em>court, \u201cThe entire scheme underlying custody decrees is that primary consideration must be given to the welfare of children. [Citation.] The ultimate aim of the court is to serve the best interests and welfare of the minor children. [Citation.] Based on these strong public policy reasons, stipulations between parents involving the minor children which attempt to divest the court of jurisdiction are void and the doctrine of judicial estoppel does not apply.\u201d <em>(Goodarzirad, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at p. 1026; see <em>Neumann, </em>at p. 164 [refusing to apply principles of waiver or estoppel when trial court ignored procedural protections provided in Fam. Code, \u00a7 7800 et seq., which were \u201call calculated to promote the best interests of the affected children\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">A central factor in determining whether to apply judicial estoppel to preclude a party from challenging an order based on an agreement determining parentage is whether the agreed-to order promotes or undermines this state\u2019s public policy \u201cfavoring that a child has two parents rather than one.\u201d <em>(Kristine H. v. Lisa R., supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 166; see also <em>Elisa B v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 108, 123 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 46, 117 P.3d 660] [\u201cBy recognizing the value of determining paternity, the Legislature implicitly recognized the value of having two parents, rather than one, as a source of both emotional and financial support, especially when the obligation to support the child would otherwise fall to the public.\u201d]; Fam. Code, \u00a7 3020, subd. (b) [public policy of California is \u201cto assure that children have frequent and continuing contact with both parents after the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage, or ended their relationship . . . except where the contact would not be in the best interest of the child\u201d].) Thus, in <em>Goodarzirad, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at pages 1026 to 1027, the stipulated judgment at issue would have deprived the child of one of his two parents; the Court of Appeal held judicial estoppel did not bar the husband\u2019s successful challenge to that order although he had previously agreed to it. In <em>Kristine H. </em>v. <em>Lisa R., supra, </em>at page 166, in contrast, the Supreme Court held the biological mother of a child was estopped from attacking the validity of a two-year-old stipulated judgment declaring that she and her lesbian partner were file joint legal parents of the child, which would have deprived the child of one of her two parents following the couple\u2019s separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Adoption of Matthew B., supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at page 1269, the estoppel doctrine was applied to preclude a party (a surrogate) to a stipulated judgment of paternity, which had assured the child had two parents, from challenging the validity of the judgment. And in <em>In re Marriage of Hinman, supra, 6 </em>Cal.App.4th at page 716, judicial estoppel was invoked to prevent a wife from attacking the validity of a judgment to which she had stipulated as part of dissolution proceedings in which she had listed five minor children of the marriage, including two children who had been bom prior to the marriage and had been fathered by the wife\u2019s former husband. The parties had stipulated wife and husband would share joint physical and legal custody of all five children, and a judgment was entered. The wife\u2019s subsequent attempt to deprive the husband of all custody over the two children fathered by her former husband, based on the argument the stipulated judgment was in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction because the husband had no biological connection to the children, was rejected as barred by judicial estoppel: \u201cHaving initially invoked the court\u2019s power to determine custody, [the wife] then <em>stipulated to a judgment </em>giving [the husband] joint custody. A party who participates in or consents to a judgment which otherwise would be beyond the court\u2019s authority is precluded from attacking it collaterally, absent exceptional circumstances.

Regardless of how objectionable it may be for Deborah to invoke the jurisdiction of the court, obtain the precise relief she requested, and now seek to reverse that action by claiming the court failed to inquire into the best interest of her children, the fact remains the trial court has candidly acknowledged it relied entirely on Deborah\u2019s now-recanted declaration and did not inquire on its own into the children\u2019s best interest when it entered its order permanently depriving the children of one of their two parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>4. <em>Because the Court Acted in Excess of its Jurisdiction in Entering the Termination Order, the Harmless Error Doctrine Is Inapplicable</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Michael\u2019s final argument, based in substantial part on comments made by the trial court at the hearing on Deborah\u2019s ex parte application,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is that the court\u2019s failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the Family Code in October 2001 was at most harmless error because it is unlikely the court would have denied Deborah\u2019s request for termination of her parental rights even if it had ordered an independent investigation or considered appointment of counsel for the children.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is generally true the existence of procedural error alone, even in a termination proceeding, is insufficient to set aside an order or judgment; the party challenging the order or judgment must also demonstrate the error was prejudicial, that is, that it is reasonably probable a result more favorable to that party would have been reached in the absence of the error.

Because it appears no formal judgment had been entered following the October 2001 termination order as required by Family Code section 7894, Deborah\u2019s counsel also argued the termination order was not final and therefore remained subject to modification by the trial court whether or not it was void or voidable.
