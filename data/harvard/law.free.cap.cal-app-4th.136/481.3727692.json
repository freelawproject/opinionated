J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6C\">Eighteen months after the trial court appointed guardians for L.V. (the minor), her parents petitioned to terminate the guardianship. Among other things, they asserted they were now able to adequately care for the minor and, thus, they were entitled to regain custody of their child. The court denied the petition, finding that although the parents \u201ccan, at this time, provide food, shelter and clothing for the child,\u201d it would be detrimental to the minor to terminate the guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The parents appeal. Their primary contention is that because they were fit parents who could provide adequate food, clothing, and shelter for the minor, it was their constitutional right to have the guardianship terminated and the minor returned to their custody. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">As we will explain, a parent\u2019s constitutional right against judicial interference with the parent\u2019s day-to-day child rearing decisions applies to a fit parent who has custody of the child. Here, the parents did not have custody of the minor; a guardianship had been established, and the guardians had provided the minor with day-to-day custody and care for several years. Because the parents were not participating in the day-to-day parenting of the minor, they were not entitled to the constitutional protection afforded to parents acting in that role. The test for determining whether to terminate the guardianship was the best interest of the child. Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s decision that to terminate the guardianship would have been detrimental to the minor and, thus, not in her best interest. The parents\u2019 other attacks on the decision also lack merit. Thus, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">For clarity and to preserve the minor\u2019s privacy, we will refer to the minor\u2019s parents as mother and father, or collectively as the parents. The minor\u2019s guardians are her maternal uncle and his wife. We will refer to them as uncle and aunt, or collectively as the guardians.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">In 1999, when the minor was 11 years old, her family was experiencing difficulties. Father had an alcohol problem and multiple convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol, and his driver\u2019s license had been revoked. Mother was unemployed. Father was working but not \u201cthat much.\u201d The parents separated, father moved to another city, and mother commenced proceedings to dissolve the marriage. Mother then began to experience health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>problems, including a benign lung tumor and heart problems, and she was hospitalized on at least two occasions. In April 2000, mother placed the minor in the care of the uncle and aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">By June 2001, the parents had reconciled and were living together a long distance away from the minor. The uncle and aunt then filed a petition seeking appointment as the minor\u2019s guardians. It appears the petition was precipitated by the minor\u2019s expressed wish to remain in the custody of her uncle and aunt; by her fear that if she visited her parents, they would not allow her to return to the uncle\u2019s and aunt\u2019s care; and by an angry telephone confrontation between the minor and her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">After a court investigator recommended that the petition be granted, the parents agreed to a schedule of visitation; and with that stipulation, they did not oppose the petition. In August 2001, the petition was granted, making the uncle and aunt the minor\u2019s guardians. In 2002, following an annual review, the guardianship was continued in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Shortly before the scheduled annual review in 2003, the parents filed a petition to terminate the guardianship. The parents and the guardians then reached an agreement for the minor to spend every other week in the summer with the parents and, if everything went well, for the minor to be returned to parental custody in the fall. The trial court postponed, until after the summer, a hearing on whether to terminate the guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">All did not go well. The visitation schedule failed, and the minor made it known that she was strongly opposed to being returned to her parents\u2019 custody. The guardians thus decided to oppose termination of the guardianship, and they successfully asked the court to appoint counsel for the minor to represent her interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">At the hearing on the petition, the parents presented evidence that they had improved the conditions which had resulted in the guardianship. Father was employed and no longer was abusing alcohol and drugs; mother\u2019s health issues were under control; they had rented an apartment; and there no longer was disruption, anger, hostility or problems between them. The parents also asserted that while the minor had been in the guardians\u2019 custody, she was not getting the kind of education she needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">It was stipulated the minor would testify that when she visited her parents, they provided her with \u201cadequate\u201d food, clothing, and shelter, and \u201cguidance\u201d in the sense \u201cthe parents directed [her] what to do and not to do,\u201d but that the conditions \u201ccould have been better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The guardians presented the following evidence at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Mother has a severe anger control problem; she will scream, yell, hit, and throw things, often on an unpredictable basis. Father continues to drink to excess, and he and mother often engage in loud and lengthy screaming matches. Although there was no evidence father had been physically violent to the minor, he was physically violent to her two older half brothers, both of whom eventually were removed from the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">When the minor first came to live with the guardians, she was pale, appeared malnourished, had no muscle tone, and had \u201cobviously poor hygiene habits.\u201d Her eyes looked sunken or glazed, and she appeared to be deprived of sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The principal of the school the minor had begun to attend testified the minor was two to three years behind in most subjects. The principal noted that although the minor wore glasses, she complained of headaches caused by reading and studying. She was \u201cextremely reserved,\u201d \u201c[d]id not know ordinary politeness,\u201d and \u201cdid not know how to interact with a <em>[sic] </em>other people, especially children her own age.\u201d According to the principal, the minor lacked physical skills\u2014such as running, catching, and throwing\u2014that a child of her age should have.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The minor told the guardians that she had not seen an eye doctor in years. After having an eye examination, the minor obtained new glasses and her headaches and concentration problems disappeared. In school, she was able to catch up to her grade level and make the honor roll. She developed social skills and made many friends. She also developed physical skills and was an active participant in team sports.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The minor did not want the guardianship to end. Although she loved her parents and wanted to be able to talk with and visit them, she was strongly against being returned to their custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">In arguing for continuation of the guardianship, the minor\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cThis child has been in a stable environment for four years. To remove her from it and return her as though she was a borrowed car to her parents would do great damage to this child and to whatever hope the parents have of any kind of relationship with her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">The parents took the position that (1) they were currently fit parents because they could provide adequate food, shelter, clothing, and guidance for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the minor, and (2) since they now were fit parents, it was their constitutional right to have the guardianship terminated and the minor returned to their custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The trial court found that the parents \u201ccan, at this time, provide food, shelter and clothing for the child.\u201d Nevertheless, the court concluded that \u201cwhen a natural parent is seeking to terminate the guardianship there must be a showing of \u2018overall fitness\u2019 on the part of the natural parent seeking to end the guardianship sufficient to overcome the inherent trauma of removing a successful caregiver.\u201d Based upon its review of the facts, the court found that \u201c[t]o terminate this guardianship at this time based on the facts presented would be detrimental in every sense of the word to [the minor].\u201d Thus, the court denied the parents\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The parents assert that this case presents a mixed question of fact and law, and that we should review the issues de novo; in the words of their counsel, we \u201cshould give no deference to the ruling or judgment of the trial court, and conduct essentially the same inquiry as that conducted by the trial court. . . .\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The resolution of a legal dispute involves three steps: (1) establishing the facts; (2) determining the applicable law; and (3) applying the law to the facts. <em>(Ghirardo </em>v. <em>Antonioli </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 791, 800-801 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 883 P.2d 960].)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">The first step, determining the relevant facts, is committed to the trier of the facts and is reviewed on appeal with deference to the factfinder\u2019s decision by applying the venerable substantial evidence test. <em>(Ghirardo v. Antonioli, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 800-801; see <em>Guardianship of Kassandra H. </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1236 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 668].) We view the evidence in a light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s decision, resolving all conflicts in the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in support of that court\u2019s findings. <em>(Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 427, 429 [45 P.2d 183].) In short, we review the evidence but do not weigh it; we defer to the trial court\u2019s findings to the extent they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Estate of Teel </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 520, 527 [154 P.2d 384]; <em>County of Mariposa </em>v. <em>Yosemite West Associates </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 791, 807 [248 Cal.Rptr. 778].)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Throughout their brief, the parents state and argue the facts in a manner most favorable to themselves, in disregard of contrary evidence. This is inappropriate. The assertion that this case presents a mixed question of fact and law has relevance only to the third step in the dispute resolution process, application of the law to the facts. <em>(Ghirardo v. Antonioli, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 800-801.) Appellate review of the trial court\u2019s determination of the first step in the process, finding the underlying facts, is confined to substantial evidence review. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">With respect to the second step in the dispute resolution process, determining the applicable law, we independently review all issues of law presented by the parents. <em>(Ghirardo v. Antonioli, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 800; <em>Hill v. City of Long Beach </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1684, 1687 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 125].)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The third step, applying the law to the facts, is reviewed under the deferential clearly erroneous standard if the inquiry is essentially factual, i.e., if it \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018is founded \u201con the application of the [trial court\u2019s] experience with the mainsprings of human conduct\u201d <em>(Ghirardo v. Antonioli, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 800-801.) If, however, the inquiry requires a consideration, in a factual context, of legal principles and their underlying values, the question is predominately legal and will be reviewed de novo. <em>(Ibid:, </em>see also <em>Crocker National Bank </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 881, 888 [264 Cal.Rptr. 139, 782 P.2d 278].)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The decision whether to terminate a guardianship is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1601; <em>Guardianship of Stephen G. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1418, 1426 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 409].) It is an inquiry that is particularly founded on application of the trial court\u2019s experience with human conduct. Thus, when the trial court applies the appropriate legal standard, its determination is subject to deferential review on appeal. <em>(Guardianship of M.S.W. </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 708, 711-712 [186 Cal.Rptr. 430]; <em>Guardianship of Davis </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 754, 761 [61 Cal.Rptr. 297]; <em>Guardianship of White </em>(1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 624, 628 [191 P2d 466].) Hence, we reject the argument that we can disregard the trial court\u2019s determination and decide the issue anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The parents claim that because they are fit parents\u2014i.e., they can provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, and guidance for the minor\u2014they are entitled to have the guardianship terminated and the minor returned to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>custody. This is not the statutory standard in California law. As we will explain, it is the best interest of the child that governs whether the trial court should terminate a guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Former section 1601 of the Probate Code stated in pertinent part: \u201cUpon petition of the guardian, a parent, or the ward, the court may make an order terminating the guardianship if the court determines that it is no longer necessary that the ward have a guardian or that it is in the ward\u2019s best interest to terminate the guardianship.\u201d (Stats. 1990, ch. 79, \u00a7 14, p. 522; further section references are to the Probate Code unless otherwise specified.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In <em>Guardianship of Kassandra H., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th 1228 (hereafter <em>Kassandra H.), </em>the Court of Appeal observed that \u201c[t]he troublesome part of [former section 1601] lies in the disjunctive \u2018or.\u2019 By using that little word, the Legislature signaled that a guardianship might be terminated <em>even if it wasn\u2019t in the best interest of the child to do so, </em>as long as it was \u2018no longer necessary\u2019 for the child to have a guardian.\u201d <em>(Kassandra H., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1230-1231, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\"><em>Kassandra H. </em>concluded that the phrase \u201cno longer necessary\u201d cannot be construed as a mere synonym for \u201cbest interest\u201d of the child because that would make the phrase surplusage. <em>(Kassandra H., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1238-1239.) Nevertheless, the court rejected the view that a guardianship must be terminated merely because a parent meets the minimal standard of fitness. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1236-1237.) \u201c[Continuity and stability in a child\u2019s life most certainly count for something .... Children are not dogwood trees, to be uprooted, replanted, then replanted again for expediency\u2019s sake.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1238.) \u201cIn substantive family law, stability and continuity in a child\u2019s living arrangement are so important <em>in themselves </em>that there must be a \u2018persuasive showing of changed circumstances affecting the child\u2019 to overcome the disruption necessarily inherent in any change of custody.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1239, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Thus, <em>Kassandra H. </em>held that in considering a parent\u2019s request to terminate a guardianship, the trial court must evaluate the parent\u2019s fitness in the context of whether changed circumstances justify a change in custody. <em>(Kassandra H., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1233, 1236.) \u201cThe bottom line is this: The \u2018no longer necessary\u2019 language of Probate Code section 1601 necessarily requires a showing of overall fitness on the part of the natural parent seeking to end the guardianship sufficient to overcome the inherent trauma of removing a successful caregiver.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1239-1240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>In <em>Guardianship of Simpson </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 914 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 389] (hereafter Simpson), the Court of Appeal that decided <em>Kassandra H. </em>reiterated and adhered to its earlier decision. In <em>Simpson, </em>a father sought to terminate a guardianship of his children, and the trial court put the burden on the guardians to prove by clear and convincing evidence that returning the children to father\u2019s custody would be detrimental to them. <em>Simpson </em>concluded this was erroneous. \u201cInstead, as California courts have done for generations, the court should have examined the totality of evidence bearing on the father\u2019s fitness with the burden upon him to show sufficient overall fitness to justify the termination of the guardianship.\u201d <em>(Simpson, supra, </em>67 Cal.App.4th at p. 921.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Since <em>Kassandra H. </em>and <em>Simpson </em>were decided, the Legislature has acted to eliminate the aspect of the law those decisions found to be troublesome. In 2002, the Legislature amended section 1601 to state in pertinent part: \u201cUpon petition of the guardian, a parent, or the ward, the court may make an order terminating the guardianship if the court determines that it is in the ward\u2019s best interest to terminate the guardianship.\u201d (Stats. 2002, ch. 1118, \u00a7 6.) Thus, the Legislature eliminated the \u201cno longer necessary\u201d ground for termination of a guardianship, and established the best interest of the ward as the sole criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Any doubt as to the Legislature\u2019s intent is resolved by reference to other aspects of the 2002 legislation, including (1) the enactment of section 1610, subdivision (a) to state, \u201cThe Legislature finds and declares that it [is] in the best interest of children to be raised in a permanent, safe, stable, and loving environment,\u201d and (2) the amendment of Family Code section 3041.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Prior to the 2002 legislation, Family Code section 3041 provided that before placing a child in the custody of a person or persons other than a parent without the consent of the parents, a trial court had to find that granting custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child and that granting custody to the nonparent was required to serve the best interests of the child. (Stats. 1993, ch. 219, \u00a7 116.50, p. 1624.) That standard is applicable in proceedings to establish a guardianship and to appoint a guardian. (\u00a7 1514, subd. (b); <em>Guardianship of Stephen G., supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th at p. 1423.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">In the 2002 legislation, the substance of former Family Code section 3041 was retained as subdivision (a) of that section, and three new subdivisions were added as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\u201c(b) Subject to subdivision (d), a finding that parental custody would be detrimental to the child shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u201c(c) As used in this section, \u2018detrimental to the child\u2019 includes the harm of removal from a stable placement of a child with a person who has assumed, on a day-to-day basis, the role of his or her parent, fulfilling both the child\u2019s physical needs and the child\u2019s psychological needs for care and affection, and who has assumed that role for a substantial period of time. A finding of detriment does not require any finding of unfitness of the parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201c(d) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person to whom custody may be given is a person described in subdivision (c), this finding shall constitute a finding that the custody is in the best interest of the child and that parental custody would be detrimental to the child absent a showing by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary.\u201d (Stats. 2002, ch. 1118, \u00a7 3.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The amendment of Family Code section 3041 demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intent when at the same time it amended section 1601. In short, the Legislature agreed with the holding in <em>Kassandra H. </em>that \u201ccontinuity and stability in a child\u2019s life most certainly count for something\u201d <em>(Kassandra H., supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 1238) and found that, in the absence of proof to the contrary, removing a child from what has been a stable, continuous, and successful placement is detrimental to the child. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 3041, subds. (c), (d).) And in that circumstance, a finding of parental unfitness is not necessary to a finding of detriment to the child. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 3041, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Consequently, now the best interest of the child is the sole criterion for termination of a guardianship. (\u00a7 1601.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fact that the trial court in this case applied the standard set forth in <em>Kassandra H. </em>and <em>Simpson </em>did not harm the parents because that standard was more favorable to them than is the legal standard set forth in section 1601.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">In the parents\u2019 view, the best interest of the child standard for termination of a guardianship is unconstitutional as applied to them. Relying on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Troxel v. Granville </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 57 [147 L.Ed.2d 49, 120 S.Ct. 2054] (hereafter <em>Troxel), </em>they contend that because they are able to provide minimally adequate food, clothing, shelter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>and guidance for the minor, their fundamental rights as biological parents required the trial court to terminate the guardianship and return the minor to their custody. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><em>Troxel </em>involved a court-ordered visitation schedule in favor of grandparents and against a natural, custodial parent. Noting that all 50 states have enacted statutes providing for grandparent visitation in some form (Troxel, <em>supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 73, fn. * [147 L.Ed.2d at pp. 61-62, fn. *] (plur. opn. of O\u2019Connor, J.)), the Supreme Court found the State of Washington nonparental visitation statute at issue in <em>Troxel </em>was \u201cbreathtakingly broad.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 67 [147 L.Ed.2d at p. 57].) The statute permitted any person at any time to petition for visitation and gave trial courts the power to overturn any decision by a fit custodial parent based solely upon the judge\u2019s view of the best interest of the child. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 67 [147 L.Ed.2d at pp. 57-58].)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The four-justice plurality opinion concluded that, as applied to that case, the Washington statute unconstitutionally infringed upon the \u201cfundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d <em>(Troxel, supra, </em>530 U.S. at pp. 66, 67 [147 L.Ed.2d at pp. 57-58].) This was so because there was no allegation or proof that the mother, who had maintained continuous custody of the children, was an unfit parent <em>(id. </em>at pp. 60-61, 68 [147 L.Ed.2d at pp. 53, 58]); the mother had agreed to meaningful grandparental visitation, but simply did not allow it with the frequency and duration desired by the grandparents <em>(id. </em>at pp. 60-61 [147 L.Ed.2d at p. 53]); and the case involved nothing more than a simple disagreement over the mother\u2019s decision <em>(id. </em>at p. 72 [147 L.Ed.2d at pp. 60-61]).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The plurality opinion held that parenting decisions made by fit, custodial parents must be presumed to be in the best interest of their child. <em>(Troxel, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 68 [147 L.Ed.2d at p. 58].) The problem in <em>Troxel </em>was \u201cnot that the [trial court] intervened, but that when it did so, it gave no special weight at all to [the parent\u2019s] determination of her daughters\u2019 best interests.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 69 [147 L.Ed.2d at p. 58].) In fact, the trial court appeared to have applied a presumption in favor of the grandparents and against the mother\u2019s decision. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Because a court may not interfere with the child rearing decisions of a fit, custodial parent simply because it believes that a better decision could be made, the Washington statute was unconstitutional as applied in that case. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 72-73 [147 L.Ed.2d at p. 61].)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Appellate courts in California have followed the plurality opinion in <em>Troxel </em>in concluding that nonparent visitation orders were unconstitutional as ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>plied to the specific facts at issue. (See <em>In re Marriage of W. </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 68, 74-75 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 461]; <em>Zasueta </em>v. <em>Zasueta </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1244 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 245]; <em>Herbst </em>v. <em>Swan </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 813, 814 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 836]; <em>Punsly v. Ho </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1101 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 139]; <em>Kyle O. </em>v. <em>Donald R. </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 848, 851 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 476].) However, it also has been recognized that in appropriate circumstances a court may impose a visitation order against a custodial parent, and that such orders are not per se invalid. <em>(In re Marriage of Harris </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 210, 226-227 [17 Cal.Rptr. 3d 842, 96 P.3d 141]; <em>In re Marriage of Ross &amp; Kelley </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 130, 140 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 287]; <em>Fenn </em>v. <em>Sherriff </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1478-1479 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 185].) A custodial parent\u2019s decisions regarding visitation are entitled to presumptive validity and must be accorded \u201cspecial weight,\u201d but they are not immune from judicial review. <em>(Fenn </em>v. <em>Sherriff, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.4th at p. 1479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The decisions in <em>Troxel </em>and its California progeny have no application to this case because they dealt with judicial interference in the day-to-day child rearing decisions of a fit, <em>custodial </em>parent. Here, the parents no longer had custody of the minor. A guardianship had been established and the guardians had provided the minor with day-to-day custody and care for several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Also inapplicable are the decisions, cited by the parents, that addressed orders freeing a child from parental custody and control. <em>(In re Cheryl E. </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 587, 606 [207 Cal.Rptr. 728]; <em>In re T.M.R. </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 694, 703 [116 Cal.Rptr. 292].) Here, the trial court did not terminate all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the minor. Those rights and responsibilities remained suspended by the decision not to end the guardianship <em>(In re Cheryl E., supra, </em>161 Cal.App.3d at p. 606; <em>In re T.M.R., supra, </em>41 Cal.App.3d at p. 703), but the court had continuing jurisdiction to reinstate them in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Nor are the parents helped by other decisions upon which they rely\u2014decisions addressing initial orders that established guardianships or otherwise removed children from parental custody. <em>(In re B.G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679, 698-699 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244]; <em>Guardianship of Jenna G. </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 387, 394 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 47]; <em>Guardianship of Stephen G., supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th at p. 1432.) As recognized by the Court of Appeal in <em>Guardianship of Stephen G., supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th at page 1426, a decision to terminate a guardianship rests in the broad discretion of the trial court and is not determined on the same basis as the creation of the guardianship or other living arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The parents have not cited, and we have not discovered, any Supreme Court decision, state or federal, that holds expressly or by necessary implication that natural parents have an automatic right to termination of a guardianship absent an express finding of their unfitness to care for the child, or that otherwise precludes the application of a \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard to the termination of a guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">For the following reasons, we decline to create such a constitutional standard that would overturn the Legislature\u2019s considered decision to provide that a guardianship may be terminated if a court determines that it is in the child\u2019s best interest to do so. (\u00a7 1601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u201c \u2018Parental rights do not spring full-blown from the biological connection between parent and child. They require relationships more enduring.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lehr </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 248, 260 [77 L.Ed.2d 614, 626, 103 S.Ct. 2985] (hereafter <em>Lehr), </em>italics omitted.) \u201c[T]he rights of the parents are a counterpart of the responsibilities they have assumed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 257 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 624].)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In other words, parental rights derive from a biological connection with the child <em>and </em>from acting in the role of parent. <em>(Lehr, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 261 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 626].) Thus, \u201cthe mere existence of a biological link does not merit equivalent constitutional protection [to that which exists when a parent has come forward to participate in the rearing of the child]. . . . \u2018[T]he importance of the familial relationship, to the individuals involved and to the society, stems from the emotional attachments that derive from the intimacy of daily association, and from the role it plays in \u201cpromoting] a way of life\u201d through the instruction of children ... as well as from the fact of blood relationship.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">For example, the Supreme Court in <em>Quilloin v. Walcott </em>(1978) 434 U.S. 246 [54 L.Ed.2d 511, 98 S.Ct. 549] (hereafter <em>Quilloin) </em>rejected the constitutional claim of a natural father who opposed the adoption of his child by the child\u2019s stepfather. According to the natural father, in the absence of a finding of his unfitness as a parent, he had a constitutional right to veto the adoption of his child. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 252 [54 L.Ed.2d at pp. 517-518].) The court disagreed: \u201cWe have little doubt that the Due Process Clause would be offended \u2018[i]f a State were to attempt to force the breakup of a natural family, over the objections of the parents and their children, without some showing of unfitness and for the sole reason that to do so was thought to be in the children\u2019s best interest.\u2019 [Citation.] But this is not a case in which the unwed father at any time had, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>sought, actual or legal custody of his child. Nor is this a case in which the proposed adoption would place the child with a new set of parents with whom the child had never before lived. Rather, the result of the adoption in this case is to give full recognition to a family unit already in existence, a result desired by all concerned, except [the natural father]. Whatever might be required in other situations, we cannot say that the State was required in this situation to find anything more than that the adoption, and denial of legitimation, was in the \u2018best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Quilloin, supra, </em>434 U.S. at p. 255 [54 L.Ed.2d at p. 520]; see also <em>Lehr, supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 262, 266-267 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 627, 630].)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Another factor that must be considered is the law\u2019s recognition of the importance of continuity and stability in a child\u2019s living arrangements. (\u00a7\u00a7 1601, 1610; Fam. Code, \u00a7 3041, subds. (c), (d).) Thus, \u201cthe paramount need for continuity and stability in custody arrangements\u2014and the harm that may result from disruption of established patterns of care and emotional bonds with the primary caretaker\u2014weigh heavily in favor of maintaining ongoing custody arrangements.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Burgess (1996) </em>13 Cal.4th 25, 32-33 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 444, 913 P.2d 473]; see also <em>In re Marriage of LaMusga </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1072, 1093 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 356, 88 P.3d 81]; <em>Burchard </em>v. <em>Garay </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 531, 541 [229 Cal.Rptr. 800, 724 P.2d 486]; <em>In re Marriage of Carney </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 725, 730-731 [157 Cal.Rptr. 383, 598 P.2d 36].) This is true regardless of whether the ongoing custody arrangement was established by court order or by the consent of a noncustodial parent. <em>(Burchard </em>v. <em>Garay, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 536-537.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Here, although the parents had a biological link to the minor, they relinquished their day-to-day parental relationship with her when mother voluntarily placed the minor with the uncle and aunt because the parents were unable to provide adequate care for her. Then, the parents did not oppose having the uncle and aunt named to be the minor\u2019s guardians. Because the parents were no longer participating in the day-to-day parenting of the minor, they were not entitled to the constitutional protection afforded to parents who are acting in that role. (Cf. <em>Lehr, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 261 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 626].)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">This is not a case where the court\u2019s order had the effect of breaking up a natural family over the family\u2019s objections. Rather, the refusal to terminate the guardianship continued the family unit already in existence, a result desired by all concerned, except the natural parents. As did the United States Supreme Court in the situation presented in <em>Quilloin, supra, </em>434 U.S. 246 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>[54 L.Ed.2d 511], we conclude that constitutional protections did not require the trial court to find anything more than that it was in the best interest of the minor not to terminate the guardianship. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 255 [54 L.Ed.2d at p. 520].)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The parents raise a variety of other challenges to the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">In passing, they state that they \u201cresponsibly and voluntarily sent [the minor] to live with her aunt and uncle\u201d until they could resolve their health and financial problems, and thereafter they were found to be fit parents. Thus, they claim, the \u201cState of California has never determined that [they] were unfit, neglectful or abusive.\u201d This claim ignores that the petition to establish the guardianship alleged it was necessary because \u201c[p]arental custody of the minor would be detrimental\u201d to her. This was so, the petition alleged, because the parents had \u201cproblems in the past with respect to physical violence and excessive use of alcohol\u201d and they were not \u201ccurrently capable or willing to provide her with proper care.\u201d The parents did not oppose the petition, and the trial court found it was \u201cnecessary\u201d to appoint guardians for the minor. In light of the uncontested allegations of the petition, the court\u2019s ruling establishing the guardianship constituted a finding that the parents were unfit to have custody of the minor at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Likewise, viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, the record does not support the parents\u2019 claim that the parties understood the minor would be returned to the parents as soon as they resolved their health and financial problems. Indeed, the court investigator\u2019s report states the uncle and aunt anticipated that the minor would remain in their custody until she reached the age of 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">According to the parents, the trial court erred in basing its finding of detriment on past events, rather than current conditions. We disagree. It is true that current circumstances and expectations for the future are most relevant to the decision whether it is necessary to establish a guardianship. However, \u201ca parent\u2019s future potential is undoubtedly revealed in the parent\u2019s past behavior with the child.\u201d <em>(In re Laura F. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 826, 833 [191 Cal.Rptr. 464, 662 P.2d 922].) Thus, prior conduct is relevant in determining the best interests of the child. (See <em>In re Marriage of McLoren </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 108, 115 [247 Cal.Rptr. 897].) In any event, the guardians <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>introduced evidence, apparently believed by the trial court, that the substance abuse and emotional problems which had made the parents unfit to have custody of the minor were continuing problems at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">There is absolutely no merit to the parents\u2019 contention that the trial court\u2019s assessment of harm to the minor was based simply on, in the parents\u2019 words, \u201cwho it felt were better parents\u201d and whether the minor \u201cwould be less well off because she would have to move from her current environment.\u201d And nothing in the record even remotely supports the parents\u2019 claim that the court was \u201cpunish[ing them] for not being perfect in the past and because it view[ed] the Guardians as \u2018better parents.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">We turn now to the parents\u2019 allegations against the guardians.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">In the trial court, mother asserted that the minor\u2019s adamant insistence that she wants the guardianship to continue was a matter of acting out because of the uncle\u2019s \u201calmost cult like\u201d \u201ccontrol and domination\u201d over her. On appeal, the parents say the guardians have been \u201cruthless mudslingers\u201d and argue the trial court \u201cdid not analyze the contemptuous, controlling and evasive conduct of the [g]uardians during the guardianship in relation to the [g]uardian\u2019s fitness as it should have . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">However, the parents\u2019 claim that the guardians have hindered their contacts with the minor and sabotaged their relationship consists of mere accusations without specific evidentiary support. The evidence credited by the trial court shows otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">The uncle testified the guardians had encouraged the minor to visit her parents and speak with them on the telephone. But, eventually, her telephone calls and visits with them caused her to feel harassed and upset. Exacerbating the problem, the parents felt they should be able to call whenever they wanted and expected the minor to listen for as long as they desired. As the minor became more involved in schoolwork, team sports, and social activities, she wanted to have more control over the telephone calls. Although the minor wanted to be able to talk with and visit her parents, she began putting restrictions on the days and times when the parents could call. The uncle also testified the minor\u2019s personal visits with her parents were often unpleasant, and the minor wanted more flexibility with respect to visitation. The minor told the court investigator that she wanted some discretion with respect to visits and that she thought more frequent but shorter visits might be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>It appears that after the parents filed the petition to terminate the guardianship and refused to relent in their efforts, their relationship with the minor deteriorated to the point that she refused to talk to them until ordered to do so by the court. Letters the minor wrote to the parents during this time reflect that the breakdown in their relationship was the result of the parents\u2019 conduct rather than the guardians\u2019 influence. Among other things, the minor was adamant about not wanting to leave what she considers her home and where her church, school, friends, and pets are. She was angry that the parents continued to insist that she has dyslexia and needs special classes. She was angry that the parents continually said bad things about the guardians, her school, and the like. She was unhappy with the parents pressuring her to return to their custody. Saying she did not like \u201cbeing manipulated, guilt tripped, or yelled at,\u201d the minor told her parents: \u201cI am fifteen, and have my own thoughts, ideas, and opinions.\u201d She added: \u201cI realy [sz'c] want to get along with you, and visit you, but the way things have been doesn\u2019t work. You need to respect me, and treat me as a person not a pet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">In light of the whole record, it is readily apparent that the parents, not the guardians, have caused the problems in the parents\u2019 relationship with the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Much of the parents\u2019 attack on the guardians is directed to the minor\u2019s schooling while in the guardians\u2019 care.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">They say the minor suffers from dyslexia and, despite the parents\u2019 efforts, the guardians have ignored her dyslexia. This is another example of the parents\u2019 baseless allegations against the guardians. The evidence shows that when the minor was enrolled in school, a review of her cumulative file indicated a need for vision testing but made no suggestion of learning disabilities. Once she obtained a new prescription for glasses, her performance improved dramatically. After the petition to terminate the guardianship was filed and this issue arose, the minor was tested by an ophthalmologist and by the school district. The testing showed the minor is not dyslexic and in fact is an above average student.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The parents also are critical of the school in which the guardians enrolled the minor. They claim the school will not prepare her for higher education and that the guardians have ignored their objections to the school. The evidence paints another picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">While in the parents\u2019 custody, the minor attended public school through the fourth grade. Mother home-schooled the minor for the fifth and sixth grades. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>When the minor began living with the guardians near the end of her sixth grade year, the guardians took over home-schooling. The uncle was shocked at the minor\u2019s poor level of proficiency. The guardians worked with her intensely through the remainder of the school year and enrolled her in summer sessions. The uncle then learned of a public school program that would suit the minor\u2019s needs, but there were no openings in the program. Thus, the uncle sought to enroll the minor in a private school, but it would take her only for the fifth grade on a probationary basis. Instead, the uncle enrolled the minor in another private school where she would be able to work at her tested levels without the stigma of being put in a grade that was one year below her age level.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The uncle testified he discussed the matter with the parents and, at the time, they were in favor of the school. The principal of the school testified it is college preparatory and 98 percent of its graduates go on to attend college. During the three years the minor spent at the school, she made dramatic improvement and was able to catch up to grade level. By the time of the hearing on motion to terminate the guardianship, the minor was enrolled in high school and had achieved a 3.3 grade point average during her first quarter of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">This evidence shows the guardians did not neglect the minor\u2019s educational needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The parents also attack the trial court, claiming they got \u201chome-towned\u201d by a biased judge who gave \u201cinappropriate legal deference to local parties, witnesses, lawyers and experts.\u201d According to the parents, bias is demonstrated in what they characterize as the judge\u2019s \u201cinsulting comments\u201d against them in the statement of decision where the judge said: \u201cIt appears that the parents are placing their desires above the best interest of their child. Any new circumstances which might point to justification to terminate a guardianship must be sufficient enough to overcome the inherent disruption of tearing a child away from a guardian who has been and is doing a good job of caring for and nurturing the child. To terminate this guardianship at this time based on the facts presented would be detrimental in every sense of the word to L[]. It is unfortunate the parents fail to recognize this fact.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>This claim of judicial bias is utterly reckless. It was the trial judge\u2019s duty to consider and pass upon the evidence presented to him. An opinion formed by a judge as the result of a judicial hearing, even though it is adverse to a party, does not amount to bias. <em>(People v. Yeager </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 374, 391 [10 Cal.Rptr. 829, 359 P.2d 261], overruled on another ground in <em>People v. Chi Ko Wong </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 698, 716, fn. 14 [135 Cal.Rptr. 392, 557 P.2d 976]; <em>Kreling </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 305, 311-312 [153 P.2d 734].) The judge\u2019s observation was an appropriate comment on the evidence that he found to be credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The parents also claim the judge was biased because throughout the trial, he \u201centertained testimony from incompetent witnesses . . . .\u201d However, the parents make no effort to identify the allegedly incompetent witnesses or to demonstrate why they were incompetent. In fact, the witnesses who testified in support of continuing the guardianship included two of mother\u2019s sisters, one of mother\u2019s adult sons, and the son\u2019s girlfriend who had lived in mother\u2019s home shortly before the guardianship was established. These witnesses, as well as the guardians and the principal of the school the minor had attended for three years, had personal first-hand knowledge of matters about which they testified and thus were competent witnesses. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 702.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In conclusion, the trial court correctly determined that the guardianship should not be terminated simply because the parents were in a position to provide food, clothing, and shelter; rather, the totality of the circumstances must be considered. Substantial evidence establishes that at the time of the hearing, mother still had a severe anger control problem reflected in screaming, yelling, hitting, and throwing things. Father still had a drinking problem and engaged in lengthy, often hours-long, screaming matches with mother. It appeared the parents did not even recognize, let alone attempt to deal with, these problems. In addition, when the minor first went to live with the guardians, she was in rather poor physical, emotional, and educational condition. By the time of the hearing, the minor had lived with the guardians for nearly four years. During that time, she had thrived in all areas of her life. The minor was of the age and reasoning capacity to be entitled to have her views considered (see Fam. Code, \u00a7 3042, subd. (a)), and she adamantly opposed termination of the guardianship. Under the circumstances, the trial court did not err in concluding that it was in the minor\u2019s best interest not to terminate the guardianship because doing so would be detrimental to the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Blease, J., and Cantil-Sakauye, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May, 10, 2006, S142034.
