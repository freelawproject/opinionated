Mother asserts the court abused its discretion in denying her section 388 petition by disregarding significant factors that compelled either the child\u2019s return to mother\u2019s custody or further family reunification services. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Mother further asserts the court erred in terminating parental rights because the parental relationship exception under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(A) applies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Mother was 15 years old and a dependent child of the court when she gave birth to Aaliyah in January 2002. After her birth, Aaliyah resided with mother at St. Anne\u2019s Group Home (St. Anne\u2019s), a residential placement with specialized services for teens who are pregnant or have children.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The record indicates a long period of unstable behavior by mother, not the least of which was her neglect and refusal to take care of Aaliyah, despite the juvenile court\u2019s extensive efforts to avert loss of mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In August 2002, when Aaliyah was seven months old, the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (Department) filed a petition under section 300, subdivision (b) on Aaliyah\u2019s behalf. The petition as amended alleged that mother was a minor herself and had only a limited ability to care for her child and that she had left Aaliyah unattended without adult supervision and in a poor state of hygiene.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court ordered Aaliyah to be detained in foster care with monitored visits for mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The Department provided documentary evidence, supported by mother\u2019s admissions, that she was frustrated with caring for her baby, screamed at and neglected the baby, had limited ability to care for the baby, was chronically noncompliant with placement rules and regulations and needed work with anger management in relation to her peers.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">In October 2002, the juvenile court found the amended petition to be true and declared Aaliyah a dependent of the juvenile court. The court ordered six months of reunification services for mother and ordered her to attend individual counseling to address case issues including anger management. The court allowed weekly monitored visits between mother and Aaliyah and gave the Department discretion to liberalize and increase the visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">At mother\u2019s request, Aaliyah was placed in the home of Mildred J. (Mildred), who was an extended family member and then caretaker of mother\u2019s sister. At this time, St. Anne\u2019s was providing mother with a number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>of services, including parenting education, individual and group counseling, 24-hour medical care, 24-hour staff support, sex education and family planning, individual educational counseling, an on-site school, food, a clothing allowance, passes for visits with Aaliyah as well as with mother\u2019s family and transportation assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In March 2003, the Department reported to the court that Mildred had asked the Department to remove Aaliyah and her aunt from Mildred\u2019s home after mother made unfounded allegations that Mildred was neglecting Aaliyah. The Department reported that mother was showing overall improvement, but she was not complying with the rules and regulations at her placement. She continued to have issues with anger management, of going AWOL (absent without leave) and inappropriate interaction with her peers. During this period, mother had monitored visits with Aaliyah and had begun attending to Aaliyah\u2019s needs during the visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In June 2003, mother\u2019s case manager at St. Anne\u2019s testified that although mother\u2019s behavior had recently improved, her behavior was inconsistent and she had been \u201cstruggling.\u201d Nonetheless, the court found that mother had made substantial progress towards alleviating and mitigating the causes that had required Aaliyah\u2019s placement. Over the Department\u2019s objections, the juvenile court ordered Aaliyah to be placed with mother and ordered the Department to provide mother with further family maintenance services.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The court imposed several conditions in placing Aaliyah with mother: mother was to remain at St. Anne\u2019s, continue in its structured program of parenting, participate in \u201cmommy and me\u201d classes and continue to attend Alateen meetings. The court determined the permanent plan would be Aaliyah\u2019s return to the home of her mother with termination of jurisdiction as the goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Mother, however, did not do well after Aaliyah returned to her care. Approximately four months later, in October 2003, the Department filed a supplemental juvenile dependency petition alleging mother was unable to continue caring for Aaliyah. Mother had again neglected Aaliyah and then reportedly had gone AWOL with her, only to call a relative the following day to request that she come and get the child. Mother told the social worker she wanted Aaliyah back in foster care and no longer wanted to care for the child. The juvenile court ordered Aaliyah to be detained in shelter care and ordered the Department to provide mother with monitored visits and family reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">In early December 2003, the Department reported that mother had gone AWOL from St. Anne\u2019s in November 2003 and was still AWOL as of the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>of the report. The report detailed numerous instances of mother\u2019s neglecting Aaliyah. Mother had told other residents she wanted her freedom, was frustrated with Aaliyah and was going to have Aaliyah taken away. Mother told staff members she wanted to \u201cgive Aaliyah back.\u201d She told another resident that she \u201cloved her new boyfriend so much that she couldn\u2019t keep Aaliyah and be with him.\u201d The court modified its June 2003 order and directed that Aaliyah remain a dependent and suitably placed in shelter care.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">In January 2004, the court sustained an amended supplemental petition stating that mother was unable to continue to provide ongoing care for her child. The court found the previous court disposition had not been effective in Aaliyah\u2019s \u201crehabilitation or protection.\u201d The court allowed mother a minimum of twice weekly two-hour monitored visits with her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In March 2004, the juvenile court determined mother had only inconsistently complied with the case plan and terminated mother\u2019s reunification services because the time for such services had run. However, over the Department\u2019s objection, the court ordered the Department to provide mother with \u201cfamily reunification like\u201d services. The court terminated its June 2003 \u201chome of parent-mother\u201d order and directed that Aaliyah be suitably placed. The court allowed mother visits of \u201cno less than twice a week or as frequent as possible in a neutral setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">From March 2004 to May 2004, mother regularly visited Aaliyah without incident. She behaved appropriately with the child and was attentive, alert and nurturing. However, the Department reported to the court that mother\u2019s current caregiver had reported behavioral problems with mother leading to the possibility mother would need a new placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The court convened a number of permanency planning hearings under section 366.26. For a permanency planning hearing in July 2004, the Department reported that Aaliyah, then two years old, was a happy, smiling, talkative, highly intelligent and easily engaged child. The foster mother had considered adopting Aaliyah, but she decided against doing so because of the possibility of having future contact with mother. Mother initially had visited her child consistently but for the last two months had frequently failed to show up for visits or to call and cancel. The Department reported that the inconsistency in mother\u2019s visitation had traumatized Aaliyah emotionally and psychologically because she was old enough to associate the visitation site with an expectation of seeing her mother. Mother again had told the social worker that she did not want to take care of Aaliyah and wished to have her adopted. Mother had also called the former foster mother, Mildred, and asked her to adopt Aaliyah. The Department informed the court that Mildred was now willing to provide a permanent home for Aaliyah under a permanent plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>of adoption and to allow mother to visit the child after adoption so long as mother behaved appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In September 2004, the juvenile court had a second permanency planning hearing. For the hearing, the Department further reported that mother was temporarily in a group home but would not be allowed to stay past her impending 18th birthday due to her inappropriate behavior, lack of motivation and chronically going AWOL. Since the court\u2019s visitation order in March 2004, mother had vacillated between \u201cconsistency and total non-compliance.\u201d Mother had made only a fraction of the minimum number of allowed visits to Aaliyah and frequently had failed to show up or call. Pursuant to court order, the Department had made arrangements for mother and Aaliyah to participate in a parent and child interactive program. The provider had reported that mother had attended only three of eight scheduled visits. The court admonished mother about her lack of compliance, stating: \u201cYou are doing practically nothing. You are sitting at home watching TV. Are you seriously trying to get your child back? You better get more serious about it[,] young lady. You go out and get a job and you go to school on a regular basis.\u201d The court authorized the Department to gradually transition Aaliyah back into Mildred\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In October 2004, the court held a third permanency planning hearing. Mother again was AWOL and did not appear. The Department reported that mother was now 18 years of age and residing in the unauthorized home of her maternal grandmother, in whose custody mother had conceived Aaliyah. Mother was three months pregnant with a second child, and the expected baby\u2019s father (Davione M.) was incarcerated for possession of a firearm. The Department informed the court that Mildred was now a licensed foster caretaker and still willing to adopt Aaliyah. The court ordered Aaliyah to be placed in Mildred\u2019s home and ordered the Department to complete a home study for Mildred. The matter was continued to January 2005 for another permanency planning hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In January 2005, the court held a fourth permanency planning hearing and set a contested permanency planning hearing for March 2005 to determine whether adoption, long-term foster care or guardianship should be the appropriate plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">In March 2005, mother filed a section 388 petition seeking modification of the court\u2019s March 2004 order terminating her family reunification services and setting a hearing on selection and implementation of a permanent plan. Mother asked the juvenile court to either return Aaliyah to mother\u2019s custody or grant mother further reunification services. In the event the court denied such relief, mother requested that the court order a bonding study to aid in her contest of the permanency plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Mother alleged changed circumstances, stating that she had returned to St. Anne\u2019s in late December 2004 and had since been complying with its rules and programs. She also alleged that she was addressing her parenting and case issues through individual therapy and had visited Aaliyah during the last month. She indicated that she was successfully attending school and working toward a high school diploma. She further had taken or completed independent living skills classes, and St. Anne\u2019s was willing to facilitate appropriate living arrangements for Aaliyah.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The court set mother\u2019s petition for modification for a hearing to be held in April 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In March 2005, for the fifth section 366.26 hearing, the Department informed the court that Aaliyah was doing very well in Mildred\u2019s home. She was developing on target and appeared mentally and emotionally stable. A further report indicated a home study had been completed on Mildred, and the child appeared to be well bonded with her. In an interim review report, the Department also noted that Aaliyah appeared to be thriving in Mildred\u2019s care and was now calling Mildred \u201cmom.\u201d Mildred was providing the child with a nurturing, stable environment. The child appeared to be well dressed, well groomed, happy and healthy. The Department reported that since Aaliyah\u2019s placement with Mildred in December 2004, mother had visited the child four times, in February and March 2005. Before that, when Aaliyah was in her prior foster home, mother had not visited from September 2004 to December 2004. The Department recommended that the court deny mother\u2019s section 388 petition and terminate parental rights. The court further continued the permanency planning hearing to April 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The juvenile court heard mother\u2019s section 388 petition on April 7 and 8, 2005. Mother did not testify at the hearing regarding her changed circumstances as the court found there was no good cause to merit hearing her direct testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In lieu of her testimony, mother submitted her written declaration as documentary evidence. In her declaration, mother stated that she had \u201cbecome a responsible, respectable woman\u201d who wanted the opportunity to care for and \u201cbe a role model for my daughter.\u201d She stated she had made significant changes in her life and was now ready to take care of her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">On April 8, 2005, after considering mother\u2019s declaration, the juvenile court denied mother\u2019s petition, indicating her declaration only served to show \u201chow much time she has wasted in her life.\u201d The court also denied mother\u2019s request for reunification services and further request to either place Aaliyah with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>mother or change the child\u2019s placement. However, over the Department\u2019s objections, the court continued the permanency planning hearing and ordered a bonding study to be performed for the specific purpose of determining whether termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The appointed psychologist, Dr. Daniel Kramon, submitted a bonding study pursuant to the juvenile court\u2019s order. Dr. Kramon personally interviewed mother and observed Aaliyah and mother interacting at his office. He noted Aaliyah had spent a substantial amount of time in three homes over the course of her young life. She spent approximately the first seven months of her life with mother, six months with Mildred, 14 months with foster mother Ms. S., five months with mother again, one month with Ms. S. after that and, finally, the last five months with Mildred. In Dr. Kramon\u2019s opinion, it was reasonable to conclude that during each of these placements, some type of bond was formed with each primary caretaker. He observed that mother related to Aaliyah in a \u201cloving, natural, engaging and thoroughly appropriate manner,\u201d but it was likely Aaliyah had also formed a \u201cclose bond\u201d with Mildred and Mildred\u2019s two granddaughters that resided in her home. He opined it was likely that Aaliyah\u2019s closest bond existed with \u201cthe caretaker with whom she has resided for the last several months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Dr. Kramon concluded that, although there apparently was an \u201caffectionate closeness\u201d between Aaliyah and her mother, \u201cthe basic link of trust that is imperative for a close bond does not exist to the extent that it likely exists between Aaliyah and Mildred.\u201d He admitted this conclusion had an \u201cassumptive aspect\u201d because he had not been able to observe the child and Mildred together.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dr. Kramon thought Aaliyah was progressing well and was likely thriving in Mildred\u2019s home. He stated that \u201cto remove her from this home, especially at a stage in her development where she has acquired a high degree of communication and relating skills, could be emotionally deleterious for her.\u201d He believed if parental rights were terminated, there might be some \u201cdisappointment\u201d on Aaliyah\u2019s part because she reportedly looked forward to contacts with mother, but it would not be substantially detrimental to Aaliyah as she had only limited contact with mother since October 2003. On the other hand, if Aaliyah were to be removed from Mildred\u2019s home, where she felt safe and secure, there likely would be a \u201csignificant risk\u201d of emotional or psychological distress as well as a further disruption to the bonding process that could result in serious emotional harm. Dr. Kramon concluded the benefits of Aaliyah\u2019s remaining in a secure and loving home outweighed the consequences of terminating parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>On May 26, 2005, the juvenile court held the sixth and final hearing on the selection of a permanent plan. Mother\u2019s new baby boy was one and one-half months old at this time and placed with her at St. Anne\u2019s. Mother testified she had moved into St. Anne\u2019s in December 2004 and had resumed visiting Aaliyah in February 2005. Mother admittedly did not visit Aaliyah from September 2004 to February 2005, stating she was \u201cgoing through a lot of problems.\u201d She stated she had been \u201cimmature\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking about anyone at the time but myself.\u201d She had asked Mildred to adopt Aaliyah because she thought she \u201cdidn\u2019t have a chance of getting [Aaliyah] back.\u201d Mother believed she had matured since then and opposed the permanent plan of adoption because she did not want Aaliyah to feel abandoned as she herself had felt and did not wish Aaliyah to believe mother had chosen the new baby over Aaliyah.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Based on the entire case file, the court found by clear and convincing evidence that Aaliyah was adoptable and it was likely the child would be adopted. The court accordingly ordered parental rights terminated. The court further determined that mother had not proved the parental relationship exception under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(A) because the court found that mother\u2019s \u201cinconsistent pattern of visitation\u201d did not satisfy the visitation requirement and that the termination of parental rights would result in no detriment to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Mother filed a timely notice of appeal from the orders denying her section 388 petition and terminating parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">1. <em>The Juvenile Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Denying Mother\u2019s Section 388 Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Mother contends the juvenile court abused its discretion in denying her section 388 petition because she met the established factors mandating the court to either return Aaliyah to her custody or to grant mother additional reunification services. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Section 388 states in pertinent part that a parent may \u201cupon grounds of change of circumstances or new evidence, petition the court... for a hearing to change, modify, or set aside any order of court previously made or to terminate the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d (\u00a7 388, subd. (a).) The juvenile court may modify an order if a parent shows, by a preponderance of the evidence, changed circumstances or new evidence and that the modification would promote the best interests of the child. <em>(In re Michael B. </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1698, 1703 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 290].) This is determined by the seriousness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>reason for the dependency and the reason the problem was not overcome; the relative strength of the parent-child and child-caretaker bonds and the length of time the child has been in the system; and the nature of the change in circumstances, the ease by which the change could be achieved, and the reason the change was not made sooner. <em>(In re Amber M. </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 681, 685 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 19]; <em>In re Kimberly F. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 519, 530-531 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 495].) Whether an order should be modified rests within the sound discretion of the juvenile court, and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>(In re Jasmon O. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 398, 415 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 85, 878 P.2d 1297]; <em>In re Stephanie M. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 295, 318 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 595, 867 P.2d 706] <em>(Stephanie M.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The record in this case indicates that the reason for the dependency was very serious and, even though mother indicated an awareness of the nature of the problems and took responsibility for them, she had made little actual progress in addressing the causes of Aaliyah\u2019s dependency. Although mother and child appeared to have developed a bond during their periods together, by this time Aaliyah had been in foster care for longer than her times with mother, and the indications were that she had well bonded with her prospective adoptive mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Mother argues that, in the short period between December 2004 and April 2005, she showed a \u201clegitimate,\u201d \u201cgenuine\u201d and \u201clasting\u201d change of circumstances. Mother attributes the dependency action solely to her immaturity and young age, which she claims \u201cessentially ended in December 2004, after mother grew up.\u201d The juvenile court clearly did not find that mother had shown a genuine change of circumstances. After hearing testimony from a St. Anne\u2019s counselor regarding mother\u2019s most current efforts, the court concluded \u201cthere has been no indication that the indicated denial of the [section] 388 [petition] should change.\u201d After reviewing mother\u2019s three-and-a-half page-long, single-spaced declaration in support of her claimed changed circumstances, the court further concluded mother\u2019s recitation only established \u201chow much time she has wasted in her life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The record is replete with evidence supporting the court\u2019s determination. Indeed, mother acknowledges she did not have a \u201cperfect\u201d record and had displayed unstable behavior throughout this case. Such behavior admittedly included a refusal to take care of Aaliyah, going AWOL numerous times from St. Anne\u2019s and other placements, refusal to comply with the rules of her placements, refusal to attend school counseling, refusal to take her prescribed medication, and inability to get along with peers and staff at her different placements, among other more serious inappropriate behavior. That mother may have had a last-minute change of heart during the last brief months of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>long saga of poor choices, inappropriate behavior and refusals to care for her daughter is not compelling evidence of a \u201clegitimate,\u201d \u201cgenuine\u201d or \u201clasting\u201d change of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Nevertheless, mother argues she maintained a strong bond with Aaliyah, compelling the juvenile court to grant her section 388 petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The record establishes, however, that the child had also bonded well with her prior foster mother and with her present caretaker and prospective adoptive parent, Mildred. Moreover, when mother filed her petition for modification the child had already lived in foster care far longer than the two short periods she had lived with mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Mother contends her problem was one of \u201cimmaturity\u201d that was \u201ceasily\u201d ameliorated or fully eliminated with her \u201ccoming of age.\u201d She argues she had been stable after returning to St. Anne\u2019s in December 2004, as demonstrated by 14 positive behavior reports from late December 2004 to early March 2005.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the court could reasonably infer from such reports that mother had yet to demonstrate she could consistently handle the responsibilities of caring for herself and two children. Mother\u2019s problems, especially her poor behavior choices, were recurrent throughout the entire case, and there was little evidence to indicate the recent improvements were genuine, permanent or would lead to mother\u2019s taking on responsibilities as a parent. Mother\u2019s declaration indicated she understood what behavior was required of her as a parent, but, as the court observed, \u201cwhether or not she does those things is quite another issue . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">After reunification services have been terminated, the parents\u2019 interest in the care, custody and companionship of the child are no longer of overriding concern. <em>(Stephanie M., supra, 7 </em>Cal.4th at p. 317.) The focus then shifts to the child\u2019s need for permanency and stability, and there is a rebuttable presumption that continued foster care is in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>(Ibid.; In re Marilyn H. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 295, 309 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 851 P.2d 826].) The juvenile court quite properly looked to Aaliyah\u2019s need for permanency and stability in denying mother\u2019s petition for modification of its prior orders. When, as here, the permanent plan is adoption, that presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>is even more difficult to overcome. <em>(In re Angel B. </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 454, 464 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 482].)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">2. <em>The Juvenile Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Finding the Parental Relationship Exception to Termination of Parental Rights Did Not Apply</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Mother contends the juvenile court erred in terminating parental rights because she met her burden of proving the parental relationship exception to termination of parental rights under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(A) applied and because insufficient evidence supported the court\u2019s finding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">As mother recognizes, the party claiming an exception to adoption has the burden of proof of establishing by a preponderance of evidence that the exception applies. <em>(In re Melvin A. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1243, 1252 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 844]; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1463(e)(3).) We review the juvenile court\u2019s decision whether to apply the parental relationship exception to termination of parental rights for abuse of discretion. <em>(In re Jasmine D. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1339, 1348-1349 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 644] <em>(Jasmine D.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1), if the juvenile court finds by clear and convincing evidence that a child is adoptable, it will terminate parental rights unless it finds termination would be detrimental because of one of five listed exceptions. Under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(A), the court may forego adoption and refrain from terminating parental rights only if a parent has maintained regular visitation and contact with the child <em>and </em>the child would benefit from continuing the relationship. To trigger the application of the parental relationship exception, the parent must show the parent-child relationship is sufficiently strong that the child would suffer detriment from its termination. <em>(In re Beatrice M. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1411, 1418 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 162] <em>(Beatrice M.) </em>[loss of mere \u201cfrequent and loving\u201d contact with parent insufficient to show detriment].) The benefit to the child from continuing such a relationship must also be such that the relationship \u201c \u2018promotes the well-being of the child to such a degree as to outweigh the well-being the child would gain in a permanent home with new, adoptive parents.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid., quoting <em>In re Autumn H. </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 567, 576 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 535] <em>(Autumn H.).) </em>A child who is determined to be a dependent of the juvenile court should not be deprived of an adoptive parent when the natural parent has maintained a relationship that may benefit the child to some degree but does not meet the child\u2019s need for a parent. <em>(Jasmine D., supra, </em>78 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Cal.App.4th at p. 1350.) Adoption, when possible, is the permanent plan preferred by the Legislature if it is likely the child will be adopted. <em>(Autumn H., </em>at p. 573.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Here, the juvenile court specifically found mother\u2019s \u201cinconsistent pattern of visitation\u201d failed to satisfy the first prong of the exception. Mother concedes her visits with Aaliyah were not regular until February 2005. By mother\u2019s own admission, therefore, mother cannot and did not establish that she had maintained regular visitation with her child. <em>(Autumn H., supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 575.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Mother also failed to satisfy the second prong of the analysis since she did not show her bond with Aaliyah was sufficiently strong that the child would suffer detriment from its termination. The court\u2019s balancing of competing considerations must be performed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account variables such as the child\u2019s age, the portion of the child\u2019s life spent in the parent\u2019s custody, the positive or negative effect of interaction between the parent and child and the child\u2019s individualized needs. <em>(Jasmine D., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1349-1350; <em>Autumn H., supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 575-576.) When the court made its termination order in May 2005, Aaliyah was only three years old. She had spent more time living in foster care than with mother and had not lived with mother since October 2003. Although Dr. Kramon\u2019s bonding study indicated an \u201caffectionate closeness\u201d between the child and mother, Aaliyah had also closely bonded with Mildred, whom she called \u201cmother.\u201d Mildred provided her with a \u201csafe, secure and trusting\u201d environment. Dr. Kramon had concluded that even though Aaliyah would be \u201cdisappointed\u201d in not being with mother, she would not suffer substantial detriment from the termination of parental rights. More importantly, Dr. Kramon opined there could be a significant risk Aaliyah would suffer emotional or psychological distress, as well as further disruption to the bonding process, were the child to be removed from Mildred\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">There was, on the other hand, no evidence that severing the relationship with mother would harm Aaliyah to any extent, much less cause grievous detriment. Mother\u2019s \u201caffectionate closeness\u201d with Aaliyah does not equate to the type of \u201c \u2018benefit from a continuing relationship\u2019 \u201d contemplated by the statute. <em>(Beatrice M., supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1418-1419.) Mother had not occupied a parental role in relation to Aaliyah for quite some time. Mildred, moreover, had expressed a willingness to allow mother to continue visiting Aaliyah after adoption so long as mother acted appropriately. Mother thus could conceivably maintain the same affectionate closeness should mother continue with her rehabilitation after the child\u2019s adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">We cannot say the court abused its discretion in concluding that a mere \u201caffectionate closeness\u201d between parent and child during occasional visits was outweighed by the child\u2019s close bond with her primary caregiver and need for a permanent and stable home environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Cooper, R J., and Boland, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-12\"> All further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-11\"> Section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(A) provides an exception to termination of parental rights when parents \u201chave maintained regular visitation and contact with the child and the child would benefit from continuing the relationship.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b348-12\"> Aaliyah\u2019s alleged 19-year-old father (Abel O.) was in jail for a firearm-related offense.
