The court found Benninghoff had been illegally practicing law by representing parties before federal and state agencies as a self-styled \u201clay representative.\u201d Benninghoff contends that laypeople may represent parties in state administrative hearings, and so this kind of representation must not constitute the practice of law. Because he was not practicing law, he argues, the court lacked any basis to assume jurisdiction over his lay practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">Benninghoff\u2019s conclusions do not follow from his premise. Representing parties in state administrative hearings constitutes the practice of law. As a \u201clay representative,\u201d Benninghoff used his legal knowledge to offer legal advice and counsel, prepare legal documents, and attempt to secure his clients\u2019 legal rights. If laypeople are allowed to engage in this kind of representation\u2014an issue we need not decide\u2014it would be an exception to the general rule that only active bar members may practice law. At most, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>exception would allow laypeople to practice law in state administrative hearings. It does not render this work anything other than the practice of law. By representing parties in state administrative hearings, Benninghoff practiced law in California\u2014something he has lost the right to do by reason of his resignation from the State Bar with disciplinary charges pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">But Benninghoff is correct on one point. The court could not assume jurisdiction over his federal practice, because federal regulations governing practice before federal courts and agencies preempt state law prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law. Thus, we grant his petition to this extent only.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In 1999, Benninghoff pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States and three other federal felonies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He resigned from the State Bar with disciplinary charges pending. In his resignation letter, Benninghoff \u201cacknowledge[d] that [he] will be ineligible to practice law or to advertise or hold [him]self out as practicing or as entitled to practice law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">No longer an active member of the State Bar, Benninghoff plied his trade outside the court system. He represented professional licensees in state administrative hearings and federal prisoners in prison transfer applications. He sent direct mail solicitations and operated Web sites advertising his services as a \u201cprofessional advocate.\u201d Eventually, the Medical Board of California (Medical Board) asked the State Bar to clarify whether Benninghoff could represent parties in its disciplinary hearings. While the State Bar investigated the matter, two administrative law judges ruled on petitions to disqualify Benninghoff from Medical Board hearings. Both judges found that Benninghoff was practicing law by representing parties in administrative hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The State Bar filed an application asking the court to assume jurisdiction over Benninghoff\u2019s practice. The court granted the order. Benninghoff petitioned for an extraordinary writ, and later filed a motion for a partial stay to allow him to continue representing federal prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">This is the first appellate opinion construing Business and Professions Code section 6180,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which authorizes a court to assume jurisdiction over the law practice of an attorney who \u201cdies, resigns, becomes an inactive member of the State Bar, is disbarred, or is suspended from the active practice of law . . . .\u201d One explanation for the dearth of appellate opinions is that an order granting an application to assume jurisdiction is not appealable; review may be sought only by a writ petition. (\u00a7 6180.13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The first issue we must address is the standard of review. As usual, we review the court\u2019s implied and express factual findings for substantial evidence, and review its statutory interpretation independently. (See <em>Winograd v. American Broadcasting Co. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 624, 632 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 378] [\u201cWhen the trial court has resolved a disputed factual issue, the appellate courts review the ruling according to the substantial evidence rule\u201d]; see also <em>Harbor Island Holdings v. Kim </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 790, 794 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 406] [questions of law reviewed de novo].)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">But the ultimate determination to assume jurisdiction over a law practice rests in the court\u2019s discretion. The statute says the court <em>\u201cmay </em>make an order assuming jurisdiction\u201d if the lawyer dies or ceases active membership in the State Bar. (\u00a7 6180.5, italics added; accord, <em>In re Richard E. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 349, 354 [146 Cal.Rptr. 604, 579 P.2d 495] [\u201cThe ordinary import of \u2018may\u2019 is a grant of discretion\u201d].) Also, we imagine that when most lawyers die or resign, clients usually pick up their files and obtain new counsel without court intervention. The court\u2019s decision to assume jurisdiction over a practice to protect the clients is akin to a decision to appoint a receiver, which calls for the exercise of discretion. <em>(City and County of San Francisco v. Daley </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 734, 744 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 256].) Thus, we will review the order assuming jurisdiction over Benninghoff\u2019s practice for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\n<em>Benninghoff May Not Represent Parties in State Administrative Hearings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Benninghoff contends that laypeople may represent parties in state administrative hearings. He relies on various sections of the Administrative Procedure Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11370 et seq.; hereinafter APA) that refer to a party\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u201cattorney or other authorized representative.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also relies on several regulations that refer to a party\u2019s \u201ccounsel or other representative.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The State Bar hedges its bet on the question. In its brief, it assumes for the sake of argument that laypeople may represent parties in state administrative hearings. But it also directs our attention to the Medical Board\u2019s amicus curiae brief filed below, which contended that laypeople have no such right. The Medical Board relied primarily on Government Code section 11509. This statute requires agencies to notify parties that they \u201chave the right to be represented by an attorney at [their] own expense,\u201d but makes no mention of any right to be represented by a layperson. It also relied on other APA sections referring to a party\u2019s attorney without mentioning any other kind of representative. It contends that the APA sections and regulations mentioning \u201cauthorized representatives\u201d or \u201cother representatives\u201d should be construed to refer to corporations, who have the right to represent themselves in agency hearings and must do so through a natural person: i.e., a \u201crepresentative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">We decline to resolve this issue. To decide this case, we need not resolve the broad question of whether laypeople in general may represent parties in state administrative agencies. Rather, we will assume that laypeople may do so, and turn to the specific question of whether Benninghoff may do so, too.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Our specific question arises because Benninghoff is not the typical layperson\u2014he used to be a lawyer. The statute prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law treats true laypeople differently than lawyers who have lost their bar membership. Section 6126, subdivision (a) addresses true laypeople. It provides that \u201c[a]ny person . . . practicing law who is not an active member of the State Bar, <em>or otherwise authorized pursuant to statute or court rule to practice law in this state </em>at the time of doing so, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d (Italics added.) Section 6126, subdivision (b) addresses lawyers like Benninghoff. It provides that \u201c[a]ny person who . . . has resigned from the State Bar with charges pending, and thereafter practices or attempts to practice law ... is guilty of a crime punishable by imprisonment in the state prison or county jail.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, a true layperson may practice law when \u201cauthorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>pursuant to statute or court rule\u201d; a defrocked lawyer like Benninghoff may not practice law at all. (\u00a76126, subds. (a) &amp; (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">This leads us to determine whether the representation of parties in state administrative hearings constitutes practicing law. The State Bar Act, section 6000 et seq., was enacted in 1927 to set forth \u201ca comprehensive scheme regulating the practice of law in the state.\u201d <em>(Birbrower, Montalbano, Condon &amp; Frank v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 119, 127 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 304, 949 P.2d 1] <em>(Birbrower).) </em>It provided that only active State Bar members may practice law, but did not itself define the term \u201cpractice law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 128.) Thus, as subsequent courts found, the State Bar Act implicitly adopted the common law definition of \u201cpractice law\u201d as \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe doing and performing services in a court of justice in any matter depending therein throughout its various stages and in conformity with the adopted rules of procedure. But in a larger sense, it includes legal advice and counsel and the preparation of legal instruments and contracts by which the legal rights are secured although such matter may or may not be depending in a court.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The California Supreme Court addressed what it means to \u201cpractice law\u201d in <em>Baron v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 535 [86 Cal.Rptr. 673, 469 P.2d 353] <em>(Baron). </em>There, the court held that the State Bar Act preempted a city ordinance governing lobbyists to the extent it purported to apply to lawyers practicing law. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 543-544.) Thus, it had to differentiate lawyers engaged in lobbying from lawyers engaged in practicing law. It conceded that \u201c[i]t is difficult to draw logical distinctions among the varied services performed by lawyers\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 542), and that \u201cascertaining whether a particular activity falls within this general definition [of the \u2018practice of law\u2019] may be a formidable endeavor.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 543.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Nonetheless, our Supreme Court had no difficulty resolving the \u201c[l]ess perplexing\u201d question of \u201cwhether participation on behalf of another in hearings and proceedings before a board or commission constitutes the practice of law.\u201d <em>(Baron, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 543.) \u201cThe cases uniformly hold that the character of the act, and not the place where it is performed, is the decisive element, and if the application of legal knowledge and technique is required, the activity constitutes the practice of law, even if conducted before an administrative board or commission.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>We conclude that Benninghoff practiced law by representing parties in state administrative hearings. By his own admission, he \u201cmade numerous appearances before various administrative and regulatory agencies in the State of California.\u201d The record suggests that, as part of his \u201clay\u201d practice, he analyzed agency disciplinary guidelines, advised clients how to defend against disciplinary charges, responded to discovery requests, prepared hearing books and declarations, and examined witnesses at hearings. In representing a client before the California Nursing Board, he advised her what her best defense would be and the evidence needed to support her defense, prepared declarations, requested a continuance, prepared her to testify, \u201cbegan trial preparation,\u201d and negotiated a settlement. Benninghoff thus gave legal advice to his clients and prepared legal documents attempting to secure their legal rights, which called for the application of his \u201clegal knowledge and technique.\u201d <em>(Baron, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 543; see also <em>Birbrower, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 128.) This is the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We reject Benninghoff\u2019s suggestion that representing parties in state administrative hearings cannot constitute practicing law because laypeople (arguably) are allowed to do so. As we explained <em>ante, </em>the law differentiates between laypeople and defrocked lawyers. Lawyers who resign with disciplinary charges pending may not practice law, without exception. (\u00a7 6126, subd. (b).) In contrast, laypeople may practice law when \u201cauthorized pursuant to statute or court rule.\u201d (\u00a7 6126, subd. (a).) If the various APA sections and regulations that Benninghoff cites do in fact allow laypeople to represent parties in administrative hearings, they constitute the statutory authorization contemplated by section 6126, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Two early cases clarify the Legislature\u2019s prerogative to create statutory exceptions by which laypeople may practice law. In a pre-State Bar Act case, <em>In re Hittson </em>(1918) 39 Cal.App. 91 [178 P. 149], the court held that a disbarred attorney could represent parties in the justice courts, because at that time the Code of Civil Procedure allowed any person to represent a party in a justice court, and precluded disbarred attorneys only \u201c \u2018from practicing <em>as such attorney </em>....\u2019\u201d <em>(In re Hittson, </em>at pp. 92-93, italics added.) The court concluded that disbarment does no more than \u201ctake away the rights granted [to lawyers] by the order of admission to practice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 93.) But the court went on to state, \u201c[w]ithout doubt the [Legislature would have the right to provide that any person who had been disbarred from the practice of law should be ineligible to appear in a justice\u2019s court to represent another, and we venture the suggestion that such legislation is both appropriate and desirable.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Nine years later, the Legislature enacted the State Bar Act, which it later amended to include section 6126 barring defrocked lawyers from practicing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>In <em>Eagle Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1933) 217 Cal. 244 [18 P.2d 341] the Supreme Court allowed a layperson to recover attorney fees for his successful representation of an injured employee before the Industrial Accident Commission. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 248-249.) The parties did not dispute that \u201cthe services performed by [the layperson] in the prosecution of the claim before the Commission were legal services.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 247.) And the court noted that \u201cas a general rule, no one may practice law without a license.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>But it also noted that \u201c[exceptions to this general rule have been established and long recognized.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It then reviewed the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and concluded that \u201cthe [legislature has [therein] provided a further exception to the general rule, as to practice before the Industrial Accident Commission.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 248.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the APA allows lay representation, presumably it does so as another exception to the general rule against laypeople practicing law. It does not remove that representation from the practice of law, or invalidate the absolute bar against defrocked lawyers practicing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">We give little weight to the other sources upon which Benninghoff relies. He submitted an amicus curiae brief filed below by a law professor and an Attorney General opinion concluding that the APA allows lay representation. Neither source considered whether defrocked lawyers, as opposed to true laypeople, may represent parties in state administrative hearings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He also submitted a Legislative Counsel opinion, which did opine that defrocked lawyers may do so. But the opinion overlooked section 6126, subdivision (b), which bars defrocked lawyers from practicing law in California. Notably, the Attorney General and Legislative Counsel agreed that representing parties in state administrative hearings constitutes practicing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Thus, Benninghoff, whom the State Bar Act prohibits from practicing law, may not represent parties in state administrative hearings. This representation constitutes the practice of law, from which defrocked lawyers are categorically barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Our conclusion is bolstered by public policy considerations. Benninghoff was convicted of four federal felonies, including conspiracy to defraud the United States and making false statements. Disbarment was an inevitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>formality, as \u201cthe Supreme Court shall summarily disbar\u201d an attorney convicted of any felony requiring the specific intent to defraud or make false statements. (\u00a7 6102, subd. (c).) In addition, his offenses were crimes of moral turpitude, which is an independent basis for summary disbarment. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>In re Lesansky </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 11, 16 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 409, 17 P.3d 764] [offense reveals moral turpitude if it \u201cshows a deficiency in any character trait necessary for the practice of law (such as trustworthiness, honesty, [or] candor)\u201d].) \u201cMoral turpitude has been defined by many authorities as an act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellowmen, or to society in general.\u201d <em>(In re Craig </em>(1938) 12 Cal.2d 93, 97 [82 P.2d 442].) Benninghoff avoided the indignity of actual disbarment only by resigning from the State Bar with disciplinary charges pending. Nonetheless, he suffers the same disqualifications as a bar member who has been tried on disciplinary charges and found wanting. (\u00a7 6126, subd. (b).) He is unfit to practice law; he has forfeited the privilege of speaking for others under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">As our Supreme Court noted shortly after the State Bar Act passed, \u201c[attorneys and counselors at law . . . have for centuries been required to undergo certain courses of preparation and to assume certain solemn obligations . . . not only with respect to their relation to the courts, but also with regard to their relation to the public at large.\u201d <em>(State Bar of California v. Superior Court </em>(1929) 207 Cal. 323, 331 [278 P. 432].) The public interest must \u201cbe safeguarded against the ignorances or evil dispositions of those who may be masquerading beneath the cloak of the legal and supposedly learned and upright profession.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The public interest is best served by preventing Benninghoff from masquerading as a lay representative. Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in assuming jurisdiction over Benninghoff\u2019s practice before state administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\n<em>Section 6180.14 Does Not Exempt Benninghoff from the Court\u2019s Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">As a fallback position, Benninghoff contends that the court lacked authority to assume jurisdiction over his practice in any event. He notes that section 6180.14 provides, \u201c[t]his article does not apply to legal services rendered as an employee, or under a contract which does not create the relationship of lawyer and client.\u201d Benninghoff asserts that he falls within this exception because his written agreements with his clients disclaim any lawyer-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">We must therefore construe section 6180.14. \u201cOur primary objective in interpreting a statute is to determine and give effect to the underlying legislative intent,\u201d turning first to the statutory language. <em>(City of Brentwood v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Bd. </em>(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 714, 722 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 322].) \u201cNonetheless, it is also well recognized that \u2018[t]he literal meaning of the words of a statute may be disregarded to avoid absurd results or to give effect to manifest purposes that, in the light of the statute\u2019s legislative history, appear from its provisions considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kramer v. Intuit, Inc. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 574, 579 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 412] <em>(Kramer).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Section 6180.14 cannot withstand a literal reading. The exception it purports to create for \u201clegal services rendered . . . under a contract which does not create the relationship of lawyer and client\u201d is self-contradictory. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c \u2018When a party seeking legal advice consults an attorney at law and secures that advice, the relation of attorney and client is established <em>prima facie.\u2019 \u201d (People ex rel. Dept. of Corporations v. SpeeDee Oil Change Systems, Inc. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1135, 1148 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 816, 980 P.2d 371].) It is unclear what contracts, if any, would both (a) call for legal services to be provided, but (b) not create a lawyer-client relationship.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The exception cannot refer to contracts that do not create a lawyer-client relationship on the basis that the person providing legal services is no longer a lawyer. We must consider section 6180.14 \u201cin the context of the . . . statutory scheme of which it is a part.\u201d <em>(DuBois </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 382, 388 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 523, 853 P.2d 978].)  Section 6180 et seq. applies <em>only </em>to former lawyers. It ensures that their practices are properly wound up and that their clients will actually find new lawyers. (\u00a7\u00a7 6180.1, 6180.5; see also 1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1996) Attorneys, \u00a7 112, p. 149.) Indeed, \u201c[a]s used in this article, \u2018attorney\u2019 means a member <em>or former member </em>of the State Bar.\u201d (\u00a7 6180.14, italics added.) We cannot read section 6180.14 as creating an exception to section 6180 et seq. for former lawyers\u2014the precise people subject to that section in the first place.  \u201cIf . . . application of an apparently unambiguous statute would lead to an absurd result, the court can presume the Legislature did not intend the apparent meaning.\u201d <em>(Sanctity of Human Life Network </em>v. <em>California Highway Patrol </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 858, 866 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 708]; accord, <em>Kramer, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at pp. 578-579.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>And contrary to Benninghoff\u2019s suggestion, it cannot refer to contracts that require legal services to be provided but purport to disclaim any lawyer-client relationship. Such disclaimers are ineffective. (See State Bar Standing Com. on Prof. Responsibility, and Conduct, Formal Opn. No. 2004-165 [written disclaimer \u201cdoes not by itself prevent the existence of an attorney-client relationship\u201d].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A retention agreement is like any other contract creating a legal relationship: \u201c \u2018The nature of the instrument is not to be determined by what the parties called it. [Citation.] Its nature is to be determined by its legal effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rosen v. E.C. Losch Co. </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 324, 331-332 [44 Cal.Rptr. 377].) \u201cThe label placed by the parties on their relationship is not dispositive, and subterfuges are not countenanced.\u201d <em>(S.G. Borello &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 341, 349 [256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399]; accord, Civ. Code, \u00a7 3528 [\u201cThe law respects form less than substance\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Thus, whatever the exception of section 6180.14 may encompass, it does not apply to defrocked lawyers who unlawfully continue to practice law. It does not refer to contracts that would otherwise create a lawyer-client relationship, if only the lawyer had not been defrocked. And it does not refer to contracts that attempt to disclaim the existence of the very lawyer-client relationships that they in fact create.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">As shown <em>ante, </em>Benninghoff provided legal services to his clients by representing them in administrative hearings. His retention agreements with his clients therefore would have created lawyer-client relationships, if only Benninghoff had not resigned from the State Bar with disciplinary charges pending. We conclude that, for purposes of this section, Benninghoff has \u201cthe relationship of lawyer and client\u201d (\u00a7 6180.14) with the licensees he represents in administrative hearings. Thus, section 6180.14\u2019s exception does not apply to Benninghoff, regardless of the disclaimers in his retention agreements. As a defrocked lawyer who nonetheless continued to provide legal services to his clients, Benninghoff was subject to the court assuming jurisdiction over his practice. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\n<em>The Court May Not Assume Jurisdiction over Benninghoff\u2019s Federal Practice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">As discussed <em>ante, </em>state law bars Benninghoff from practicing law in California, including representing parties in administrative hearings. In his motion for a partial stay, Benninghoff contends that state law cannot interfere with his representation of federal prisoners seeking prison transfers from the U.S. Department of Justice. \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We must agree. \u201cThe [State Bar] Act does not regulate practice before United States courts.\u201d <em>(Birbrower, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 130.) Rather, \u201c[t]he State Bar Act and other statutes enacted for the purpose of regulating the practice of law in this state are applicable to our state courts only.\u201d <em>(In re McCue </em>(1930) 211 Cal. 57, 66 [293 P. 47].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">More broadly, state law cannot restrict the right of federal courts and agencies to control who practices before them. In <em>Sperry v. State of Florida </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 379 [10 L.Ed.2d 428, 83 S.Ct. 1322], the United States Supreme Court vacated a state court injunction prohibiting a layperson from representing parties in the U.S. Patent Office. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 381, 404.) The court conceded that patent prosecution constitutes the practice of law, and that Florida law validly prohibited laypeople from practicing law in the state. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 383.) But federal regulations allowing nonlawyers to prosecute patents preempted state laws barring the unlicensed practice of law. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 384-385.) The court concluded that a state \u201cmay not deny to those failing to meet its own qualifications the right to perform the functions within the scope of the federal authority.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 385; see also <em>Augustine v. Department of Veterans Affairs </em>(Fed.Cir. 2005) 429 F.3d 1334, 1339-1340 [\u201cstate law purporting to govern practice before a federal administrative agency would be invalid. [][]... [][] California has no authority to require that attorneys practicing before the [U.S. Merit Systems Protection] Board obtain a state license\u201d]; <em>In re Poole </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 222 F.3d 618, 620 [\u201cOnce federal admission is secured, a change in circumstances underlying state admission ... is \u2018wholly negligible\u2019 on the right to practice before a federal court\u201d].) Thus, the court erred by assuming jurisdiction over Benninghoff\u2019s federal practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The petition is granted in part. Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the court to modify its June 17, 2005 order to relinquish jurisdiction over Benninghoff\u2019s federal practice, and require the State Bar to return any seized materials regarding his federal practice. The order as modified is affirmed. The request for judicial notice is denied. In the interests of justice, each party shall bear its own costs in this writ proceeding. Finally, pursuant to rule 24(b)(3) of the California Rules of Court, and to promote the interests of justice, this decision is final in this court fifteen days after its filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">O\u2019Leary, Acting P.

(Vapnek et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Professional Responsibility (The Rutter Group 2005) \u00b6 3:46, p. 3-17.) Lawyers may also limit the scope of their representation to certain client matters without creating a lawyer-client relationship as to other matters. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 3:33, p. 3-10.) And they may decline a representation altogether, providing no legal services and creating no lawyer-client relationship at all. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 3:48, p. 3-19; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gionis </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1196, 1209-1212 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 456, 892 P.2d 1199].)

The legislative history notes that it is a misdemeanor for persons who are not active bar members or otherwise authorized to practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>law to hold themselves out as lawyers. (Legis Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 894 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) p. 2172.) This language mirrors the language of section 6126, subdivision (a), which applies to true laypeople, not defrocked lawyers. This suggests that section 6180 et seq., not section 6126.3, provides the appropriate statutory authorization for the court to assume jurisdiction over the practice of a defrocked lawyer who continues to practice law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
