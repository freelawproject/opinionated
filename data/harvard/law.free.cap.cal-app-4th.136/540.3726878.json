The trial court implicitly denied employee Ron Parker\u2019s motion to dismiss employer Progressive Concrete, Inc.\u2019s (Progressive) appeal of the Commissioner\u2019s award of unpaid sales commissions and, after a de novo bench trial, entered a judgment awarding him a lesser amount than the Commissioner\u2019s award. On appeal to this court, Parker contends that because section 98.2, subdivision (b) provides an employer filing an appeal \u201cshall\u201d post an undertaking in the amount of the Commissioner\u2019s award and Progressive did not do so, the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss Progressive\u2019s appeal of that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">During the period July 1996 through March 2001, Parker apparently was employed by both Progressive and Concrete Images International, Inc. (Concrete) (together Employers), as a sales coordinator. He was to be paid commissions for sales he obtained for each Employer based on agreed percentages depending on the amount of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">In May 2002 Parker filed a claim with the Commissioner against Employers for unpaid wages. Following an evidentiary hearing, the Commissioner issued an order dated August 19, 2004, awarding Parker $133,339.38 against Employers for unpaid wages, interest, and penalties. Two weeks before issuance of the Commissioner\u2019s order, Parker settled his claim against Concrete for $12,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">On September 3, Progressive filed a notice of appeal with the San Diego County Superior Court, requesting a section 98.2 de novo hearing of Parker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>claim for unpaid wages. Apparently shortly thereafter, Progressive filed an ex parte application for an order staying execution of the Commissioner\u2019s award and fixing the appeal bond at a reduced amount based on the $12,000 settlement between Parker and Concrete and other factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On or about September 15, the trial court apparently issued an order staying execution of the Commissioner\u2019s award, fixing the amount of the appeal bond at $122,339.38,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and gave Progressive until September 22 to post that bond to continue the stay of execution. The parties agree Progressive did not post the bond by September 22 (and has not since posted that bond). Parker did not file any request or motion for an order requiring Progressive to post a bond as a condition of proceeding with the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">On September 29, Parker filed a notice of ex parte application for shortened notice on motion to dismiss the appeal because Progressive did not timely post the appeal bond. The record on appeal does not contain a copy of the motion to dismiss, which should have been attached to Parker\u2019s ex parte application for shortened notice. On or about October 4, Progressive filed its opposition to Parker\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss.\u201d On or about October 7, Parker filed a reply to Progressive\u2019s opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">On or about October 1, Parker apparently filed a writ of execution and notice of levy under writ of execution against property of Progressive in the amount of $121,339.38. On or about October 5, Progressive filed an ex parte application for an order quashing or recalling Parker\u2019s writ of execution and notice of levy. On or about October 7, Parker filed his opposition to Progressive\u2019s ex parte application. The record on appeal does not contain an order in response to the application to quash or recall the writ of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On October 12, a de novo bench trial of Parker\u2019s claim for unpaid wages began. On November 18, the trial court entered judgment for Parker in the amount of $57,668.79 and on April 18, 2005, entered an amended judgment for Parker in the amount of $75,263.79.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Parker timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\n<em>Section 98.2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">If an employer does not pay wages in the amount, time or manner required by contract or statute, an employee may file an unpaid wage claim with the Commissioner pursuant to sections 98 through 98.8 and obtain an administrative \u201cBerman hearing.\u201d <em>(Smith v. Rae-Venter Law Group </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 345, 350 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 516, 58 P.3d 367]; <em>Cuadra </em>v. <em>Millan </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 855, 858 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 952 P.2d 704], disapproved on another ground in <em>Samuels </em>v. <em>Mix </em>(1999) 22 Cal.4th 1, 16, fn. 4 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 273, 989 P.2d 701].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Within 10 days after a party is served with notice of the Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award after a Berman hearing, that party \u201cmay seek review by filing an appeal to the superior court, where the appeal shall be heard de novo.\u201d (\u00a7 98.2, subd. (a).) \u201cThe timely filing of a notice of appeal forestalls the [Commissioner\u2019s decision, terminates his or her jurisdiction, and vests jurisdiction to conduct a hearing de novo in the appropriate court. [Citation.] If no party takes an appeal, the [Commissioner\u2019s decision will be deemed a judgment, final immediately and enforceable as a judgment in a civil action. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Post v. Palo/Haklar &amp; Associates </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 942, 947 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 4 P.3d 928].)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">\u201cAlthough denoted an \u2018appeal,\u2019 unlike a conventional appeal in a civil action, [the] hearing [by the trial court] under the Labor Code is de novo. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cA hearing <em>de novo </em>[under Labor Code section 98.2] literally means a new hearing,\u201d that is, a new trial.\u2019 [Citation.] The decision of the [Commissioner is \u2018entitled to no weight whatsoever, and the proceedings are truly \u201ca trial anew in the fullest sense.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] The decision of the trial court, after [a] de novo hearing, is subject to a conventional appeal to an appropriate appellate court. [Citation.] Review is of the facts presented to the trial court, which may include entirely new evidence. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Post v. Palo/Haklar &amp; Associates, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at pp. 947-948.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">In 2000, section 98.2, subdivision (b) was added and now provides: \u201c <em>Whenever an employer files an appeal pursuant to this section, the employer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>shall post an undertaking with the reviewing court in the amount of the order, decision, or award. </em>The undertaking shall consist of an appeal bond issued by a licensed surety or a cash deposit with the court in the amount of the order, decision, or award. The employer shall provide written notification to the other parties and the Labor Commissioner of the posting of the undertaking. The undertaking shall be on the condition that, if any judgment is entered in favor of the employee, the employer shall pay the amount owed pursuant to the judgment, and if the appeal is withdrawn or dismissed without entry of judgment, the employer shall pay the amount owed pursuant to the order, decision, or award of the Labor Commissioner unless the parties have executed a settlement agreement for payment of some other amount, in which case the employer shall pay the amount that the employer is obligated to pay under the terms of the settlement agreement. If the employer fails to pay the amount owed within 10 days of entry of the judgment, dismissal, or withdrawal of the appeal, or the execution of a settlement agreement, a portion of the undertaking equal to the amount owed, or the entire undertaking if the amount owed exceeds the undertaking, is forfeited to the employee.\u201d (Italics added.) The crux of this case involves the effect of the term \u201cshall\u201d in the first sentence of section 98.2, subdivision (b): does the trial court <em>not have jurisdiction </em>to hear a section 98.2 appeal if an appealing employer does not \u201cvoluntarily\u201d post an undertaking <em>or </em>is the term \u201cshall\u201d merely directory and requires a court order mandating an appealing employer to post an undertaking before the court can dismiss that employer\u2019s section 98.2 appeal as a sanction for not posting the ordered undertaking?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The plain language of section 98.2, subdivision (b) does not resolve that question or reveal its underlying legislative intent. Although the term \u201cshall\u201d generally is considered \u201cobligatory\u201d in the sense it is not permissive, in a section 98.2 appeal the term \u201cshall\u201d could be interpreted either as mandatory and jurisdictional <em>or </em>as merely directory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If interpreted as mandatory and jurisdictional, an appealing employer\u2019s appeal must be dismissed if the required undertaking is not posted because the trial court has no jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>hear the appeal. If interpreted as merely directory, an appealing employer\u2019s appeal is not necessarily subject to dismissal if the required undertaking is not posted.  Because the language of section 98.2, subdivision (b) is ambiguous, we independently determine its meaning by considering its statutory context, its legislative purpose, and the nature and character of the act to be done. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Rae-Venter Law Group, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 358-359; <em>Pulcifer v. County of Alameda </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 258, 262 [175 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Section 98.2, subdivision (d) provides: \u201cIf no notice of appeal of the order, decision, or award is filed within the period set forth in subdivision (a), the order, decision, or award shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed the final order.\u201d Therefore, the Legislature expressly provided that a timely filed notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional under section 98.2, subdivisions (a) and (d). As the California Supreme Court concluded: \u201cThe time for filing a notice of appeal from a decision of the Labor Commissioner [i.e., within 10 days] is mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>(Pressler v. Donald L. Bren Co. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 831, 837 [187 Cal.Rptr. 449, 654 P.2d 219].) However, section 98.2, subdivision (b)\u2019s language does <em>not </em>expressly provide that the posting of an undertaking by an appealing employer is mandatory and jurisdictional and, if not posted, the Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award becomes final.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Section 2673.1, subdivision (g), enacted in 1999 (one year before the amendment adding \u00a7 98.2, subd. (b)), deals with claims for unpaid wages in the garment manufacturing industry and adopts the same appeal procedures employed under section 98.2, <em>but </em>uses <em>different </em>language regarding the appeal bond requirement: \u201cAny party shall have the right to judicial review of the order, decision, or award of the Labor Commissioner made pursuant to paragraph (5) of subdivision (d) as provided in Section 98.2. As <em>a condition precedent to filing an appeal, the contractor or the guarantor, whichever appeals, shall post a bond </em>with the Commissioner in an amount equal to one and one-half times the amount of the award. No bond shall be required of an employee filing an appeal pursuant to Section 98.2. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 2673.1, subd. (g), italics added.) By expressly providing the posting of an appeal bond under section 2673.1, subdivision (g) is a <em>condition precedent </em>to a contractor\u2019s or guarantor\u2019s appeal under section 98.2, the Legislature has expressly provided the posting of that required appeal bond is mandatory and jurisdictional. However, although section 98.2, subdivision (d) provides that timely filing a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional for an appeal of a Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award, section 98.2, subdivision (b), unlike section 2673.1, subdivision (g), does not provide an appealing employer posting an undertaking is mandatory and jurisdictional. We therefore may presume the Legislature did not intend section 98.2, subdivision (b) to have that effect. (Cf. <em>Edwards v. Steele, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 410.) Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>had there been such legislative intent, the Legislature presumably would have expressly provided for dismissal of the section 98.2 appeal or a \u201cdeemed\u201d final adoption of the Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award for an appealing employer\u2019s failure to post the undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We further conclude the legislative purpose of section 98.2, subdivision (b) does not show the posting of the required undertaking is mandatory and jurisdictional, rather than merely directory. The apparent purpose of the undertaking required by section 98.2, subdivision (b) is to ensure simple and expedient enforcement of any judgment entered in an employee\u2019s favor after a de novo appeal by an employer pursuant to section 98.2. However, that purpose is not substantially furthered by the undertaking\u2019s being mandatory and jurisdictional in contrast to merely directory; if the required undertaking is directory, a promptly issued trial court order requiring an appealing employer to post the undertaking by a certain date would have substantially the same effect and thereby accomplish the same legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Furthermore, if an appealing employer does not post the section 98.2, subdivision (b) undertaking, the employee possibly may be able to enforce the Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award pending the appeal. In <em>Buchwald v. Katz </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 493, 497 [105 Cal.Rptr. 368, 503 P.2d 1376], the court interpreted section 1700.44, subdivision (a), which applies to talent agencies and provides: \u201cIn cases of controversy arising under this chapter, the parties involved shall refer the matters in dispute to the Labor Commissioner, who shall hear and determine the same, subject to an appeal within 10 days after determination, to the superior court where the same shall be heard de novo. <em>To stay any award for money, the party aggrieved shall execute a bond </em>approved by the superior court in a sum not exceeding twice the amount of the judgment. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) <em>Buchwald </em>concluded section 1700.44, subdivision (a)\u2019s language did <em>not </em>condition the right to appeal on the filing of a bond: \u201c[Section 1700.44, subdivision (a)] confers upon the aggrieved party two separate rights: first, the right to appeal and second, the <em>right to stay execution of an award and determination of the Labor Commissioner pending appeal by executing a bond </em>approved by the superior court. <em>If the aggrieved party fails to exercise this right by filing the requisite bond, then the prevailing party is free to enforce the Labor Commissioner\u2019s award; the aggrieved party\u2019s right to appeal remains unaffected.\u201d (Buchwald v. Katz, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 498, italics added.) <em>Buchwald </em>explained a prevailing party\u2019s right to \u201cenforce\u201d the Commissioner\u2019s award: \u201c[T]he proper procedure for enforcing such an award is to first apply to the superior court for judicial confirmation of the award \u2018in the same manner as awards of private arbitrators under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1285-1288.8. [Fn. omitted.]\u2019 <em>(Buchwald v. Superior Court </em>[(1967)] 254 Cal.App.2d 347, 358 [62 Cal.Rptr. 364].) \u2018If an award is confirmed, judgment shall be entered [by the superior court] in conformity therewith. The judgment so entered has the same force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>and effect as, and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment in a civil action; <em>and it may be enforced like any other judgment </em>of the court in which it is entered.\u2019 ([Former] Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1287.4; italics added.)\u201d <em>(Buchwald </em>v. <em>Katz, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 499.) <em>Buchwald </em>concluded: \u201c[S]ince [the aggrieved party] has failed to file the requisite bond, [the prevailing party] may move in the court below to confirm the Labor Commissioner\u2019s award, and upon confirmation [of that award] enforce the ensuing judgment.\u201d <em>(Buchwald, </em>at p. 500.) Accordingly, the California Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order dismissing the aggrieved party\u2019s appeal for failure to file a bond under section 1700.44, subdivision (a) and remanded the matter to the trial court for a de novo trial on appeal of the Commissioner\u2019s award. <em>(Buchwald, </em>at p. 503.) The court stated: \u201cNotwithstanding the pendency of said [appeal] proceedings in the superior court, [the prevailing party] is entitled to enforce the award and determination of the Labor Commissioner since [the aggrieved party] failed to file the requisite stay bond.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">To the extent <em>Buchwald </em>concluded a prevailing party has a right to \u201cenforce\u201d a Commissioner\u2019s award if an aggrieved party does not file a bond to stay execution (e.g., appeal bond), that conclusion appears to support the recognition of an employee\u2019s (e.g., Parker\u2019s) right to \u201cenforce\u201d a Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award if the appealing employer (e.g., Progressive) does not post the undertaking required by section 98.2, subdivision (b). However, unlike the actions taken by Parker in this case (i.e., immediate filing of a writ of execution and notice of levy under writ of execution against Progressive\u2019s property), under Buchwald.\u2019s interpretation of \u201cenforcement\u201d Parker <em>first </em>was required to file a motion in the trial court for an order confirming the Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award and for entry of a judgment thereon and <em>then </em>(if the confirmation order is issued and the judgment is entered) Parker could have enforced that judgment of the trial court like any other judgment for money. <em>(Buchwald </em>v. <em>Katz, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at pp. 499-500, 503.) Therefore, to the extent an employee has the right to so \u201cenforce\u201d the Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award on an employer\u2019s failure to post the undertaking required by section 98.2, subdivision (b), that enforcement right is an alternative remedy to dismissal of the employer\u2019s appeal for failure to post that required undertaking. The availability of alternative remedies may be a factor in determining whether a statutory requirement is directory or mandatory. (Cf. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>County of Marin, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at pp. 908-909, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Although we must follow Buchwald\u2019s holding, we are perplexed by its conclusion that a prevailing party can \u201cenforce\u201d a Commissioner\u2019s award by filing a motion to confirm the award while the aggrieved party\u2019s appeal of that award is pending. There appears to be an inconsistency in allowing an aggrieved party\u2019s appeal (requesting a de novo determination) of a Commissioner\u2019s award to proceed in the trial court without posting of a bond, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>at the same time allowing the prevailing party to \u201cenforce\u201d that appealed Commissioner\u2019s award by filing a motion in the same trial court for an order confirming the award and for a judgment thereon (which judgment, if entered, would then be subject to \u201ctrue\u201d enforcement). Such an \u201cenforcement\u201d (i.e., award confirmation) proceeding in the trial court could have the effect of depriving the aggrieved party of its statutory right to an appeal of the Commissioner\u2019s award and a true de novo determination by the trial court. We doubt a trial court should be charged with conducting a de novo trial on the aggrieved party\u2019s appeal of a Commissioner\u2019s award, while simultaneously considering a prevailing party\u2019s \u201cenforcement\u201d motion for an order confirming the same award subject to that de novo trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Furthermore, in the circumstances of a section 98.2 appeal, we believe pertinent statutory language impliedly rejects the possibility of a Buchwald-type \u201cenforcement\u201d of a Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award in an unpaid wages case while an appeal of that award is pending. Section 98.1, subdivision (a) provides, inter alia, that the Commissioner must serve a copy of his or her order, decision or award on the parties, which \u201cnotice shall also advise the parties of their right to appeal the decision or award and further advise the parties that <em>failure to do so [i.e., </em>appeal] within the period prescribed by this chapter [i.e., within 10 days per section 98.2, subdivision (a)] <em>shall result in the decision or award becoming final and enforceable as a judgment by the superior court.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) That statute supports an inference the Legislature intended a Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award to become \u201cenforceable\u201d <em>only if </em>an aggrieved party (e.g., an employer) has not timely filed a notice of appeal of that award, thereby resulting in that award becoming \u201cfinal and enforceable as a judgment by the superior court.\u201d (\u00a7 98.1, subd. (a).) We construe section 98.1, subdivision (a) as supporting a conclusion that a Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award is <em>not </em>\u201cfinal and enforceable\u201d if the aggrieved party has timely filed a notice of appeal of the award. Similarly, section 98.2, subdivision (e) provides that, if no notice of appeal is timely filed and the Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award is deemed the final order (per \u00a7 98.2, subd. (d)), the Commissioner shall file a copy of that final order with the trial court and \u201c[\u00a1judgment shall be entered immediately ... in conformity therewith.\u201d (\u00a7 98.2, subd. (e).) Importantly, section 98.2, subdivision (e) then provides: <em>\u201cThe judgment so entered </em>has the same force and effect as, and is subject to all of the provisions of law relating to, a judgment in a civil action, and <em>may be enforced in the same manner as any other judgment of the court </em>in which it is entered. Enforcement of the judgment shall receive court priority.\u201d (Italics added.) As with section 98.1, subdivision (a), we construe section 98.2, subdivision (e) as supporting a conclusion that a Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award is not enforceable unless and until it becomes a \u201cfinal order\u201d because a timely notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>of appeal has not been filed and that \u201cfinal order\u201d has been filed with the trial court, resulting in a \u201ctruly\u201d enforceable judgment of the trial court. Therefore, to the extent Buchwald-type \u201cenforcement\u201d of a Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award may, in general, be available during the pendency of an appeal of that award (e.g., under \u00a7 1700.44), based on our interpretation of sections 98.1, subdivision (a) and 98.2, subdivision (e), we doubt that a Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award in an unpaid wages case is subject to <em>Buchwald-type, </em>\u201cenforcement\u201d during the pendency of a section 98.2 appeal of that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In any event, in the circumstances of a section 98.2 appeal, we conclude there is nothing to preclude the trial court from promptly issuing, either sua sponte or on an employee\u2019s application or motion, an order requiring the appealing employer to post an undertaking in a certain amount by a certain date or be subject to sanctions, including dismissal of the employer\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is what occurred in <em>Williams v. Freedomcard, Inc. </em>(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 609 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 220].) In <em>Williams, </em>after filing their notice of appeal, employers moved for relief from section 98.2, subdivision (b)\u2019s undertaking requirement, arguing, inter alia, the trial court could waive that requirement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 995.240. <em>(Williams, </em>at p. 613.) \u201cThe trial court ruled that [one of the employers] had not shown any evidence of indigence, which was necessary to qualify for dispensing with a bond, and that <em>he was required to post a bond within 10 days or the matter would be </em>dismissed.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) After employers did not post the bond <em>required by the trial court\u2019s order, </em>the court dismissed their appeal. <em>(Ibid.) Williams </em>concluded \u201cthe trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in declining to grant relief from the statutory bond requirement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 615.) Accordingly, it held \u201cthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the [appeal] for failure to post the requisite bond . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The existence of statutory exceptions to the section 98.2, subdivision (b) undertaking requirement, as recognized in <em>Williams, </em>weighs against a conclusion that the undertaking requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional, rather than directory. Code of Civil Procedure section 995.240 provides an indigency exception to section 98.2, subdivision (b)\u2019s undertaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>requirement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That statute provides: <em>\u201cThe court may, in its discretion, waive a provision for a bond </em>in an action or proceeding and make such orders as may be appropriate as if the bond were given, <em>if the court determines that the principal is unable to give the bond because the principal is indigent and is unable to obtain sufficient sureties, </em>whether personal or admitted surety insurers. In exercising its discretion the court shall take into consideration all factors it deems relevant, including but not limited to the character of the action or proceeding, the nature of the beneficiary, whether public or private, and the potential harm to the beneficiary if the provision for the bond is waived.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 995.240, italics added.) If the Legislature had intended section 98.2, subdivision (b)\u2019s undertaking requirement to be mandatory and jurisdictional, it presumably would have expressly precluded the potential application of any exceptions to that requirement, including the indigency exception under Code of Civil Procedure section 995.240.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">We conclude the undertaking under section 98.2, subdivision (b) is directory and <em>not </em>mandatory or jurisdictional. There is no contrary intent clearly expressed in section 98.2, subdivision (b). That statute does not provide any consequence or penalty for an appealing employer\u2019s failure to post the undertaking. Section 98.2, subdivision (b)\u2019s purpose would not be substantially furthered were its undertaking requirement deemed mandatory and jurisdictional, rather than only directory. Other means of enforcing that requirement and accomplishing its statutory purpose exist (e.g., a court order requiring the employer to post an undertaking by a certain date or be subject to possible dismissal of its appeal). Finally, at least one potential exception (i.e., Code of Civ. Proc., \u00a7 995.240) exists to section 98.2, subdivision (b)\u2019s undertaking requirement, weighing against a conclusion its undertaking requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Parker notes <em>Williams </em>contains language that appears to support a conclusion section 98.2, subdivision (b)\u2019s undertaking requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional. However, we believe that language is overbroad and essentially dictum, considering its facts and the court\u2019s disposition of the case. <em>Williams </em>stated: <em>\u201c[T]he right of an employer to seek de novo judicial review in the superior court of a Labor Commissioner\u2019s order, decision or award is conditioned on the necessary prerequisite that the employer post a bond or undertaking for the amount of the award. </em>Nonetheless, the employer may obtain a court order waiving the requirement of a bond or undertaking on the grounds of both indigency and inability to obtain the necessary bond. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>[Citation.] ... [f] If adequate evidence supports relief from the requirement of posting a bond or undertaking, the trial court may then exercise its discretion by waiving the requirement of a security.\u201d <em>(Williams v. Freedomcard, Inc., supra, </em>123 Cal.App.4th at p. 614, italics added.) Williams\u2019s \u201cblanket\u201d statement that an employer\u2019s right to appeal a Commissioner\u2019s order \u201cis conditioned on the necessary prerequisite\u201d that it post the required undertaking is unsupported by any analysis or authority. Rather, it appears <em>Williams </em>may have based that statement solely on its initial reading of section 98.2, subdivision (b)\u2019s language without considering whether the statute\u2019s use of the term \u201cshall\u201d should be interpreted as mandatory and jurisdictional or merely directory. Furthermore, in the circumstances of <em>Williams, </em>the trial court issued an order requiring the employers to post the required undertaking by a certain date and only dismissed the employers\u2019 appeal after they violated that order. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Freedomcard, Inc., supra, </em>123 Cal.App.4th at p. 613.) Therefore, it appears <em>Williams\u2019s </em>\u201cblanket\u201d statement, on which Parker relies, is dictum. In any event, we are not bound or persuaded by <em>Williams\u2019 s </em>conclusory statement that the undertaking required by section 98.2, subdivision (b) is a condition precedent, or a \u201cnecessary prerequisite,\u201d to an employer\u2019s appeal. Accordingly, we decline to adopt that aspect of <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\n<em>Trial Court Did Not Err by Not Dismissing Progressive\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The record on appeal does <em>not </em>show the trial court\u2019s September 15, 2004 order <em>required </em>Progressive to post an undertaking. Rather, that order was issued in response to Progressive\u2019s application to stay execution of the Commissioner\u2019s award and reduce the amount of section 98.2, subdivision (b)\u2019s undertaking. The order stayed execution of the Commissioner\u2019s award, fixed the amount of the appeal bond at $122,339.38, and gave Progressive until September 22 to post the bond to continue the stay of execution. Accordingly, when Progressive did not post that appeal bond by September 22, it did <em>not </em>violate any court order <em>requiring </em>it to do so, but subjected itself to possible enforcement of the Commissioner\u2019s award. Absent a violation of a court order, there was no ground on which the trial court had discretion to dismiss Progressive\u2019s appeal because section 98.2, subdivision (b)\u2019s undertaking requirement is not mandatory and jurisdictional, but rather merely directory. Therefore, without a court order directing Progressive to post the required undertaking, the trial court could not dismiss the appeal outright.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, to the extent Parker filed a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>dismiss Progressive\u2019s appeal, either before or during trial, the trial court had no ground on which to dismiss Progressive\u2019s appeal based on that motion because it had <em>not </em>violated any court order <em>requiring </em>it to post an undertaking as a condition to proceeding with the appeal by a certain date. It was incumbent on Parker to seek a court order requiring Progressive to post the undertaking by a certain date.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court did not err by not dismissing Progressive\u2019s appeal in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">IIII</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\n<em>Attorney Fees and Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Progressive requests that we award it attorney fees and costs on its appeal to the superior court pursuant to section 98.2, subdivision (c). However, that statute does not apply in the circumstances of this case. Section 98.2, subdivision (c) provides: \u201cIf the party seeking review by filing an appeal to the superior court is unsuccessful in the appeal, the court shall determine the costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the other parties to the appeal, and assess that amount as a cost upon the party filing the appeal. An employee is successful if the court awards an amount greater than zero.\u201d That statute would apply only had Progressive been unsuccessful in obtaining a more favorable award on its appeal of the Commissioner\u2019s order to the trial court. <em>(Smith v. Rae-Venter Law Group, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 370-373; <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Parking Service 2000 Com., Inc. </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 212, 227-228 [11 Cal.Rptr.3d 595].) Because Progressive obtained a more favorable award, that statute does not provide any basis for an award of attorney fees and costs. Accordingly, we decline to award Progressive its attorney fees and costs on appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The judgment is affirmed.

Because Parker apparently does not dispute the substance of that order as described in Progressive\u2019s notice of ruling, we presume, for purposes of this appeal, that the court\u2019s order is as described above. However, we note that had the trial court, for appeal undertaking purposes, reduced the $133,339.38 amount awarded by the Commissioner by the amount of the $12,000 settlement between Parker and Concrete, the net amount for appeal undertaking purposes would have been <em>$121,339.38, </em>not $122,339.38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b453-11\"> Alternatively, an employee may forgo an administrative hearing and directly file an ordinary civil action for judicial relief against the employer for breach of contract or statutorily required wages.
