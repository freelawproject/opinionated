The primary issue in this appeal is whether this \u201cfavorable termination\u201d element can be established where a plaintiff prevailed on some, but not all, of the causes of action asserted against it in the complaint in the underlying litigation. We conclude that in such circumstances, a plaintiff cannot establish favorable termination and is consequently precluded from maintaining a subsequent malicious prosecution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">In the instant malicious prosecution action, StaffPro, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contends that it was the victim of a meritless civil action, maliciously prosecuted by Elite Show Services, Inc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The relevant facts are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">StaffPro and Elite are competitors in the event-staffing industry. In May 2001, Elite filed suit against StafiPro and two other unrelated defendants in superior court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Elite\u2019s complaint (the Complaint) alleged that StafiPro was engaging in unlawful practices designed to \u201cartificially lower [StafiPro\u2019s] cost of labor and to diminish or destroy competition for security guard and traffic control services in San Diego.\u201d The Complaint specifically singled out a number of such practices, including using unlicensed personnel to perform security officer functions, utilizing security guard personnel who did not possess valid \u201cguard cards\u201d as required by state law, allowing unlicensed employees to direct traffic at events, and staffing events with group labor paid by lump-sum payments to third party organizations without required withholdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">The Complaint asserted three causes of action against StafiPro, alleging that StafiPro: (i) engaged in unlawful business practices in violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200; (ii) offered below-cost services in violation of Business and Professions Code section 17043; and (iii) underbid Elite on a number of specifically enumerated contracts, constituting intentional interference with prospective business advantage. Each of Elite\u2019s causes of action was based on StaffPro\u2019s alleged reliance on the unlawful practices specified <em>ante </em>to obtain a competitive advantage. Elite sought injunctive relief, attorney fees and monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">After filing the Complaint, Elite sought a preliminary injunction to immediately preclude StaffPro from engaging in the allegedly unlawful practices. The trial court granted the injunction in part, finding that Elite \u201cestablished a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of its case\u201d with respect to the group labor allegations. The court\u2019s order stated: \u201cStaffpro is obtaining an unfair advantage by not treating [group laborers] as employees and providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation and state disability benefits and paying appropriate employment and payroll taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">As the litigation progressed, StaffPro filed a motion for summary adjudication as to Elite\u2019s second cause of action. The trial court denied the motion, finding that Elite had demonstrated \u201ca triable issue\u201d with respect to the allegations in that cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Immediately prior to trial, Elite dismissed its third cause of action and withdrew its claim for monetary damages as to its second cause of action, limiting the issues to be resolved at trial to the legality of StaffPro\u2019s business practices and Elite\u2019s requests for injunctive relief and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">Trial commenced on December 17, 2002. At the conclusion of Elite\u2019s presentation of evidence, StaffPro moved for judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 631.8. (See <em>id., </em>subd. (a) [\u201cAfter a party has completed his presentation of evidence in a trial by the court, the other party . . . may move for a judgment\u201d].) The motion was granted as to Elite\u2019s second cause of action but denied as to the first; trial proceeded on Elite\u2019s first cause of action. At the conclusion of trial, the court granted relief to Elite, ordering StaffPro to take the following remedial measures: (1) \u201cTo ensure Workers\u2019 Compensation coverage is afforded to \u2018group labor\u2019 personnel, either by ensuring that each nonprofit organization certifies such coverage or providing such coverage itself\u2019; and (2) \u201cTo utilize only those personnel licensed pursuant to Business [and] Professions Code section 7583.11 for the following activities: 1. Restraints upon or limitation of movement of the general public which, if escalated, requires force and physical restraint; 2. Pat-downs requiring physical intrusion into the personal space of a member of the general public; 3. Car searches requiring physical intrusion into the personal space of a member of the general public.\u201d With respect to StaffPro\u2019s alleged use of employees without proper \u201cguard cards,\u201d the court ruled that there was evidence supporting the allegations, but that \u201c[n]eed for relief concerning these established practices is rendered moot\u201d by regulatory developments that had become effective after trial commenced. The court also recognized that there was evidence that StaffPro unlawfully utilized uncertified persons to control traffic, but relying in part on StaffPro\u2019s contention that \u201cit has recently become licensed to certify traffic control employees and is utilizing the license to certify those assigned to traffic control duties,\u201d the court declined to order relief. Concerning Elite\u2019s allegations of other unlawful practices with respect to events staffed on school property, the court noted that the evidence, \u201cwhile significant, is insufficient... to warrant injunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>In addition to ordering the relief described <em>ante, </em>the trial court made a number of findings relevant to the determination of whether Elite\u2019s lawsuit was meritorious. The court found that Elite \u201cwas informed and believed in good faith that the alleged unfair business practices and unfair competitive practices had a serious negative impact upon plaintiff\u2019s business in San Diego County.\u201d The court stated that \u201cthere is a dearth of published opinion, definitions or case law dealing with\u201d the event staffing industry and a number of \u201cdiffering . . . opinions by members of the industry as to what is legal or illegal, fair or unfair.\u201d Consequently, the court found the lawsuit provided a benefit to the public which \u201cstands to benefit from a clarification of the use of licensed and unlicensed personnel who both manage and control them.\u201d Finally, the court specified that neither party was a prevailing party and each would bear its own costs and fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">In April 2004, StaffPro filed the instant lawsuit alleging that Elite\u2019s prosecution of the above-described lawsuit, specifically the second and third causes of action of that lawsuit, constituted the tort of malicious prosecution. Elite responded by moving under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 (section 425.16) to strike StaffPro\u2019s malicious prosecution cause of action. The trial court granted Elite\u2019s motion, ruling that StaffPro failed to carry its burden under section 425.16 of establishing a probability that it would prevail. The court subsequently entered judgment in favor of Elite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">StaffPro appeals the trial court\u2019s ruling that StaffPro failed to establish a probability that it would prevail on two of the elements of its malicious prosecution cause of action, namely, favorable termination and lack of probable case. We conclude that the trial court was correct with respect to the favorable termination element. As this is a sufficient ground for dismissal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>StaffPro\u2019s action, we need not address the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to the probable cause element.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">\n<em>Applicable Legal Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">We begin by summarizing the applicable legal standards. Under section 425.16, the trial court was required to strike StaffPro\u2019s malicious prosecution cause of action unless StaffPro established \u201ca probability\u201d that it would prevail on that claim. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">To make this showing, StaffPro had to demonstrate a probability of prevailing with respect to each of the elements of its malicious prosecution action, namely, that Elite\u2019s underlying action was (1) brought (or continued) without probable cause, (2) initiated with malice, and (3) pursued to a legal termination in StaffPro\u2019s favor. (See <em>Zamos </em>v. <em>Stroud </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 958, 965-966 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 54, 87 P.3d 802] <em>(Zamos).) </em>If a plaintiff cannot establish any one of these three elements, its malicious prosecution action will fail. (Ibid.; <em>Sheldon Appel Co. v. Albert &amp; Oliker </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 863, 871-872 [254 Cal.Rptr. 336, 765 P.2d 498] <em>(Sheldon Appel).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">We review the trial court\u2019s ruling on a section 425.16 motion de novo <em>(Zamos, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 965; <em>HMS Capital, Inc. v. Lawyers Title Co. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 204, 212 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 786] [\u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s rulings on an anti-SLAPP motion de novo, conducting an independent review of the entire record\u201d]); the substantive ground upon which we rule here, the element of favorable termination in a malicious prosecution action, is also a legal question for the court to decide. <em>(Sierra Club Foundation v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number><em>Graham </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1149 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 726] <em>(Sierra Club) </em>[\u201cThe element of favorable termination is for the court to decide; thus, our review is de novo\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">\n<em>StaffPro Failed to Demonstrate a Probability of Prevailing on Its Malicious Prosecution Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">The trial court ruled that StaffPro could not establish favorable termination of the underlying lawsuit because Elite was successful on its first cause of action and Elite\u2019s other two causes of action were not \u201cseverable\u201d from that cause of action. StaffPro contends that this ruling was erroneous for two reasons. First, StaffPro argues that the remedial order issued against it in the underlying action should be considered a termination in StaffPro's <em>favor </em>because the order was not as broad as an earlier settlement offer made by StaffPro. Second, StaffPro argues that even if Elite was successful on its first cause of action, Elite\u2019s second and third causes of action are severable from the first, and therefore can serve as an independent basis for StaffPro\u2019s malicious prosecution action. As discussed <em>post, </em>we find no merit in either of StaffPro\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">\n<em>The Favorable Termination Element</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">Prior to analyzing StaffPro\u2019s contentions, we first define the concept of favorable termination. To be considered \u201cfavorable\u201d for purposes of a malicious prosecution action, a termination in the underlying action \u201cmust reflect the merits of the action <em>and the plaintiff\u2019s innocence </em>of the misconduct alleged in the lawsuit.\u201d <em>(Pender v. Rodin </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1814 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 36] <em>(Pender), </em>italics added, citing <em>Lackner v. LaCroix </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 747, 750 [159 Cal.Rptr. 693, 602 P.2d 393] <em>(Lackner).) </em>\u201cThe key is whether the termination reflects on the underlying defendant\u2019s innocence. [Citations.] If the resolution of the underlying litigation \u2018leaves some doubt as to the defendant\u2019s innocence or liability[, it] is <em>not </em>a favorable termination, and bars that party from bringing a malicious prosecution action against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>underlying plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Eells v. Rosenblum </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1848, 1855 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 323] <em>(Eells), </em>alteration and italics in original.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Favorable termination \u201cis an essential element of the tort of malicious prosecution, and it is strictly enforced.\u201d <em>(Ferreira </em>v. <em>Gray, Cary, Ware &amp; Freidenrich </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 409, 413 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 683] <em>(Ferreira).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">\n<em>Elite\u2019s First Cause of Action Did Not Terminate in StaffPro\u2019s Favor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">On appeal, StaffPro first seeks to blunt the significance of the court\u2019s order in the underlying litigation with respect to Elite\u2019s first cause of action\u2014an order that required <em>StaffPro </em>to take a number of remedial actions. StaffPro argues that this remedial order should be considered a result <em>favorable to StaffPro </em>because it was \u201cmore limited in scope than the actions StaffPro agreed to undertake\u201d as part of an earlier settlement offer. We disagree with StaffPro\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">Well-established case law requires that a malicious prosecution plaintiff demonstrate that the complained-of action was \u201c \u2018pursued to a legal termination in [the] <em>plaintiff\u2019s[] </em>favor.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Crowley </em>v. <em>Katleman </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 666, 676 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 386, 881 P.2d 1083] <em>(Crowley), </em>italics added.) We have found no authority, and StaffPro cites none, to suggest that there is an exception to the above formulation where an action is pursued to a termination in the <em>defendants\u2019 </em>favor, but the termination is less favorable than an earlier settlement proposal. In fact, the case law regarding settlements in the malicious prosecution context strongly suggests that StaffPro\u2019s offer to stipulate to what it characterizes as \u201cthe precise injunctive relief that Elite prayed for in its complaint\u201d weakens rather than strengthens its case for favorable termination, as it implies that StaffPro was <em>not </em>innocent of the conduct alleged by Elite. (See, e.g., <em>Ferreira, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>pp. 413-414 [\u201cwhere both sides give up anything of value in order to end the litigation, a party cannot later claim he received a favorable termination\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">Thus, StaffPro\u2019s contention is not an argument based on existing case law, but an invitation, without statutory or case authority, to broaden the malicious prosecution tort to encompass a new category of lawsuits\u2014those that were favorably terminated solely by reference to the parties\u2019 earlier settlement positions. We decline this invitation. An expansion of the tort along the lines suggested by StaffPro would contradict our Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cthe tort of malicious prosecution \u2018should not be expanded,\u2019 \u201d but contained within its already established boundaries. <em>(Brennan </em>v. <em>Tremco Inc. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 310, 314 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 790, 20 P.3d 1086] <em>(Brennan) </em>[relying on \u201ctrend against creating or expanding derivative tort remedies, including malicious prosecution\u201d to support ruling that favorable termination of arbitration could not support malicious prosecution claim]; <em>Crowley, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 680 [contours of right to bring malicious prosecution action \u201cshould not be expanded\u201d]; cf. <em>Sheldon Appel, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 872 [malicious prosecution is \u201ca disfavored cause of action\u201d and consequently \u201cthe elements of the tort have historically been carefully circumscribed\u201d].) These established boundaries leave no room for StaffPro\u2019s contention that even where the favorable termination element cannot be established by a legal termination in the malicious prosecution plaintiff\u2019s favor <em>(Crowley, </em>at p. 676), it can still be shown by comparing a legal termination in the defendant\u2019s favor with the plaintiff\u2019s earlier settlement offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">In sum, we reject StaffPro\u2019s contention that the favorable termination element of the malicious prosecution tort can be established by reference to the parties\u2019 prior settlement positions. We conclude instead that Elite\u2019s first cause of action, which resulted in a court order requiring StaffPro to take remedial action, did not terminate in StaffPro\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Eells, supra, </em>36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>Cal.App.4th at p. 1855 [favorable termination cannot be established if \u201cthe resolution of the underlying litigation \u2018leaves some doubt as to the defendant\u2019s innocence or liability\u2019 \u201d].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">\n<em>Severability Is Not the Touchstone of the Favorable Termination Element of a Malicious Prosecution Cause of Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">Alternatively, StaffPro contends that its inability to demonstrate favorable termination of Elite\u2019s <em>first </em>cause of action does not bar it from establishing that Elite maliciously prosecuted its <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>causes of action. In making this argument, StaffPro contends that the favorable termination element of the malicious prosecution tort must be determined with respect to each \u201cseverable\u201d cause of action, and that Elite\u2019s second and third causes of action, which terminated in StaffPro\u2019s favor, are severable from the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">StaffPro premises its argument on a statement from <em>Singleton v. Perry </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 489, 497 [289 P.2d 794] <em>(Singleton), </em>that for a viable malicious prosecution action, \u201c \u2018 \u201cit is not necessary that the whole [underlying] proceeding be utterly groundless, for, if groundless charges are maliciously and without probable cause, coupled with others which are well founded, they are not on that account the less injurious.\u201d \u2019 \u201d This reliance on <em>Singleton </em>is unavailing and demonstrates the flaw that lies at the core of StaffPro\u2019s analysis, namely, the failure to distinguish between cases evaluating the <em>probable cause </em>element of the tort of malicious prosecution (such as <em>Singleton) </em>and those that concern the distinct element at issue here\u2014 <em>favorable termination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-9\">As we stated in <em>Dalany </em>v. <em>American Pacific Holding Corp. </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 822, 829 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 13] <em>(Dalany), </em>a case not cited by any of the parties to this appeal, our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Crowley, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 666, dictates that the severability analysis implicit in <em>Singleton </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>inapplicable to the favorable termination element of the malicious prosecution tort. (Dalany, at p. 829 [holding that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court [in <em>Crowley] </em>has recently emphasized that although for purposes of determining probable cause each theory asserted in a prior action must be separately considered, separate consideration of prior theories of claims is not appropriate with respect to the element of favorable termination\u201d].) To the contrary, for purposes of determining favorable termination, \u201c \u201c[t]he court in the action for malicious prosecution will not make a separate investigation and retry each separate allegation without reference to the result of the previous suit <em>as a whole </em>(Crowley, at p. 684, italics added.) Instead, \u201c \u2018consideration should be given to the judgment as a whole\u2019 \u201d as it is \u201c \u2018the decree or judgment itself in the former action [that] is the criterion by which to determine who was the successful party in such proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 685.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the severability analysis that StaffPro urges us to apply in the instant case has been explicitly rejected by our Supreme Court, which requires instead that we look to the judgment in the underlying action \u201c \u2018as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Crowley, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 684\u2014685.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">We recognize that a handful of published opinions of the California Courts of Appeal apply severability analysis to determine the favorable termination element of the tort of malicious prosecution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> With one exception, however, these cases were decided prior to <em>Crowley </em>and our interpretation of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>decision in <em>Dalany. </em>The one exception, <em>Sierra Club, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th 1135, is in conflict with <em>Dalany, </em>and we find its analysis to be flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\"><em>Sierra Club </em>rejects the position we espoused in <em>Dalany </em>that \u201cone must look to the judgment as a whole in deciding whether termination is favorable\u201d <em>(,Sierra Club, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th at p. 1152), and instead, in the following dicta from that opinion, decides that favorable termination of severable claims will support a claim for malicious prosecution: \u201cGroundless charges coupled maliciously and without probable cause with well-founded causes are no less injurious for the coupling. <em>(Singleton[, supra,] </em>45 Cal.2d 489, 497-498 . . . .) <em>Thus, a malicious prosecution plaintiff is not precluded from establishing favorable termination where severable claims are adjudicated in his or her favor. (Paramount </em>General[, <em>supra,] </em>213 Cal.App.3d 360, 369-370.)\u201d <em>(Sierra Club, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th at p. 1153, italics added.) As our earlier analysis indicates, <em>Sierra Club's </em>reasoning is deficient for at least three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">First, the authorities <em>Sierra Club </em>cites for its conclusion are inapposite. The primary case <em>Sierra Club </em>relies on, <em>Paramount General, </em>predates <em>Crowley </em>and relies on <em>Freidberg </em>for its conclusion that favorable termination can be established through a severability analysis. <em>Crowley's </em>explicit disapproval of the severability analysis in <em>Freidberg </em>(see <em>Crowley, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 683-686) necessarily implies similar disapproval of that same analysis in <em>Paramount General. </em>The other case cited by <em>Sierra Club, Singleton, </em>is a probable cause case decided decades prior to <em>Crowley. </em>Reliance on a probable cause case that did not consider the element of favorable termination directly contradicts <em>Crowley\u2019s </em>instruction that these elements are analytically distinct. <em>(Crowley, </em>at p. 686.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">Second, <em>Sierra Club\u2019s </em>interpretation of <em>Crowley </em>focuses exclusively on, and in our view misinterprets, a minor point in the opinion. <em>Sierra Club </em>relies on a portion of <em>Crowley </em>that criticizes severability analysis because that analysis only determines whether the plaintiff obtained <em>\u201cat least </em>a \u2018 \u201cpartial favorable termination,\u201d \u2019 \u201d leaving unanswered the \u201c \u2018question of policy\u2019 \u201d as to whether such partial favorable termination can support a malicious prosecution action. <em>(Sierra Club, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th at p. 1153, quoting <em>Crowley, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 686, italics added.) Our primary difference with <em>Sierra Club </em>is that we do not believe <em>Crowley </em>raises this \u201cquestion of policy\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>to leave it unresolved. Rather, the high court answers the question by subsequently announcing the rule that a malicious prosecution plaintiff must demonstrate \u201c \u2018favorable termination of the <em>entire </em>[underlying] action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Crowley, </em>at pp. 685-686; see <em>Dalany, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 829.) Such a rule, which requires judgment to have \u201c \u2018been reached in the plaintiff\u2019s favor in the prior action as a whole\u2019 \u201d <em>(Crowley, </em>at p. 686, italics added), cannot coexist with an exception for <em>partial </em>favorable termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">Third, whatever the merits of <em>Sierra Club's </em>interpretation of the portion of <em>Crowley </em>upon which it relies, its conclusion that \u201ca malicious prosecution plaintiff is not precluded from establishing favorable termination where severable claims are adjudicated in his or her favor\u201d <em>(Sierra Club, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th at p. 1153) cannot be reconciled with the overall message of Crowley\u2014that favorable termination must be determined by evaluating \u201c \u2018the judgment as a whole\u2019 \u201d <em>(Crowley, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 685). <em>Sierra Club, </em>in fact, makes no attempt to reconcile this conflict, or for that matter the same conflict its opinion creates with <em>Dalany. Sierra Club's </em>analysis is therefore incomplete, and on that basis alone, unconvincing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">In sum, we decline to follow <em>Sierra Club </em>and instead adhere to our previous interpretation of <em>Crowley </em>as explained in <em>Dalany </em>that severability analysis is improper in determining whether a malicious prosecution plaintiff has demonstrated favorable termination of an underlying lawsuit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>(Dalany, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 829.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">\n<em>StaffPro Failed to Demonstrate a Probability of Establishing Favorable Termination of the Underlying Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">Having determined that the court\u2019s decision in <em>Crowley </em>requires a rejection of the severability analysis argued by the parties, we next apply the alternate analysis laid out in <em>Crowley </em>to determine whether StaffPro has, on this record, established a probability of prevailing on the favorable termination element of its malicious prosecution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">In criticizing the <em>Freidberg </em>court\u2019s severability analysis, the <em>Crowley </em>court outlined a much simpler analysis to be applied, stating that a plaintiff in a malicious prosecution must establish \u201c \u2018a favorable termination of the <em>entire </em>[underlying] action\u2019 \u201d and that the other elements of the tort, such as probable cause, will only be reached after \u201c \u2018judgment ha[s] been reached in the plaintiff\u2019s favor in the prior action as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Crowley, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 686, quoting <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1292, 1300 [266 Cal.Rptr. 557] (Jenkins);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Casa Herrera, supra, 32 </em>Cal.4th at p. 341 [\u201cTo determine \u2018whether there was a favorable termination,\u2019 we \u2018look at the judgment as a whole in the prior action\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">We applied these principles in <em>Dalany </em>to preclude a malicious prosecution claim where the plaintiff similarly attempted to separate the causes of action in the underlying action for purposes of establishing favorable termination. In <em>Dalany, </em>the plaintiff had obtained summary judgment on \u201csome, but not all\u201d of the causes of action alleged against him in an underlying suit brought by his former employer, and eventually settled the remainder (in addition to his own claims against the employer) in return for a payment of $105,000. <em>(Dalany, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at pp. 825-826.) Despite the settlement, in a subsequent malicious prosecution, Dalany contended that he could establish favorable termination by focusing solely on the causes of action for which he obtained summary judgment. Relying on <em>Crowley, </em>we disagreed, holding that \u201cseparate consideration\u201d of the claims asserted in the underlying lawsuit was \u201cnot appropriate with respect to the element of favorable termination.\u201d <em>(Dalany, </em>at pp. 829-830, citing <em>Crowley, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 686.) Instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>because <em>Crowley </em>required us to \u201cconsider the prior judgment \u2018as a whole,\u2019 \u201d and not as separable components, we determined that Dalany\u2019s settlement of some of the claims against him created \u201cambiguity\u201d as to his innocence, thus precluding the requisite showing of a \u201c \u2018favorable termination of the <em>entire </em>action.\u2019 \u201d (Dalany, at pp. 828-830 &amp; fn. 2, quoting <em>Crowley, </em>at p. 686.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">Similarly, here, Elite\u2019s success in obtaining some relief on its first cause of action precludes a showing of favorable termination. The trial court\u2019s order in the underlying action required StaffPro to take remedial action with respect to many of the core allegations against it, and the order further states that a number of Elite\u2019s other requests for remedial action were rendered moot by StaffPro\u2019s voluntary compliance and/or regulatory developments. In light of this order, we must conclude that the resolution of the underlying action, viewed as a whole, \u201c \u2018leaves some doubt as to [StaffPro\u2019s] innocence or liability\u2019 \u201d and consequently \u201c \u2018is <em>not </em>a favorable termination.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Eells, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 1855; <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Gerth </em>(1944) 65 Cal.App.2d 170, 177-178 [150 P.2d 489] [termination not favorable to defendant even though \u201conly a small part of the amount sued for\u201d was recovered and on a different theory than that advanced because \u201c[t]he fact remains that the judgment, framed upon the pleadings filed and the issues raised thereby, was not in favor of the defendant therein\u201d], criticized on other grounds in <em>Sheldon Appel, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 878, fn. 7; cf. <em>Padres L.P. v.

Consequently, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling on the section 425.16 motion, striking StaffPro\u2019s malicious prosecution cause of action.

The requirement that a favorable termination reflect on \u201cthe merits of the action,\u201d is simply one step in the broader inquiry into whether that termination \u201c \u2018tends to indicate the innocence of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lackner, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 750 [the \u201c \u2018theory underlying the requirement of favorable termination is that it tends to indicate the innocence of the accused\u2019 \u201d].) Consequently, a termination that \u201creflect[s] the merits\u201d is not a substitute for, but rather a prerequisite to a finding that termination reflects \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s innocence of the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>(Pender, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 1814.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1187-7\"> In its reply brief, StaffPro makes the additional argument that the trial court, in its order, found \u201cagainst Elite personally in every respect.\u201d This somewhat misleading statement is based on the trial court\u2019s determination that \u201c[t]he court finds that [Elite] has standing to proceed with this litigation,\u201d but only as a <em>representative </em>plaintiff under Business and Professions Code section 17200. From this ruling, StaffPro argues that dictum in <em>Casa Herrera, Inc. v. Beydoun </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 336 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 97, 83 P.3d 497] <em>(Casa </em>Herrera) requires a finding of favorable termination. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 342 [stating that favorable termination can be shown in a number of ways, including where the trial court has \u201cheld that the defendant, as a matter of law, violated no duty to the plaintiff\u201d].) We do not believe the <em>Casa Herrera </em>dictum, which did not consider this issue, was meant to apply in this context. A contrary conclusion would lead to the absurd result that all representative actions would be subject to malicious prosecution claims regardless of the result of the underlying litigation and the plaintiff\u2019s guilt or innocence of the allegations considered therein. <em>(Ibid, </em>[stating that focus of favorable termination inquiry is the malicious prosecution \u201cplaintiff\u2019s innocence of the misconduct alleged in the lawsuit\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1188-10\"> StaffPro also emphasizes that the trial court ruled in the form of an order rather than an injunction. We assign little significance to this distinction as there was no suggestion that the court\u2019s order was anything other than a mandatory decree that StaffPro alter its practices; the court stated that its decision to rely on an order rather than the \u201cdrastic measure of regulation by injunction\u201d was \u201cpremised heavily upon the pledges by counsel of Staff Pro in the presence of its CEO and major stockholder to comply with the . . . order]] without the issuance of an injunction [\u2014tjhese pledges were made on numerous occasions on the record and were backed by the extreme credibility of its counsel earned by his performance during the trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1189-7\"> The favorable termination analysis in <em>Crowley </em>was arguably not required for the decision in that case. Nevertheless, Supreme Court \u201cdictum, while not controlling authority, carries persuasive weight and should be followed where it demonstrates a thorough analysis of the issue or reflects compelling logic.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 266, 297 [262 Cal.Rptr. 754].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1189-8\"> While the parties all contend that we should resolve the issue of favorable termination by applying the \u201cprimary rights\u201d severability analysis used in <em>Freidberg, </em>none of the parties distinguish <em>Crowley\u2019s </em>explicit disapproval of that analysis. Rutherford LLP, the only party to specifically address the issue, argues that <em>Crowley </em>\u201cdoes not change th[e severability] rule,\u201d because although the <em>Crowley </em>court \u201cmentioned that the primary right theory relied upon in <em>Freidberg </em>might be inappropriate,\u201d the high court \u201chas not offered an alternative basis to determine severability.\u201d Rutherford LLP cites <em>Hindin </em>v. <em>Rust </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1247 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 668] (Hindin) for the proposition that \u201cthe Courts of Appeal still use primary right.\u201d We find Rutherford LLP\u2019s contentions unavailing for two reasons. First, <em>Hindin </em>does not support Rutherford LLP\u2019s argument, as that case concerned only the probable cause element of the malicious prosecution tort and itself notes that <em>Crowley </em>\u201cquestioned the] propriety of relying on the primary right theory to define the prior action for purposes of the favorable termination requirement.\u201d <em>(Hindin, </em>at p. 1258, fn. 7.) Second, as we stated in <em>Dalany, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th 822, the <em>Crowley </em>court did not simply criticize the application of the primary right theory, but the entire severability analysis. Thus, there was no need for the high court to provide \u201can alternative basis to determine severability.\u201d Rather, as discussed <em>post, </em>the court stated that the favorable termination question must be resolved without reference to severability, but rather by evaluating the result of the \u201c <em>\u2018entire </em>action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Crowley, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 685.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1189-9\"> (See, e.g., <em>Tabaz v.
