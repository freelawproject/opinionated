The Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA), representing the refineries, sought a writ of mandate from the superior court vacating the rule on the grounds the District lacked substantial evidence the refineries could achieve the new standards and that the new standards were cost effective. WSPA also argued the rule should be vacated because the District had not adequately assessed the environmental impact, which would result from the refineries\u2019 attempts to comply with the rule and had failed to maintain, produce and disclose pertinent records of the rule\u2019s development. The superior court denied the writ and this timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">We conclude substantial evidence supports the District\u2019s findings of feasibility and cost effectiveness. We also hold the District complied with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>applicable CEQA requirements and substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding the administrative record contains all relevant documents in the District\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">A. <em>The Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">In November 2003 the District adopted rule 1105.1 giving the six refineries in its jurisdiction until December 31, 2006 to reduce the emissions of PM 10 and ammonia from their fluid catalytic cracking units (FCCU\u2019s). The refineries may request an extension to December 31, 2008 to synchronize the installation of PM10 control devices with their FCCU\u2019s operational cycles. The new standards provide PM 10 emissions cannot exceed 0.005 grains per dry standard cubic foot (0.005 gr/dscf) and ammonia emissions cannot exceed 10 parts per million by volume (10 ppmv). As an alternative to meeting the PM10 standard of 0.005 gr/dscf the rule allows a refinery to emit up to 0.006 gr/dscf of PM 10 if it can find ways to make up the difference. The rule provides other escape clauses for refineries which are unable to meet the new standards, as discussed below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">B. <em>The Reason for the Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">An FCCU is a processing unit used in refining petroleum. The FCCU takes heavy crude oil and \u201ccracks\u201d it into more usable hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons can be further refined to make gasoline and other fuels. This cracking creates fine particulate matter referred to in the industry as PM10.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has found the adverse health effects from elevated PM10 concentrations include lung damage, respiratory and cardiovascular disease and premature death. Children, the elderly and people suffering from heart and lung diseases such as asthma are particularly at risk.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">In order to try to trap PM 10 before it can escape into the environment FCCU\u2019s are equipped with electrostatic precipitators (ESP\u2019s). An ESP electrically charges the particles which are then attracted to large collection plates which are oppositely charged. The particles are removed from the plates in one of two ways. A \u201cdry\u201d ESP uses a mechanical hammering device, which dislodges the particles. A \u201cwet\u201d ESP uses water to continuously wash down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>the plates. No ESP is 100 percent efficient in trapping PM10 so some particulate matter inevitably escapes into the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">In order to enhance an ESP\u2019s ability to trap PMlO\u2019s refineries sometimes use ammonia as an agent to reduce the particles\u2019 resistance to electrical charge. The problem with this technique is that it creates \u201cammonia slip\u201d\u2014 unreacted ammonia, which is emitted into the atmosphere where it reacts with other gases to produce fine chemical particulates such as ammonia sulfates, which can cause conjunctivitis, laryngitis and pulmonary edema especially in persons suffering from asthma.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The EPA has established nationwide standards for PM 10 emissions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and has found the Southern California Basin to be \u201cserious[ly]\u201d out of conformity with those standards.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly the EPA has given California a deadline of December 31, 2006 to bring PM 10 emissions into compliance with federal standards. Failure to do so could ultimately subject the state to severe penalties such as the withholding of billions of dollars in federal highway funds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Although FCCU\u2019s are not the only source of PM 10 emissions they are the single largest regulated stationary source of PM10 pollution in the Southern California Basin emitting approximately 318 tons of PM 10 into the atmosphere each year. Thus it was inevitable the District would seek to reduce these emissions as part of its strategy to bring the basin into conformity with federal PM10 standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">C. <em>Development of Rule 1105.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">The District\u2019s staff first proposed a rule limiting PM10 in 1989 but other priorities intervened until 1995 when agency staff and refinery operators formed a task force to study FCCU emissions and potential control strategies. The task force conducted source tests at the six refineries under the District\u2019s jurisdiction. Summarizing the results of these tests the District\u2019s staff noted the refinery with the newest ESP technology \u201cgot little actual PM reduction and still emits significant amounts of [ammonia].\u201d In fact the tests showed as PM10 emissions were reduced ammonia emissions increased. The staff recommended any further development of the rule include limits on ammonia emissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Further development of the rule was postponed until 2002 when the District\u2019s staff formed a working group with representatives of the refineries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>and WSPA to consider appropriate limits on PM10 and ammonia emissions. Representatives of environmental organizations were also invited to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">After consultation with the members of the working group the District\u2019s staff proposed a rule calling for emission limits of 0.0042 gr/dscf for PM10 and 10 ppmv for ammonia. The staff based these limits on \u201cthe current emission level at Refinery A,\u201d which had the newest ESP among the six refineries.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">WSPA objected to the proposed rule on the ground refinery A had characteristics not found or reproducible at other refineries. Moreover, WSPA contended, even with its new equipment, refinery A had not been able to achieve a 0.0042 emission level on a consistent (five-year) basis. An expert engaged by WSPA concluded the lowest feasible emission rate of PM10 would be 0.006 gr/dscf regardless of how little or how much ammonia the refinery used in its ESP. The District\u2019s own expert disputed the conclusions of WSPA\u2019s expert. He concluded the proposed limits on PM10 and ammonia emissions were technologically feasible and sustainable. Nevertheless this expert recommended increasing the PM10 limit to 0.005 gr/dscf to account for space constraints at some of the refineries, which could affect their ability to install the equipment necessary to meet the proposed limit of 0.0042 gr/dscf.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Prior to submitting the proposed rule to the District\u2019s board for approval the staff prepared and publicly circulated an environmental assessment which acknowledged that even with mitigating measures the construction of the new or modified ESP\u2019s needed to comply with the proposed rule could cause significant short-term impacts on air quality. Despite this adverse environmental impact the staff recommended adoption of the proposed rule because its long-term benefits outweighed its short-term detriments.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">At a public hearing the District\u2019s board heard presentations by its staff and representatives of WSPA along with testimony from a refinery representative and members of the public. Following the hearing the board voted to adopt the environmental assessment and the proposed rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">D. <em>WSPA\u2019s Petition for Writ of Mandate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">WSPA filed suit in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County challenging the legality of rule 1105.1. The suit seeks a writ of mandate under Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>Civil Procedure section 1085<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and injunctive and declaratory relief on the grounds the rule is arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion, lacks adequate evidentiary support and was adopted without adherence to proper administrative procedures. In particular, the complaint alleges rule 1105.1 establishes emission limits for PM 10, which are neither feasible nor cost effective, and was adopted without proper adherence to the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Prior to a hearing on the writ petition WSPA moved for an order requiring the District to correct the administrative record to include all documents created prior to 2002 addressing the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of proposed rule 1105.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The trial court denied the motion to correct the record and denied the writ. WSPA filed a timely appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">I. <em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">The parties agree the District\u2019s adoption of rule 1105.1 was a quasi-legislative action. As such the authority of the trial court \u201cis limited to determining whether the decision of the agency was arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support, or unlawfully or procedurally unfair.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This limited judicial review is further constrained by the recognition that \u201c[i]n technical matters requiring the assistance of experts and the study of marshaled scientific data as reflected herein, courts will permit administrative agencies to work out their problems with as little judicial interference as possible.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">We review the trial court\u2019s decision de novo under the same standard.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>H. <em>SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE DISTRICT\u2019S DETERMINATION THE LIMIT ON PM10 EMISSIONS IN RULE 1105.1 IS ACHIEVABLE BY THE REFINERIES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The experts consulted by the District and WSPA agreed that given the right circumstances a reduction of PM10 emissions to 0.005 gr/dscf is achievable with existing technology.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The issues before the District\u2019s board were what are the \u201cright circumstances\u201d and whether they exist or can they be created at the six affected refineries.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">WSPA\u2019s own experts on ESP design and operation testified the most important factors in trapping PM 10 emissions are the size of the unit, the amount of heat inside the unit and the amount of redundancy built into the unit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">The District relied on a variety of evidence showing the affected refineries could design and build ESP\u2019s which were big enough, hot enough and had enough redundancy to achieve the PM 10 and ammonia limits contained in rule 1105.1.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We summarize below this evidence and the \u201cescape routes\u201d built into the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">A. <em>Refinery A</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">The principal evidence supporting the rule consisted of test results from refinery A, one of the six affected refineries, which showed during the period 1993 to 1997 the refinery consistently met or bettered the rule\u2019s requirements as to PM10 and ammonia emissions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Refinery A was retested in 2003 and again met both the PM 10 and ammonia standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">WSPA contends refinery A\u2019s achievements are not a fair indication the other refineries can meet the standards prescribed by rule 1105.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">Because of the configuration of refinery A\u2019s FCCU its emissions were tested before they passed through a \u201cCO boiler,\u201d which produces additional PM10. The evidence showed, however, one of the other refineries also has its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>CO boiler downstream of its ESP. There is nothing in the District\u2019s rules to prevent a refinery from placing its CO boiler downstream or eliminating the CO boiler altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">WSPA also contends the other refineries do not have sufficient space available to duplicate the size of refinery A\u2019s ESP. WSPA cites no evidence to back up this contention. A consultant hired by the District reached the opposite conclusion based on its site visits to each of the refineries.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">WSPA next contends refinery A\u2019s lower PM10 emissions were not solely the result of installing a new ESP in 1993 but were due in part to other changes in the refinery\u2019s system which impacted FCCU emissions. The record contains no evidence, however, to support WSPA\u2019s conclusion the \u201cother changes\u201d made at the same time the new ESP was installed helped reduce the refinery A\u2019s PM 10 emissions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Even assuming such a correlation exists, WSPA produced no evidence the other refineries could not make the same changes refinery A made or that the cost of these changes would be prohibitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Finally, WSPA states refinery A operates \u201ca more efficient hot ESP while other refineries\u2019 configurations require that they use less efficient <em>cold </em>ESP\u2019s.\u201d (Italics added.) Again WSPA cites no evidence in the record to support the quoted statement. What the record does show is that ESP\u2019s typically operate at a temperature of 500 to 700 degrees and that ESP\u2019s can be designed for all six refineries to operate at those temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">As to redundancy, the District\u2019s consultant concluded ESP\u2019s could be designed and installed at the affected refineries to meet the requirements of rule 1105.1 with 25 percent of their ESP\u2019s out of service. Although WSPA\u2019s expert disputed this conclusion, it was up to the District\u2019s board to decide which expert\u2019s opinion to accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">B. <em>Evaluations by ESP Manufacturers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The District staff consulted with several ESP manufacturers in determining whether the proposed rule was feasible. While all the manufacturers hedged and qualified their responses, none stated the rule\u2019s requirements could not be met. For example, McGill AirClean Corporation stated its dry ESP\u2019s \u201chave shown they can achieve the outer level of 0.005 gr/scf(d) on FCC units\u201d and Southern Environmental Corporation stated it could \u201cguarantee\u201d a PM10 emission standard of 0.005 gr/dscf using a dry ESP unit so long as there was enough room to install the unit and the ESP could use some ammonia injection.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>C. <em>Evaluation by ESP Consultant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The six affected refineries were evaluated by James Campbell, a consultant with many years experience in working with ESP\u2019s. After making site visits to each refinery Campbell concluded a PM10 limit of 0.0042 gr/dscf was \u201ctechnically feasible with the use of dry [ESP\u2019s] and without any ammonia conditioning.\u201d Campbell also concluded, however, three of the refineries would have difficulty meeting this standard on a consistent basis because of space limitations affecting redundancy. For this reason Campbell recommended, and the board adopted, a higher emission limit of 0.005 gr/dscf with 10 ppmv of ammonia slip.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">D. <em>Alternatives to Complying with the Rule\u2019s Emission Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">The availability of three \u201cescape routes\u201d from the rule\u2019s emission standards further convinces us the board acted reasonably in adopting the mle.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">Rule 1105.1 requires each refinery to comply with the PM 10 and ammonia limits by December 31, 2006. Refineries, however, may request an extension up to December 31, 2008 in order to synchronize the installation of PM 10 control devices with their normal FCCU turnaround times.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">A refinery which finds it cannot meet the PM10 emissions standard of 0.005 gr/dscf is permitted to emit PM10 not to exceed 0.006 gr/dscf so long as the 0.001 gr/dscf difference is mitigated by alternative control measures.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Finally, recognizing there were arguments against the rule\u2019s feasibility by respectable industry sources, the District staff promised at the public hearing on the rule it would monitor the refineries\u2019 progress in meeting the rule, report back to the board, and make adjustments in the mle if adjustments are necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">These alternatives appear to address WSPA\u2019s concerns other refineries may not be able to duplicate the emissions of refinery A.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">For the reasons discussed above we conclude the record contains substantial evidence the refineries will be able to comply with mle 1105.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">III. <em>THE DISTRICT PROPERLY DETERMINED THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF RULE 1105.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">Before the District can adopt a new regulation which \u201cwill significantly affect. . . emissions limitations\u201d the District must, to the extent data is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>available, \u201cperform an assessment of the socioeconomic impacts of the adoption ... of the rule or regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The socioeconomic impact of an emission limitation includes \u201c[t]he range of probable costs, including costs to industry, of the rule or regulation\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and \u201c[t]he availability and cost-effectiveness of alternatives to the rule or regulation, as determined pursuant to [Health and Safety Code] section 40922.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In adopting a regulation the District must consider and make available to the public its findings related to the cost effectiveness of a control measure determined pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 40922 \u201cas well as the basis for the findings and the considerations involved.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Furthermore, the District \u201cshall make reasonable efforts, to the extent feasible within existing budget constraints, to make specific reference to the direct costs expected to be incurred by regulated parties, including businesses and individuals.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">The record shows the total cost of installing new ESP\u2019s at the five refineries that currently do not meet the 0.005 gr/dscf standard will be in the range of $88 million to $100 million. Based on these figures the District staff estimated the cost effectiveness of the rule to be between $3000 and $5000 per ton of PM 10 and ammonia reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">WSPA argues the District failed to properly evaluate the costs of the proposed rule because it ignored WSPA\u2019s site-specific data and used generic equipment cost indexes instead. The record refutes this claim. It shows the District\u2019s consultant, SP Environmental, visited each of the six refineries to review the costs associated with rule 1105.1. Each visit included a session reviewing the basis of each refinery\u2019s cost estimates for the proposed rule and obtaining additional information regarding site-specific conditions and space availability. The consultant walked each site to assess the options available. Based upon the information obtained during these site visits the consultant prepared independent cost estimates for each refinery.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">WSPA also contends the District violated the requirement it consider \u201c[t]he availability and cost-effectiveness of alternatives to the [proposed] rule or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>regulation\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> by failing to consider an alternative rule proposed by WSPA, which would have limited PM10 emissions to 0.008 gr/dscf instead of the 0.005 gr/dscf limit contained in rule 1105.1. Again the record rebuts this claim. District staff advised WSPA it had conducted \u201can incremental cost analysis that indicates that the incremental cost effectiveness of between 0.008 gr/dscf and 0.005 gr/dscf is only $12,000 per additional ton of reductions, which is very cost effective.\u201d In addition WSPA\u2019s 0.008 proposal was discussed at length at the public hearing on the 0.005 standard. WSPA\u2019s representatives presented and explained their proposal to the District board and responded to the board\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Finally WSPA maintains the vendors who supplied the District staff with cost estimates were inexperienced in building ESP\u2019s and the District\u2019s consultant was incompetent to evaluate the costs of complying with the proposed rule. The District board, however, was aware of the qualifications of the consultants used by its staff and by WSPA. It chose to rely on the consultants chosen by its staff. As our Supreme Court has noted, \u201cThe choice between conflicting expert analysis is for the [board], not the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We find nothing in the record which would allow us to say the choice in this case was unreasonable, especially when we consider WSPA\u2019s experts were unable to say their 0.008 standard was any more feasible than the 0.005 standard they claimed was infeasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">We conclude for the reasons stated above the District adequately assessed the cost effectiveness of rule 1105.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">IV. <em>THE DISTRICT PREPARED AN ADEQUATE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF RULE 1105.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">WSPA concedes CEQA<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> did not require the District to prepare a full-blown environmental impact report before adopting rule 1105.1. Rather, the District was only required to prepare a less formal environmental assessment (EA). Nevertheless, WSPA contends, the District did not even meet the less stringent standards for an EA because it focused exclusively on the environmental impact of installing new dry ESP\u2019s and ignored the environmental impact of installing wet ESP\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Admittedly wet ESP technology differs from dry ESP technology in two important respects. In order to operate a wet ESP the flue gas in the FCCU would have to be cooled down from 500 to 700 degrees to approximately 170 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>degrees. In addition a wet ESP, as the name implies, uses water to wash the trapped particles from the collecting plates creating a stream of polluted liquid waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">WSPA argues the additional energy needed for the cooling and the discharge of the waste water could have significant environmental impacts and should have been analyzed in the EA.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">This argument contains a fatal flaw, however. There is no evidence in the record any of the affected refineries intends to use wet ESP technology to meet the emission standards of rule 1105.1. On the contrary, the record shows (1) no refinery has ever used wet ESP technology to reduce particulate emissions from FCCU\u2019s; (2) the refineries\u2019 consistent position (through WSPA) has been the 0.005 gr/dscf standard is unattainable regardless of the ESP technology used; and (3) contrary to the refineries\u2019 position there is substantial evidence the affected refineries can meet the rule\u2019s emission standards with dry ESP\u2019s (see discussion <em>ante </em>at pp. 1019-1021.)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">An EA is only required to address \u201csignificant or potentially significant effects\u201d a project might have on the environment.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Clearly, a technology no one intends to use cannot have a \u201csignificant or potentially significant effect\u201d on the environment.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">We conclude, therefore, the District met its obligation under CEQA to conduct an environmental assessment of its proposed rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">V. <em>THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY DENIED WSPA\u2019S MOTION TO CORRECT THE SCOPE AND ACCURACY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Prior to the hearing on its petition for writ of mandate WSPA moved the court for an order requiring the District to supplement the administrative record with documents relating to rule 1105.1 created prior to January 2002 but not considered by the District board when it adopted the rule in November 2003. WSPA claimed that although the rule was first conceived in 1989 the administrative record contained only a smattering of documents from the period 1989 to 2001. Allegedly missing from the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>record were tests, data, internal memoranda and public comments casting doubts on the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the rule as originally proposed.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The District responded with declarations from its staff members who testified they had turned over every document in their possession relating to a rule to reduce PM10 emissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">At the hearing on its motion WSPA produced no evidence to dispute the testimony of the District staff; it merely argued the District would \u201clook harder\u201d for the documents if the trial court ordered it to do so. The court found that while some older documents may have been destroyed, the uncontradicted evidence showed the District had made a reasonable search for all existing documents and included them in the administrative record of rule 1105.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">We conclude the trial court ruled correctly in denying WSPA\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding the District made a diligent search for all records pertaining to the proposed rule limiting PM10 emissions. Furthermore, the destruction of some of these records, at least absent a showing of bad faith, would not invalidate the rule. Our Supreme Court has held \u201cextra-record evidence is generally not admissible in traditional mandamus actions challenging quasi-legislative administrative decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> And, while the court recognized some exceptions to this general rule,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> it stated \u201cextra-record evidence can <em>never </em>be admitted merely to contradict the evidence the administrative agency relied on in making a quasi-legislative decision or to raise a question regarding the wisdom of that decision.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Since these were exactly the purposes for which WSPA sought the extra-record evidence in the present case, the evidence would have been inadmissible even if it had been located.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The judgment is affirmed.
