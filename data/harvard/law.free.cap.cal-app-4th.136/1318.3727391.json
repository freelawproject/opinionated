In October 2002, the Board of Prison Terms (now Board of Parole Hearings; hereafter Board) determined that Bums was not suitable for parole and deferred further consideration of parole for five years on the ground that it was unreasonable to expect Bums to be found suitable for parole within that period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">On Bums\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus, the trial court found the Board had no reasonable justification for deferring parole consideration for five years. The court ordered issuance of a writ directing the Board to amend its decision to reflect a deferral period of three years, and to place Bums on its October 2005 hearing calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">On appeal, the Board contends the order for writ must be reversed because (1) some evidence supports the five-year deferral and (2) alternatively, the court should not have ordered a three-year deferral and instead should have directed the Board to reconsider its decision. For reasons we shall explain, the first contention has merit and requires reversal of the judgment (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-12\">\n<em>The murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-13\">Eighteen-year-old Bums had enjoyed a long and close relationship with 19-year-old Katina Salamo and her family. However, during an argument in August 1979, Bums threatened to kill Katina. At about this time, a pistol was taken from Katina\u2019s father\u2019s store where Bums was employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>About 3:00 a.m. on the day before Katina was to start college, Bums awakened her and her younger sisters by throwing rocks at their bedroom window. They looked outside and saw him return to his house across the street. Then, their telephone repeatedly rang one time and stopped. Katina spoke to Bums during one call and became frightened. After a few minutes, the girls heard what appeared to be the sound of someone climbing the wall of their home. They then saw Bums mnning back across the street to his house. Later that day, the Salamo family attended a barbecue at a relative\u2019s house in Stockton to celebrate Katina\u2019s entry into college.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">The next day, as the S alamo family checked out of their Stockton hotel, Katina saw Bums in the hotel lobby and asked her father, \u201cwhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d Katina looked confused and stressed by Bums\u2019s sudden appearance. When asked, Bums said that his enrollment at the college was a \u201csurprise.\u201d Bums had an unfamiliar look on his face when he said that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">At 6:00 p.m., the Salamos kissed Katina goodbye and left for home. When it became dark, Bums called Katina at her dorm room to arrange a meeting. She had decided that she no longer wished to date him and wished to devote her energies to her studies. As she left for the meeting, she prophetically told a roommate that she was going to meet Bums \u201cfor the last time.\u201d The meeting place was in a dark and isolated area. During the meeting, Bums shot Katina in the head using the gun he had stolen from her father. Bums later claimed that he had spent the evening watching Monday Night Football.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">Bums\u2019s version of the murder changed over time. When first questioned, he denied any involvement. The next day, he claimed Katina struck him with her fist, pulled out a firearm and fired at him; he was unclear as to how many shots were fired, whether he was shot and how she was shot. Bums later admitted taking the gun from the store; he claimed Katina hit him and he shot her as she walked away. Still later, he claimed she pulled the gun from her purse; they struggled and the gun accidentally discharged. Finally, in a 1995 psychiatric evaluation, Bums stated that he carried the gun in order to \u201cbe impressive\u201d; as he argued with Katina, he \u201cwent into outrage, lost control, and then shot her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">\n<em>Parole proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-9\">Parole consideration hearings were conducted for Bums in 1990, 1992, 1994 and 1995. At the next hearing in 1998, the Board denied parole and deferred parole consideration for four years. Bums was instructed to become discipline-free, and to participate in self-help and therapy as available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>Four years later, on October 1, 2002, the Board conducted the hearing that is the subject of this appeal. Bums appeared by counsel but not in person. Four members of Katina\u2019s family attended, as did a deputy district attorney, a victims services representative and several observers. In addition, 58 victim advocates from across the state came to the prison where the hearing was held. Katina\u2019s father presented approximately 2,000 letters and 10,000 signatures on a petition opposing parole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board also considered several letters from public officials opposing parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">The Board concluded that Bums was not suitable for parole because his release would pose an unreasonable risk to the public. In support of its conclusion, the Board found \u201c[t]he offense was carried out in an exceptionally cruel, callous, or violent and brutal manner. The offense was carried out in a dispassionate manner. The offense was carried out in a manner which demonstrates an exceptionally callous disregard for human suffering and life.\u201d To support these findings, the Board reiterated its statement of facts, which we summarized <em>ante. </em>The Board noted that Bums had \u201ctold a number of stories\u201d regarding the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">The Board noted that Bums had received a variety of psychological diagnoses over the years and that he \u201chas not sufficiently participated in meaningful therapy programming.\u201d The Board criticized a 1998 psychological evaluation for claiming that Bums had \u201cnever incurred disciplinary reports,\u201d when in fact Bums had incurred a \u201cvery significant disciplinary report\u201d after sending his semen through the mail to an inmate with whom he had had a sexual relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">The Board found that the letter containing the semen was \u201cvery specific in regards to [Bums\u2019s] desire to control this other inmate and pleads with that inmate and makes statements such as, to death us do part and again, I\u2019m begging you not to,\u201d by which Bums was \u201ctrying to prompt this individual not to leave him.\u201d This letter, along with others that Bums wrote to the inmate, were significant to show that Bums had \u201cthis possessive nature . . . which seems to go hand in hand with the possessiveness he showed with the victim prior to the murder and up to the time of the murder.\u201d The Board read excerpts of the letters into the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">The board further found that Bums engaged in the same sort of stalking behavior when he sent a series of 23 letters to Katina\u2019s father, who is also Bums\u2019s godfather, even after family members asked and told Bums to leave them alone. Katina\u2019s father described the letters for the record. In one letter, Bums stated that he would appear at the 2002 parole hearing by counsel but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>not in person; added that, if released on parole, he would live with his grandmother in the same neighborhood as the Salamos; and invited Katina\u2019s father to meet with him at the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">The Board found it \u201chard to understand\u201d why Bums, who had undergone psychological counseling for so many years, still engaged in stalking behavior as late as 1996 or 1998. The letters demonstrated that Bums needed additional time for psychological \u201cevaluation.\u201d Thus, the Board found: \u201c[Bums] needs additional time in order to fully understand and deal with the causation factors that led to the commitment of the [murder]. He needs therapy in order to face, discuss, understand, and cope with stress in a non-destructive manner. Until progress is made, [Bums] continues to be unpredictable and a threat to others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">In a \u201cseparate decision,\u201d the Board found it was \u201cnot reasonable to expect\u201d that parole would be granted at a hearing during the following five years. After reiterating the facts of the offense, the Board again found that Bums committed the offense in an exceptionally cmel, callous, violent, and bmtal manner. The Board further found that Bums has a \u201chistory of unstable or tumultuous relationships with others,\u201d as shown by the murder, the letters he wrote to the other inmate, and the letters he wrote to Katina\u2019s father. The Board found that Bums\u2019s most recent psychological evaluations, in 1998 and 2002, were of no value because they did not address the issues raised by Bums\u2019s letters. The Board concluded \u201ca longer period of observation\u201d of Bums was required before it could find him suitable for parole. The Board requested an investigation to determine whether the letters Bums sent to Katina\u2019s father were mle violations. The Board also requested a new psychological evaluation addressing the letters to the inmate and to Katina\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">\n<em>Trial court proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">In August 2004, Bums filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus alleging, among other things, the Board improperly deferred further consideration of parole for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">The trial court found that the record did not entirely support the five-year deferral period, particularly in that the Board\u2019s recommendation for additional psychological testing may be accomplished in a much shorter time. The court issued an order to show cause, requiring a written return explaining \u201cwhy the 5 year deferral period should not be vacated and set aside and a more appropriate period of 3 years be imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>After the return was filed, the court confirmed its initial ruling. The court found \u201cthe imposition of the 5 year period was an abuse of discretion and is not supported by the record. Specifically, given the [Board\u2019s] recommendations for the next hearing, the [Board] has failed to establish any reasonable basis on which to conclude such matters cannot be completed within a 3 year period and furthermore, offers no reasonable justification for the 5 year deferral.\u201d The court ordered issuance of a writ directing the Board to (1) amend its October 1, 2002, decision to reflect a three-year deferral period, and (2) place Bums on the October 2005 parole suitability hearing calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">The Board timely appeals. In February 2005, this court denied the Board\u2019s petition for writ of supersedeas. However, we subsequently stayed further proceedings on the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">The Board contends parole decisions are reviewed under the deferential \u201csome evidence\u201d standard, and the trial court\u2019s order granting writ relief must be reversed because there is some evidence to support the five-year deferral period. In a separate argument, the Board contends that, if the evidence does not support a five-year deferral, the proper remedy is to remand to the Board for determination of a proper deferral period, rather than to order a three-year deferral. For reasons we shall explain, the Board\u2019s first argument has merit and its second argument need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">\n<em>Statutory and regulatory framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">When considering parole for an indeterminate life inmate, the Board first determines suitability for parole. If it finds the inmate suitable, the Board establishes a parole release date. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3041, subd. (a); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402, subd. (a); see <em>In re Dannenberg, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 1091.) Conversely, if the Board concludes that public safety requires a lengthier period of incarceration, parole will be denied. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3041, subd. (b); <em>In re Dannenberg, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 1091.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">In making this determination, the Board considers \u201c[a]ll relevant, reliable information available,\u201d including the circumstances of the inmate\u2019s social history, past and present mental state, past criminal history, the commitment offense(s), the inmate\u2019s attitude toward the crime, and any other information that bears on the inmate\u2019s suitability for release. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>If the inmate is found unsuitable and parole is denied, the Board must conduct subsequent parole consideration hearings annually. There are two exceptions to annual review; one is relevant here. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3041.5, subd. (b)(2).) If the inmate has been convicted of murder, the hearing may be deferred for \u201c[u]p to five years,\u201d if \u201cthe board finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted at a hearing during the following years____\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3041.5, subd. (b)(2)(B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">The Board\u2019s decision to defer the annual hearing must be guided by the same criteria used to determine parole suitability. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2270, subd. (d), citing <em>id.., </em>\u00a7 2402.) Thus, the reasons for refusing to set a parole date need not be completely different from the reasons for excepting an inmate\u2019s case from annual review. \u201cThe latter decision involves a prediction that at least during the period of the postponement, an inmate will not likely become suitable for parole. That prediction may involve some of the same facts on which the unsuitability determination is based. What is required, however, is an identification of reasons which justify the postponement.\u201d <em>(In re Jackson </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 464, 479 [216 Cal.Rptr. 760, 703 P.2d 100]; cf. <em>People v. Belmontes </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 335, 347 [193 Cal.Rptr. 882, 667 P.2d 686].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">Under the Board\u2019s regulations, \u201cCircumstances Tending to Show Unsuitability\u201d for parole include \u201cThe prisoner committed the offense in an especially heinous, atrocious or cruel manner.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402, subd. (c)(1).) When determining whether the offense was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, the Board considers several factors, including one that is relevant here: \u201c(D) The offense was carried out in a manner which demonstrates an exceptionally callous disregard for human suffering.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402, subd. (c)(1)(B) &amp; (D).) The factors described in the regulations are \u201cgeneral guidelines; the importance attached to any circumstance or combination of circumstances in a particular case is left to\u201d the judgment of the Board. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2402, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">Another circumstance tending to show unsuitability is \u201cUnstable Social History. The prisoner has a history of unstable or tumultuous relationships with others.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402, subd. (c)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">In addition to the nature of the commitment offense, the Board may consider any other information that bears on the inmate\u2019s suitability for release. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">\u201c[T]he judicial branch is authorized to review the factual basis of a decision of the Board denying parole in order to ensure that the decision comports with the requirements of due process of law, but... in conducting such a review, the court may inquire only whether some evidence in the record before the Board supports the decision to deny parole, based upon the factors specified by statute and regulation. If the decision\u2019s consideration of the specified factors is not supported by some evidence in the record and thus is devoid of a factual basis, the court should grant the prisoner\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus and should order the Board to vacate its decision denying parole and thereafter to proceed in accordance with due process of law. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Rosenkrantz </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 616, 658 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 104, 59 P.3d 174], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">As noted, the Board found, in \u201ca separate decision,\u201d that it was not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted at a hearing within the ensuing five years. In so finding, the Board relied in part on one factor related to the commitment offense and one factor related to Burns\u2019s relationships with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">The Board first found that Bums committed the offense \u201cin an exceptionally cruel, callous, violent, and bmtal manner.\u201d (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402, subd. (c)(1).) Specifically, the Board found that Bums committed the offense in \u201ca manner which demonstrates an exceptionally callous disregard for human suffering and life.\u201d (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402, subd. (c)(1)(D).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">The record contains \u201csome evidence\u201d that Bums committed the murder in a manner that demonstrates an exceptionally callous disregard for human suffering and fife. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402, subd. (c)(1)(D); <em>In re Rosenkrantz, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 658.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">There was evidence that, after luring Katina to an isolated spot and shooting her, Bums did not summon help or stay to help her. Instead he walked away, climbed the stairway of his dormitory building from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>Katina might have been visible, and entered his dorm room, where he lay down on his bed and may have joined his roommate who was watching Monday Night Football. Meanwhile Katina, who had been shot between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m., was not found until 9:45 p.m. When found, she was lying on her back and moaning. Her body had scratches indicating that she may have tried to obtain help. Katina was not pronounced dead until after midnight. Thus, Bums had approximately one to two hours in which he could have reconsidered his disregard for Katina\u2019s suffering and life, but he did not do so. (Compare <em>In re Smith </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 343, 367 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 655] [no evidence the inmate unnecessarily prolonged pain or suffering].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">The Board also found that Bums has a history of unstable or tumultuous relationships with others. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402, subd. (c)(3).) The record contains \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting this finding. <em>(In re Rosenkrantz, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 658.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">The Board first noted that this factor was shown \u201cby the instant offense.\u201d The Board found it was further shown by Bums\u2019s 1996 letter to the inmate with whom he had shared a sexual relationship. According to the Board, the letter \u201ccontains statements that show [Bums\u2019s] desire to possess and to threaten if he can\u2019t have his way and then make statements that\u2014such as, to death do us part.\u201d The letter also made reference to Bums \u201cbeing abandoned and left for dead, which . . . just conjures up the night of the shooting; if you abandon me and left me for dead.\u201d Finally, the Board noted that Katina\u2019s \u201cfather has been receiving letters also.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">Because a hearing postponement \u201cmay involve some of the same facts on which the [parole] unsuitability determination is based\u201d <em>(In re Jackson, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 479), we may consider the Board\u2019s discussion of parole unsuitability for the purpose of illuminating the Board\u2019s reasons justifying the postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">After discussing Bums\u2019s letters to the inmate and Katina\u2019s father, the Board found \u201cthat [Bums] needs additional time for psychological evaluation.\u201d The Board commented that it was \u201chard to understand [why] an individual [who] has gone through psychological counseling as long as he has . . . still has this problem as late as 1998 or 1996.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the series of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>letters to Katina\u2019s father extended beyond 1998 to the vicinity of the 2002 parole hearing, the Board could deduce that Bums still had a stalking problem notwithstanding several more years of psychological counseling. In short, there was <em>some </em>evidence supporting the Board\u2019s decision to defer parole consideration for five years. <em>(In re Rosenkrantz, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 658.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\">The trial court\u2019s contrary finding appears to have been based, not upon the evidence as a whole, but upon the Board\u2019s \u201crecommendations for the next hearing.\u201d The Board recommended that an investigation be conducted as to whether Bums\u2019s letters constituted prison mle violations, and recommended that Bums undergo a psychological evaluation that considers and addresses his letters. The trial court correctly noted that there was no reasonable basis to conclude that those two matters required more than three years to complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">However, the Board\u2019s five-year deferral of parole consideration was not based solely on its desires for a new psychological evaluation and an investigation of possible mies violations. Rather, as we have explained, the Board properly considered that Bums\u2019s offense was especially cmel and callous and that his progress during many years of psychological counseling preceding the 2002 parole hearing had been demonstrably insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">We emphasize that the Board sought a new psychological evaluation because the prior evaluations had overlooked evidence <em>supporting </em>the Board\u2019s conclusions that Bums was unsuitable for parole, and that future parole consideration should be deferred for five years. Bums does not contend, and the record does not suggest, the new evaluation would have been <em>more favorable </em>toward Bums than the prior evaluations. Thus, the fact the evaluation could be completed in less than five years does not suggest that the five-year deferral was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">In sum, the evidence supports a finding \u201cthat it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted at a hearing during the following years . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3041.5, subd. (b)(2)(B).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the Board\u2019s decision had a factual basis and was supported by evidence in the record, Bums\u2019s habeas corpus petition should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">The judgment (order granting writ of habeas corpus) is reversed.

(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 150 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 825 P.2d 781]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wharton </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 522, 563 [280 Cal.Rptr. 631, 809 P.2d 290].) In any event, the claim has no merit. Excerpts of the letters were read into the record or summarized for the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1115-8\"> Our conclusion is not based upon the magnitude or the quantity of opposition to parole expressed by the victim\u2019s family and members of the community. We need not consider Burns\u2019s contention that the Board improperly \u201cgave in to pressure from those opposing . . . Burns\u2019s parole.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
