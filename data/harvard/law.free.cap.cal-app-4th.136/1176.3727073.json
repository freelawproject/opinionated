Because the court refused to instruct the jury on imperfect self-defense, we reverse and remand for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">Vicente Vasquez was charged with murdering his cousin, Ramon Arechiga. He pleaded not guilty and was tried by jury. At trial, one of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>cousins testified during the People\u2019s case-in-chief that appellant admitted he killed Arechiga. According to the cousin, appellant said he invited Arechiga to a party, where appellant asked Arechiga to join him and some of appellant\u2019s friends in a nearby alley. In the alley, appellant, who was confined to a wheelchair, confronted Arechiga about Arechiga\u2019s reportedly having raped appellant\u2019s deceased younger brother years earlier. Reacting to appellant\u2019s accusation, Arechiga lunged at appellant and began to choke him. In response, appellant pulled out a gun and repeatedly shot Arechiga, killing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The jury acquitted appellant of first degree murder, but convicted him of murder in the second degree. The court sentenced appellant to state prison for 40 years to life. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Appellant asked the court to instruct the jury on imperfect self-defense. Imperfect self-defense is the actual, but unreasonable, belief in the need to resort to self-defense to protect oneself from imminent peril. <em>(In re Christian S. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 768, 773, 783 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 872 P.2d 574]; <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1270 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 345].) When imperfect self-defense applies, it reduces a homicide from murder to voluntary manslaughter because the killing lacks malice aforethought. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Blakeley </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 82, 87-88 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 451, 999 P.2d 675]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 674 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1], disapproved on another point in <em>In re Christian S., supra, </em>at p. 777.)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">The court stated two reasons for refusing to instruct on imperfect self-defense. First, the court found as a factual matter that appellant did not believe he was in imminent peril from Arechiga\u2019s attack. The court said, \u201cthere\u2019s no statements in [appellant\u2019s] confession or statement, there\u2019s no physical evidence, there\u2019s no discussion, there\u2019s nothing that suggests that your client felt he was not [ric] in danger . . . . [f] . . . How could he have felt imminent harm when he\u2019s holding a gun and someone is approaching him with their hands?\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>The record does not support the court. The prosecution\u2019s chief witness against appellant testified Arechiga was choking appellant when appellant drew his gun and shot Arechiga. It was for the jury sitting as the trier of fact to decide whether appellant actually feared serious injury or death from being choked. <em>(People v. Barton </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 201 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 906 P.2d 531]; <em>In re Christian S., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 783 [\u201cwhether the defendant actually held the required belief is to be determined by the trier of fact based on all the relevant facts.\u201d].) That appellant had a gun to rebuff Arechiga\u2019s attack does not mean appellant could not have believed his life was in peril\u2014in fact, a defendant claiming imperfect self-defense will <em>always </em>have had the means to rebuff the victim\u2019s attack, or else the homicide would not have occurred. In our holding it was the jury\u2019s role to determine appellant\u2019s state of mind, we do not ignore the plentiful evidence suggesting appellant\u2019s criminal intent in the alley.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold only that it was for the jury, not the judge, to infer what appellant believed if it accepted the evidence that Arechiga attacked appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">The second reason the court refused to instruct on imperfect self-defense was its conclusion that appellant had created the need to defend himself by luring Arechiga to the alley to confront him. The court said, appellant \u201cset up the situation where [Arechiga] then sought to protect himself. That is, he told [Arechiga]: \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you.\u2019[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] [][] Anybody else in that situation, with somebody else\u2019s friends, having that person tell them that: T know you molested my brother,\u2019 is obviously going to respond in some way. He set that situation up. He put him in an alley. He put a gun on him, and he had his friends there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">The court\u2019s second reason interpreted imperfect self-defense too narrowly, a misinterpretation respondent echoes in arguing the defense is not available to a defendant who \u201cinduces a quarrel that leads to an adversary\u2019s attack.\u201d Neither the court nor respondent is precisely correct. Imperfect self-defense does not apply if a defendant\u2019s conduct creates circumstances where the victim is <em>legally </em>justified in resorting to self-defense against the defendant. <em>(In re Christian S., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 773, fn. 1 [imperfect self-defense unavailable when defendant \u201chas created circumstances under which his adversary\u2019s attack or pursuit is legally justified\u201d].) But the defense is available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>when the victim\u2019s use of force against the defendant is unlawful, even when the defendant set in motion the chain of events that led the victim to attack the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\"><em>People v. Randle </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 987 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 725, 111 P.3d 987] <em>(Randle), </em>illustrates the distinction. In that case, the defendant and his accomplice were burglarizing a car when a relative of the car\u2019s owner came upon them. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 991.) The defendant and his accomplice fled, but the relative and car\u2019s owner chased them down and began to beat the accomplice severely. To save his accomplice from serious injury or even death, the defendant pulled out his gun and killed the car owner\u2019s relative. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 992.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">On review, the Supreme Court held the defendant was entitled to a jury instruction on imperfect defense of another. <em>(Randle, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 993.) As in our case, both the defendant in <em>Randle </em>and appellant were up to no good\u2014plainly so in <em>Randle </em>who was obviously committing a crime, and arguably so with appellant when he invited Arechiga to the alley. And both the defendant in <em>Randle </em>and appellant generally set in motion the circumstances that led their victims to attack them. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1001-1003.) But in each case, the evidence suggested the victims, not the defendants, used unlawful force first. Accordingly, appellant was entitled to assert imperfect self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">The court\u2019s erroneous refusal to instruct on imperfect self-defense was not harmless. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) The murder charge against appellant was not airtight. Jury deliberations spanned three days for an uncomplicated one-count case turning on appellant\u2019s state of mind when he fired his gun. Despite his being accused of first degree murder, the jury acquitted appellant of that charge, meaning it found appellant did not go to the alley with a willful, deliberate, and premeditated plan to kill his cousin. Instead, it convicted him of the lesser included offense of second degree murder. The jury\u2019s verdict implies it found appellant formed his intent to kill only under the immediate circumstances of the confrontation in the alley, which is consistent with second degree murder but is also equally consistent with voluntary manslaughter arising from imperfect self-defense. Because the evidence could have allowed a reasonable jury to conclude appellant actually believed his fife was in imminent peril as Arechiga choked him, the murder conviction cannot stand and appellant must be retried.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">The judgment is reversed. The matter is remanded for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"AbG\">Cooper, P. J., and Flier, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-8\"> It is unclear what the court meant in saying appellant was \u201cholding a gun.\u201d If the court meant to suggest appellant was pointing a gun, or that his gun was even visible, when Arechiga initially lunged toward him, the record does not support the court. The only evidence on the point was the testimony of appellant\u2019s cousin, which was appellant drew his gun after Arechiga started to choke him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b973-7\"> On the record before us, a reasonable jury could have concluded that in creating the situation appellant intended to kill all along. A reasonable jury could also have concluded that appellant only intended to confront Arechiga with the accusation of rape and it was only after Arechiga attacked him that appellant formed the intent to kill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b973-8\"> The record does not show appellant ever said \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d Instead, the court appears to be putting into words the unspoken message it believed appellant intended to convey to Arechiga when appellant invited Arechiga to the alley to accuse him of raping appellant\u2019s late brother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b974-7\"> In light of our holding, we need not address whether the record supports an instruction on manslaughter based on provocation. Because the facts that may be developed at any retrial may differ from those before us, that issue is better left to the trial court in the first instance. We also do not address the defense of self-defense (as opposed to <em>imperfect </em>self-defense) as appellant did not raise it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
