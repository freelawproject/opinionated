The \u2019 auditor, appointed to distribute the fund, awarded without dispute, debt, interest and costs to the mortgagees, and \u2018f of the balance of the fund to the owner of \u00a7 interest in the land, &gt; the other third thereof-remained to be awarded to the owner of the disputed third interest in the premises.. J. E. Peters claimed under a deed, for one undivided third, dated June 10;, 1881, recorded June 25th, 1881, from Jacob M. Peters. Samuel T. Jaquett claimed the same by virtue of a certain agree-ment, dated April 8th, 1881, in the form of. a receipt, sighed, by. the said Jacob M. Peters, the grantor above named,1 and: delivered to Frederick Sylvester, therein styled agent; wherein the said Jacob M. Peters acknowledged - the; receipt'Of \"$500 from the .said Frederick Sylvester, therein' ah agent,'dep\u00f3sito^ to secure the consummation of a sale of the said preihises. \"- It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>was an undivided third interest therein, and the said Jacob M. Peters agreed therein, and thereby, within 30 days from the date thereof to grant and convey unto the said Frederick Sylvester, agent or his assigns said \u00a7 interest for the sum of $5,000, $500 whereof was deposited by the said Frederick Sylvester, agent, to the said Jacob M. Peters. An abstract of title was produced, showing that the said Jacob M. Peters was seized of an undivided interest in the said premises described in this agreement to sell. Subsequently on the 23rd November, 1881, the said Frederick Sylvester assigned and transferred to Samuel T, Jaquett, his heirs and assigns, the said contract of sale and the money therein acknowledged to have been paid, and all of his right, title and interest in and to the said real estate reciting therein, the said agreement of April 8,1881, and the assignment to Jaquett was recorded on Nov. 26, 1881. The auditor found that J. E. Peters had acknowledged this agreement, but he (Peters) contends that Sylvester and Jaquett had been in default, by reason whereof the said sale had not been consummated. Jaquett contends that he was the principal of the contract, was at all times ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. That the cause of the failure to consummate a contract, rested upon Jacob M. Peters, contending that Mr. Sylvester was the agent of Jacob M. Peters, and not his agent. A deed had been prepared and executed by Jacob M. Peters, for the said J interest, and was ready for delivery on the 9th May, 1881, at the office of Mr. Sylvester, and Jaquett was ready to pay the balance of the purchase money, $4,500. Frederick Sylvester had prepared a statement of debits and credits between Jacob M. Petera and Samuel T. Jaquett, adjusting the interests, taxes. &amp;c., about which there seems to-have be\u00e9u no dispute. Mr. Sylvester offered to pay to Jacob M. Peters the' balance due him, less, however,. $130, his commission j which he \u2019 claimed from the -grantor, as broker, in negotiating the sale. Jacob M. Peters refused to pay any commission and declined to accept the sum tendered, denying that Mr. Sylvester was-his agent in the. transaction. Mr. Sylvester insisted that he should, accept the balance due, less $130, or nothing*. Jacob M. Petera persisted in his refusal and answered,-that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>being the case, bo would decline to accept such sum, and then and there declared the contract null and void. Mr. Sylvester subsequently renewed his tender, less $130 for commission, which was again refused, as aforesaid. After this Jacob M. Peters tendered to Mr. Sylvester the return of the $500, which was refused. Sylvester, on the evening of the day before the contract of sale was made, went to the residence of Jacob M. Peters in Frankfort, and tried to induce him to agree to the sale in question, but failed. lie, however, obtained from Mr. Peters the promise that he would call next morning on Mr. Sylvester. Mr. Peters called in the morning, when and where the agreement, in the shape of a receipt was made and deliv ered, which agreement is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-4\">Philadelphia; April 8,1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-5\">Eeceived from Frederick Sylvester, acting herein as agent, $500, deposited to secure the consummation of the sale of premises, &amp;c. * * * Settlement to be made free from any and all deductions, excepting taxes other than for the year \u201981, and interest prior to the last semi-annual interest period.
