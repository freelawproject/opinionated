The codicil does not in any manner interfere with or affect the life estate previously given to her husband. It is not until his death that any provision is made for the support of Paul Betz. It is therefore \u201cafter the death\u201d of her husband that Betz first acquires any right. Previous to that time he has no lien charged on the property. The husband,is still living,. It follows that Betz now has no right to the relief prayed for, and the other complainants cannot interfere with the life estate given to the husband, whether it remains with him or has passed by due course of law to a third person. It was, therefore, error to award the special injunction prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">And now, to wit, April 21, 1884, injunction dissolved and decree reversed, and bill dismissed at the costs of the appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
