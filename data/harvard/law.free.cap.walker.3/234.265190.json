There is no denial at all that this policy was duly and properly executed by the company on the fourteenth day of August, 1865. There is no doubt, because it has not been controverted, that this building was destroyed by fire; there is no doubt that it has been rebuilt at the expense of the insured. The carpenter who came here and had charge of these buildings, as an agent, was very familiar with it, and testified positively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>that he rebuilt it exactly as it was built before, aud that the prices charged by him are the usual and ordinary prices for such work. That is not controverted. The notice which the policy requires was sent to the defendant, showing the fact of the entire loss of the building, and if they had intended to dispute the amount to be recovered, they had a full and fair opportunity to do so, having offered no evidence whatever as to the value of the property, so as to impair the testimony of the carpenter. If you should think the plaintiff is entitled to recover at all she should be entitled to recover the amount of damage which the plaintiff' has been shown to have sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-4\">Although there is no denial of that, the defendant defends against the payment of this policy on two or three grounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">lie first says, and it is not controverted, that by the survey of this building, which accompanies the policy, it appears that it was the premises occupied as a four-story brick store, that was originally insured in this company. By the 13th section of the policy it is stated and agreed that the survey taken at the time of this insurance and- signed by the insured shall be the only evidence of the state of the building, and if any alteration or change be made therein, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">Now the defendant says that this provision has been violated, and that, therefore, this policy is void and of no effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">He states the violation to consist in a violation in two or three particulars of the terms aud conditions of the permanent insurance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-8\">He first says that these provisions enact that persons exercising any particular occupation \u201cherein mentioned, or making use, etc.\u201d He then enumerates various things \u2014 mills, manufactories. That I understand to mean, if these premises insured as a store are used as mills, manufactories, etc., without the payment of an extra amount, that would be a violation of the policy. It strikes me, however, that application could not be made in this ease. To my mind it means converted into a mill or manufactory, and I am further induced to think that is the true construction, because the very last provision .provides \u201cor any manufactory or mechanical business which requires a furnace or oven.\u201d So they thus made a distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>between a mill and a manufactory and a manufacturing business carried on on the premises, so that I do not think that any of the evidence would justify the. assumption that it has been turned into a mill or manufactory \u2014 a manufactory in the sense of these conditions. [3d assignment of error.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-4\"><em>2. uOr for storing or keeping any of the articlesthat i\u00ab, for storing or keeping them, he would be liable to pay an additional risk; \u25a0 and it is here contended that by the evidence it is shown that sulphur wqs used for certain purposes about the -premises. Whether that would justify you in believing that they come within the provision against storing or keeping those articles is a question I leave for you to decide. Of </em>course, <em>every man has a right to keep a small amount of these articles without infringing </em>\u2014 for <em>instance, a man might be prohibited from keeping or storing gunpowder, but you would hardly think if you were to hang up your powder-flask on coming home from, a hunting trip, it would fairly come within the provision. There is a question between these two extremes whether the amount of this material used wo aid justify your saying they were storing and keeping sulphur on these premises. I leave that for you to decide on the evidence. </em>[4th assignment of error.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AhD\">There is another provision in this 17th section, upon which, in my opinion, this controversy turns altogether. It is that they agree that persons exercising any of the trades, occupations herein mentioned, or making use of the premises insured for any other business that will increase the risk. Of course it would be impossible for a company to put down in a list all the cases in which the risk might be increased, because a slight variation in the mode employed by the tenant would prevent the company from taking advantage of it; and, therefore, they have said, and it is a question of fact in this case for you to determine whether the business carried on increased the risk. Of course the selling brooms is no risk, and nobody pretends it \u2014 it was not the selling of brooms and wooden ware. It was the bleaching that was carried on in one of the stories. You have heard the evidence about that. You have heard how this bleaching room was managed. It was a room with shelves all around filled with broom corn. In the centre of the room were two bricks on the floor, on which rested an iron box filled with sulphur. On retiring for the night, the sulphur was set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>on fire, the door locked, and thus left till morning, the box being covered with an iron perforated cover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-4\">Now the question is, as I have said, did that increase the risk of this store ? About as good a way of testing this as any other, would be to suppose you occupied the third story with all your goods aud chattels, and the man below you had a room of this kind. Would you consider that you were as safe as if it were used for ordinary purposes ? Would you or would you not consider your risk as increased in consequence of this bleaching room being underneath or above the floor which you occupied? This is a question tor you to determine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\">There is another point in this case also, which is, that some one, on two different years, not consecutive \u2014 I think a year intervening \u2014 paid the increased risk on this building for the manufacture of these brooms. One year it was $70 ; the other year it was $30. And the defendant contends, and that is the recollection of Mr. Lex, that this lady \u2014 some lady \u2014 came there and had conversation with him which was impressed upon his mind in consequence of his telling her it was a violation of the policy. She then was worried about that because it had been transferred as collateral security to the mortgagee of the property. He then said, \u201cWell, you can paya license, if you please, for carrying this on.\u201d In consequence of that conversation she did pay at one time $70, and at another $30. After that no more was paid. That fact, howev\u00e9r, of this lady having been there is positively denied. As far as' she is concerned, she says she did not do it. Some one apparently did; it does not appear who paid that sum. This lady denies it. Of course it is for you to decide which you choose to believe in regard to that. If you should believe this lady did it, it would be very strong evidence that the parties had agreed that this was an extra hazardous risk, because nobody would pay for an increased risk if their contention. was that it was not an increased risk. If you believe that the parties both agreed, and that for some time an increased risk was paid, it would be strong evidence that it was extra hazardous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-6\">The contention also was that at the expiration of these policies their invariable habit is to notify the person that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>policy has expired. They have nothing to do beyond that. Of course, it is none of their business whether you choose to go on payiug an extra hazardous risk or not. The company cannot know -whether you may not be payiug it for a temporary cause for a year or two from the fact of your not insuring beyond that. You insure for a year. They send you a notice. Nothing more is done. It is for the insured himself whenever he is going to use the premises for any other purposes which make the risk extra hazardous \u2014 it is for him to pay it. It is not for them to look out for it. They say all we have is a policy on a store. If you are going to do anything else, it is your business to come, according to the 13th section, \u201cIf any alteration is made the insured shall forthwith give notice to the association and pay such additional risk as may be required.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-4\">The defendant\u2019s points and the answers thereto were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\">1. \u201cIf any alteration was made in the occupancy of the \u201cbuilding insured, affecting the risk, and no notice of the \u201csame was given to the Fire Association, or additional pre\u201cmium paid to cover the period of such increased risk in \u201caccordance with the provisions of section XIII of the Terms \u201cand Conditions annexed to the Policy then the plaintiff cannot \u201cnow recover.\u201d</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b238-6\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-7\">2. \u201cThat the keeping and use of sulphur on the property \u201cwas a violation of the express provisions of section XVII \u201cof the Terms and Conditions of the policy, and if sulphur \u201cwas so kept and used in the property, the plaintiff cannot \u201cnow recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-8\">If the premises were used for the storing or keeping sulphur that is true. It is for the jury to say whether that has been established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-9\">3. \u201cIf the jury find that the fumes of burning sulphur \u201cprevented the firemen from entering the property at the time \u201cof the fire, and interfered with the extinguishment of it? \u201cthen the evidence produced of the amount expended in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u201crebuilding is not the proper standard to measure the plaintiffs loss.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-3\">The answer to this depends entirely whether the insurance' was or was not void. If the plaintiff had under the policy a right to use the building as she was using it, the difficulty of extinguishing fire was of no moment. If \"the use she was making was a violation of the policy, the plaintiff should'not recover anything.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-4\">4. \u201cThat if the building was used for manufacure of \u201cbrooms it was an alteration within the meaning of the- said \u201csection XIII, and required notice and payment of the additional premium therein provided for.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">That is a question for you to decide. If the manufacture of brooms, including the bleaching room, increased the risk for which this building was originally insured, your verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">During the trial the Court allowed a witness (Fretz) who occupied the premises, whether he had received a notice that the privilege to make brooms had expired. [First error.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">The Court refused to admit the books of the Association, by which it was offered to prove that on two previous occasions extra payments had been made for the license to make brooms.

(See 1st assignment.) There was nothing in the case to show that the plaintiff was entitled to the notice referred to, or that it was the duty of the defendant to send it. The question was irrelevant; the answer was unimportant, and the result did no harm to any one. We do not reverse for such reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The second assignment is not sustained. The books of the defendant company were not evidence against the plaintiff. They had, moreover, been used by the witness to refresh his recollection, and all that could have been shown by them was distinctly proved by the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The third, fourth and fifth assignments are such a wide departure from the rules of Court, that we must decline to consider them. They allege errors in the charg\u00e9 of the Court, but, instead of giving the language of the Court, they set forth the effect of the charge, or what the learned counsel understood by it. Rule XXIII requires that \u201cwhen the error assigned is to the charge of the Court, or to answer to points and answers referred to, must be quoted <em>totidem verbis </em>in the specification.\u201d We also call attention to Mr. Outerbridge\u2019s notes on pages 37 and 38 of Rules of Court, where a number of eases are cited, showing the reason of the rule and the importance of observing it. Neither of the specifications are assigned in accordance with the rules. The points are set out, but the answers are not given, except by a reference to another page of .the paper-book. Both the point and the answer should appear in the assignment. As this departure is not so wide as the other, we will consider the- questions they involve.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">By the defendant\u2019s second point the Court was asked to instruct the jury \u201cthat the keeping and use of sulphur on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>property was a violation of the express provisions of section XVII of the terms and conditions of the policy, and if sulphur was so kept and used on the property the plaintiff cannot now recoverto which point the learned Judge answered: \u201cIf the premises were used for the storing or keeping of sulphur, that is true. It is for the jury to say whether that has been established.\u201d It is difficult to see any objection to this answer. The Court affirmed the defendants\u2019 point if the jury found the facts of which it was predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The defendant\u2019s third and fourth points were correctly answered. The fact that the fumes of burning sulphur prevented the firemen from entering the building at the time of the fire had no significance if the plaintiff had the- right to use the building in the manner she was using it. In other words, if she had the right under the policy to keep sulphur there, it mattered not that the firemen were driven back by its fumes.- And the Court very properly said in answer to the fourth point, that if the manufacture of brooms increased the risk, the verdict should be for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
