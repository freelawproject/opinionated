The present action was On the recognizance in that case. In the Court below the defendants, Littell and Powers defended on-the ground that there was no judgment, in the ease to which their recognizance applied. That the writ of error was improvidently taken ; therefore, there was no liability on their part, and also alleging there was no judg-: ment at the time of the execution of the recognizance. On June 19,1876, the Court entered judgment on the special verdict for the plaintiff. Mechling then took a writ of error complaining that the Court entered judgment on the verdict and also that the judgment upon the special' verdict is erroneous for the reason that the special verdict does not find the facts, but refers the facts to the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-4\"><em>Thomas M. </em>Marshall, <em>A.

The <em>non pros, </em>was a breach of the condition, and the recognizance thereby became absolute. It therefore does not lie in the mouth of the bail to allege now that the judgment was not final because not liquidated. He stepped in to arrest the proceeding,rand undertook that-.the proceeding should not be affirmed or the writ <em>non prossed. </em>He failed to perform the condition and consequently must perform the alternative, viz : pay the debt, damages and costs. The rule absolute for judgment in the original proceeding was a substantial judgment, and the liquidation could be made at any moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
