The defendant below is a taxpayer within the tax district. The total amount of the bounty tax in 1864 was $59,470. The borough authorities from 1864 to 1873 levied taxes amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $121,059.34. For a period of nine years the people paid their bounty tax without resistance. In 1873, discovering that, notwithstanding the enormous levies that were made and collected during nine years, the whole amount applied to the payment of bounty tax bonds was $4,000, they appealed to the Court for protection against this \u2022power to levy and collect each year a twenty-mill tax. A Bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In Equity was filed and an injunction against the further collection of the tax granted, which was finally decided adversely to the taxpayers. Afterwards D. H. Wade, not in his own right, but as tax collector, brought a large number of suits before Alderman Blair against the taxpayers for the taxes due on the duplicate issued on the 17th day of November, 1873. The case in hand is one of the number of suits thus brought, on February 2,1880. The cases were appealed to the Common Pleas, and this case was then tried and a verdict against the defendant below was rendered, from which this appeal is taken. The questions involved are purely legal, and are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-4\">First. Does the sixth section of the Act of Assembly relating to this tax (P. L. 1864, p. 85) confer upon the tax collector, either in his own right or as collector, a right of action?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">Second. If it does, should not the action be brought in his own right, and not as collector ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">Third. If the right of action exists, is it not barred by the statute of limitation, as more than six years have elapsed from the time the duplicate was placed in the collector\u2019s hands, before suit was brought, though it was less than six years from the time the warrant expired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">The Court below decided in favor of the collector, and this writ of error was then taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-8\"><em>C. </em>Smith, <em>Esq., </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-9\"><em>S.
