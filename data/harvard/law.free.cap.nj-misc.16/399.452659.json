No one of either committee appeared in opposition thereto. In explanation thereof we are told that the committee had no special information concerning the applicant since his suspension, and, moreover, that no intimation has ever come from the court that such committees were expected to supervise the conduct of suspended attorneys during their period of suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Notwithstanding this circumstance, the court upon its own motion called upon the present grievance committee to ascertain whether the conduct of Wesler during the two-year period had been such as to commend him to the favorable consideration of the court. In pursuance of the call thus made, we are advised, in writing, by the committee that it called a meeting at which all the members were present; that Wesler\u2019s application was presented; and that each member was asked whether he knew of any reason why Wesler should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>reinstated. We are further advised that \u201cin answering this question the members of the committee took into consideration * * * whether or not they had received any report of his [Wesler\u2019s] attempting to practice law during the period of his suspension or of engaging in any unethical conduct;\u201d and that \u201cnone of the members had heard of any such conduct and the committee\u2019s action was that this application be not opposed by our committee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Under the circumstances of this particular case, the provision of the order of suspension \u201cuntil the further order of the court,\u201d is lifted, and Morris Wesler is permitted to resume practice as an attorney-at-law of this state. Let such order be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
