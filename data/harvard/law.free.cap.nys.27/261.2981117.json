Considering defendants\u2019 plea, therefore, with reference to its legal effect, which is simply that of a denial, it cannot be properly regarded as setting up any such claim as to render it proper to require a bill of particulars. See Goddard v. Medicine Co., 52 Hun, 85, 5 N. Y. Supp. 119, which was followed and fully approved by this court in Strebell v. J. H. Furber Co., (City Ct. N. Y.) 21 N. Y. Supp. 1032. And the case of Rafalsky v. Boehm, (City Ct. N. Y.) 20 N. Y. Supp. 374, does not in any way conflict with either of these decisions, for in the Eafalsky Case the answer did not, by general or specific denial, put at issue plaintiff\u2019s alleged performance, and in the opifiion in that case it is suggested that defendants\u2019 plea was insufficient and frivolous, but, as it was not so assailed, and plaintiff had only sought and secured at special term a bill of particulars of an affirmative plea in the answer, it would not be disturbed at general term. But, as seen, the answer here specifically denies plaintiff\u2019s alleged performance; hence defendants should not have been required to furnish a bill of particulars of the times and manner of plaintiff\u2019s nonperformance, and the order requiring him to do so should be reversed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
