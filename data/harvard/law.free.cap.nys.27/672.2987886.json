From a judgment entered on a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $70 damages, and from an order denying a motion for a new trial, defendant appeals. Reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b700-14\">Plaintiff, in her complaint, alleges that in August, 1887, \u201cshe was induced by the defendant to purchase of him an Ithaca organ, No.-, upon representations by the defendant that said organ was new, and first-class in every particular, and which plaintiff believed and relied upon; that defendant, for the purchase price of said organ, induced plaintiff to make her promissory note to him for \"sixty-five dollars, after obtaining ten dollars cash down.\u201d Her Complaint also contains the following allegation: \u201cThat defendant now has, by reason of his fraud, deception, and misrepresentations, and breach of warranty to plaintiff, forty-six dollars of plaintiff\u2019s money, besides said organ and plaintiff\u2019s note, upon which there is due and unpaid about twenty-five dollars. That, by reason of the foregoing, defendant was guilty of a gross fraud, constituting a breach of warranty of said organ, to plaintiff\u2019s damage in the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars.\u201d The answer contains a denial of the allegations of the complaint, and sets up that the defendant delivered to the plaintiff an organ \u201cupon the express agreement that the plaintiff should pay to defendant on account thereof the sum of sixty-five dollars, in monthly payments of five dollars, on the 1st day of each month, and that when the said sum of sixty-five dollars, with annual interest thereon, should be paid, the said organ should become the property of the plaintiff, and that, until said sum of sixty-five dollars and interest should be so paid, the title thereto remained in the defendant, with the right on his part to retake the said organ out of the possession of the plaintiff on default of payment as above specified.\u201d The answer of the defendant contains the further allegation, to wit: \u201cThat the said agreement for conditional sale was duly rescinded, and in or about the month of August, 1892, the defendant retook from the plaintiff, by process of law, the possession of the said organ, pursuant to the terms of the agreement aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b700-16\">Argued before HARDIN, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARt\">At the commencement of the trial the defendant\u2019s counsel asked the direction of the court to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel <em>\u201cto </em>elect whether he will prosecute this action for deceit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tort, or whether for breach of warranty on contract.\u201d Thereupon, the court observed: \u201cAs I understand it, it is announced to be an action for breach of warranty. * *\" You do not claim now that there is anything but a breach of warranty?\u201d To which question the plaintiff\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cThat is all.\u201d When the defendant was giving evidence, the question arose as to whether it was admissible to prove the rental value of the organ in the fall of 1887. In connection with the objection, the court observed, \u201cIf there was no warranty, then there is no liability.\u201d Thereupon, the counsel for the defendant observed, \u201cDo I understand the court takes the position that, if they can recover damages at all, it must be for a breach of warranty?\u201d To which the court replied, viz.: \u201cIt must be for a breach of warranty, and nothing else. * * * You must defend this action upon the ground that you made no such representation, and that there was no warranty, or you fail to defend it, in my judgment; and they must maintain their action upon their complaint upon the ground that there was a warranty, and there was a breach of it. I think you are entitled to offset anything in this action that would offset the purchase price.\u201d At the commencement of the charge the trial judge said, \u201cThis is an action brought by Minnie English against Joel Hanford to recover for a breach of warranty in the sale of an organ;\u201d and further on he said: \u201cThe first question for you to proceed with, gentlemen, is, was there a warranty of this kind? Did he warrant it to be a new organ, unused?\u201d And in referring to the question of damages the court used the following language: \u201cIf she has suffered any damages, gentlemen, I shall charge you that the rule of law in this case is that she is entitled to recover the difference between the value of a new organ as represented, unused, and this organ in the condition in which it was at the time it was delivered to her.\u201d From the foregoing events and incidents occurring upon the trial, we think the action was treated as one upon a warranty, and damages were sought to be recovered for a breach of warranty, and that, unless the verdict can be maintained upon the theory that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for a warranty, it ought not to be sustained. At the close of the negotiations between the parties in respect to the organ, the plaintiff executed an instrument containing the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJQ\">\u25a0\u201c$(35.00. Ithaca, Aug. 2d, 1887.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">\u201cOne year after date, I promise to pay Joel Hanford sixty-five dollars, value received, as follows: Five dollars the first of every month until paid. When $65.00, with annual interest, is paid, Ithaca organ No. 9,058 is my property. Until paid, the title remains in said Joel Hanford, or holder of this, with the right to retake it out of my possession on default of payment as above specified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-10\">[Signed] \u201cMrs. Wakeman English.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Possession of the organ was given to and taken by her, and she remained in possession until after she had made default in complying with the terms of her contract with the defendant. She testifies the organ was taken from her possession July 23, 1892. She was in default in making her payments before the property was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>removed from her possession. The evidence clearly shows that she never completed her contract for the purchase, and that she never had a clear, full, absolute, unconditional title to the property prior to the commencement of this action. In Benjamin on Sales, under the head of Remedies of the Buyer, (at page 855,) are found the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">\u201cBut no action will lie on a warranty unless the title has fully passed to the buyer. Therefore, where the sale was conditional on payment of the full price which was due, in installments, and the last installment had not been paid, it was held in Frye v. Milligan, (1885,) 10 Ont. 509, that no remedy yet existed on the warranty.\u201d Benj. Sales, (Bennett\u2019s Ed. 1885.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In Osborn v. Gantz, 60 N. Y. 540, it was held, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">\u201cA warranty is an incident, only, of a completed sale. It has no present vitality and force in an executory contract of sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">2. It is now sought to maintain the verdict on the ground that the evidence would have justified a finding of fraud on the part of the defendant. The case was not submitted to the jury in that aspect, and, before the verdict shall be upheld that establishes the defendant's liability for fraudulent representations, he is entitled to a clear and intelligent presentment of the questions relating thereto to the jury. Mayo v. Knowlton, 134 N. Y. 251, 31 N. E. 985. We think there should be a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
