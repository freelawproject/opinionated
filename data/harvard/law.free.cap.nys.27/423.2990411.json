Y. Supp. 812.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-16\">The action was brought to recover the sum of $150 for the rent of the first floor and basement of the premises known as No. 874 Eighth avenue, in the city of New York, for the months of March and April, 1892. The premises had been leased by plaintiff to the firm of Ghatfield Bros. \u2018 The lease expired May 1, 1892. The rent was $75 per month, payable in advance, on the first day of each month. Chat-field Bros, occupied said premises from May 1, 1891, to October, 1891, and paid the rent to November 1, 1891. In October, 1891, the firm of Ghatfield Bros, made a general assignment of their property for the benefit of their creditors to defendant, who accepted the assigneeship, and entered upon its duties. He took possession of said premises, and of the assigned goods and property, in October, 1891; put a man in possession of the premises, and continued in possession thereof until the 1st of May, 1892. In April defendant sold the assigned goods on the premises at auction. The defendant paid the rent of the premises, $75, for the month of November, 1891. The rent for the months of December, 1891, and January and February, 1892, was paid by Thomas B. Ghatfield under an agreement between him and the defendant, Wagner.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b451-19\">Argued before EHRLICH, C.

Because of defendant\u2019s answer as to the rent for the month of March \u00a1he is also entitled to it, for it appears that in November, 1891, he \u00a1received rent for that month from defendant, and that defendant remained in possession of the store with the landlord\u2019s consent \u2022until May 1, 1893. This agreement created between the plaintiff \u00a1and defendant the relation of landlord and tenant, and made defendant liable to plaintiff for the reasonable value of the premises \u2022occupied by him, which the testimony shows is $75 for the April month. Judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
