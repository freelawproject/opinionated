The trial justice dismissed the-complaint. He did right in doing so. There is no evidence showing that defendant received money from any insurance for the clothing which plaintiff\u2019s daughters had in his house; in fact, the evidence entirely failed to support the complaint, and was rightfully dismissed. Judgment affirmed, with, costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
