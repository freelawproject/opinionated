The appellant insists that this is a reversible error. This leads to the consideration of the sufficiency of the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">A pleading in the district courts of this city may be oral or in writing. \u201c1$ it is oral, the substance thereof must be entered by the justice in his docket book; if it is written, it must be filed by him, and a reference to it made in his docket book.\u201d Code .Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2938,\" which is made applicable to these courts by section 1347 of the consolidation act, (Laws 1882, c. 410.) A denial in an answer in these courts seems to be limited to one upon knowledge, (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2938; Consolidation Act, \u00a7\u00a7 1347, 1383, subd. 1;) to which should be added \u201ca denial upon information and belief,\u201d which seems to be authorized by implication under section 526 of the Code of Civil Procedure, (Wood v. Raydure, 39 Hun, 144; Bennett v. Manufacturing Co., 110 N. Y. 150, 17 N. E. 669,) which section, it appears, is made applicable to district courts by sections 1346 and 1383 of the consolidation act. An allegation in the answer \u201cthat the defendant has not sufficient knowledge to form a' belief\u201d as to the allegations contained in certain portions <em>of </em>the complaint is not authorized in district courts, (Dennison v. Carnahan, 1 E. D. Smith, 144;) a denial \u201cof any knowledge or information thereof sufficient to form a belief,\u201d permitted by section 500 of the Code of Civil Procedure, being expressly restricted to courts of record, (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3347, subd. 4. See Dennison v. Carnahan, supra.) It follows that the answer in the case at bar, to portions of the third and the entire fourth and fifth paragraphs of the complaint, that \u201cdefendant has not sufficient information to form a belief,\u201d is wholly insufficient, and these allegations, if material, must be taken as confessed by nondenial. Are any of them material? In order to answer this question it will first be necessary to determine the nature of this action. This case is almost identical with Ross v. Mather, 51 N. Y. 108, in which the court of last resort held that the complaint contained all the elements of a cause of action for a fraud. The essential constituents of an action to recover damages for false and fraudulent representations are \u201crepresentation, falsity, scienter, deception, and injury.\u201d Arthur v. Griswold, 55 N. Y. 400, per Church, C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>J.; Brackett v. Griswold, 112 N. Y. 454, 20 N. E. 376; Bosworth v. Higgins, (Sup.) 7 N. Y. Supp. 210. Tested by these rules, it is quite clear that the complaint in this case is for a fraud, not upon a contract. Such being the nature of the action, the averments in the third paragraph of the complaint as to the scienter of the defendant must be regarded as not being denied, and, being material, are therefore admitted. Dennison v. Carnahan, supra. The other allegations of the complaint, hereinbefore referred to, as to specific facts, as distinguished from a matter of opinion, and other than a statement of unliquidated damages, must also be admitted by the defendant\u2019s failure to deny them. Abb. Brief Pl. \u00a7 540, subd. 3, p. 441, and cases cited. Accordingly, it must be held that the following allegations of the complaint were confessed by nondenial, viz.: \u201cThat the mare had an equine disease, and was, moreover, big with young at the time.\u201d \u201cThat the plaintiff was put to great expense in the care, and in attempting the cure, of said mare, and in her treatment during pregnancy, and thereafter in the keeping of her and her colt.\u201d The denials contained in the other portions of the answer were sufficient to put in issue the remaining allegations of the complaint; therefore, the motion for judgment on the pleadings was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">The allegations of the complaint as to representation, falsity, deception, and injury, were abundantly established by the evidence, and the scienter was confessed by nondenial, and was therefore not open to traverse or contrary proof on the trial. Electric-Light Co. v. Clark, (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 18 N. Y. Supp. 464. The plaintiff, under any aspect of the case, was entitled to nominal damages, (Moore v. Railroad Co., 4 Misc. Rep. 132, 23 N. Y. Supp. 863;) and under all the' circumstances of the case the justice clearly erred in rendering judgment of dismissal, without prejudice to a new action, (Consolidation Act, \u00a7 1382.) It follows from these views that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the party there prevailing. In view of the statement contained in the appellant\u2019s brief, that \u201cthe object of this appeal is to secure an authoritative utterance for the guidance of the court below,\u201d it is deemed proper to remind the counsel for both parties litigant that the court below possesses ample power to allow a pleading to be amended at any time before or during the trial. Runge v. Esau, 6 Misc. Rep. 148, 26 N. Y. Supp. 33.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
