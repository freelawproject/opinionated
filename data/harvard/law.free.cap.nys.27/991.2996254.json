The answer was a general denial. The complaint was amended by setting up an agreement of defendant to give the plaintiffs his note for $500 on condition that they satisfy a mechanic\u2019s lien which they had filed for said materials, their compliance with the condition, and his refusal to perform his agreement.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1019-13\">Argued before DALY, C.

It thus appeared that the agreement for the note in consideration of the removal of the lien was rescinded by mutual consent, and the lien restored. This disposed of the alleged cause of action under the amendment, and the complaint was properly dismissed. It is urged by appellant that defendant ratified the purchase by Pearse &amp; Thornton by the agreement to give the $500 note, but the evidence showed that, when he agreed to give the note, he refrained from acknowledging any liability for the goods. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
