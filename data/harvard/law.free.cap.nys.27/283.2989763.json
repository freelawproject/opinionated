From the order granting the writ, an appeal was taken to this court, pending which this motion was made, and denied on the ground that the appeal operated to stay proceedings under the writ. The determination thus made we approve. Section 1314 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides, among other things, that \u201cupon an appeal taken by a domestic municipal corporation the service of the notice of appeal perfects the appeal and stays the execution of the judgment or order appealed from, without an undertaking or other security;\u201d and we think the appeal taken from the order granting the writ was, within the meaning of the section, an appeal by a domestic municipal corporation. The commissioner of public works is a part of the city government, and the head of the executive department by means of which the corporation acts in regard to its public streets. Consolidation Act, \u00a7 316. The duties of the commissioner in respect to the care and maintenance of streets are the duties of the corporation acting through him, and-his official acts within the limits of the authority conferred, because the office constitutes a part of the corporate organization, and represents it, are acts of the municipal corporation. It is therefore entitled to the benefit of section 1314 when its commissioner of public works takes an appeal from a judgment or order directing him, as such officer, to do some act affecting the corporate interests. The order should be affirmed, with f 10 costs and printing disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
