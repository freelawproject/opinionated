The answer denies every allegation except that defendant is a corporation. From the judgment in favor of plaintiff, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">A careful perusal of the testimony discloses no satisfactory evidence that defendant was the owner or lessee in possession of the train or the tracks, or the employer of those in charge of the train. There is no proof of what, if any, roadbeds or tracks the defendant owns, or where the same begin or end; and it is uncontroverted that this train, at the time of the accident, was on Atlantic avenue, Brooklyn, at Franklin avenue station, on the tracks of the Long Island Railroad Company. There is evidence that the latter company runs trains over the track from Rockaway Beach to this station. Whether or not the train in question was in charge of defendant ought to be capable of easy proof. Judgment and order must be reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
