The defendant did not claim the affirmative, and the record does not show that it was denied him; therefore it was proper for the trial justice to deny his application for the affirmative in summing up. The paper marked \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Exhibit Number 3,\u201d and set out on page 82 of the printed case, was certainly properly admitted in \u25a0evidence, because the witness Scott testified that it was a copy of a paper given him (Scott) by the defendant, Tyng, personally, which paper the witness said Tyng claimed fixed his compensation and claim to the fund.in the \u201cSchreyer matter.\u201d The testimony submitted fully justifies the verdict gendered, and we find no error in the charge of the trial justice. The verdict is therefore affirmed, \u2022with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
