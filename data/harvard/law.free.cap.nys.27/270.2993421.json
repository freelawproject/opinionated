The jury rendered a verdict in her favor for $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The defendant moved, at the close of the case, to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that the plaintiff failed to show that the defendant made any contract with her for passage from Hamburg, which motion was denied. In denying the motion to dismiss the complaint upon the ground just stated, the learned trial justice erred, because there is no testimony in the case (except the mere say so of plaintiff\u2019s child, who, at the time of the taking of said passage, was only 11 years of age) which establishes that Mendel was the agent of the defendant in Hamburg, or that he acted for it in any capacity, or that any of his acts were ratified by defendant. Nor is there any testimony proving that any ship, railroad, or other means of transit used by the defendant on her passage from Hamburg to New York was owned or controlled, or managed or operated, by defendant. .Under these circumstances, no cause of action was established against the defendant, and the complaint should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Judgment is reversed; a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event of action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
