The 'sole ground urged against the verdict is that the plaintiff did business under the name and style of Fred. Adee &amp; Co., without having a partner. The defense was not pleaded, and the plaintiff was not called upon to prove, that he had secured th\u00e9 right to use the firm name, under existing statutes. But, aside from this, the defense was unavailable against the note in suit. Gay v. Seibold, 97 N. Y. 475. The appeal is destitute of merit, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
