Fitzgerald, the petitioner, executed a mortgage to one Henry Morgenthau for \u00a72,580, due June 15, 1894. Morgenthau assigned the same to the Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Company October 7, 1891. The latter assigned the same to the Madison Square Bank March 18, 1892, \u2022of which the petitioner had due notice. On July 25, 1892, the latter, on suggestion from the Madison Square Bank, paid the bank $1,580, to be applied \u2022on the principal, and $8.77 on the interest, then due on said mortgage. The bank became insolvent, and Miles M. O\u2019Brien and James G. Cannon were Appointed receivers thereof in August, 1893. On October 30th, thereafter, said Fitzgerald was notified by the State Trust Company, 30 Wall street, that the latter held and owned said mortgage by assignment from the Madison Square Bank, the latter having assigned the same April 6, 1893, and this was the first notice he had. Said State Trust Company further claimed the entire amount of $2,580 as due, with interest, and refused, on demand of Fitzgerald, to credit the amount of $1,580 as paid in reduction of said principal, and the interest paid at the same time, of $8.77. Thereupon, this petitioner notified the receivers of the Madison Square Bank of this claim of the State Trust Company, and was informed by them that the amount in (pies<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>tian, of $1,588.77, had been duly passed to the credit of said Madison Square Bank.

This can only be done by directing the receivers to pay the money of the petitioner, which they have in their possession, to the State Trust Company, to be applied upon the bond and mortgage in question. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
