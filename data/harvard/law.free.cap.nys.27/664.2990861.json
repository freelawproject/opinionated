By the section referred to, a change has been made in the public policy of this state as to railroads. Formerly, it was within the power of any body of persons sufficiently numerous, and possessing the requisite capital, to construct a railroad at any time, between any termini they might select, the route of the road being subject to judicial review or determination, and the \u25a0consent of the municipal authority being necessary to obtain a location in a city. Now it is necessary that a certificate shall be granted by the railroad commission that public convenience and necessity require the construction of the. road. If that is refused, an application may be made to the general term of this court for an order \u2022directing the issue of the certificate, which, if granted, must state the reasons therefor. This mode of proceeding, while it grants the \u2022court power to review the action of the commissioners, plainly indicates that the court is to treat the application as in the nature \u2022of a review of the decision of a subordinate tribunal, and not as it would an original application made to it in the first instance. The \"burden rests upon the petitioner to show affirmatively that the commissioners erred in their determination, and the commissioners \u25a0should be credited with some technical knowledge which this court is not presumed. to possess. The petitioner\u2019s road is to run from New .Hamburg,- through Wappinger\u2019s Falls, to the city of Poughkeepsie. The village of Wappinger\u2019s Falls is the seat of some large factories, and it can be assumed that its direct connection with the coal roads passing through Poughkeepsie, as well as with the city itself, would be a substantial convenience to its inhabitants, and \u2022also an advantage to the city. The objection made to the road on behalf of the city is that it will cross several of the principal streets \u2022at grade; and it was stated before the commission, on behalf of the petitioner, that it was not possible to construct the road otherwise than with such grade crossings. It may be that none is practicable in this state, where the conditions of its territory vary so much, from the greatest city in the country to what is almost a wilderness; but it is plain that grade crossings should not be allowed in the cities or in densely populated territory unless the necessity be paramount. It is not necessary to lay down any rule on the subject. It is sufficient to say that it was a consideration the commissioners might well weigh in determining whether to grant the application; and in their determination, based on this consideration, we cannot \u2022say that the commissioners erred. It is still within the power of the petitioner, if the topography of the country does not forbid, to modify its location or terminus so as to obviate this objection, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>to renew its application, in which case there would seem no valid ground for refusing it. The application should be denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
