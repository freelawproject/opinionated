Drake, I have to say that, if you wish it for any purpose connected with the pending suit against the New York Iron Mine, for which you are entitled to it, I will give it to you. In this respect I shall be treating the defendant with more courtesy than I have received from it, for I had every impediment put in the way of service upon the president, after clearly explaining the purpose for which I wished to know his whereabouts, to the persons in charge of his office. Awaiting your explanation, I remain,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-15\">\u201cYours, truly, Roger M.

Until you assign some reason relevant to this action for your inquiry, I do not perceive that I am called upon to give you Mr. Drake\u2019s address.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-21\">\u201cYours, truly, Roger M.

There is doubtless sufficient power lodged in the court to make such or any order when it becomes necessary for the due and orderly progress of the action in which it is made; yet it is en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tirely obvious that such power will never be exercised for any remote purpose. Courts make only such orders and permit such proceedings in actions as are relevant and essential to the legitimate conduct thereof. Ulterior designs of litigants cannot be fostered by the courts. This defendant has been offered all he can require for the purposes of this action, and the papers before us disclose an ulterior design in procuring this order. The attorney for the plaintiff made a distinct offer, in writing to the attorney for the defendant, to furnish him with the address and occupation of the plaintiff if it was desired for any purpose connected with the pending suit, and, as that offer was not accepted, there can be but one inference drawn from such failure to accept the same. We do not think the power of the court has been wisely exerted, and the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
