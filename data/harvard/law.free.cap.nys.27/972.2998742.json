The question litigated upon the trial was whether defendant had a lien. The justice found that he had, to.the amount of $25, after setting off against his \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>charges various charges for cigars he had bought; and on January 19, 1893, signed and filed a \u201cmemorandum,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-5\">\u201cThe cigars of August 4th, allowed at $70, and the six hundred cigars admitted, at $30, making $100. The keep of the horse from August 1st to December 31st, at $25 a month, $125. Therefore, judgment for defendant, that he retain possession of one roan horse to satisfy a lien of $25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-6\">\u201cDated New York, Jan. 19, 1893.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">But' the return upon appeal certifies that on the 19th day of January, 1893, he rendered a judgment \u201cin favor of the plaintiff against the defendant, as set forth in the judgment annexed to it.\u201d No judgment is annexed except the memorandum above referred to. The return therefore shows, first, a judgment in favor of defendant, and ultimately one in favor of plaintiff, and will have to be reversed. There being a finding of a lien in favor of defendant, he should have had judgment. Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant, to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
