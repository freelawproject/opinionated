The defendant, on August 27,1891, discontinued the use of the premises, and resists the claims for rent accruing after that date. The plaintiff recovered the rent unpaid for the whole term. The defendant proved at the trial the provisions of the sanitary code (section 53): \u201cThat no cattle, swine, or sheep, geese, goats, or horses, shall be yarded within or adjacent to the built up portions of the city of Few York, without the permit of this department, or otherwise than according to its regulations.\u201d The tenant made no application to the board of health for an extension of time or suspension of the requirements of the notice. There was no eviction by the landlord, and no final order of the board of health after the hearing of the application for suspension which the tenant was entitled to request under the notice. The tenant voluntarily abandoned the premises without contest. If he is therefore relieved from the payment of rent, any lessee, by collusively procuring such a notice to be issued, and by immediately complying with it, might terminate his lease. And it does not appear that there was any violation of any provision of the sanitary code. The \u201cyarding\u201d of cattle, swine, sheep, geese, goats, or horses is a wholly different thing from the stabling of horses in a properly kept stable. If the lessee kept the horses in the yard instead of in the stable, or failed to keep the stable clean, so as to authorize the interference of the board, that is Ms fault. But the whole case fails to disclose facts which gave the board of health jurisdiction under the section in question. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
