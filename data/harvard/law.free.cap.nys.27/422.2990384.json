Indeed, the issue was that the check was given at the solicitation and for the accommodation of the' plaintiff, without any consideration, and the jury so found. Upon' such an issue and finding the cases cited by the appellant have no relevancy, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
