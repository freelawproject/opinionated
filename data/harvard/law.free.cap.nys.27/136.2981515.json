It was therefore admissible. The plaintiff, according to his testimony, was entitled to commissions upon the coal sold by him. As to the alleged settlement claimed by defendants, that claim is disputed by the plaintiff. He says that he accepted the $42 paid him under protest. Under these circumstances, the fact that he signed a receipt in full for all commissions, and defendants\u2019 contention that his commission amounted only to $42, do not preclude him from recovering the sum due him. The verdict is amply sustained by the evidence, and is not contrary to law, and is therefore affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
