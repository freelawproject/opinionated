In opposition to the motion, to vacate the attachment, the plaintiff argues that the moving papers do not show a valid \"attachment' in favor of the subsequent creditor. As we are of opinion that plaintiff\u2019s papers are sufficient, we are not compelled to analyze those of the Subsequent creditors. \u2022 Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
