McDonald, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-8\">In considering whether the complaint in this action does state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, we must first have in mind what dower is, according to the New York statute. The Revised Statutes say: \u201cA widow shall be endowed of the third part of all the lands whereof her husband was seized of an estate of inheritance at any time during the marriage.\u201d This is the only provision of our laws concerning dower which is pertinent to the present discussion. What provision there is concerning dower in certain equitable estates has no relevancy. In re Ransom, 17 Fed. 331.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-9\">The title to dower is inchoate on marriage and seisin attaching on the land when the seisin and the marriage relation are concurrent, vesting at the moment of the grant to the husband.

Carter, 10 Hun, at page 199, is said to be not in conflict with Holmes v. Holmes, 3 Paige, 363, \u201cwhich related only to the disposition of personal property, in which the wife can have no such interest as she has in her husband\u2019s real estate.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b649-10\">Dailey, Bell &amp; Crane, (James D. Bell, of counsel,) for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-11\">The novelty of the present action, if indeed it be without precedent, is no bar to its maintenance. Youngs v.

It is raised by a demurrer to the complaint. Leaving out an allegation in the complaint that the defendant holds an agreement in writing, signed by a person holding the legal title by deed, that it is held for the benefit of defendant, I think, under the law in this state, the demurrer was well pleaded. The complaint fails to state in full what the agreement is, or that it would give the defendant a right to have a conveyance made to himself of the fee. The respondent has quoted a large number of cases, none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>of which clearly hold that a wife is dowable in property so held, except cases in other states where there is a statute giving dower in equitable estate held by the husband. While there is no direct authority in favor of respondent\u2019s contention, yet there are expressions which seem to lean in that direction, and an opinion of the court of last resort can only settle the question. The case is on the border line, and, in the absence of any direct authority upon either side, we have concluded to affirm the decision below, as being the most equitable view of matters. Affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
