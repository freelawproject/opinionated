Somborn &amp; Co., was engaged in the business of selling a brand of champagne known as \u201cGrand Sec.\u201d They employed one Edward K. Somborn to sell said wine as a general salesman. In that capacity he sold to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>fendant wines, and agreed to allow it a discount of 10 per cent, upon the value of wines purchased. The amount of such discounts, it appears, was $320.13. These facts were testified to by the salesman and the defendant\u2019s president, and were uncontradicted, and for that sum defendant set up a counterclaim. This action was brought to recover the value of wines sold,\u2014$232,\u2014with interest. Judgment was rendered in defendant\u2019s favor upon said counterclaim, over and above the amount claimed by plaintiff, for $07.31, and from said judgment this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The undisturbed testimony shows that Edward K. Somborn was the general salesman of plaintiff\u2019s assignor. As such, his agreement to allow a discount and fixing prices was binding, and in law was the act of his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The trial justice was justified, in view of the undisputed evidence of defendant, to direct a verdict in defendant\u2019s favor upon the counterclaim up to the amount claimed in the complaint, but not beyond it. It was error, therefore, for him to render an affirmative judgment in defendant\u2019s favor for $07.31, because plaintiff is an assignee. The judgment must therefore be modified by reducing it $67.31, and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
