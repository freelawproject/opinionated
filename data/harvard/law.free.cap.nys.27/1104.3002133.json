The gravamen of the argument upon the part of the counsel for the defendant seems to be that no property in the city of New York would ever have increased in value had it not been for the existence of the elevated railroads, and that they are the beneficent authors' of all the prosperity which has blessed our city. We do not think that the evidence in this case requires us to consider this proposition. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
