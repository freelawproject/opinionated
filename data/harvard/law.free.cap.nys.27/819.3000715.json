Crimmins to recover damages for injuries sustained by plaintiff while in defendant\u2019s employ as a laborer on the Broadway cable road. Plaintiff, whose labors were directed by defendant\u2019s assistant foreman, was directed to take up an old pickaxe, broken off at both ends, one of which was much battered by hammering, and hold it upon a spike. The foreman then struck the axe with a heavy hammer, to drive home the spike. A sliver broken off the battered end of the pickaxe by one of his blows flew into the plaintiff\u2019s eye, and destroyed it. A nonsuit was ordered at circuit, and plaintiff\u2019s exceptions were ordered to be heard at general term in the first instance.

We are not able to say that a spicula would not be dislodged from a chisel by the blow of a heavy sledge when the chisel was in good order. There was no proof that the condition of the chisel, before the blow was struck, was a dangerous one; still less, that a reasonable examination would have disclosed danger. We are therefore of opinion that plaintiff failed to prove negligence on the part of defendant. Judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
