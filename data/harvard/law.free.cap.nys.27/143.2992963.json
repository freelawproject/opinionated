The complaint is for damages for breach of a contract by defendant to sell and deliver to plaintiffs 1,500 boxes of coke tins. The answer alleges that no contract whatever was made, although certain negotiations looking towards the making of one took place between the plaintiffs and the defendant, in which the defendant was not a principal, but an agent and broker for others. Defendant is a metal broker, which fact was known to the plaintiffs. On May 16, 1891, he wrote plaintiffs the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">\u201cNew York, 16th May, 1891.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">\u201cTo Messrs. Kir wan &amp; Tyler, Baltimore\u2014Gentlemen: I can offer you, subject to prior sale, 1,500 boxes, i. e. 14x20, Bessemer steel coke tins, for June delivery at Locust Point, at $4.96, cash on delivery. This is a very low price, but having offered them to other parties, and having only a limited quantity to sell, I can only offer them to you subject to prior sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">\u201cYours, very resp\u2019ly, Ewd. E. Byrne.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">And plaintiff replied by telegram, May 18, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\">\u201cBaltimore, May 18th, 1891.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-12\">\u201cMr. E. F. Byrne,\" 54 Cliff street, New York: We accept your offer 16th, if full-weight plates. Kirwan &amp; Tyler.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">Was the reply by the plaintiffs such an acceptance of defendant\u2019s order as to constitute a contract? The offer was explicit, and if the answer of the plaintiffs had ended after the word \u201c16th\u201d a contract would have been made between the parties. The answer by plaintiffs, however, was a qualification of their acceptance, to wit, \u201cif full-weight plates.\u201d This qualification left the transaction in such a state that, if the plaintiffs did not find the plates full weight; they were at liberty to refuse to accept them. It made the acceptance depend upon facts not contained in defendant\u2019s proposal: To create a binding contract by correspondence, the law required the offer to be accepted by the party to whom it may be made as it shall be contained in the offer itself. An offer of a bargain by one person to another implies no obligation upon the former until it is accepted by the latter according to the terms in which it was made. Until the terms of the agreement have received the assent of both parties, the negotiation is open, and imposes no obligation upon either. Mayer v. McCreery, 9 N. Y. St. Rep. 114, affirmed in 119 N. Y. 434, 23 N. E. 1045; Brown v. Railroad Co., 44 N. Y. 79. The subsequent correspondence between the parties made no change, of benefit to the plaintiffs. For these reasons the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to defendant to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">FITZSIMONS, J., concurs.</p>\n<author id=\"AeT\">MCCARTHY, j.</author>\n<p id=\"ACg\">I cannot concur with my associates. I think this does constitute a contract, but think the action ought to be brought against the principal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
