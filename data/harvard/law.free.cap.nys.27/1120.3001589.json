Y. Supp. 389. Upon the new trial which has been had, the evidence adduced seems to have taken the plaintiffs\u2019 case out of the 'condemnation of o-ur previous judgment, so far, at least, as to render the- question of the plaintiffs\u2019 contributory negligence properly a question of fact to be submitted to the jury. It was so submitted, with instructions which did no violence to the principles upon which the previous appeal was determined; and there were no exceptions taken on the trial which seem to require discussion. It follows that the judgment and order pow appealed from should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
