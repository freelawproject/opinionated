J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6B\">The gravamen of the complaint is that the defendant let the west side of a store to the plaintiff for sale of furniture, carpets, etc., and agreed that the store on the east side \u201cshould not be rented or used for the sale of the same kind of goods.\u201d As a breach, the complaint alleges that the defendant subsequently rented the'east store to one Harrington, \u201cwithout restricting\u201d him as agreed, and that Harrington used the store to sell goods of the same character as sold by the plaintiff, whereby \u201cthe plaintiff was unable to sell his goods as he had theretofore done,\u201d to his damage $2,000. There is no pretence that the defendant used the place for the rival business, or knowingly let it therefor, but merely that he failed to \u201crestrict\u201d Harrington, who injured him, etc. The damages recoverable for such a breach would be nominal, merely, in the absence of a claim for special damages, and there is no such claim. Sedg. Dam. (6th Ed.) p. 731, note; Parsons v. Sutton, 66 N. Y. 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-17\">If the plaintiff has any action, it is a technical one, merely; and if the court below had sustained the demurrer a reversal would not have been granted, in such a case, to enable the plaintiff to recover nominal damages only. Patton v. Hamilton, 12 Ind. 256; Hudspeth v. Allen. 26 Ind. 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-18\">The general term of the same court may on appeal make the order which ought to have been made below. The court at special term overruled the demurrer, and permitted the defendant to answer over on payment of $15 costs. But why prolong a litigation, and compel the defendant to pay $15 costs in a 6-cent case, where that is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>limit of the recovery? We think the interlocutory judgment and order ought to be reversed, without costs, (except as hereinafter mentioned,) and the demurrer sustained, with liberty to the plaintiff to amend his complaint by pleading special damages, or any other material allegation, on paying the disbursements incurred on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
