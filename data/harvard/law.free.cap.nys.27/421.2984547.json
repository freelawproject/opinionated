McKean, as assignee of the firm of Bullard &amp; Shannon, against Charles N. Adams, to recover the sum of $250 alleged to be due for services rendered to defendant by plaintiff\u2019s assignors, as attorneys at law. A verdict was rendered in favor of plaintiff for $50, and from the judgment entered thereon, and from an order denying a motion for a new trial, plaintiff appealed. The trial judge, after settlement of the case on appeal, vacated and set aside the same on defendant\u2019s motion, and from said order plaintiff appeals.

Under such circumstances it was not alone his right, but his duty, to make such an order; so that no injustice might be done respondent because of an incorrect and false record by the appellate court. The order is affirmed, with costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
