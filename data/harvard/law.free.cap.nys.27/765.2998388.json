Pentz and others, and the claimant, Ira Shafer, are adverse claimants to the award for certain parcels. The same petitioners, and William R. Hutton and others, executors, are adverse claimants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>to the award for certain other parcels in another proceeding. The questions presented are the same in both cases, and arise upon the same facts, and may be disposed of together. Prior to January, 1863, Smith Barker, as executor and trustee under the will of John Pentz, deceased, became the owner of a tract of land which included the parcels to which the awards for damage in controversy were made; the land being included within the boundaries of a street called \u201cPentz Street,\u201d which was laid out in the year 1872 by Barker, who caused a map of the Pentz tract to be made, by which it was laid oft in numbered city lots, fronting on streets and avenues designated thereon. It is \u25a0conceded that Pentz street was never laid down upon any of the official or \u25a0permanent maps of the city; neither upon that of 1811, made by the commissioners of streets and roads, under the act of 1807, nor later upon that of 1868, made by the Central Park commissioners, under chapter 697 of the Laws \u25a0of 1867; nor was it ever subsequently accepted or adopted by any department' \u25a0of the city government. It has never been graded or improved, nor used by the public or private owners. St. Nicholas terrace, as laid out in 1891, intersected Pentz street, and the awards in question were made for that part of the latter street included within the lines of this terrace. After filing the map of the Pentz tract, Barker, as executor, conveyed many of the lots embraced in said map by the numbers by which they were designated thereon, .and by descriptions bounding the lots by Pentz street and 139th street, as laid \u25a0down thereon. By reference to the Hutton deeds, which contain four separate descriptions, and to the ICilpatrick-Shafer deeds, which contain two \u25a0separate descriptions, it will be noticed that in all of the deeds the property is conveyed by lot numbers as appearing upon the map filed by Barker; but this is followed by a description giving the boundaries by courses and distances.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b794-5\">' Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

Y. 446. _ The .awards, therefore, should be equitably apportioned between the \u25a0owners of the fee and those persons to whose lands the easements were appurtenant. The orders should accordingly be reversed, .and the case sent back to the referee, in order that an apportionment may be made, with costs to appellants, to be paid out of the .awards.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
