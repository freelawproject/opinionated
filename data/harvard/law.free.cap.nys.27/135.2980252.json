This involves a question of fact, and, while the evidence is not very strong, yet it is sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>require the question of negligence to be submitted to the jury. There was sufficient evidence as to the ownership of the wagon and the agency of the driver to have forced defendants to contradict same. Seaman v. Koehler, 122 N. Y. 646, 25 N. E. 353. The evidence of Stone was admissible and relevant, as also the minutes of the former trial, which were offered for the purpose of impeaching the witness Tompkins, who had just sworn that on the last trial the boy Birnbaum had sworn to a certain state of facts. These minutes were in the possession and control of the witness Tompkins, and admitted to be correct. They were proper, then, to prove that the boy did not swear to the facts as testified to by Tompkins. The case was properly submitted to the jury, and we find no error. Judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
