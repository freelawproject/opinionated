The person whom the defendant seeks to interplead (one Meier) does not pretend or claim that he is entitled to said award, but claims that he is entitled to the debt upon which the award is predicated. Even the defendant\u2019s moving affidavits show this to be so. It is therefore apparent that two persons are not claiming the same thing, which is absolutely necessary before the right to an interpleader is established. The fact alleged by defendant that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the said award is based upon irregular proceedings, and lis therefore void, is proper and good by way of defense, and should be so pleaded in defendant\u2019s answer, but does not entitle him to an inter-pleader. The defendant\u2019s moving papers conclusively show that he is not subjected to a double demand for the same thing. The order must therefore be vacated, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">NEWBURGER, J.. concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
