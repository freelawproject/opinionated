The motion was denied, and we think properly. It is based on two grounds, as now argued before us:</p>\n<p id=\"b998-18\">1. That the affidavit in supplementary proceedings was irregular because it was not made by the attorney of the assignee of the judgment, and did not recite the assignment. The irregularity was not specified in the debtor\u2019s notice of motion, or order to show cause, as required by the rules, and therefore might be disregarded. Buie 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-19\">2. That the supplementary proceedings were unauthorized by the assignee of the judgment. But the debtor\u2019s affidavit shows the contrary, for he expressly states that the proceeding was taken for Cohen\u2019s benefit, in aid of his action to cancel the fraudulent conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-20\">The order is affirmed, with costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
