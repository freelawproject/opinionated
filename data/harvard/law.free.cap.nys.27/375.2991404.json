Siegel and Jacob Kulla to recover damages for trespass, in causing plaintiff\u2019s store to be entered, and its contents carried away, and plaintiff\u2019s business to be destroyed. The defense was that the store was entered and the contents levied on under an execution issued on a judgment recovered by defendants, and that the judgment debtor was the owner of the store and its contents at the time of the levy. From a judgment entered on a verdict in favor of plaintiff, and from an order denying a motion for a new trial made on the minutes, defendants appeal.

This contention, however, is without merit. Plaintiff\u2019s promise was enforceable against him as an original one, made upon an independent consideration, beneficial to him, and devolving the obligation to pay the demands as agreed. White v. Rintoul, 108 N. Y. 222, 227, 15 N. E. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The evidence shows that the defendants actively participated, and directed the marshal, in the seizure of and levy upon the store and contents. This constituted them trespassers equally with the marshal, and subjected defendants' to joint and several liability therefor, (Dyett v. Hyman, 129 N. Y. 351, 29 N. E. 261;) and, upon a charge to which no exception was taken, the learned trial judge fairly submitted the question \"of the bona fides of the transfer of the store, and of defendants\u2019 participation in its seizure, to the jury, whose determination upon a mere conflict of evidence we are not authorized to disturb. Besides, when the introduction of evidence for both sides was at an end, defendants did not ask that the complaint be dismissed, or a verdict be directed in their favor. Hence, they should now be precluded from questioning the sufficiency of the evidence for submission to the jury. Bennett v. Levi, (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 226. If it was error to deny \u2022defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint when plaintiff rested, the evidence thereafter adduced by either party obviated it. Meyers v. Cohn, 4 Misc. Rep. 185, 23 N. Y. Supp. 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Plaintiff was asked on direct examination, \u201cDid you have any transaction with Mr. Lindahl about the 21st of July, 1892?\u201d No exception was taken to the overruling of an objection by defendants\u2019 counsel, and the objection itself was invalid because no ground therefor was stated. Cruikshank v. Gordon, 118 N. Y. 178, 186, 23 N. E. 457. The motion to strike the answer out also fails to present any ground therefor, and was addressed to the discretion of the court, because no valid objection to the question was made. Platner v. Platner, 78 N. Y. 90, 101. It was competent to plaintiff to show payment of the demands agreed to be paid \"by him. The exception, therefore, to the question on plaintiff\u2019s direct examination, \u201cWhat was done by you with reference to the debts to the other persons, other than yourself?\u201d is unavailable. The question did not call for the narration of a conversation with .any person, as contended. An objection to an answer of the witness, without a motion to strike the answer out, does not present error. Hence, the exception based upon an objection to Lindahl\u2019s testimony as to why he made the transfer to plaintiff is invalid. Platner v. Platner, supra. The objection to the question asked \u25a0of Lindahl\u2014to state what goods the marshal took, and their value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\u2014specifies no ground. It was competent for plaintiff to show that the marshal entered his store with the intention of seizing it under .the process directed to him, as- well as that the demands which plaintiff had agreed to pay in consideration of the transfer of the store to him were actual and subsisting. The objections, therefore, to the introduction of this evidence, present no error. The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
