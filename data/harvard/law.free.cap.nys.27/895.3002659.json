According to the testimony which the jurors seem to have credited, as they had a right to do, it appears that the driver of defendant\u2019s car (upon which plaintiff was a passenger, standing on the front platform) drove the car against a wagon standing across the track, and about to enter a stable over the sidewalk. The collision threw plaintiff upon the street. His side was hurt, and his foot was seriously and permanently injured, there being a complete loss of sensation from the ankle to the toes, and a partial loss of motion. His foot was exposed to the jury, and the physicians tested the loss of sensation in their presence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>He was confined to his home for six weeks, and suffered great pain, was under the care of the physician for a considerable time, and was unable to do hard work at the time of the trial. The judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
