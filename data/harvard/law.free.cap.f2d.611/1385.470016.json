Alabama, </em>368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961). An Alabama arraignment was there held to be such a critical stage in view of the great number of available defenses waived or lost if not there asserted, defenses such as insanity, pleas in abatement, and challenges to the composition of the grand jury. The Court recognized, however, that \u201c[a]rraignment has differing consequences in the various jurisdictions.\u201d 368 U.S. at 54, n. 4, 82 S.Ct. at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-22\">In Texas, by contrast, the only defense waived by appellant\u2019s uncounselled \u201cNot guilty\u201d plea at his arraignment was that the name on the indictment was not appellant\u2019s true <em>name </em>\u2014 a defense which he has never suggested he might have asserted. At appellant\u2019s arraignment he pled \u201cNot guilty,\u201d asserted indigency, and was appointed counsel who represented him thenceforward.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a Texas arraignment is a \u201ccritical stage,\u201d we have held in similar circumstances that even on direct appeal a defendant may question failure to provide counsel only where potential substantial prejudice inheres. <em>United States v. Lacy, </em>446 F.2d 511 (5th Cir. 1971). In view of appellant\u2019s \u201cNot guilty\u201d plea, of the immediate appointment of counsel, and of the minor nature of the sole defense waived\u2014 the assertion of which would doubtless have resulted only in the correction of the indictment \u2014 we can conceive of no such prejudice here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">The Court, moreover, has indicated that the doctrine of harmless constitutional error applies in somewhat similar circumstances, <em>Moore v. Illinois, </em>434 U.S. 220, 232, 98 S.Ct. 458, 54 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977). We hold that it applies here, and that in the circumstances presented here any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
