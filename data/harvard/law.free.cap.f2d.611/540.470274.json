(ETA) brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against Ro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>bray Offshore Drilling Company, Ltd. (Robray) to collect a balance due on account for services growing out of a written contract, and design fees which were allegedly due under the contract. Robray filed a counterclaim for breach of contract and to recover usury penalties as provided by Texas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">On Robray\u2019s motion and supplemental motion for summary judgment, the district court found that ETA\u2019s acceptance and cashing of a check sent by Robray in settlement of the disputed statement of account constituted an accord and satisfaction, that Robray owed ETA $20,000.00 for design rights, and that Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 1302-2.09 precluded Robray\u2019s recovery of usury penalties. Robray appeals from that portion of the judgment which denied its counterclaim for usury penalties. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">ETA is a Texas corporation having its principal place of business in Houston, and Robray is a foreign corporation with its principal office in Singapore. On March 27, 1973, ETA and Robray entered into a written contract whereby ETA was to design for Robray a mobil self-elevating offshore drilling rig. The contract provided that ETA would own twenty percent of the design and Robray eighty percent, but that Robray would have the option to purchase ETA\u2019s design rights for $20,000.00 at any time prior to the compl\u00e9tion of the first unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In April, 1975, a dispute arose over the accuracy of the monthly statements of account. After much correspondence between the parties, Robray\u2019s vice president of finance met with officials of ETA in September, 1975, and tendered a $20,000.00 check in payment of Robray\u2019s option to purchase ETA\u2019s interest in the rig design. This offer was refused by ETA and the parties were unable to resolve their dispute as to the correct balance of account. ETA filed suit on October 1, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">In a letter dated October 6, 1975, Robray\u2019s attorney mailed two checks to ETA. One check was for $35,157.72 and was in payment of the statement of account dated September 15, 1975, less adjustments for two disputed invoices and the interest charged by ETA on the open account, and including a $4,000.00 retainer fee for the month of September. The other, in the amount of $20,000.00, represented a second attempt by Robray to exercise its option to buy ETA\u2019s design rights. The $35,157.72 check was cashed by ETA\u2019s Secretary-Treasurer. However, ETA again returned the $20,000.00 check, claiming that Robray had breached the contract by failing to make timely payments and hence the option to acquire ETA\u2019s design rights was no longer of any force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Thereafter ETA continued for twelve months to bill Robray for the monthly $4,000.00 retainer fee and to accept payment of such fees. On September 23, 1976, ETA sent Robray a \u201cStatement of Account as of September 8, 1976.\u201d This statement of account charged Robray interest of one percent per month on the previous month\u2019s unpaid balance of principal and interest, or $2,409,617.00. The contract contained no provision for payment of interest for past due amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">The issue on appeal is whether the district court properly construed the Texas usury statutes in denying Robray\u2019s counterclaim for the recovery of usury penalties. We conclude that the court\u2019s interpretation of these statutes, and of Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat. Ann. art. 1302-2.09 (Cum.Supp.1963-78) in particular, was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">As a basic premise, interest in excess of ten per cent per annum is usurious under Texas law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where the parties have not agreed on a rate of interest, six percent per annum is the allowable rate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The penalties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>for usury are imposed by Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat. Ann. art. 5069-1.06, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">(1) Any person who contracts for, charges or receives interest which is greater than the amount authorized by this Subtitle, shall forfeit to the obligor twice the amount of interest contracted for, charged or received, and reasonable attorney fees fixed by the court provided that there shall be no penalty for a violation which results from an accidental and bona fide error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Supreme Court of Texas recently held that the phrase \u201ccontracts for, charges or receives\u201d contained in Article 5069-1.06 is to be read disjunctively, and \u201conly one such condition need occur to trigger penalties; either a contract for, a charge of <em>or </em>receipt of usurious interest.\u201d <em>Windhorst </em>v. <em>Adcock Pipe and Supply, </em>547 S.W.2d 260, 261 (Tex.1977). Thus, in <em>Windhorst, </em>a retailer who unilaterally charged to its customer\u2019s open account a IV2 percent per month finance charge was liable under the statute, even though the customer did not agree to pay and never did pay the charge. <em>See also Houston Sash and Door Co., Inc. v. Heaner, </em>577 S.W.2d 217 (Tex.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">By virtue of this authority, it seems that ETA should have incurred penalties under the statute in that it unilaterally charged Robray interest in excess of six percent per annum. However, the district court applied Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 1302-2.09, and in so doing held that ETA\u2019s otherwise usurious interest charges did not subject it to penalties. Article 1302-2.09 reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, corporations, domestic or foreign, <em>may agree to and stipulate for </em>any rate of interest as <em>such corporation may determine, </em>not to exceed one and one-half percent (lV2%) per month, on any bond, note, debt, contract or other obligation of such corporation under which the principal amount is Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) or more, or on any series of advances of money pursuant thereto if the aggregate of sums advanced or originally proposed to be advanced shall exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000), or on any extension or renewal thereof, and in such instances, the claim or defense of usury by <em>such corporation </em>... is prohibited . (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Robray maintains, quite reasonably, that the district court\u2019s construction of this statute, in conjunction with its specific finding that the contract contained no provision for the payment of interest, was error. This assertion is supported by recent Texas case law. In <em>Houston Sash and Door Co., Inc. v. Heaner, supra, </em>the creditor charged interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum on its corporate debtor\u2019s open account. The Texas Supreme Court upheld the determination of the court of civil appeals that the creditor was subject to the penalty provisions of Article 5069-1.06 since it had not shown that the corporation had agreed to pay interest on the open account. Similarly, in <em>Carr Well Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skytop Rig Co., </em>582 S.W.2d 500 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 El Paso 1979, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.), the court of civil appeals specifically held that Article 1302-2.09 does not control in cases where the corporate debtor did not agree to the high rate of interest. These decisions are sound and are logically based on the literal language of the statute. Therefore, we hold that the district court erred in applying Article 1302-2.09 so as to preclude Robray\u2019s recovery of usury penalties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">In anticipation of this decision, ETA has limited its argument on appeal to its assertion that the accord and satisfaction eliminated not only the principal debt, but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>any usury claim which Robray might otherwise have had. Since the district court never reached the question of the effect of the accord and satisfaction on the usury claim, the parties may pursue this point before the district court on remand. The portion of the court\u2019s judgment denying the appellant\u2019s counterclaim for usury is reversed insofar as it is based on the applicability of Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 1302-2.-09, and the case is remanded for such other proceedings as may be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">.
