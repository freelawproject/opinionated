The first four claims of appellant were also raised by codefendant Paul Arthur Noll, and were decided adversely to him by a panel of this court in <em>United States v. Noll, </em>600 F.2d 1123 (5th Cir. 1979). We agree and affirm those points on the basis of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-26\">Appellant\u2019s final claim is that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction on any count. The facts of this crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>nal episode are set out in <em>Noll. </em>Appellant reasons that Mullins\u2019 statement to Harrell (that Mullins and others planned to make PCP) was inadmissible, so there was insufficient evidence to show that PCP was made. He argues that he, Noll, and Witt could have intended to use the chemicals present to make something else. However, Mullins\u2019 statement was properly admitted. There was sufficient evidence to show an attempt to make PCP. <em>See United States v. Noll, </em>at 1129. Evidence that appellant was present with Mullins to accept the PMB from Harrell, that appellant transported the PMB from Maryland to Florida, and that appellant joined with Noll and Witt to attempt to make PCP is sufficient to show that appellant conspired to make PCP. Evidence that appellant transported the PMB across the Maryland-North Carolina state line, together with the evidence of attempt, was sufficient to sustain the conviction for traveling in interstate commerce to promote an unlawful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Appellant having failed to meet his burden of demonstrating reversible error, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
