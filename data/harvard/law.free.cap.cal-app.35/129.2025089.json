Said section, so far as applicable here, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\u201c . . . Any action heretofore or hereafter commenced shall be dismissed by the court in which the same shall have been commenced or to which it may be transferred on motion of the defendant, after due notice to plaintiff or by the court on its own motion, unless such action is brought to trial within five years after the defendant has filed his answer, except where the parties have stipulated in writing that the time may be extended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The complaint in this action was filed on October 20, 1908, and the answer and cross-complaint on January 5, 1909. A demurrer to the answer and cross-complaint was filed on February 1, 1909, more than six years before the motion to dismiss the action was made. While the record discloses the fact that said demurrer was overruled, it does not show at what date such action was taken, but it is stated in respondents\u2019 brief that it occurred more than five years before the making of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Said motion to dismiss the action was heard upon affidavits. C. E. McLaughlin, attorney for defendants, whose affidavit was dated May 14, 1915, deposed that at no time since the answer was filed had any stipulation been entered into, in writing or otherwise, extending the time in which said action might be brought to trial; that, in September, 1913, affiant and A. E. Bolton, attorney for plaintiff, had a conversation in substance as follows: That said Bolton said to affiant: \u201cWe must arrange to try the case of <em>Perrin </em>v. <em>Miller. </em>It should have been tried before this, but Perrin has had so much trouble with the government, and has been so annoyed, and so much of my time has been taken up in connection with his difficulties, that we have never seen our way clear to try the case\u201d; that affiant replied to said statement: \u201cWe are ready to try the case at any time, but a date must be fixed which will not interfere with my other engagements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The affidavit of A. E. Bolton, attorney for plaintiff, referring to said conversation with Judge McLaughlin in 1913, was in practical accord with the latter\u2019s statement regarding the troubles of his client with the government, and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>eeeded: \u201cThat affiant does not remember the exact conversation that took place at that time, but as affiant understood the substance thereof, said McLaughlin said he would take up the trial of said cause at the pleasure of affiant; and affiant assured said McLaughlin that there was no disposition on the part of affiant or said Perrin to put off the trial of the case;'that the difficulties arose by reason of the condition of the affairs of said Perrin.\u201d It is also stated that 1 \u2018 affiant, by reason of the understanding of affiant, was taken by surprise\u201d when he learned from Judge McLaughlin, in March, 1915, that his clients were insisting that the cause bo dismissed, and \u201cthat affiant had relied upon said understanding. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Appellant, in his brief, says that, \u201cAfter the demurrer of the plaintiff to defendant\u2019s answer and cross-complaint had been overruled, no notice of the overruling of the demurrer was given to the plaintiff,\u201d and further states: \u201cIf the action was brought to trial by the filing and hearing upon the demurrer to the answer, then the action had been brought to trial and was pending, and could not be dismissed.\u201d The following eases are cited holding that \u201ca trial is the examination before a competent tribunal of the facts or law\u2014that is, when a court hears and determines any issue of fact or of law for the purtpose of determining the rights of the parties, it may be considered a trial.\u201d <em>(Tregambo </em>v. <em>Comanche M. Co., </em>57 Cal. 504; <em>Redington </em>v. <em>Cornwell, </em>90 Cal. 62, [27 Pac. 40]; <em>Flagg </em>v. <em>Peterbaugh, </em>98 Cal. 136, [32 Pac. 863] ; <em>Botto </em>v. <em>Vandament, </em>67 Cal. 332, [7 Pac. 753]; <em>Goldtree </em>v. <em>Spreckels, </em>135 Cal. 669, [135 Pac. 1091].) Appellant then says: \u201cAt the time of the enactment of section 583 in 1905, the word \u2018trial\u2019 had by these decisions been given a distinct meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Said section 583 was first before the supreme court in the case of <em>Romero </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>167 Cal. 216, [138 Pac. 1002], wherein it was said that the section fixes \u201ca maximum period of five years, upon the expiration of which the delay is declared to be sufficient as a matter of law and the dismissal is made mandatory.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">In <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>171 Cal. 719, [Ann. Cas. 1917D, 670, 154 Pac. 841], the court said: \u201cUnless the parties have, in effect at least, stipulated in writing that the action need not be brought to trial within five years from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the date of the filing of the answer, it must be dismissed at the expiration of such five years, if not \u2018brought to trial\u2019 within that time. ... It is a stipulation in writing extending the <em>jive year period </em>that the statute provides for, and without such a stipulation, certainly in the absence of some element of estoppel, there can be no effective answer to a motion to dismiss, if the action has not been \u2018brought to trial\u2019 within such period. The language of the statute is so plain in this regard that no other intent can be attributed to the legislature. We are not concerned here with the exact meaning of the term \u2018brought to trial,\u2019 for it is manifest that with whatever liberality we construe it in favor of plaintiff here, this action was not brought to trial within five years of the date of filing the answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In the case before us it becomes necessary that we should determine what was the intention of the legislature when it used the expression, \u201cbrought to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Our supreme court has declared that \u201cthe words of a statute must be interpreted according to their common acceptation\u201d <em>(Quigley </em>v. <em>Gorman, </em>5 Cal. 418, [63 Am. Dec. 139] ; <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>21 Cal. 393; <em>People </em>v. <em>Reis, </em>76 Cal. 269, [18 Pac. 309]), and also that \u201cwhere a word, having a technical as well as a popular meaning, is used in a statute, the courts will accord to it its popular signification.\u201d <em>(Weill </em>v. <em>Kenfield, </em>54 Cal. 111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">There can be no question that, applying the above rules of construction to the section under consideration, the \u201ccommon acceptation\u201d and the \u201cpopular signification\u201d of the word \u201ctrial\u201d must be construed as referring to a hearing and determination of the issues of fact involved. To hold otherwise would be to give to the word a strained and 'technical meaning. If the judge of a superior court in this state should announce that he would proceed to set cases for trial, every attorney present would know that he meant that the issues of fact were to be tried. There may be several \u201ctrials\u201d-of issues of law besides the ruling on a demurrer, such as an order granting or denying a motion to change the place of trial, the ruling on a request of a party to be permitted to amend pleadings, etc. It is inconceivable that, if its attention had been directed to the various \u201ctrials\u201d possible in an action, the legislature should have been so careless as not to have inserted in the section words definitely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>indicating whether the trial referred to was one of fact or of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">If, as we hold, the word \u201ctrial\u201d means the trial of the issues of fact, we are unable to perceive any just reason why the judgment should be reversed. Said section 583 is mandatory in its terms. It directs that an action <em>\u201cshall </em>be dismissed by the court . . . except where the parties have stipulated in writing that the time may be extended.\u201d More than six years had elapsed since the filing of the answer and no written stipulation extending time had been entered into. If the conversation between the counsel for the respective parties, in September, 1913, was as stated by appellant\u2019s attorney, to have prevented the terms of the section from applying to his cause of action, the understanding should have been reduced to writing in the form of a stipulation to extend the time of trial and signed by the attorneys for both parties. By the entering into of such a written stipulation only could the imperative mandate of the section have been made unavailing to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Much space is devoted in the briefs to a discussion of various questions arising under the pleadings\u2014as to who are necessary parties, whether the demurrer to defendants\u2019 cross-complaint was properly overruled, etc. Inasmuch as we hold that the action was properly dismissed, we conceive it to be unnecessary to examine and decide the questions thus discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Chipman, P. J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
