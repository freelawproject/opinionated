The respondent, Industrial Accident Commission, concluded from the evidence on the whole that the relation of employer and employee existed, and thereupon made its award. We are satisfied that the evidence sustains this conclusion, and for that reason the writ is dismissed and the award affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
