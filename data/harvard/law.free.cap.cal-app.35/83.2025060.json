Cas. 942, 85 Pac. 1011], and the case of <em>Kissler </em>v. <em>Budge, </em>24 Idaho, 246, [133 Pac. 125], the court was within the law when it refused to dismiss the cause after a good and sufficient bond had been filed. For that reason the writ is dismissed. .</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on December 20,1917.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
