In short, no injury comes to him because his petition is filed and numbered with a similar pending petition, and the presumption is that the superior court will do what the law demands in the premises. It is conceded that the writ of mandate is issued by this court as a matter of discretion and not as of right, and in the present case there does not appear to be any injury suffered by the petitioner because of the action of the clerk. Moreover we are of the opinion that if the petitioner is entitled to the remedy prayed for, it may be plainly, speedily, and adequately had in the court below upon proper application and showing made there.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">. For these reasons the writ is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
