The complaint further alleges that as a result of this 'unauthorized conduct of the defendant the plaintiff\u2019s professional reputation and stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ing as a lawyer was seriously impaired, and that he was damaged in the sum of one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, for which sum he demanded judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The complaint contains much immaterial matter, and it would certainly he obnoxious to a special demurrer, but as against a general- demurrer we think was good; for, assuming \u2014as we must on demurrer\u2014that the allegations of the complaint are true, we learn that the defendant, without the plaintiff\u2019s permission, used his name and his alleged well-known standing as an attorney at law to endeavor to effect collections of over one thousand tardy accounts. This, if true, was certainly a transgression or invasion of the plain.tiff\u2019s rights, from which the law will at least presume nominal damages, which may be recovered. (Civ.
