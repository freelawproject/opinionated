This evidence was received without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Thereupon, the court, over the objection and exception of the defendant, permitted the plaintiff to testify that as a result of the injury to his testicles he had become impotent. The testimony regarding the extent and effect of his injuries was supported by medical testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">The first assignment of error challenges the action of the court in permitting plaintiff to testify as to his impotency, the defendant\u2019s contention being based upon the theory that there was no allegation to that effect in the declaration. There is no merit in this contention. Plaintiff alleges in his declaration that the accident caused his testicles to be contused, which injury the evidence tends to show resulted in impotency. In other words, the declaration was notice to defendant of an injury which might result in impotency.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">In Hall v. Manufacturer\u2019s Coal &amp; Coke Co., 260 Mo. 351, 168 S.W. 927, 933, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 375, cited by defendant, there was a general allegation in plaintiff\u2019s declaration to the effect that his body was. severely and permanently wounded, bruised, contused, and torn, and \u201cthat he suffered great bodily and mental pain and anguish as the result of said injuries * * ' * and is and was, as a result of said injuries, permanently injured and crippled for life, that ever since said injuries and as a result thereof and by reason of said injuries he has suffered, does suffer, and will continue to suffer for the remainder of his life, great bodily pain, annoyance, inconvenience, and expense.\u201d Plaintiff in that case had been permitted to introduce evidence of impotency. The appellate court said: \u201cIt will be noticed that the petition [declaration] fails to specifically allege impotency, neither does it contain an allegation of a general nature which might be said to embrace within its terms the condition of impotency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">In the present case the allegation as to the injury to the testicles \u201cmight be said to embrace within its terms the condition of impotency.\u201d That allegation was sufficient notice to defendant on this branch of the case as to what it would be called upon to answer, so that it would \u201cnot be taken by surprise.\u201d Garrett v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co., 235 U.S. 308, 35 S.Ct 32, 33, 59 L.Ed. 242. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>In the second assignment of error defendant complains because the court admitted testimony \u201cas to the atrophy of plaintiff\u2019s testicles.\u201d As already stated, this evidence was received without objection or exception. Defendant may not now object to the introduction of this testimony. Moreover, our reasons for rejecting the first assignment of error are applicable also to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In the third assignment of error defendant complains that the court failed to strike the testimony of the witness Elmer Millard relating to the sinking of his truck some 15 to 18 feet away from the hole in which plaintiff is alleged to have fallen. The witness testified that during February, 1931, a week or 10 days before plaintiff\u2019s accident, he drove a ton and a half Ford truck across the sidewalk 15 feet south of the watering trough; that both hind wheels suddenly went in up to the hub; that before he drove across, the driveway was perfectly smooth; that he saw the hole in which plaintiff fell; at the bottom- of the hole was mud and water. The witness overheard the statement of a Mr. Fitzgerald (since deceased) in a conversation with police officers between the time the truck broke through and the time plaintiff fell, to the effect \u201cthat if they did not fix that place in the driveway someone was going to break their neck.\u201d The defendant moved to strike out this testimony, which had been given without objection or exception. The court declined to strike at that stage of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Later Police Officer Storm testified that on December 28, 1930, he saw a deep hole in a tree-box space 25 or 30 feet south of the watering trough and reported the hole on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">A Mr. Lei\u2019zear, after testifying concerning the accident to plaintiff, testified that he heard Fitzgerald in conversation with police officers say that \u201cthe whole place was undermined\u201d and that unless something was done \u201csomebody is going to break his neck.\u201d When Leizear overheard Fitzgerald state to the officers that this whole place was undermined, Fitzgerald was standing where the Millard truck had broken through. The evidence therefore as. to the breaking through of the truck was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Mr. Elbert, a District computing engineer, testified to the laying on August 1, 1930, of a 12-inch water main under the sidewalk about 2 or 3 feet east of the watering trough, the location of which has already been stated. It is now contended in the fourth assignment of error that the court erred in admitting his testimony. No objection or exception was taken to its admission. There is, therefore, no basis for this assignment of error. Moreover, the defendant later introduced testimony concerning the laying of the water main.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">In 'the fifth assignment of error defendant complains because the court admitted testimony relative to the hole in the tree-box space in December 1930, some 25 or 30 feet away from the place which caved in under plaintiff. This hole was reported by the police officer on December 28, 1930. This testimony was admissible, we think, as tending to show that before plaintiff\u2019s injury there was a condition within a space of 25 or 30 feet of the point of the accident which should have indicated to defendant that the entire place, as described in Fitzgerald\u2019s complaint, \u201cwas undermined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">In assignment 6 defendant alleges that the court should have directed a verdict for the defendant at the close of plaintiff's case; and in 7, that a verdict should have been directed at the conclusion of all the testimony. By introducing evidence, after denial at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case of the motion for a directed verdict, defendant waived the exception. Picard v. Smith, 59 App.D.C. 291, 40 F. (2d) 803. The evidence as a whole justified the conclusion that the defendant had notice of an unsafe condition in the sidewalk at and in the vicinity of the accident^ and that an examination would have disclosed the cause and suggested the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">In his charge to the jury the court directed attention to the fact that several months after the accident \u201cthe place was dug up and a leak discovered in the pipe connecting with the water trough\u201d; that ordinarily the existence of a defect several months after an accident is no notice of its existence at the time, but, said the court, \u201cit seems to -me that in this case that may be taken into consideration in connection with all those other circumstances and from that you might, if you thought proper, draw some inference as to its previous existence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">In the ninth, eleventh, and twelfth assignments of error the correctness of this portion of the charge is. challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Mr. Keppel, an employee of and witness for the defendant, testified that in the latter part of 1930 and early in 1931 he was a plumber\u2019s helper and at the time of his testimony (January 1935) a plumbing inspector; that he was in the vicinity of Georgia avenue and Blair road once a week; that he had never seen the horse-watering trough overflow nor had he seen the trough leak, except once when he was sent there in response to a complaint. \u201cOn June 28, 1931, at 7:30 in the morning he went there to make a repair; that he repaired the leak; that the leak was in the intake on the south end; that the repair he made was to a small 3-inch galvanized nipple; that in February 1931 witness was at the horse-watering trough; that he looked up the record; that there was nothing wrong with the trough in February 1931; * * * that he was working the week ending February 19, 1931.\u201d \u201cThat 4 months after the accident, witness got orders to make a test; that he put a curb cock key into the water box and turned the water off; that when he turned the water off it was not leaking, but when he turned it on there was a slight leak in the curb box.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">On cross-examination this witness testified that the curb cock was about 3 feet underground; \u201cthat the leak was not at the curb cock but 'right at the fountain, in a small %-inch nipple at the inside; that he did not know how long it had been leaking\u201d ; that he did not dig up or investigate the cause of the cave-in in February, 1931; that the first time anything was done to the trough was in June, 1931; \"that if a leak occurred the ground around it -would be soft and the water would come up in the course of 2 or 3 days and the ground around the trough would be soft and soggy; that the moisture would come <em>up </em>and cause a cave-in and a cave-in could be caused by a leak.\u201d On redirect examination this witness testified that the leak in June, 1931, was caused by the short, 3-inch nipple; \u201cthat the threads were rotten on the end.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">It will be observed that Keppel\u2019s test was made by direction of the defendant. The purpose of that test undoubtedly was to disprove plaintiff\u2019s contention that a leaky pipe in the previous February had been responsible for the dangerous condition which resulted in plaintiff\u2019s injuries. But a leak was discovered by defendant\u2019s employee and was disclosed by his testimony. How long the leak had existed, witness could not say, but he did say that it was \u201ccaused by the short, 3-inch nipple,\u201d and that \u201cthe threads were rotten on the end.\u201d No other leak was discovered, and in the circumstances the justifiable inference is that with the repair of the discovered leak the dangerous condition terminated. The leak, according to Keppel\u2019s testimony, was caused by \u201crotten threads.\u201d It is common knowledge that a considerable length of time must elapse before metal threads will become rotten. Indeed, this was recognized by the witness when he said \u201che did not know how long it (the nipple) had been leaking.\u201d Defendant having introduced that testimony, the court properly commented upon the weight to be given to it and the inferences reasonably deducible therefrom in the light of the other evidence. The charge was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
