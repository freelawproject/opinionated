Thereafter, the City adopted specifications and advertised for bids for furnishing and installing the new power plant. On September 19, 1927, the bid of Fairbanks Morse was accepted subject to the submission of a satisfactory 'contract. The contract above referred to was submitted, and the City adopted an ordinance approving it and authorizing the mayor <em>and </em>city clerk to execute it in behalf of the City. It was duly executed on October 6, 1927. In making the bid and entering into the contract, Fairbanks Morse acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Fairbanks Morse Company delivered and installed the new power plant, and the City Commissioners, by a unanimous vote, accepted same and directed the mayor and city clerk to execute and deliver the notes to Fairbanks Morse. They were so executed and delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The new power plant was duly and properly furnished and installed, and fully \u25a0conformed to the contract specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">On March 16, 1928, the City commenced the use of the new power plant to generate electric energy for its electric utility. Until May 7, 1928, the electric utility was in charge of an experienced and competent engineer who operated the new power plant properly, efficiently and economically. The electric utility was under the supervision of the City Water &amp; Light Commissioner. On May 7, 1928, a new Water &amp; Light Commissioner took office. He immediately discharged the engineer in charge of the electric utility, and placed it in charge of an inexperienced and incompetent engineer. The new commissioner was opposed to the purchase of the new power plant and favored the buying of electric energy from the Public Service Company of Oklahoma; and he placed the incompetent engineer in charge of the electric utility with the deliberate purpose of creating the impression upon the inhabitants of the City that the Diesel engines were inefficient, expensive to operate, and not capable of carrying the rated capacity load specified in the contract. The new engineer operated the new power plant until October 17, 1930, when the engines were disconnected and their use discontinued. After the new engineer took charge, the Diesel engines were negligently, unskillfully and improperly cared for and operated. A water softener was not used, scale collected in the cooling system, the engines were overheated, nine cylinder heads were cracked, water was permitted to escape into the cylinders and dilute the lubricating oil, and the pistons and cylinders were scored.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">On September 17, 1927, Zachary and Eby, residents and taxpayers of Wagoner, commenced a suit in the District Court of Wagoner County, Oklahoma, against the City, its mayor and commissioners to enjoin the execution of the contract on the ground it undertook to create an indebtedness contrary to the provisions of the Oklahoma Constitution and the City Charter set out in note 1. After the contract was executed by the City, Zachary and Eby filed a supplemental bill in which they sought to enjoin the City from carrying it out. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the supplemental petition, and entered a decree of dismissal. On appeal the Supreme Court reversed the decree and remanded the cause with instructions to overrule the demurrer. Zachary v. City of Wagoner, 146 Okl. 268, 292 P. 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">Fairbanks Morse was not a party to the suit in the state court. It did not directly or indirectly participate in the trial in the District Court or the hearing in the Supreme Court, or in anywise direct or control the litigation of the suit. It furnished the mayor $750 with which to employ counsel to represent the City on the appeal. The counsel employed in nowise represented Fairbanks Morse.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">The mandate from the Supreme Court in Zachary &amp; Eby v. City of Wagoner, was received by the District Court of Wagoner County and spread of record October 10, 1930. On October 11, 1930, a decree was entered by the State Court permanently enjoining the City from carrying out the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>On October 16, 1930, the city commissioners adopted an ordinance authorizing the mayor and city clerk, in behalf of the City, to enter into a contract with the Public Service Company for the purchase by the City from the Public Service Company of electric energy for a period of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The rates provided for in such contract with the Public Service Company were 3 cents per K.W.H. for lighting, small power and appliances, 2.05 cents pqr K.W.H. for industrial power, and 2 cents per K.W.H. for street lighting, municipal building lighting and municipal water pumping. The City also bore the line loss. The minimum rate under the contract was .40 cents, and the maximum rate 1.40 cents in excess of the average cost to the City of producing electricity during the period the new power plant was used by the City, even with the unskillful, careless and inefficient operation by the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">On June 25, 1931, Fairbanks Morse filed its application for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of, and operate the electric utility with the new power plant, and offered to place the engines in operating condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">On the same day the Court entered an order appointing T. C. Harrill, receiver, to take charge of and operate the electric utility. Fairbanks Morse expended $1750.-71 in reconditioning the engines and placed them in fair operating condition. The receiver was ordered to keep accurate accounts of operating costs and expenses and of earnings, and to retain the net earnings until the further order of the court. E. D. Lord succeeded Harrill as receiver on October 3, 1932. The electric utility has been continuously operated by such receivers since July 13, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The City, prior to September 27, 1927, had fixed the rates for domestic use at 12 cents per K.W.H. The Court entered an order reducing such rate to 8 cents per K.W.H. effective November 1, 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The City operated the electric utility with the'new power plant from March 16, 1928, to August 17, 1930, a period of two years, five months and one day. The receivers\u2019 reports considered in the Court\u2019s findings covered the receivers\u2019 operation from July 13, 1931, to August 28, 1933, a period of two years, one month and fifteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">For the twelve months ending June 30, 1927, the cost of producing electric energy with the steam plant was 3.03 cents per K.W.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">For the month of April 1928, when the new power plant was operated by a com7 petent engineer, the cost was .98 cents per K.W.H. For the month of May 1928, six days of which the new power plant was operated by a competent engineer, the cost was 1.81 cents per K.W.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">During the period of the City\u2019s operation 1,877,500 K.W.H.\u2019s of electric energy were produced at an average cost of 1.60 cents per K.W.H. This was 1.43 cents per K.W.H. less than the average cost for the fiscal year 1926-1927, and the new power plant effected a saving of $27,189.30. During the period covered by the receivers\u2019 reports 1,688,700 K.W.H.\u2019s of electric energy were produced at an average cost of 1.003 cents per K.W.H. This was 2.027 cents per K.W.H. less than the average cost for the fiscal year 1926-1927, and the new power plant effected a saving of $34,255.88.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">Due to the fact that the equipment was in better condition when the period of the City\u2019s operation commenced than during the period of the receivers\u2019 operation, the former period should have reflected a greater saving than the latter. The costs during the period of the City\u2019s operation were excessive due to the careless, improper and inefficient operation of the plant by the new engineer. If the City had operated the plant at no greater costs than the receiver, the savings effected would have been increased $11,208.68, and the total saving for both periods would have been $72,623.86.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">The actual savings for the combined period of the City\u2019s and the receivers\u2019 operations average slightly in excess of $1,-274.00 per month. The notes evidencing the monthly installments under the contract were each for $1,061.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">The City owns and operates a water utility which furnishes water to the City and its inhabitants. Since September 27, 1927, the pumping plant at the waterworks has been operated by electric energy furnished from the electric utility. In its accounting system the City charged its water utility and credits its electric utility with the electric energy used at the pumping plant, but no funds received by the water utility have been used to pay the cost of producing the electric energy used at the water plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">The cost of energy furnished the water utility during the period of the City\u2019s op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>eration of the Diesel plant was $3,650.21, and during the receivers\u2019 operation was $11,420.93. The increase during the latter period is due to the fact that the meter during the period of the City\u2019s operation was defective and under registered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">No charge has been made either by the City or the receiver for electric energy used by the City at the city parks, city buildings, and the cemetery, and for street lighting and other City purposes. During the period covered by the receivers\u2019 reports, 22,590 K.W.H.\u2019s were used in the city parks, City Hall, City Library and cemetery, and 124,597 K.W.H.\u2019s were used in the white way and residence street lighting systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">During the period of the City\u2019s operation, electrical energy was being supplied to churches, public schools, and certain individuals without charge; and meters were permitted to be tampered with resulting in some cases in no registration and in others of under registration of the amount cf current used. The receiver corrected these conditions. The loss due thereto during the period of the City\u2019s operation amounted to $3,755.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">During the period of the City\u2019s operation, the total revenue of the electric utility was $56,203.67, and the total expense for labor, materials, supplies, replacements and maintenance of the entire plant was $45,375.07. During the receivers\u2019 operation, the total revenue actually received was $47,047.09, and the total expense for labor, material, supplies, replacements and maintenance of the entire plant was $27,-964.82, leaving net earnings of $19,082.27. The net earnings would have been $26,-030.62 had the rates not been reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u2022 The Court made a recapitulation which we set forth in subjoined note 3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">If the City had operated the electric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>utility with proper skill, care and attention, the savings effected and net earnings produced by the new power plant would have been sufficient to have paid the installment notes monthly as they matured without resort directly or indirectly to tax revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">During the period of the City\u2019s operation it paid in liquidation of 19 of the notes $20,167.36 principal, and $166.67 interest. Thirty-three of the notes remain unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The bill prayed that the defendants account for any funds in the hands of the City Treasurer which represents savings in the cost of producing electricity with the new power plant, that the defendants be required to apply same on the balance due on the contract, and that the defendants be required to pay the remainder out of future savings effected by the new power, plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The answer set up the proceedings and judgment in the state court suit, and the alleged invalidity of the contract. It alleged that the City paid to Fairbanks Morse $20,332.03 on the contract; that it paid $7,700 thereof, out of a sinking fund and was entitled to recover back double the amount of such payment. It prayed that the contract and the unpaid notes be cancelled and that plaintiff recover the sum of $28,032.03 with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The trial court field the contract was void because it made no provision for a depreciation reserve and, therefore, cast an incidental tax burden on the taxpayers of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">It concluded that Fairbanks Morse was entitled to retain the sum of $20,167.36, principal and $166.67, interest paid on the contract, and to remove and take into its possession, 'the engines and equipment; and that the City was entitled to the net proceeds in the hands of the receiver derived from the operation of the light plant after deducting the costs and expenses of the receivership. It entered a decree accordingly and both sides have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">The object of the provisions of the Oklahoma Constitution and City Charter set out in note 1, is to place restrictions on the taxing power and on the incurring of indebtedness payable out of tax revenues. Campbell v. State, 23 Okl. 109, 99 P. 778, 784, 785; Faught v. Sapulpa, 145 Okl. 164, 292 P. 15, 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">Section 26 of article 10 of the Oklahoma Constitution was adopted from the Missouri Constitution of 1875.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-19\">There has grown up in many jurisdictions in this country what is commonly known as the special fund doctrine to the effect that a contract by a municipality to purchase and pay for property sol\u00e9ly out of the net earnings of the property, without resort directly or indirectly to revenues derived from taxation, does not create a debt within the meaning of such constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-20\">The doctrine has been approved in Missouri, and Oklahoma and many other states.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AmrO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>It is true that the special fund doctrine was disapproved in Zachary v. City of Wagoner, 146 Old. 268, 292 P. 345, 348.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">However in the later case of Baker v. Carter, 165 Old. 116, 25 P.(2d) 747, 755, the court expressly approved the special fund doctrine. In the opinion the court in part said:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u201c59 C.J. page 225, \u00a7 370, announced this general rule: \u2018Obligations, issued by a state, if payable only from the revenue to be realized from a particular utility or property acquired with the proceeds of the obligations, if payable only from the revenue to be realized from special taxes for a particular utility or property, acquired by the obligations or proceeds, or if payable only from a special fund to be raised from the sale or lease of lands previously set apart for the purpose of the obligations, do not generally constitute debts of the state within the meaning of constitutional limitations on indebtedness.\u2019 * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b247-32\">\u201cThe Supreme Court of California, Garrett v. Swanton, 216 Cal. 220, 13 P.(2d) 725, 729 in construing the special fund doctrine, held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-33\">\u201c \u2018The overwhelming weight of judicial opinion in this country is to the effect that bonds, or other forms of obligation issued by states, cities, counties, political subdivisions, or public agencies by legislative sanction and authority, if such par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ticular bonds or obligations are secured by and payable only from the revenues to be realized from a particular utility or property, acquired with the proceeds of the bonds or obligations, do not constitute debts of the particular state, political subdivision, or public agency issuing them, within the definition of \u201cdebts\u201d as used in the constitutional provisions of the states having limitations as to the incurring of indebtedness. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">\u201c \u2018Thus it is well established that an indebtedness or liability is incurred when by the terms of the transaction a municipality is obligated directly or indirectly to feed the special fund from general or other revenues in addition to those arising solely from the specific improvement contemplated. It also seems to be well settled, as a second limitation to the doctrine, that a municipality incurs an indebtedness or liability when by the terms of the transaction the municipality may suffer a loss if the special fund is insufficient to pay the obligation incurred. * * *\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201cAn examination of many authorities cited in the brief and a research of many others conducts us to the conclusion that, so far as the special fund doctrine is concerned, the majority rule as set forth in the case of Garrett v. Swanton et al., supra, announces the correct rule that a limitation upon state or municipal indebtedness is not violated by an obligation which is payable out of a special fund, if the state or municipality is not liable to\" pay the same out of its general fund should the special fund prove to be insufficient and the transaction by which the indebtedness is incurred cannot in any event deplete the resources of the state or the municipality, limited to the two exceptions noted therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Furthermore only the petition and demurrer were before the Supreme Court in Zachary v. City of Wagoner, supra, and it is apparent from a statement in Baker v. Carter, supra, that the court conceived the facts to be that the payments were to be made from the earnings of the entire plant, part of which had been acquired with funds derived from ad valorem taxation, whereas in fact the payments were to be made solely from the earnings of the new power plant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Where a contract is fairly susceptible of two constructions, one of which will render it lawful and the other unlawful, the former will be adopted. Hobbs v. McLean, 117 U.S. 567, 576, 6 S.Ct. 870, 29 L.Ed. 940; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Delmar Co., 283 U.S. 686, 691, 51 S.Ct. 579, 75 L.Ed. 1349; E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Claiborne-Reno Co. (C.C.A.8) 64 F.(2d) 224, 228, 89 A.L.R. 238; Moffat Tunnel Improvement Dist. v. Denver &amp; S. L. Ry. Co. (C.C.A.10) 45 F.(2d) 715, 733. Therefore, if the language of the contract permits, we should adopt a construction that will render it valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The property sold was a complete power or generating plant. The payments were to be made from the savings effected by the new power plant over the old steam power plant. The savings were in fact, a portion of the net earnings of the generating plant because in arriving at such savings, there were to be deducted salaries and wages of engineers, employees, mechanics, laborers and other workers engaged in the operation and maintenances of the plant, all expenses for fuel and oil and all other expenses reasonably n\u00e9cessary for the production of the electricity and the maintenance, upkeep and repair of the plant, machinery, equipment, appliances and appurtenances and the buildings and structures housing the same, and the cost of insurance on the plant machinery, equipment, appliances, appurtenances, buildings and structures. The only costs or expenses that were not to be deducted were distributing costs and the expense of collect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ing charges. These were not generating costs, but were properly allocated to the distributing system.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">It will be noted that the electric utility, with the steam power plant, produced income sufficient to maintain the same, pay all operating expenses, and yield a profit to the City. The new power plant reduced the costs of generation approximately two cents per K.W.H. or an average monthly saving of about $1300 per month. If the light utility, with the expensive steam plant produced sufficient revenue to pay all costs of maintenance and all operating costs and, in addition, to yield a profit to the City, with a saving of $1300 per month effected by the new power plant in generating costs, it should still yield sufficient net earnings to pay costs of maintenance, operating expenses and to permit the use of $1061.44 of the earnings of the new equipment to be used to pay the purchase price thereof, without resort to taxation to main; tain or operate the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The trial court was of the opinion the contract was invalid because it made no provision for a reserve for depreciation of the plant. It will be noted that the contract provides for the deduction of all costs and expenses \u201cfor the production of electricity and the operation, maintenance and up-keep of said plant and the machinery, equipment, appliances and appurtenances <em>* </em>* *, and the buildings and structures housing and protecting same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AtU\">It is well settled by works on accounting and by accepted accounting practices, that depreciation is an operating cost or expense.

City of Campbell v. Arkansas-Missouri Power Co. (C.C.A.8) 55 F.(2d) 560, 563. But if the purchase price is payable only from the net earnings of the unit purchased, and there is a reasonable allocation of earnings to that unit, the contract is valid. City of Campbell v.

City of Spokane, 12 Wash. 524, 41 P. 888; Faulkner v. City of Seattle, 19 Wash. 320, 53 P. 365; Joliet v. Alexander, 194 Ill. 457, 62 N.E. 861; East Moline v. Pope, 224 Ill. 386, 79 N.E. 587, and other cases), but we cannot follow such holding. In our opinion, this is but another attempt to nullify and evade the wholesome constitutional limitations upon the power of municipalities to create indebtedness and to usurp powers never intended to be granted to municipal officers. The reasoning in support thereof is the ingenious ai\u2019gument by which such attempts have ever been supported. Under the decisions of this court and the Constitution and laws of Oklahoma, the agreement to pay for the material purchased creates an indebtedness\" no matter from what source the funds are to be derived from which the payment is to be made. Sections 26 and 27, article 10, supra, contain nothing that limits their application to indebtedness to be paid fx-om funds derived from ad valorem tax levy. They are general in their terms and they will be applied by this court to all manner of ixxdebtedness, no matter bow created or from what source the indebtedness is to be paid. As well might a municipality contend that an indebtedness was not an indebtedness because it was to be paid from receipts fx-om gross production tax or other sources of income other than ad valorem taxation. We cannot give our approval to any such theory of the law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\"> In Baker v. Carter, the court said: \u201cThe case of Zachary et al. v. City of Wagoner, 146 Okl. 268, 292 P. 345, is cited by the plaintiffs as authority for their contention that in this case a debt is created in violation of the said constitutional provisions. In that case the city of Wagoner purchased Diesel engines, and provided for the payment of the purchase price thereof over a period of years from the savings accruing to the city each month from the operation of the said plant during said period of time when operated with the Diesel engines over the income derived from the plant accruing during a like period of the fiscal year of 1926-27 before it was equipped with the Diesel engines, and this court held that an indebtedness was created thereby in violation of the constitutional provisions. In that case a portion of the corpus of the lighting system of the city created by an ad valorm tax was utilized to feed the special fund provided for the payment of the Diesel engines.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\"> In Bell v. City of Fayette, supra, the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u201cIt will be noted that the distinction is whether any other property of the city is liable for the payments or whether the purchase price of such improvement is to be paid for wholly out of the earnings of the improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\u201cAppellant admits the general principle stated in McQuillin, but seeks to make a distinction between the Neosho Case [203 Mo. 40, 101 S.W. 99] and this case, in this; that in the Neosho Case the city purchased the waterworks and agreed to pay for it out of its own earnings as the city realized such earnings from the private consumers; whereas, in this case the city owned its power plant and the pay-</p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">ment was to be made out of the earnings of that power plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">\u201cYet the contract in this case carefully and distinctly avoids that very contingency \u2019by making the payments solely out of the earnings of the Diesel engines purchased. The general revenue from the operation of a waterworks is not pledged to pay these installments. No special or general tax could be levied for the purpose of making those payments ; they can be paid only from the revenue, the savings, derived to the city from the use of these engines purchased. What it cost the city per kilowatt hour without these engines is the measure by which this earning is to be determined. The difference is what the city saves each month by</p>\n<p id=\"AbL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the use of the engines. Whether that method to which the parties resort in order to ascertain the \u2018savings\u2019 or earnings, is exact, or is capable of being applied, ia not in question. Thus the monthly installments in this case are to be paid out of the earnings of the engines purchased, and nothing else, and the only remedy provided in the contract which the company has in case of failure to pay, is to retake the engines for failure to pay the purchase price.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
