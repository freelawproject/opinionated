Thus the total deduction claimed by petitioner amounts to $213,213.47, the amount of the combined losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">The Board of Tax Appeals denied the claimed deduction upon the ground that it was \u201cnot satisfied that the sale of the tanks and stock was made in good faith,\u201d and, as to the stock, upon the further ground that \u201cthe cost of the stock to the petitioner was not sufficiently proven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-18\">At the outset it should be noted that the question for consideration is a factual one; that is, whether there vfas an actual sale and a loss thus sustained. That there was a loss by the petitioning company if the tanks and stock were sold is not questioned, although there is a dispute as to the sufficiency of the evidence to show a loss in the sale of the stock. If there was a loss due t\u00ae depreciation in value of the tanks and the stock, it was not a deductible loss until the tanks and stock were sold. It matters not that the purpose of the sale was to lay a foundation for such deduction. If there was a sale, that ipso facto entitled the taxpayer to the loss thus sustained. Budd v. Com\u2019r (C.C.A.) 43 F.(2d) 509; Jones v. Helvering, 63 App.D.C. 204, 71 F. (2d) 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-19\">Was there such a sale? That $19,000 was paid by the purchaser to Ihe petitioner and this sum was retained by the petitioner, and the tanks and stock were transferred to the purchaser, does not seem to be questioned. The difficulty seems to be that the McGinley Corporation, the company that made the purchase, and the Fulton Oil Company were under the same management; that is, Mr. McGinley was the president of both. The Commissioner contends that the relationship of the two corporations was such that the sale was constructively fraudulent, and consequently the purchaser was a constructive trustee for the petitioner. This point seems not to have been pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>sented to, or considered by, the Board of Tax Appeals. That Board, after stating at great length the evidentiary facts and its conclusions with reference thereto, stated that it was not satisfied that the \u201csale\u201d was bona fide. It did not find that there was no sale. If we were to consider the effect of the evidence and decide whether or not there was a sale, we would be doing what it was the duty of the Board to do and what we have no authority to do. We must remand the case to the Board of Tax Appeals for a finding as to whether, there was a sale, and a consequent deductible loss. Helvering v. Rankin, 295 U.S. 123, 131, 55 S.Ct. 732, 79 L.Ed. 1343; Anderson v. Com\u2019r (C.C.A.9) 78 F.(2d) 636, 637; Belridge Oil Co. v. Helvering (C.C.A.) 69 F.(2d) 432. We refrain from commenting upon the finding of the Board that there was no proof of the cost of the stock of the Maple Leaf Refining Company, for the reason that this question will again be involved in the decision of the Board if it finds that there was a sale of the stock. If the evidence as to cost now before the Board is not considered by the Board to be sufficient, the petitioner should be permitted to supplement its evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
