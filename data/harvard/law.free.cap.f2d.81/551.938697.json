As allowed, the patent contains seven claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-23\">On February 10, 1926, one John T. Simmons filed an application, which, on October 17, 1933, matured into patent No. 1,930,-987, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Testing the Productivity of Formations encountered in Wells.\u201d This patent contains 19 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-24\">On February 2, 1934, appellant filed application, serial No. 709,518, for the reissue of his patent <em>No. </em>1,896,522 and, for interference purposes, copied a number of the claims allowed in the patent to Simmons, among them being a claim which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-25\">\u201cAn apparatus for testing the productivity of a formation in a well containing drilling fluid, 'comprising a string of pipe to be lowered into the well through the drilling fluid to adjacent the formation to receive a fluid sample therefrom and to be raised out of the well to remove the entrapped sample, said pipe being closed against the flow of the drilling fluid as the pipe is lowered into the well, a packer carried by the pipe as the pipe is lowered into the well and adapted to be seated by manipulation of the pipe to seal off the well above the formation, said packer adapted to be positively pressed against the walls of the formation to seal off the same, an inlet to the pipe communicating with the well below .the point at which the packer seals off the well, and means for controlling the inlet to permit fluid from the formation to enter the pipe while the packer is set and to prevent fluid from entering the pipe after the packer is released and the pipe is being raised out of the well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-26\">The foregoing, which is claim 19 of the Simmons patent, became claim No. 8 of appellant\u2019s reissue application. It was lick! by the Examiner that appellant\u2019s application failed to disclose the subject-matter of the claim, and the Board of Appeals sustained the rejection upon that ground. Thereupon appeal was taken <em>to </em>this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-27\">Under the decision of the Board, the only references to be considered by us in relation to this, the only appealed claim, are the respective patents to appellant and Simmons above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-28\">The brief of appellant says:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-29\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s specification in the application for re-issue is an exact photographic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>copy of the specification of his original patent number 1,896,522 without the slight-' est change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABy\">The issue to be determined here is \u2019 therefore limited to the question of whether the claim above quoted reads upon the disclosure made by appellant in his original application. In other words, is appellant entitled to make the claim?</p>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">It appears that, in the process of drilling wells, such as oil wells, the hole or bore is usually kept filled with a mud-laden fluid, frequently referred to as \u201cthe drilling fluid.\u201d This fluid serves the double purpose of carrying away the detritus formed by the cutting bit and maintaining hydraulic pressure upon the sides of the hole which prevents caving. Where the wells are deep, the boring carries the hole through various strata formations and water , . streams, and it is desirable frequently to take samples from the well bottom in order to ascertain whether a satisfactory oil-bearing stratum has been reached. Such sampies, as of course, must be as free as possible of the drilling fluid and the water encountered in drilling, and, broadly, the end sought by both appellant and Simmons is that of securing uncontaminated samples.</p>\n<p id=\"AV8\">It is believed that the claim itself is so clear in defining the elements of structure that no extraneous explanation of it need be attempted by us. It requires a string of pipe, sometimes called the tester pipe, to be lowered into the well through the drilling fluid. When this pipe reaches the bottom of the well, it receives the sample, by means not here at issue, and is then withdrawn. The claim recites, \u201cSaid pipe being closed against the flow of the drilling fluid as the pipe is lowered into the well,\u201d and elsewhere it makes the requirement of an inlet to the pipe at a point described, and, in the last clause requires ^ means for controlling the inlet * _ * to prevent fluid from entering the pipe^ after the^ packer is released and the pipe is being raised out of the well.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahq5\">. It is pointed out in the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office that there is such an interrelationship between the clauses above quoted as that they really amount to only a single limitation. This seems substantially correct since, if the pipe is to be . ? . i , \u2022__. \u201e\u201e\u201e operated m closed condition, means to control the inlet near the bottom are essential.</p>\n<p id=\"AWdv\">The Examiner denied the claim to appellant because of the above limitation or limitations, holding that \u201capplicant\u2019s apparatus does not show any means for closmg the pipe against the flow of the drill-mg fluid,\u201d and saying also, \u201cAs based on the original specification, applicant never intended to have any pipe of such character.</p>\n<p id=\"Asm\">In affirming the Examiner, the Board not only approved the foregoing but, going further, declared that to operate appellant\u2019s pipe in closed condition \u201cwould be a method of operation entirely contrary to that described in the original disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAN\">There wag nQ ^ a nt on behalf f llant before blft in rsonam he filed a brief which lms received our careful \u00a1n connection with the Simmons pat_ , , \u201e ., , ent and appellant s own disclosures,</p>\n<p id=\"AU0\">It seems unnecessary here to enter upon a detailed explanation of the Simmons device. Such may be found in' the statement of the Examiner made following the appeal to the Board of Appeals, and its correctness is not challenged. It is sufficient to say that Simmons shows certain valves positioned so that they perform the functions of closing the pipe against the flow of the drilling fluid and controlling the inlet as required.</p>\n<p id=\"ACM\">most careful of appell<em>an</em>t specification and drawings fails to reveal an? Physical means\u2019. such as the valves of Simmons, for effecting closure of the pipe as it is being lowered through the drilling fluid, nor anything equivalent to Simmons\u2019 means for controlling the inlet and closing the pipe as it is being raised,</p>\n<p id=\"AFg\">\u25a0 Appellant\u2019s teaching, upon the point fiere \u00bfn issue, seems to us to be limited to \u00a3be use 0j compressed air turned into the wejj at ^ bead jn a manner described jn bjs specification. By means of this, the drilling f[uid may be kept out of the tester pipe, but this does not close the tester pipe either as it is being lowered or as it is bejng raised, and this method, we think, cannot properly be construed as meeting the requirement of a\u00f1 apparatus claim for structure which actually closes the pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"Aio\">. , .., \u201e , , A , .
