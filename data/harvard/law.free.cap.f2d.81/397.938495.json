This mark consisted of the name \u201cAmerican Steel &amp; Wire Company,\u201d arranged as follows, as described by the Examiner : \u201cThe name is written in rather conventional lettering in double arcuate form, the word \u2018American\u2019 above and the words \u2018Steel &amp; Wire Company\u2019 below an elliptical paraph of the initial \u2018A\u2019 of the word \u2018American.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-28\">The Examiner denied registration on the ground that the name \u201cAmerican Steel &amp; Wire Company\u201d \u201cis the name of a corporation not distinctly displayed.\u201d Thereupon the appellant filed its disclaimer as to the words \u201cSteel &amp; Wire Company\u201d apart from the mark as shown. The Examiner then held that the word- \u201cAmerican\u201d was the dominating feature of appellant\u2019s mark; that the word was geographical; and that the mark could not, therefore, be registered under section 5 of the TradeMark Act of February 20, 1905, as amended (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-29\">The appellant then filed a further attempted disclaimer as to the lettering \u201cmerican,\u201d apart from the mark as shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-30\">The Examiner again and finally denied the registration on the ground that the mark was the name of a corporation not distinctively displayed, and again held that the word \u201cAmerican\u201d was geographical and not registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>On appeal to the Commissioner, the decision of the Examiner was affirmed. As to the offer to disclaim all but the letter \u201cA\u201d in the word \u201cAmerican,\u201d the Commissioner held that he found \u201cno authority-holding that parts of words may be disclaimed, and can see no justification for extending the disclaimer doctrine to any such length. Certainly this should not be done in a case such as this, where the result would be a clear evasion of the statutory prohibition against registration of mere names by the simple expedient of disclaiming all but the first letter of a notation otherwise objectionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">We are of opinion the refusal of registration was proper. The rule as to registration of the name of an individual, firm, or corporation, where such name is claimed to be written, printed, impressed, or woven in some particular or distinctive manner, is well stated in Re Nisley Shoe Co., 58 F.(2d) 426, 427, 19 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1211-1213:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that the proper construction of the words \u2018particular or distinctive manner\u2019 in the proviso of section 5 referred to is that the word or words constituting the mark shall be written, printed, impressed, or woven in such a manner as to form a distinct impression upon the eye of the observer, to the extent that he will remember such particular or distinctive form and rely upon it, in part at least, in ascribing origin of the goods to which the mark is applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">This is the rule of the Patent Office. Ex parte A. Englehard &amp; Sons Co., 1904 C.D. 122, 109 O.G. 1886; Ex parte Marsh, etc., 1929 C.D. 20, 382 O.G. 845; Flanders &amp; Flanders Mfg. Co. v. Studebaker Corp., 1913 C.D. 246, 197 O.G. 241; Ex parte Alden Co., 1907 C.D. 423, 131 O.G. 2419; Dunlap &amp; Co. v. Jackson &amp; Gutman Co., 1924 C.D. 38, 326 O.G. 469; Ex parte C. S. Marshall Co., 1924 C.D. 88, 328 O.G. 528; Ex parte Dudley Lock Corp., 156 MS.D. 249; Ex parte E. Kahn\u2019s Sons Co., 156 MS.D. 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The rule has been approved by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (now the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia), our predecessor in this jurisdiction. In re Artesian Mfg. Co., 37 App.D.C. 113; In re Landis Machine Co., 54 App.D.C. 404, 298 F. 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">It is quite apparent here that there is nothing in the arrangement or appearance of the mark as originally presented which would make such an impression upon the eye of the ordinary observer as would outweigh the significance of the name \u201cAmerican Steel &amp; Wire Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">After the first disclaimer was filed, the word \u201cAmerican\u201d remained. This word was, plainly, geographical, as held by the Patent Office. In its behalf, the appellant cites the case of Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Brothers &amp; Co., 240 U. S. 251, 36 S.Ct. 269, 60 L.Ed. 629, wherein the name, \u201cThe American Girl,\u201d was held to be a valid trade-mark, and not geographical. This, it is argued, is authority which supports the right of appellant to obtain registration of the trade-mark \u201cAmerican\u201d for use with its sale of florist wire. The cases are not at all the same, and it is thought the differences will be obvious, without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">Finally, as to the second attempted disclaimer, we agree with the Commissioner of Patents that we know of no authority; statutory or otherwise, which authorizes or approves the practice of disclaiming a part of a word or certain letters thereof. Although the practice of filing a disclaimer to part of a mark, while continuing to use the whole of the same, has been approved by the courts, it should not be further extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">Appellant seeks to justify the registration of its mark by referring to the action of the Patent Office in Ex parte Atlantic Refining Co., 159 MS.D. 87, wherein the mark \u201cSafety-Kleen\u201d was permitted to be registered as a trade-mark for liquid dry cleaner. What the office may have done in other cases cannot be held to be conclusive upon the court in the case now before us, and does not affect the principles of law involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
