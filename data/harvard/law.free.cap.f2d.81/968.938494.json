By way of replication to appellees pleas, the appellant set up: That appellee\u2019s governing body, by resolution adopted on March 9, 1929, provided for the issue, under a described act of the Legislature of Florida, of bonds of the appellee h1 the amount of $198,000, and that said bonds or the proceeds from the sale thereof shall be used exclusively for the purpose 0f refund\u00a1ng 0f certain notes and obligations of appellee, aggregating the sum of $198,000, which are set out in a list or schedule attached to that resolution, and are ratified and declared to be valid obligations, the above-mentioned notes made by appellee to the Osceola Golf Club being included m that list or schedule; and that <em>a</em>n thfi L islature of Florid ap_ d A a 2\u00d3 1929 (Sp.Acts Fla.1929, c. 14407) authorizi the issue b appellee 0f bonds in an amount not exceeding $210)000 for e of liquidating the outsta<em>n</em>d floating btedness of appellee, and validating said indebtedness, after referring to ^ description of such indebtedness con-tarmed \u201c above-mentioned resolution of appellee\u2019s governing body expressly validated said indebtedness m all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">The appellee contended that it was without power under its charter to buy land for a ball park and athletic field, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>support of its first above mentioned defense invoked the following provision of the charter: \u201cOfficers and employees of the city may hold more than one office in the City Government but shall not be interested in the profits or emoluments of any contract, work or service for the municipality, and any such contract in which any member is, or may become interested, shall be declared void by the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">In the trial there was evidence to the following effect: When the above-mentioned resolution of appellee\u2019s governing body of March 9, 1929, was adopted, whereby the notes sued on were ratified, Stanley Kitching was not a member of appellee\u2019s governing body. When the Osceola Golf Club made the above-mentioned sale, possession of the land which was the subject of that sale was delivered to appellee, which retained possession of that land. The description of the land contained in Osceola Golf Club\u2019s deed to appellee was furnished by appellee\u2019s engineer. Upon the conclusion of the evidence, appellee moved for a directed verdict in its favor, on grounds including the following: That there was an attempt to validate or ratify a contract prohibited by law; that there was an attempt to carry out an act not authorized for a municipal purpose; that there was no proof contradicting or disproving appellee\u2019s defense based on the indefiniteness of the conveyance of the Osceola Golf Club to appellee. In granting that motion, the court, after mentioning the fact that, when appellee paid to the Osceola Golf Club part of the purchase price of the land, Mr. Kitching was a commissioner of appellee and was also a stockholder and interested in the Osceola Golf Club, stated: \u201cWe must apply the law of Florida, which is the law governing this case in reference to the validity and indemnity of the contracts of a City, and prevent City Officials from dealing -with the City in matters in which they are interested, and I shall direct a verdict for the defendant in this case under the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">It appears that the action of the court in directing a verdict in favor of the appellee was the result of the conclusion that the notes sued on were void and unenforceable, because, when appellee entered into the transaction of which the giving of those notes was a part, one member of the governing body of the appellee was a member of the club which was the payee in those notes, and as such member had a financial interest in that transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">The failure of the court, in stating the ground of its ruling, to mention what was done to the end of validating the notes sued on, indicates that the court regarded as ineffectual the attempts of appellee\u2019s governing body and of the Legislature of Florida to validate those notes. The part of the above set out provision of appellee\u2019s charter to the effect that any contract of the appellee in which any member of its governing body is, or may become, interested shall be declared void by the commission does not indicate a purpose to deprive the appellee of the power, at a time when no member of its governing body is interested in a contract theretofore attempted to be made by the appellee when one member of its governing body was interested in that contract, to ratify that contract, which, when it was entered into, was void or voidable by reason of a member of appellee\u2019s governing body being interested in it. So far as we are advised, when appellee\u2019s governing body adopted the above resolution of March 9, 1929, ratifying the notes sued on, after Stanley Kitching had ceased to be a member of appellee\u2019s governing body, no legal obstacle stood in the way of that action. In the absence of a statute forbidding such municipal action, it was within the power of appellee\u2019s governing body to ratify the notes sued on in the manner adopted. Cady v. City of Watertown, 18 Wis. 322; City of Fort Wayne v. Railway Co., 132 Ind. 558, 32 N.E. 215, 18 L.R.A. 367, 32 Am.St.Rep. 277, 282 ; 3 McQuillan on Municipal Corporations, \u00a7 1257. So far as we are advised, nothing stood in the way of the Legislature of Florida validating the notes sued on. Any lack of power of appellee to bind itself by those notes when they were executed was cured by the above-mentioned act of the Florida Legislature. Anderson v. Santa Anna Tp., 116 U.S. 356, 364, 6 S.Ct. 413, 29 L.Ed. 633; White Water Valley Canal Co. v. Vallette, 21 How. 414, 16 L.Ed. 154. The court erred in ruling that the notes sued on are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">In the circumstances disclosed, the alleged insufficiency of the description in the Osceola Golf Club\u2019s deed to appellee of the subject of the conveyance did not constitute a defense to appellant\u2019s action. It appears that appellee got the land it intended to buy. A misdescription of the land in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>the seller\u2019s deed entitled appellee to have that instrument so reformed as correctly to describe that land. 23 R.C.L. 335. But the insufficiency of the deed\u2019s description of that land did not entitle appellee to keep that land and be exempt from the obligation to pay the agreed price of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
