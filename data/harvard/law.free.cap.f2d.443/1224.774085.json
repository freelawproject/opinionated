The cylinders were being transported from a pier in Staten Island, New York, where they had arrived by ship in May 1969, to another pier in Brooklyn. The truck from which the cylinders were stolen was recovered the day after the hijacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">Viewing the evidence most favorably to the Government, as we must at this juncture, United States v. Kahaner, 317 F.2d 459, 467 (2d Cir. 1963), cert. denied sub. nom. Corallo v. United States, 375 U.S. 835, 84 S.Ct. 62, 11 L.Ed.2d 65 (1963), the proof at trial adequately supported defendants\u2019 convictions. Neither defendant was identified as a participant in the thefts either of the mercury cylinders or of the truck. Shortly after the cylinders (each of which weighed above 100 pounds) had been reported stolen, FBI agent George Mores-co observed an International truck cab with a dump-truck type body (open on top) riding low on its axles and thus obviously carrying a heavy load, parked in front of a scrap metal yard on Staten Island. The truck was placed under surveillance and several agents followed it closely as the truck proceeded north from Staten Island via the Connecticut Turnpike to Watertown, Connecticut. During the course of this journey, FBI agent James Hays was able many times to observe D\u2019Avanzo driving the truck and Falcone sitting in the passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-12\">After the truck entered Watertown at about 2:30 a. m. on June 6, D\u2019Avanzo appeared to be getting ready to turn into a street leading to the Infeld Metal Company but then for some reason changed his mind and proceeded ahead for two more blocks before turning into a U-shaped residential street, Bessamy Avenue,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which led nowhere but back to the road upon which the truck had been traveling, Falls Avenue. D\u2019Avanzo parked a short distance down Bessamy Avenue. While several FBI agents remained in another car on Falls Avenue (contiguous to Bessamy), Agent Hays stopped his car short of Bessamy Avenue and walked toward the other FBI vehicle, whose headlights were on. The agents saw appellants leave the truck and walk in their direction for a short distance. But then, as they approached Hays, both turned in the opposite direction and proceeded at a trot into a swampy wooded area behind Bessamy Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-13\">Their retreat prompted Agent Hays to inspect the inside of the truck with his flashlight. The panels were sufficiently high that it was necessary for him to stand on a ledge running around the body of the truck in order to view, through the open top, the exposed interi- or of the dump truck. Without disturbing a tarpaulin that covered only part of the truck\u2019s cargo, Hays was able to observe several exposed cylinders, later identified as part of the stolen shipment of mercury cylinders. Further investigation revealed that the serial number on the motor of the truck corresponded with that of a 1969 flat-bed International truck stolen from the Port Equipment Renting Co. in March 1969. Under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>layer of fresh paint on the left door of the cab the name \u201cPort Equipment Renting Co.\u201d was still visible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">Prior to the trial, Judge Zavatt conducted a hearing on D\u2019Avanzo\u2019s motion to suppress the fruits of the search and seizure of the truck and its contents on the ground that Agent Hays acted without a warrant. After a hearing, Judge Zavatt ruled that the defendants had \u201cabandoned\u201d the truck and its contents prior to Hays\u2019s inspection and thus there had been no \u201csearch and seizure\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to which appellants could object. Whether there has been an abandonment presents a question of intent. Like other factual findings by a district court we may disturb Judge Zavatt\u2019s finding that defendants relinquished any interest they may otherwise have. had in protecting the privacy of the exposed portion of the dump truck only if the finding is clearly erroneous. United States v. Cowan, 396 F.2d 83, 87-88 (1969). Under the circumstances present here we believe Judge Zavatt\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. Hays\u2019s inspection invaded no aspect of the defendants\u2019 legitimate interests in privacy. In arriving at this conclusion, we have considered, in addition to defendants\u2019 flight into the woods and the attendant circumstances, the minimal intrusion into the truck that resulted from Hays\u2019s inspection. We are mindful also that traditionally, as the Supreme Court has recently had occasion to reaffirm, \u201cthere is a constitutional difference between houses and cars.\u201d Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 52, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 1982, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970). After Hays had observed a number of the cylinders in plain view, moreover, probable cause existed for the more thorough search of the truck which was conducted on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">We have examined appellants\u2019 other points and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">The convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1287-14\">. From among many different versions in the record of the name of this street, we have adopted that form used by the parties in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
