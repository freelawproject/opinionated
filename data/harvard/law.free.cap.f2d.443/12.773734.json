At trial, Tharpe, who admitted the transaction, based his defense on entrapment. He contended he succumbed to the importunities of a government agent named Stokes and a government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>informer named Weatherman after he had initially set his will against breaking the law. The trial judge, however, excluded Tharpe\u2019s testimony about the informer\u2019s alleged statements as hearsay on the ground that there was no showing Weatherman was working for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Exclusion of Tharpe\u2019s testimony describing Weatherman\u2019s statements was error. On cross-examination, Stokes, who admitted knowing Weatherman, testified he told Tharpe that he was Weatherman\u2019s friend and that Weatherman had sent him. He also admitted he did this on instructions from his superi- or officer. These facts are sufficient to establish that Weatherman was an instrument in the government\u2019s investigation of Tharpe, and statements Weatherman made which might have worn down Tharpe\u2019s will were relevant to the entrapment issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Nevertheless, the erroneous exclusion of Weatherman\u2019s alleged statements was not reversible error, for even with the excluded testimony, Tharpe failed as a matter of law to establish that he was entrapped. In Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 372, 78 S. Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958), the Supreme Court said that the entrapment occurs when official activity creates criminal conduct. And this court has specifically held that mere solicitation is insufficient to create the kind of inducement the entrapment defense was intended to correct. United States v. DeVore, 423 F.2d 1069, 1072 (4th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 950, 91 S. Ct. 1604, 29 L.Ed.2d 119 (1971). In this case, by his own testimony Tharpe acknowledges a hiatus of over a month between his last contact with Weatherman in April when he had made a sale to Stokes at Weatherman\u2019s urging and the commission of the offense in May. He also admits that Stokes did not contact him for the same length of time. Moreover, he stated that he was in serious financial difficulty and that he agreed to deal in nontaxpaid distilled liquor because he needed the money. In these circumstances, Stokes\u2019 request for a delivery of illegal whiskey in May was no more than a solicitation which gave Tharpe the opportunity to commit a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Tharpe also contends that his character witness was improperly cross-examined, but after an examination of the record, we find no reversible error. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
