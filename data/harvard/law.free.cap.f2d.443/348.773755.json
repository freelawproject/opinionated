This motion was denied, and at the close of the trial the jury returned its verdict of guilty as to Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">On this appeal, appellant urges that the district court erred in denying his motion to strike Count II of the indictment; that the evidence was insufficient to establish appellant\u2019s receipt or possession of the firearm in question; and that the district court erred in sentencing procedures adopted by it. Appellant concedes that the firearm in question was of a type which required registration in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">At oral argument appellant conceded that the decision of the Supreme Court in United States v. Freed et al., 401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (decided April 5, 1971), undermined completely his contention that Section 5861(d) was violative of his Fifth Amendment rights not to incriminate himself. On the authority of <em>Freed, </em>and for the reasons stated therein, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that the district court erred in denying his motion to strike Count II of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">We have reviewed the record and find without merit appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">Finally, appellant contends that allegedly improper procedures were adopted in the sentencing of appellant which require remand of the cause to the district court for resentencing. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Initially it should be stated that the imposed sentence of five years is well within the statutory limits prescribed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871, which provides for a fine not more than $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than ten years, or both. This court has consistently held that the matter of sentencing is within the discretion of the trial court and not reviewable by an appellate court so long as the sentence falls within the bounds prescribed by statute. See Westover v. United States, 394 F.2d 164 (9th Cir. 1968); Young v. United States, 286 F.2d 13 (9th Cir. 1960), cert. den. 366 U.S. 970, 81 S.Ct. 1934, 6 L. Ed.2d 1259 (1961), and George v. United States, 266 F.2d 343 (9th Cir. 1958), cert. den. 364 U.S. 923, 81 S.Ct. 289, 5 L.Ed.2d 262 (1960), rehrg. den. 365 U.S. 825, 81 S.Ct. 702, 5 L.Ed.2d 704, cert. den. 368 U.S. 857, 82 S.Ct. 97, 7 L.Ed.2d 55 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
