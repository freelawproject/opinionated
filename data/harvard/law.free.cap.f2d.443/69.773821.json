Citizens Casualty Co. of New York, et al., 5th Cir. 1970, 431 F. 2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b131-25\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b131-26\">The appellant filed a petition in the district court seeking to enjoin his prosecution by the State of Texas for the offense of robbery by firearms, and seeking his release from state custody. He contended that he would be subjected to double jeopardy if he were tried on the robbery charge, since he had previously been acquitted of the offense of assault with intent to murder a police officer, and both indictments arose from the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-27\">The district court denied relief, holding that the court was without jurisdiction to enjoin the state criminal prosecution on authority of the federal anti-injunction statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283. The court also held that the appellant\u2019s application for federal habeas relief was premature because he had failed to exhaust his available state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-28\"> The appellant has now filed a brief in this Court in which he states that he was convicted on February 5, 1971 of the robbery charge. Therefore his appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief is now moot. The appellant\u2019s allegations concerning the illegality of his conviction will not be adjudicated upon this appeal, since they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>have not been presented to his state courts either upon direct appeal or by collateral attack. Ector v. Smith, 5th Cir. 1971, 438 F.2d 975; Harrison v. Wainwright, 5th Cir. 1970, 424 F.2d 633; Taylor v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1968, 392 F.2d 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The order of the district court denying habeas and injunctive relief is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
