Kennedy Airport, Carolina, Puerto Rico, on a flight from Chile at about 10:30 p.m. After completing the routine customs inspection, where his baggage and overcoat were examined, appellant walked towards the exit where he was stopped by a customs inspector, one Brugueras, and requested to step into a nearby office for a \u201csecondary search.\u201d During the course of this search, which included visual inspection of portions of appellant\u2019s body after he lowered his trousers, appellant\u2019s overcoat slipped from the chair behind him. Inspector Kopish, who was present while Brugueras conducted the search, grabbed the coat and felt a package inside the lining. The package turned out to contain cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-17\">At his jury-waived trial for knowingly importing cocaine in violation of 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 174, the contraband was introduced, the district court having ruled, after a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, that the evidence was not obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure. This determination was reaffirmed by Aldrich, C. J., sitting as district judge on appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Appellant was convicted solely on the basis of this evidence and was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. The single issue raised by this appeal is whether the court erred in ruling the contraband admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-18\">Appellant contends that a \u201cstrip search\u201d may not be initiated, even by a customs official at a frontier, without a \u201creal suspicion\u201d, i.e., one \u201csupported by objective, articulable facts.\u201d United States v. Guadalupe-Garza, 421 F.2d 876, 879 (9th Cir. 1970); United States v. Johnson, 425 F.2d 630 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. granted, 400 U.S. 990, 91 S.Ct. 451, 27 L.Ed.2d 437 (1971). Assuming, without deciding, the validity of this standard and that the search in this case was a \u201cstrip search,\u201d we agree with appellant that the standard was not met. Brugueras testified that he had no specific recollection why he chose to subject appellant to a spot check, other than his judgment ba,sed on his experience as a customs inspector. We nevertheless affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-19\">In this ease, the contraband came to the inspector\u2019s attention when appellant\u2019s coat slipped to the floor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Had this event happened, without the attendant more intimate search, there would be no basis whatsoever for suppression. It is well settled that a customs officer may search an individual\u2019s baggage and outer clothing, in a reasonable manner, based on subjective suspicion alone, or even on a random basis. Landau v. United States Attorney, 82 F.2d 285 (2d Cir. 1936); Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 154, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925) (dictum). The arriving international traveler is on notice that such a search may be undertaken, and the search itself involves only the most minor affront to the individual\u2019s dignity. Note, Border Searches and the Fourth Amendment, 77 Yale L.J. 1007, 1015 (1968). The only problem then is the effect of the contemporaneous arguably illegal search of appellant\u2019s person. Unless we find that this search fouled the legitimate search activities carried out independently by a second customs official, appellant\u2019s appeal must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">If the discovery of the cocaine was made \u201cby exploitation\u201d of the \u201cprimary illegality\u201d, the body search, the tainted contraband would be inadmissible. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471, 488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). The testimony at the voir dire hearing, however, supports a contrary conclusion. Whatever might have impelled Inspector Kopish to search appellant\u2019s overcoat, there was no causal nexus between the body search and the simultaneous search of the overcoat. In a broad sense, of course, the contraband would not have been found \u201cbut for\u201d the ^secondary search, but the Supreme Court has expressly ruled out such a test as a litmus in this area. <em>Wong Sun, supra </em>at 488, 83 S.Ct. 407. The unfortunate fortuity \u2014 as far as appellant is concerned \u2014 of the falling of the overcoat acts further to insulate the contraband from any taint of illegality. There is no indication that anything appellant said or did as a result of the body search, or anything that Brugueras found on his body, led Kopish to examine the coat. We conclude that the evidence was obtained \u201cby means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d <em>Wong Sun, </em>supra at 488, 83 S. Ct. at 417. The court properly ruled that the contraband was admissible and appellant\u2019s conviction must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-15\">. Appellant claims that one of the inspectors took the coat from the chair after appellant had begun to replace his belongings in his pockets. The fact that the chair was behind appellant renders this version suspect, as the district court apparently felt. Even under appellant\u2019s version, however, we would apply the analysis in the text, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
