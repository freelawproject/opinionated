(MMA), appeals from a Memorandum Opinion and Order of the Federal Communications Commission released May 6, 1969, denying petitioner\u2019s request for waiver of the nonduplication provisions of section 74.1103(e) of the Rules of the Commission, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 74.1103(e), adopted March 8, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">Petitioner, MMA, is the owner and operator of a twelve-channel community antenna television system with 6200 subscribers, serving the City of Meadville, Pennsylvania, with a population of about 17.000, suburban and semi-rural adjacent areas with a population of about 6.000, and the boroughs of Conneaut Lake and Saegertown, Pennsylvania, with a population of about 3,000. Near the beginning of the present conflict in 1966, MMA was carrying the signals of two NBC affiliates, WICUTV, Channel 12 in Erie, Pennsylvania, and WFMJ-TV, Channel 21 in Youngstown, Ohio. WFMJ-TV lies about 45 miles southeast of Meadville and WICUTV lies approximately 30 miles north of Meadville.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-20\">Community antenna television systems receive distant signals by means of an antenna, amplify and relay them by cable to the sets of individual subscribing members who pay a fee for the service. First Report and Order, 38 F.C.C. 683, 684 (1963). CATV systems were intended to supplement free systems and have been utilized traditionally in com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>munities where rough terrain made off-the-air reception difficult or where sparse population made operation of a local station commercially unfeasible and so necessitated the importation of distant signals. Eventually, however, CATV systems began servicing communities already served through off-the-air reception of television signals. In response to concern expressed about the financial position of local stations faced with CATV competition, the Commission asserted jurisdiction over all CATV systems,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conducted inquiries, and adopted rules covering their operations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The carriage provisions of the Rules of the Federal Communications Commission provide that a CATV system must carry upon request the signals of certain local stations. The non-duplication provisions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the rules contained in section 74.1103 provide that a CATV system, upon the demand of a qualifying station, must refrain from transmitting from stations with a lower priority or more distant signals programs which are also carried, at the same time or at another time on the same day, by the qualifying station.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-18\">The relative priority of stations is determined by the signal strength contours placed over the CATV system\u2019s service community.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commission has pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>vided in section 74.1109 for the waiver of the non-duplication provisions when the need of petitioner and the public interest so requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On June 1, 1966, WICU-TV requested petitioner MMA to provide program exclusivity for WICU-TV as against WFMJ-TV. WICU-TV has a predicted principal city (city grade) contour while WFMJ-TV has a predicted Grade B contour. MMA refused and, on July 1, 1966, filed a petition for waiver of the non-duplication rules on the grounds that (1) the signal strength of WICUTV\u2019s signal was inferior or no better than the signal strength of WFMJ-TV in most of Meadville; (2) the signal quality of WICU-TV was substantially inferior to that of WFMJ-TV both in color and in black and white; (3) there was a community of interest between Meadville and Youngstown; and (4) the Commission\u2019s long-standing policy of encouraging the development of UHF television favored waiver in this instance since WFMJ-TV is a UHF station and WICU-TV is a VHF station. On September 1, 1966, Lamb Communications, Inc., the licensee of WICU-TV and intervenor in this action, filed an Opposition to the Petition for Waiver and included an engineering report (hereinafter termed the Smith report), purporting to measure the strength and quality of the signals of the two stations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Field strength measurements were made at ten sites in the Meadville area. Interviews were conducted and observations of signal quality made at the stores of eight television dealers in the area. On October 24, 1966, the petitioner, MMA, filed a Reply to the Opposition of Lamb and included comments of TV dealers in the Meadville area and an Engineering Statement by Archie S. Taylor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">On May 6, 1969, the Commission rejected MMA\u2019s petition for waiver of the non-duplication provisions of the Commission\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">Subsequently, MMA filed on June 5, 1969, a Petition for Reconsideration with an accompanying Motion to Stay.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> MMA later submitted a supplement to the petition, including a subscriber survey and a resolution of the Meadville City Council asking for reconsideration, on June 24, 1969.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">On September 2, 1970, the Federal Communications Commission released a Memorandum Opinion and Order rejecting MMA\u2019s Petition for Reconsideration and Motion to Stay.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Section 74.1109(c) (1) of the rules directs that a petition for waiver of the non-duplication rule shall set forth the \u201cpertinent facts and considerations relied upon to demonstrate the need for the relief requested and to support a determination that a grant of such relief would serve the public interest.\u201d <em>See also </em>Shen Heights TV Association, 11 F. C.C.2d 814 (1968). Petitioner, in this case, contends that waiver of the non-duplication rule is justified because the signal strength of WICU-TV is such that its predicted contour does not in fact encompass large sections of the community and is in fact equal to or inferior to that of WFMJ-TV and because the quality of both black and white and color signals of WICU-TV is substantially inferior to that of WFMJ-TV. WICU-TV, the party seeking non-duplication protection, had the burden of establishing the applicability of section 74.1103 of the rules. This burden was fulfilled, as here, by establishing the predicted contours of the stations and the manner in which the CATV system has failed to provide non-duplication protection. See Shen Heights TV Association, 11 F.C.C.2d 814, 816 (1968); Bluefield Television Cable, 10 F.C.C.2d 731, 732-33 (1967). Then, the burden shifted to the CATV operators to demonstrate either that the rule is inapplicable because the contour does not, in fact, encompass the community or that waiver of the rule is warranted because of facts and circumstances which override the public interest determinations underlying the rule. Shen Heights TV Association, 11 F.C.C.2d 814, 816 (1968). Here MMA raises the issue of signal intensity not in an effort to show that section 74.-1103 is inapplicable,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but as one of the facts and circumstances which, it is claimed, justifies waiver of section 74.-1103. In its Second Report and Order, the Commission recognized signal intensity as a basis for waiver, stating \u201ccarriage will not be required where a sufficient showing is made that a predicted signal is not in fact present in the community, or that a good signal is not obtainable because of technical deficiencies on the part of the station.\u201d Second Report and Order, 2 F.C.C.2d 725, 753 n. 40 (1966); see Bluefield Television Cable, 10 F.C.C.2d 731, 732 (1967). However, in a recent decision, the Commission added to the unfair competition and economic impact policies <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> underlying the non-duplication rule a third consideration, the allocations policy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Apparently relying on the new allocations policy, the Commission narrowed the \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d which can justify a waiver and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">* * * CATV, as an interstate communication by wire which makes integral use of TV broadcast signals and particularly affects the service areas of stations, must observe the carriage and nonduplication requirements of our rules even though a viewable off-the-air picture is not available in any part of the CATV community, and may obtain a waiver of these requirements only upon a substantial showing of unusual or exceptional circumstances justifying such action. Shen Heights TV Association, 11 F.C.C.2d 814, 818 (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">This limitation apparently refers only to attempts to justify waiver on the grounds of signal intensity. <em>See </em>Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>munity Service, Inc. v. United States, 418 F.2d 709, 719-720 (6th Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AFu\">MMA requests a waiver not only on the grounds of signal intensity but on the grounds of signal intensity combined with signal quality in black and white and in color. These considerations can, in our judgment, constitute \u201cunusual or exceptional circumstances\u201d justifying waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">As to signal strength, MMA alleged that the predicted contour of WICU-TV was not in fact present in large sections of the community.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In its relatively lengthy engineering study (hereinafter termed the Taylor report), MMA contended that \u201cthe median field intensity for the entire inhabited part of the City of Meadville is less than 56 dBu; less than Grade B.\u201d <em>See </em>App. 74.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, petitioner claims that the actual contour of WICU-TV for the inhabited part of Meadville is less than the actual contour of WFMJ-TV. However, the Commission, in its order of May 1, 1969, merely stated that \u201cIt is clear that WICU-TV is entitled to priority on the Meadville system on the basis of predicted signals, and the possibility of actual discrepancies does not, of itself, provide a basis for waiver of the program exclusivity requirement.\u201d The Commission\u2019s brief and conclusory reference to the \u201cpossibility of actual discrepancies\u201d in response to MMA\u2019s allegations, supported by detailed evidence, that there were <em>actual </em>discrepancies, is not complete enough to permit us to exercise our judicial function of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">The Commission\u2019s response to petitioner\u2019s evidence that the signal quality of WICU-TV was substantially inferior to that of WFMJ-TV, both in black and white and in color, is likewise unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">In its section on signal quality, the Taylor report notes the opinion of \u201ccasual observors\u201d and of the authors that there is a noticeable difference in picture quality between WFMJ-TV and WICU-TV. Then the report describes a series of tests made concerning relative picture quality.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Taylor report contended that as to black and white signal quality, the \u201cWICU-TV signal as received in the area and at petitioner\u2019s antenna site is such that reception of WICU-TV was subject to chronic ghosting and that in addition to chronic ghosting, the WICU-TV signal was such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>that there was a lack of definition and clarity in the picture to the point that the signal was noticeably inferior to that of WFMJ-TV.\u201d See Petition for Reconsideration. Taylor report. The report also purported to establish that WICU-TV\u2019s color signal was likewise inferior.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The report also attempted to establish that the inferiority was not due to degradation of the WICU-TV signal by CATV, by testing the signals at the cable head end.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Although intervenor submitted an RCA Proof of Performance statement indicating that the WICU-TV equipment was operating properly at its transmission site, this report did not purport to test signal quality at the crucial point, the head end of the cable system where the signal is received by the antennae of MMA and begins its journey through MMA\u2019s cable to the receivers of subscribers.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">In the face of this evidence, the Commission, in its first Memorandum Opinion and Order, said nothing about black and white signal quality. Its comment as to the \u201cpossibility of actual discrepancies\u201d in signal strength was not responsive to petitioner\u2019s allegations with regard to signal quality. In its September 2, 1970, Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Commission though referring obliquely to signal quality, again did not mention or attempt to respond to the Taylor report\u2019s data and conclusions with regard to black and white signal quality. It concluded that \u201c[sjince acceptable off-the-air reception is apparently available to a portion of the viewing population, and there has been no substantial showing that an acceptable WICU-TV signal is not available at the cable headend, the viewer survey does not constitute a substantial showing of unusual circumstances that justify a waiver of the rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Such terse and unilluminating conclusions represent an unsatisfactory response to the contentions and supporting evidence submitted by petitioner. Similarly unsatisfactory is the Commission\u2019s response to petitioner\u2019s contentions with regard to color quality.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In the May 6 Opinion and Order, the Commission stated, \u201cAlthough inferior color signal has been recognized as a possible basis for waiver in par. 62, Second Report and Order, this consideration is inapplicable where, as here, \u2018the technical quality of the local signal [is] sufficiently good to permit satisfactory color reception on the cable.\u2019 There has been no allegation that reception of WICU-TV falls below this level.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In its Opinion and Order of September 2, 1970, the Commission stated \u201c* * * [concerning] the argument that WICU-TV\u2019s color signal is subjectively less attractive than WFMJTV\u2019s * * * we again hold that paragraph 62 of the Second Report and Order controls this situation, and that as long as color reception of WICU-TV is satisfactory waiver is not warranted. And petitioner has not persuaded us that WICU-TV\u2019s signal is unsatisfactory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">If this court is to properly exercise its judicial function of review, it is necessary that the Commission consider the evidence placed before it and set out its conclusions with supporting facts and reasons.

Greater Boston Television Corp. v. Federal Communications Comm., 143 U. S.App.D.C. -, 444 F.2d 841 (1970).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Nowhere does the Commission mention the Taylor engineering study or offer any analysis of its contents that could guide this court in its review of the Commission\u2019s treatment of this most important part of petitioner\u2019s evidence. The Commission gave no indication that it considered the evidence contained in the Taylor report submitted by petitioner as to signal strength or as to black and white or color signal quality. This it must do.\u2019 Community Service, Inc. v. United States, 418 F.2d 709, 716 (6th Cir. 1969). Moreover, the Commission must set forth a \u201cbrief statement of the grounds for denial.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555(e). That statement must contain conclusions which are responsive to the evidence placed before it as to signal strength and as to black and white and color signal quality, and must contain the reasons upon which the conclusions are based. Community Service, Inc. v. United States, 418 F.2d 709, 717 (6th Cir. 1969); West Michigan Telecasters, Inc. v. F. C. C., 130 U.S.App.D.C. 39, 396 F. 2d 688, 691 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We do not think the Commission has fulfilled this obligation in its two opinions. Its conclusory, one-sentence re-</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">sponses referring to the \u201cpossibility of actual discrepancies\u201d in signal strength or to the lack of a \u201csubstantial showing\u201d of an \u201cacceptable\u201d signal at the cable head end or to \u201csatisfactory color reception\u201d are not acceptable. There is \u201cno justifiable basis for the Commission\u2019s sweeping aside\u201d with a few unenlightening phrases the fully supported allegations of petitioner. <em>See </em>Presque Isle TV Co. v. United States, 387 F.2d 502, 507-508 (1st Cir. 1967). The Commission, guided by the technical expertise at its command, may have good reason to find the evidence submitted in the Taylor report unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\"> However, if there are fatally defective weaknesses in the evidence offered by petitioner, the Commission must disclose the nature of the defects. It must state with specificity its objections to the showing made by petitioner and not rely on conclusory and undefined terms such as \u201cacceptable\u201d and \u201csatisfactory.\u201d We have before us the Taylor engineering study which appears on its face to offer such support for petitioner\u2019s position as to permit us to say, particularly when we also consider petitioner\u2019s other evidence,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>has satisfied its burden of proof on the issue of waiver. <em>See </em>Shen Heights TV Association, 11 F.C.C.2d 814 (1968). We do not think anything submitted by petitioner or explained in the Commission\u2019s opinions overcomes the showing that intervenor has made. For the reasons stated, including the failure to state \u201cthe grounds for denial\u201d and the absence of support for its action in the record when read as a whole, the summary denial of these petitions constitutes unreasonable and illegal action by the Commission. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702 and 706; <em>cf. </em>Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U. S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will set aside the May 1969 Commission order and remand the case to the Commission so that it may set forth in detail its conclusions and the reasons for them on the issues of signal strength, as well as on black and white and color signal quality.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-5\">.

In its reply brief at p. 3, petitioner declares, \u201cWe must state again in these proceedings MMA did not raise the issue of the applicability of the rule but rather sought a waiver of the rule.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\">. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b348-10\">. In describing the allocations policy, the Commission, in its decision in <em>Slien Heights, </em>stated that because CATV \u201cmakes use of television broadcast signals as the <em>sine qua non </em>of its operation,\u201d it \u201cmust observe reasonable regulations designed to promote the public interest in this very area,\u201d such as the carriage and non-duplication rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\">. In its May 1, 1969, and August 26, 1970, memorandum opinions and orders, the Commission recognized that unsatisfactory color quality can justify a waiver. Thus, by implication, the Commission limited its comment in <em>Shen Heights </em>concerning \u201cviewable off-tlie-air\u201d pictures to considerations of signal strength.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">. Although MMA stated in its initial petition that \u201cThe signal strength of both stations might be classified as excellent,\u201d its subsequent engineering study, which was submitted to the Commission, contended the signal strength of WICU-TV was inferior to that predicted. <em>See </em>text <em>infra. </em>This contention was reiterated in petitioner\u2019s Reply to the Opposition of Lamb Enterprises, Inc. to the Petition of Meadville Master Antenna, Inc. for Waiver of the Nonduplieation Provisions of Section 74.1103 and in its Petition for Reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">. The Taylor report successfully answered, in our opinion, the relatively incomplete study of Smith Consulting Radio Engineers, submitted on behalf of WICUTV. Field strength measurements were taken at only ten sites, as compared with 100 sites in the Taylor study. Moreover, only four of the sites were in the city of Meadville and two of these were less than Grade B. <em>See </em>Comments on Carl E. Smith Measurements in Meadville in the Taylor report at App. 81-83.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b349-13\">. Various steps, enumerated in the report, were taken in an attempt to assure that the viewing receiver, its tuning controls or the CATV plant were not the cause of the discrepancies. Tests involved viewing the pictures of two commercial RCA portable color TV receivers of identical type and model, placed side by side. Other receivers were also used. Some were connected to the CATV plant and some to antennas having no connection with CATV. On some sets, Channel 12 was converted to Channel 3 and Channel 21 was converted to Channel 4. On other receivers, no conversion was made. To eliminate the possibility of the CATV equipment being the cause of the difference, various tests described in the report were conducted at the CATV head end.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b350-5\">. The Taylor report stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">1. There are distinctly observable differences between Channel 21 [WFMJ-TV] and Channel 12 [WICUTV] requiring readjustment of brightness and chroma controls to obtain usable pictures. On some programs, on some receivers, even the best possible adjustments on Channel 12 [WICUTV] were not pleasing, being too \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cyellow\u201d particularly the flesh tones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">2. These differences are in the broadcast signals, and are not caused by either the CATV equipment or the monitoring receiver used for the observation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">s\u00a1: \u00a1k \u00a1k *k *k</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">From these tests and observations, it is concluded that Channel 12 [WICU-TV]is broadcasting a signal which is nonlinear with respect to brightness levels; and that there is probably also significant differential gain and phase shift distortion associated with the non-linearity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">The report noted that photographs were taken without the necessary filters so that \u201cthe photographs do not even come close to representing the color balance observed visually during the tests. The photos are included, as Figures 5-7 of this report, since they do record the difference in brightness, and the loss of highlight detail.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b350-12\">. The Taylor report stated that \u201c * * * there is no question that the median cable subscriber in Meadville is receiving a far better picture from Channel 12 and from Channel 21 than is possible from a typical roof-top antenna at a median location in Meadville.\u201d <em>See also </em>note 17 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b350-14\">. The Taylor report successfully countered the findings of another study submitted on behalf of WICU-TV and completed by Smith Consulting Radio Engineers. In the Smith study, observations as to signal quality were made at the stores of eight dealers who use the cable distribution system of MMA. The comments concerning the observations were very subjective and brief. MMA\u2019s reply included the Taylor statement and affidavits from eleven of the fifteen television dealers in the Meadville area. Ten of these dealers made sworn statements as to the inferiority of the WICU-TV signal. WICU-TV did not attempt to meet the findings of the Taylor report except to file the RCA Proof of Performance, which shows that WICU-TV\u2019s equipment is operating according to the specifications of the Commission. It did not purport to test signal strength or signal quality at the receiving end.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b351-5\">. In the Second Report and Order, the Commission, at 2 F.C.C.2d 725 (1966), stated at paragraph 62:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">Some of the CATV comments urge us to go further and permit duplication of local colorcasts where a CATV system makes a showing that the technical quality of the local signal is substantially inferior to another signal. While we would, of course, consider any such showing on a case-by-case basis, we have no reason to anticipate any widespread problem warranting action by rule. We expect that valid complaints of this nature will be rare. In most instances the technical quality of the local signal should be sufficiently good to permit satisfactory color reception on the cable if the CATV system and the station cooperate in good faith to accomplish this result. We would expect good faith efforts by both to resolve any technical problem before any complaint is made to the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">We note that petitioner alleges that beginning in late 1965 and several months before the Commission issued its rules on nonduplication, MMA informed WICUTV of the unfavorable comments it had received regarding the color quality of WICU-TV broadcasts. Petitioner alleges that WICU-TV failed to make any improvements in the quality of the signal. If true, this may be a factor which the</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">FOO will want to take into consideration on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b351-12\">. We think the Commission was wrong in stating that there had been no allegation of unsatisfactory color quality. While the word \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d may never have been used by petitioner, its references to color quality in its communications to the Commission, including the statements in the Taylor report, are such as to amount to an allegation of unsatisfactory color quality. However, this error in the Commission\u2019s May 6 opinion and order was corrected in its September 2 opinion and order (see text) which indicates that the Commission considered some evidence, however briefly, as to color inferiority and did not dismiss that part of the complaint on the grounds of the absence of a sufficient allegation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b351-13\">.

The evidence of dissatisfaction on the part of viewers and city council, submitted to the Commission in connection with petitioner\u2019s Petition for Reconsideration, lends support to petitioner\u2019s case. Petitioner mailed to its subscribers a letter explaining the Commission\u2019s May 6 action and making the following request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-12\">If you wish to voice an objection to the FCC, we ask you to sign the enclosed card at the place indicated and mail it to us at once. * * * App. 192.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">The following statement appeared on the card:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-15\">The undersigned Subscriber (s) to CATV service of Meadville Master Antenna, Inc., by the signing hereof, certify (ies) that the reception from Erie Channel 12 is consistently inferior to the reception from Youngstown Channel 21, both in black and white and in color; that for this reason the under-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>signed definitely prefer(s) to view NBC programs shown by both stations at the same time on Youngstown Channel 21; and that the reception from Erie Channel 12 of color programs is not satisfactory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">The undersigned, therefore, strongly object (s) to Meadville Master Antenna, Inc., being required to delete the reception of NBC programs shown by Youngstown Channel 21 at the same time these programs are shown by Erie Channel 12. App. 194.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">These cards were mailed on June 9, 1969, to 6,865 subscribers. Of the 2,597 reply cards received as of June 17, 1969, 2,588 cards containing 4,040 signatures certified as to the inferiority of reception from WICU-TV, as compared with WFMJ-TV. Nine of the reply cards containing eleven signatures indicated no inferiority of reception from WICU-TV compared to WFMJ-TV. In response to petitioner\u2019s argument that the survey supported its view that in many areas reception of WICU-TV\u2019s signal is inferior to that of WFMJ-TV, the Commission stated in its August 26, 1970, opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-15\">Petitioner invited its subscribers to write it if they felt WICU-TV\u2019s signal is inferior, in fact, to WFMJ-TV\u2019s signal on the Meadville system. While many subscribers apparently agree with petitioner, we do not believe it appropriate to accept a poll which attracts only dissidents since, presumably, persons who did not agree would have no reason to respond. Further, it is doubtful that viewers will fail to respond favorably to a survey that seems to offer the promise of better reception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">We agree with the Commission\u2019s criticism and feel the statement to which viewers were asked to affix their signatures could have been more carefully worded. However, we think there was at least some evidentiary value in the prompt response by a relatively high percentage of persons. Likewise, we think that the resolution of the Meadville City Council, expressing its belief that WICU-TV\u2019s signal is inferior to that of WFMJ-TV and its concern with the May 6 order of the Commission, is of at least minimal evidentiary value.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
