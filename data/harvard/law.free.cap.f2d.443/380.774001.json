On appeal, he contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish (1) that he possessed the tablets, (2) that he sold the tablets, and (3) that he was a member of a common scheme so that incriminating statements of confederates were admissible against him. We have reviewed the evidence and concluded that it was in all respects sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
