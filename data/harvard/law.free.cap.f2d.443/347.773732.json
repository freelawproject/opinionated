His claim for Social Security disability benefits for this period was administratively denied on the grounds that he had been engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d and hence was not disabled within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(d) (1). In a suit brought by his executrix the District Court upheld this determination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-23\">Of course the scope of our review is narrowly limited to the question of whether the disallowance of benefits was supported by substantial evidence. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>though the record reveals that the claimant obviously was unable to engage in any sort of even moderately strenuous <em>physical </em>activity, nevertheless he came to work six days a week, supervised his employees, took telephone orders, handled accounts receivable and generally acted as overseer of the business\u2019s day-to-day operations. Unlike the disabilities we considered in Butler v. Flemming, 5 Cir., 1961, 288 F.2d 591 and Hayes v. Celebrezze, 5 Cir., 1963, 311 F.2d 648, his condition was not so severe as to preclude for all practical purposes his doing any work at all, and he did in fact contribute significant managerial expertise to the operation of a profit-making enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">We therefore conclude that the evidence supports a finding that, although bearing the burden of a terminal illness, the claimant was engaged in substantial gainful activity and hence was not disabled under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
