The Supreme Court of Connecticut affirmed both convictions on February 4, 1970. State v. Holliday and State v. Daniels, 159 Conn. 169, 268 A.2d 368 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-23\">The sole claim raised and rejected on appellants\u2019 appeal to the Supreme Court of Connecticut was the correctness of the evidentiary ruling by the state trial court in admitting, over appellants\u2019 objection, evidence of a second assault upon the victim of the assault for which appellants were on trial. The second assault occurred the day before the trial originally was scheduled to begin. The State claimed the second assault was instigated by appellants in an effort to prevent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>victim of the original assault from testifying at the trial. The trial court admitted the evidence of the second assault solely to show consciousness of guilt and gave a careful cautionary instruction to the jury. The Supreme Court found no error in this evidentiary ruling and rejected appellants\u2019 asserted constitutional claims that admission of the other crime evidence violated their \u201cright to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation\u201d and served to \u201cdeprive them of their liberty without due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In their habeas corpus proceedings in the District Court, appellants urged substantially the same constitutional claims with respect to the admission of the other crime evidence as were raised and rejected in the Supreme Court of Connecticut. The District Court likewise carefully considered and rejected each such claim, after first observing that \u201cthe question of whether the state court committed error in admitting the evidence of the second assault is irrelevant\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u201c[t]he only question for this court is whether that admission deprived petitioners of a constitutional right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We affirm on Judge Blumenfeld\u2019s well considered opinion of September 23, 1970, 325 F.Supp. 444 (D.Conn.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\">. We note in passing that the standard for admission of, as well as the cautionary procedure in admitting, other crimes evidence is substantially the same under Connecticut law, see, e. g., State v. Holliday and State v. Daniels, 159 Conn. 169, 172-74, 174 n. 1, 268 A.2d 368, 369-70, 370 n. 1 (1970); State v. Leopold, 110 Conn. 55, 66-67, 147 A. 118, 123 (1929), as under federal law in this Circuit, see, e. g., United States v. Jordan, 399 F.2d 610, 612-13 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1005 (1968); United States v. Bradwell, 388 F.2d 619, 621-22 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 867 (1968); United States v. Gardin, 382 F.2d 601, 603-04 (2 Cir. 1967); United States v. Johnson, 382 F.2d 280, 281-82 (2 Cir. 1967); United States v. Deaton, 381 F. 2d 114, 117-18 (2 Cir. 1967); United States v. Knohl, 379 F.2d 427, 438-39 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 973 (1967); United States v. Bozza, 365 F.2d 206, 213-14 (2 Cir. 1966); United States v. Kahaner, 317 F.2d 459, 471-72 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 835-36 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-20\">Even if this were not so and, as Judge Blumenfeld noted, even if the state trial court\u2019s admission of the other crime evidence were error, such error would not rise to the level of constitutional dimensions unless shown to violate specific constitutional safeguards \u2014 a showing strikingly absent here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
