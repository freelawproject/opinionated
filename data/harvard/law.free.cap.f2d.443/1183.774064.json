Henderson, 220 Tenn. 91, 414 S.W.2d 419 (1969). On rehearing, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied and the judgment affirmed by the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals. State' ex rel. Leighton v. Henderson, 448 S.W.2d 82 (1969), cert. denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">This action was then filed and following an evidentiary hearing the application for a writ of habeas corpus was denied. The opinion by then District Judge Miller, who is now a judge of this Court, clearly relates the background of this case, Leighton v. Neil, 317 F.Supp. 959 (1970) and upon consideration of the briefs and oral arguments and the entire record, it is concluded that the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed for the reasons stated by Judge Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
