Our jurisdiction rests upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Both entries into the United States were made upon fraudulent claims of citizenship. Appellant\u2019s defense at trial was based upon the fact that he is the child of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. He now asserts that the deportation order was rendered invalid by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(f), thereby negating an essential element of the crime. The trial court, 319 F.Supp. 558, rejected this contention and upheld the order of deportation on the basis of the decision of the Attorney General in Matter of Lee, Interim Decision No. 1960 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Subsequently, we considered the scope of \u00a7 1251(f) and reversed the said Attorney General\u2019s decision in Lee Fook Chuey v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 439 F.2d 244, (9th Cir. Sept. 29, 1970), pet. rh. denied (Feb. 11, 1971). In that case we held that an alien who has the requisite family ties and meets the qualitative requirements of the Immigration and Naturalization Act is entitled to the relief provided by \u00a7 1251(f), even though he has obtained entry by misrepresentation. No petition for <em>certiorari </em>has been filed by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Because this case is factually indistinguishable from <em>Chuey, </em>we must <em>reverse </em>the judgment of conviction. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b970-5\">GRAY, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ah7\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">I agree that this case is covered by the opinion of this Court in <em>Lee Fook Chuey. </em>Being bound by that decision, I concur in this one.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
