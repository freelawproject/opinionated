Opposition was based on appellant\u2019s alleged prior and continuous use of the marks TRAFFIC-COTE <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for varnish and floor sealer, TRAFFIC WAX <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for buffing wax and TRAFFIC GRADE <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for floor polish. All are suitable for use on gymnasium floors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">There is no question as to the prior use of the appellant. The sole issue before the court is whether appellee\u2019s mark T-R-I-F-I-C is so similar to TRAFFIC WAX, TRAFFIC-COTE, and TRAFFIC GRADE, as to be likely, when applied to the respective goods, to cause mistake, confusion or deception. We agree with the board below that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">The appellant\u2019s marks are two-word designations, <em>i. e., </em>TRAFFIC WAX, TRAFFIC-COTE and TRAFFIC GRADE. In each instance the word \u201ctraffic\u201d is used in connection with another word. Appellee\u2019s mark T-R-I-F-IC, on the other hand, is, we believe, visibly different from the word \u201ctraffic\u201d. It is obviously a play on, or contraction of, the laudatory term \u201cterrific\u201d and not, as urged by appellant, the word \u201ctraffic\u201d. Since each of these words has a distinct and separate meaning, it follows that we agree with the conclusion made by the board that the mark sought to be registered neither sounds like the word \u201ctraffic\u201d nor suggests it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">In short, we agree that the mark T-R-I-F-I-C is not so similar to the marks TRAFFIC GRADE, TRAFFIC-COTE and TRAFFIC WAX as to be likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception. We therefore <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"Ato\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1273-18\">.
