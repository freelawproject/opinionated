KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">Nearly a century after its inception as one aspect of a reform \u2019 movement still widely identified as the \u201cnew\u201d penology, the device of releasing prisoners from incarceration on a trial basis as parolees has long since gained common acceptance by the penal systems of every state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unlike most other Circuits, this court until recently has had little occasion to consider constraints that Fourteenth Amendment guarantees may place on the operation of state parole systems. This appeal, however, requires us for the third time within a year to decide whether an important aspect of a state\u2019s parole procedures operates to deprive affected prisoners and parolees of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-9\">Last term we held in Menechino v. Oswald, 430 F.2d 403 (2d Cir. 1970), that due process did not guarantee legal representation to New York State prisoners when they appeared at a hearing to determine whether they would be released on parole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The instant appeal presents the question, expressly reserved for later decision in <em>Menechino, </em>but since decided affirmatively by New York\u2019s highest court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whether the Constitution nevertheless requires that parolees be afforded legal assistance at a proceeding to determine whether parole status should be <em>revoked. </em>We hold that it does, and that Bey, the petitioner and appellant here, was not accorded due process of law when his parole was revoked and he was reimprisoned following a 1960 hearing before the Connecticut Board of Parole where Bey appeared alone, but was not represented by a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-15\">An appreciation of the issue presented to us, and our resolution of it, requires a preliminary understanding of the functioning of the Connecticut parole system as it was constituted in 1960. For purposes of deciding this case, the operation of the system is best described with reference to Bey\u2019s own history of brief release and subsequent recommitment to prison more than ten years ago, where he has remained confined since.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-16\">Pursuant to state law, Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 54-125, 54-126, appellant was released as a parolee from the Connecticut State Prison on June 10, 1960, where he had been serving a life term for second degree murder. Bey\u2019s release was necessarily premised on a finding by the parole board that there was a \u201creasonable probability that [he would] live and remain at liberty without violating the law and * * * [that his] release [was] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>not incompatible with the welfare of society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 54-125. The board was required to ai\u2019rive at this finding only after weighing a complex of factors, many intangible and subjective.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\">Bey was released from prison in the custody of a parole officer under standard conditions stated on a form signed by Bey prior to his release. The restrictions included a requirement that Bey not \u201cown, possess, use, sell, or have under his control any deadly weapons or firearms,\u201d and that he not leave Connecticut without prior permission from a parole board staff member.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">The events following Bey\u2019s provisional release that resulted eventually in his arrest and reimprisonment less than six months later, on November 30, 1960, are known to us only through a report prepared by a parole officer, Earl C. Mercer,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> after Bey was arrested and in preparation for his revocation hearing. By Mercer\u2019s account, Bey appears to have performed the duties required of him by each of three jobs he held while on parole satisfactorily. He, nevertheless, seemed to progressively disappoint, annoy, and disturb his employers and eventually his parole officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">During the period of his release, Bey was employed successively in unskilled jobs at the Radiant Baseboard Plant in Newington, the Porter School in Farmington, and the Institution of Living in Hartford, a mental institution, all in Connecticut. In each instance minor difficulties developed shortly after Bey assumed each new job. For example, while he was employed at the Newington plant, Bey\u2019s parole officer was required to investigate a report by Bey\u2019s landlady that he was engaged in a \u201csex orgy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">Bey later admitted, according to the parole officer, that a friend had arranged to provide him with a girl with whom to have sexual relations. The landlady entered Bey\u2019s room to find him on his bed with the girl, a bottle of whiskey on the floor, and his friend in a nearby chair. The parole officer was disturbed not only over the incident but by Bey\u2019s apparent \u201cbelligerence\u201d at his landlady\u2019s and parole officer\u2019s interference with his private affairs. The parole officer was also annoyed at Bey\u2019s complaints that his job was unsuitable, that he was receiving inadequate medical treatment for boils and a lame shoulder, and that the services provided him by the parole officer were in other ways inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-12\">At the Porter School, the foreman at the school and the parole officer eventually became \u201cvery apprehensive\u201d that Bey was becoming too involved with one of the girl students there, whose ages ranged from 13 to 16 years. The bases for their suspicions are not revealed in Mercer\u2019s report. Similarly, while Bey was working as a groundsman at the Institute of Living, his parole officer was told by an official at the Porter School that Bey was writing \u201cupsetting\u201d letters to girls and faculty members at Porter and had become \u201ca little too friendly\u201d with two of the girls. Events began to come to a head when the parole officer learned that, contrary to the officer\u2019s instructions, Bey had persisted in talking freely about his prison record, and that Bey sometimes bought whiskey which he took to his room but which others consumed there. Finally, on November 29, Bey\u2019s parole officer received a call from an unnamed individual \u201cwhose word [was] believed to be reliable by the parole officer,\u201d reporting that Bey had threatened to leave Connecticut without informing the parole board, had shown a dagger or knife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>to a fellow-employee, and had bragged that he had killed a policeman before and \u201ccould kill again if anyone bothered him.\u201d A search of Bey\u2019s room was conducted the next morning, after Bey had gone to work, by two parole officers and the Assistant Personnel Director at the Institute. A \u201cnew English style hunting knife was found in a paper box under some clean clothing on a shelf in Bey\u2019s closet,\u201d in the words of Mercer\u2019s report. Bey was taken into custody and returned to prison later the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Mercer\u2019s report, dated December 14, was addressed to the Executive Secretary of the Parole Board, James I. Mcllduff. Notably, Mercer considered the knife incident, although a clear violation of a parole condition (see p. 3006 <em>supra), </em>\u201cin itself not of tremendous import.\u201d Based on Bey\u2019s past record, as well as his record on parole, and on \u201ca number of psychiatric evaluations which have been made,\u201d Mercer described Bey as \u201can extremely unstable individual\u201d and \u201cpotentially dangerous.\u201d According to Mercer, Bey\u2019s parole officer had decided that \u201cit is incompatible with the welfare of society that John Bey be continued on parole.\u201d Because he considered Bey to be \u201cmentally incapable of accepting the responsibilities of parole,\u201d Mercer recommended that he \u201cshould not be re-paroled without extensive psychiatric study.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">The procedures to be followed after Bey\u2019s arrest and return to prison were prescribed by the parole board Regulation \u201cRevocation of Parole.\u201d Bey was to have \u201creasonable notice of the charges against him\u201d and \u201can opportunity to appear before the parole board at its next regular meeting at the State Prison to admit, deny, or explain the violation charged.\u201d After considering the case, the parole board could select any of five options for disposing of Bey\u2019s case. Thus, Bey could be reprimanded; his parole might be continued under more stringent conditions, or closer supervision ; time previously earned toward reduction of his term of imprisonment could be withheld or withdrawn; and of course, his parole could simply be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">Following a hearing conducted December 21, 1960, at which Bey appeared <em>pro se, </em>the Board chose the last, most severe, alternative. As an automatic consequence of parole revocation, Bey was remanded to prison to serve the unexpired portion of the term of his maximum sentence at the date of his violation of a parole condition. Although he could be reconsidered for parole at any time, he would automatically be heard again for possible release on parole only after serving another year of imprisonment. Parole Board Regulation X.C, D. Although Bey\u2019s arrest was statutorily authorized for any reason \u201cdeem[ed] sufficient\u201d by the parole board, a precondition to parole revocation and reinearceration was that Bey had been arrested \u201cfor violation of his parole.\u201d Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 54-128(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-8\">At the time it revoked Bey\u2019s parole, the board had before it Bey\u2019s testimony (there is nothing in the record to indicate the nature of the testimony), Mercer\u2019s report, and also a much briefer report prepared by the Executive Secretary, James Mcllduff. Mcllduff\u2019s report consisted of a digest of Mercer\u2019s report, in the main stressing aspects least favorable to Bey, and miscellaneous representations based on Bey\u2019s previous record. For example, Mcllduff described Bey as \u201cemotionally unstable\u201d and \u201csomewhat of an agitator\u201d and referred to a period of several years during Bey\u2019s earlier incarceration when Bey was confined at the Norwich State Hospital as a mental patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-9\">We have recounted the facts revealed in this record with somewhat greater detail than necessary to resolve the legal question presented. We have done so to avoid the appearance of resolving the important issue raised on this appeal abstractly or academically. Bey\u2019s brief parole history serves better than hypothesis to illustrate concretely the potential importance of a lawyer\u2019s presence at a parole revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>At the outset, we must note the narrowness of the issue framed by appellant. In 1967 Bey initiated a habeas corpus action in Connecticut state courts by filing a petition which alleged numerous statutory and constitutional deficiencies in the Board\u2019s revocation procedure. The Superior Court, Hartford County, denied the petition, Bey v. Reincke, No. 151663 (July 30, 1969). After an application for a certificate of probable cause was denied, Bey proceeded with his present federal application, again raising numerous constitutional challenges. Judge Blumenfeld denied the petition in all respects in a brief opinion filed June 3, 1970. Among the many constitutional issues resolved against him by the district court judge, Bey has chosen to appeal only the holding that he had no right to counsel at the revocation hearing. That is the sole issue briefed and argued before us and it is the only issue we decide today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">Precedent on the precise issue before us is conflicting and its significance is difficult to assess. The Tenth Circuit, which has spoken most often and has frequently been followed by other courts, appears to hold that counsel is of sufficient importance that if a parolee is permitted to <em>retain </em>counsel to represent him at revocation hearings, then the equal protection and due process guarantees require that counsel also be provided for indigent parolees, Earnest v. Willingham, 406 F.2d 681 (1969), at least when the parolee contests an alleged parole violation, Serviss v. Moseley, 430 F.2d 1287 (1970); Murphy v. Turner, 426 F.2d 422 (1970); but a state may choose to bar counsel from revocation hearings altogether, Firkins v. Colorado, 434 F.2d 1232 (1970) (per curiam); Williams v. Patterson, 389 F.2d 374 (1968). The fount of Tenth Circuit precedent on the latter point seems to be a per curiam opinion in Gonzales v. Patterson, 370 F.2d 94 (1966), relying (as have many courts, including the district court below) on dictum in Escoe v. Zerbst, 295 U.S. 490, 492-493, 55 S.Ct. 818, 79 L.Ed. 1566 (1935) that <em>probation </em>is a matter of \u201cgrace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">In Williams v. Dunbar, 377 F.2d 505 (1967) , the Ninth Circuit rejected a petitioner\u2019s claims to various procedural guarantees at a revocation hearing, including a right to compulsory process to summon witnesses and a right to cross-examine and confront adverse witnesses, as well as a right to counsel. Rather than evaluate the merits of each claimed right individually, the <em>Dunbar </em>court reasoned broadly that a state required to comply with <em>all </em>the procedures sought would abandon its parole system as rigid and unwieldy. See also Mead v. California Adult Auth., 415 F.2d 767 (9th Cir. 1969) (per curiam) (simply citing Williams v. Patterson, <em>supra). </em>On the strength of the Escoe v. Zerbst dictum, <em>supra </em>(and relying in part also on its earlier decision in Johnson v. Avery, 382 F.2d 353 (6th Cir. 1967), reversed, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969)), the Sixth Circuit in Rose v. Haskins, 388 F.2d 91, cert. denied, 392 U.S. 946, 88 S.Ct. 2300, 20 L.Ed.2d 1408 (1968) discovered and applied an \u201caxiom\u201d that \u201cthe administration of the state\u2019s penal system is exclusively a state function under the reserved powers in the Constitution\u201d in finding no right to counsel in state parole revocation proceedings. <em>Rose </em>was announced over a scholarly and thorough dissent by Judge Celebrezze, who we believe successfully unravelled the rationale of the majority as well as that of other courts reaching results like that in <em>Rose, </em>including those cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-10\">The other Circuit to rule on the right to counsel at state parole revocation hearing is the Third. That Court has decided that a state prisoner is not denied due process when revocation is premised on either irrefutable evidence that the parolee violated a condition of his parole, United States ex rel. Halprin v. Parker, 418 F.2d 313, 315 (3d Cir., 1969) (parolee arrested out-of-state; parole revoked because he left the parole board\u2019s jurisdiction without permission), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>or on a criminal act proved after a full trial prior to parole revocation, United States ex rel. Heacock v. Myers, 367 F.2d 583 (3d Cir., 1966), affirming on opinion below, 251 F.Supp. 773 (E.D. Pa.), cert. denied sub nom. Heacock v. Rundle, 386 U.S. 925, 87 S.Ct. 900, 17 L.Ed.2d 797 (1967). The Third Circuit has not ruled on the right to counsel where the parole violation is less conclusively established prior to revocation. Finally, in other Circuits the precise question before us here as one of first impression appears not to have been squarely decided, although certain views that have been expressed by the Fourth,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Fifth,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Seventh,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Eighth,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and District of Columbia<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Circuits on closely related issues appear to parallel those of the Circuits which have found no right to counsel at state parole revocation hearings. We note, however, that many of the leading cases in other Circuits were decided prior to the landmark Supreme Court decisions in Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967) (unanimous) and Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> discussed below. Our views coincide with those of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>courts in Pennsylvania, Michigan and New York, Commonwealth v. Tinson, 433 Pa. 328, 249 A.2d 549 (1969); Warren v. Michigan Parole Board, 23 Mich.App. 754, 179 N.W.2d 664 (Ct.App. 1970) , appeal dismissed, Mich., 184 N.W.2d 457 (1971); People ex rel. Menechino v. Warden, 27 N.Y.2d 376, 318 N.Y.S.2d 449 (1970) and one federal district court, Goolsby v. Gagnon, Civ.No. 70-C-330, 322 F.Supp. 460 (E.D.Wis. 1971) , and with the recommendations of several scholars and commentators who have long urged courts to recognize that legal assistance is essential to the fundamental fairness of a parole revocation proceeding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">In particular, we are in accord with those who consider it no longer tenable to rely unanalytically on dictum in the Supreme Court\u2019s 1935 case, Escoe v. Zerbst, <em>supra, </em>in a probation revocation case, that \u201c[probation or suspension of sentence comes as an act of grace to one convicted of a crime, and may be coupled with such conditions in respect of its duration as Congress may impose.\u201d 295 U.S. at 492-493, 55 S.Ct. at 819. It seems often to be overlooked that the primary thrust of <em>Escoe </em>was to stress the importance of the hearing guaranteed by statute prior to revocation of federal probation. Moreover, as authority for the quoted dictum, the Court in Escoe cited Burns v. United States, 287 U.S. 216, 53 S.Ct. 154, 77 L.Ed. 266 (1932), where it had stated a principle complementary to the <em>Escoe </em>dictum and harmonious with our own views, that \u201c[w]hile probation is a matter of grace, the probationer is entitled to fair treatment, and is not to be made the victim of whim or caprice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 53 S.Ct. at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-13\">Any lingering doubt that the \u201cgrace\u201d theory of <em>Escoe </em>may no longer be resurrected as the Q.E.D. of due process arguments on the question presently before us should have been finally laid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>rest by the explicit direction of Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970), that a constitutional challenge to procedures preceding a state\u2019s withdrawal of welfare benefits \u201ccannot be answered by an argument that public assistance benefits are a \u2018privilege\u2019 and not a \u2018right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, 90 S.Ct. at 1017. In this Circuit, early conceptual analysis has yielded to practical consideration of \u201cthe nature of the governmental function involved and the substance of the private interest which is affected.\u201d Escalera v. New York Housing Auth., 2nd Cir., 425 F.2d 853, 861, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 853, 91 S.Ct. 54, 27 L.Ed.2d 91 (1970). \u201c[S]tates may not avoid the rigors of due process by labelling an action which has serious and onerous consequences as a withdrawal of a \u2018privilege\u2019 rather than a \u2018right.\u2019 \u201d Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178, 196 (2d Cir. 1971) (en banc). See also, Securities &amp; Exchange Comm\u2019n v. Frank, 388 F.2d 486, 492 (2d Cir. 1968); K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 7.04 (1970 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">We do not imply by this that it is irrelevant that appellant is a lawfully convicted felon, a fact permitting the constriction of freedoms guaranteed other citizens so far as \u201cjustified by the considerations underlying our penal system\u201d Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1060, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948). Moreover, we are cognizant that insensitive judicial intrusions might blunt the flexibility of a useful device such as parole, which may permit both a smoother transition from the dependency of prison to complete freedom and earlier release from incarceration under conditions designed to test the prisoner\u2019s capacity to \u201cmake it on the outside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">Accordingly, we have refused to shackle a parole board in its endeavor to dispose of each parolee\u2019s case on an individual basis by denying it access to relevant information produced by an illegal state police search. United States ex rel. Sperling v. Fitzpatrick, 426 F.2d 1161 (2nd Cir., 1970). For similar reasons we declined in Sostre v. McGinnis 442 F.2d 178 (1971) to import the trappings of trial-type due process into prison disciplinary proceedings. Most closely in point to this case, however, is our holding in Menechino v. Oswald, <em>supra, </em>that a prisoner \u201cis not entitled to procedural due process,\u201d including legal representation, \u201cin seeking parole.\u201d 430 F.2d at 408-409.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-8\">But the respondent here misconstrues the relevance of <em>Menechino. </em>That case does not dictate that parolees facing loss of their conditional freedom be equated with prisoners looking forward to release. It does, however, provide a convenient model for analysis. Patterning our discussion on Judge Mansfield\u2019s majority opinion in <em>Menechino, </em>we will consider in turn three factors: (1) Bey\u2019s stake in the parole revocation proceeding; (2) the importance to the fairness of the proceeding of the particular constitutional right asserted; and (3) the anticipatable effects on state institutions of recognizing that right. See Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420, 444, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 1515, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960) (\u201cThe nature of the alleged right involved, the nature of the proceeding, and the possible burden on that proceeding, are all considerations which must be taken into account\u201d). <em>Menechino\u2019s </em>parole release case is sharply distinguishable from the present parole revocation case on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-9\">A. <em>The Parolee\u2019s Interest in Conditional Freedom</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-10\">Unlike a prisoner being considered for parole release, a parolee facing reimprisonment stands to lose a \u201cpresently enjoyed\u201d interest in his conditional freedom that the <em>Menechino </em>panel aptly characterized as \u201ca liberty akin to a private interest.\u201d 430 F.2d at 409. It is not sophistic to attach greater importance to a person\u2019s justifiable reliance in maintaining his conditional freedom so long as he abides by the conditions of his release, than to his mere anticipation or hope of freedom. In this respect, this case is indistinguishable from Mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>pa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967), establishing the right to legal representation at Washington State\u2019s unusual deferred sentencing and probation revocation proceeding. Both the probationer and parolee have \u201cbeen given a status that is considerably more desirable than that of a prisoner. When revocation is threatened, they all have the same interest in maintaining that status.\u201d Rose v. Haskins, 388 F.2d 91, 103 (6th Cir. 1968) (Celebrezze, J., dissenting). The cost to Bey of revocation thus far has been eleven years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\">Moreover, we do not doubt that a parole revocation is more likely than a denial of initial release to mar a prisoner\u2019s record, perhaps adversely affecting his chances for future parole. Even after release from prison, it is only realistic to assume that a former inmate\u2019s job opportunities and standing in the community will also be influenced by his prison record. Parole revocation will inevitably connote wrongdoing and thus the citizen whose parole was once revoked will continue to carry a burden analogous and in addition to his criminal stigma. See Hahn v. Burke, 430 F.2d 100, 102 (7th Cir. 1970). Thus, it seems incontestable to say that \u201csubstantial rights\u201d of Bey were \u201caffected\u201d by the revocation proceeding. For that reason as well as those stated below, Bey was entitled to the assistance of a lawyer. Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 134, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">B. <em>The Lawyer\u2019s Role in a Parole Revocation Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">A decision to revoke parole, like a parole release determination, inevitably involves the discretionary application of principles and knowledge derived from study and experience in fields such as psychology, sociology, and penology \u2014 \u2022 where ordinarily a lawyer can claim no special expertise. Neither forensic skill, legal training, nor the advocate\u2019s role in a decision making process suits a lawyer for effective participation in this judgment phase of the parole process. Unlike a parole release decision, however, a necessary precondition to parole revocation is a finding that events intervening between a prisoner\u2019s release and the hearing justify forfeiture of the prisoner\u2019s provisional liberty. Thus, in Connecticut, the ^parole release decision is based on a complex of tangible and intangible, objective and subjective, factors which we have partly enumerated above. See fn. 4, <em>supra. </em>By contrast, a necessary precondition to Bey\u2019s reincarceration was the finding that Bey had violated a condition of his parole. Whether Bey would lose his conditioned liberty turned on a narrow retrospective determination of a specific factual question. A lawyer\u2019s training particularly suits him to analyze and organize for the benefit of an impartial tribunal evidentiary matter bearing on the occurrence or nonoccurrence, as well as the significance, of past events. See Specht v. Patterson, 386 U.S. 605, 87 S.Ct. 1209, 18 L.Ed.2d 326 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">Of course, more complex factual questions than whether Bey had a knife in his closet and why, were also relevant to the disposition of his case by the parole board. Mercer\u2019s report reveals the complexity of factual questions that can dispose a parole board or officer to greater or lesser leniency or harshness. None of the incidents that soured Bey\u2019s relationship with the parole officer are sharply delineated by Mercer\u2019s recitation. Mc-Ilduff apparently accepted Mercer\u2019s account at face value. A trained lawyer might well have discovered mitigating circumstances and hidden significances not revealed or immediately obvious on the face of Mercer\u2019s report. For example, the Board might well have welcomed a suggestion for a fuller investigation of Bey\u2019s alleged announced intent to depart the state, or his oblique threat to repeat his past crimes. Perhaps Bey\u2019s employers could have supplied useful information as to Bey\u2019s dependability and thoroughness on the job. A review of Bey\u2019s reported letters to Porter School girl students might have revealed different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>hues of motivation than found their way into Mercer\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">Thus, at the least a diligent lawyer representing Bey before the Parole Board might have investigated the decisive events of Bey\u2019s brief period of release and in an orderly, disciplined presentation to the Board have attempted to establish facts more favorable to Bey than those presented by Mercer and Mcllduff and have suggested their relevance to the four alternatives less severe than revocation available to the Board in disposing of Bey\u2019s case, see p. 3008, <em>supra. </em>See Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948); McConnell v. Rhay, 373 U.S. 2, 89 S.Ct. 32, 21 L.Ed.2d 2 (1968) (per curiam). See also, Cohen, Sentencing, Probation and the Rehabilitative Ideal: The View from Mempa v. Rhay, 47 Tex. L.Rev. 1, 28 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">The fact that the Board performs a predictive and prognostic function does not depreciate the importance of accurate factual exposition and evaluation. Less educated or intelligent prisoners are particularly likely to suffer from the absence of trained legal assistance. See Johnson v. Avery, <em>supra. </em>Bey himself must have been severely handicapped in preparing a case from behind prison walls.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cf. Sostre v. McGinnis, <em>supra, </em>442 F.2d at 196-197. Accordingly, we are compelled to recognize, as did the Court in Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 135, 88 S.Ct. 254, 256, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967), \u201cthe necessity for the aid of counsel in marshalling the facts, introducing evidence of mitigating circumstances and in general aiding and assisting the defendant to present his case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">C. <em>Impact of a Right to Counsel on the State\u2019s Parole System</em></p>\n<p id=\"AA2\"> We realize that \u201cthe due-process clause should not be treated as a device for freezing the evidential procedure of [state correctional processes] in the mold of trial procedure.\u201d Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 251, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1085, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1948) (sentencing). But the state has demonstrated no respect in which the presence of counsel for the limited purpose of developing and evaluating relevant events of a parolee\u2019s history on parole, and of recommending alternative dispositions to revocation, will tend to inhibit or constrict the parole process. Indeed, representation of parolees at revocation hearings should advance, not retard, the \u201cmodern concept of individualized punishment\u201d and rehabilitation. Williams v. New York, <em>supra, </em>337 U.S. at 247, 69 S.Ct. at 1083. As distinct from other elements of trial-type due process, see U. S. ex rel. Sperling v. Fitzpatrick, <em>supra, </em>a lawyer\u2019s participation should not be permitted to impede the flow of relevant information to the parole- board. Indeed, competent counsel should augment the flow and the board, as well as the parolee, should benefit from a trained lawyer\u2019s capacity to guard against error and distortions. To the extent that a lawyer who misconceives his role in the parole process might resort to dilatory or distracting tactics or equate it with his role in the trial of a ease, the board does not lack the power to so structure the proceedings as to maximize the lawyer\u2019s contribution and minimize his potential for disruption. See Fleming v. Tate, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 156 F.2d 848, 849-850 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-9\">Nor does our decision threaten to introduce friction into the relationship between a parolee and his assigned parole officer. The right to counsel does not attach until the parole status might imminently be discontinued. Neither will counsel\u2019s participation in proceedings post-dating a parolee\u2019s arrest and incarceration pending his hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>add in any degree to the burden of the overworked parole officer, or require him to divert his energies from his \u201crehabilitative\u201d to his \u201cpatrolman\u201d functions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See United States ex rel. Sperling v. Fitzpatrick, 426 F.2d 1161, 1164 (2d Cir. 1961) (Lumbard, Chief Judge, concurring).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\">We believe also that, unlike perhaps a decision that would have been contrary to that announced in Menechino v. Oswald, <em>supra, </em>recognizing a parolee\u2019s limited right to counsel will have little or no tendency to defeat its own purpose by causing Connecticut to grant fewer paroles. No such effect has to our knowledge ever been demonstrated. See Sklar, Law and Practice in Probation and Parole Revocation Hearings, 55 J. Crim.L.C. &amp; P.S. 174, 175 (1964); <em>id. </em>194 n. 157 (Michigan, which guarantees parolees by statute almost the full panoply of due process rights, had one of the highest rates of parole in the country). It is contrary to common sense that state policy would be significantly influenced by the relatively small increased administrative burden ensuing from legal representation to parolees at revocation hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">Chief Justice Burger has recently commented on the seeming effectiveness with which \u201ctypical\u201d prison systems in this country \u201cbrutalize and dehumanize\u201d inmates. Interview with Chief Justice Burger, U. S. News &amp; World Rep., Dec. 14, 1970, p. 45. One certain way to increase a prisoner\u2019s sense of resentment and to discourage his will eventually to return to a normal life would be to deny him basic safeguards essential to the fundamental fairness of a decision to deprive him of the liberty he gained upon parole release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">For the reasons stated, we hold that parolees are entitled to legal representation at parole revocation hearings that may result in their reinearceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\"> We stress once again that the participation of the lawyer at a parole hearing should be limited to investigating and explicating to the board, evidence bearing on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of events during the parolee\u2019s period of release and their significance, provided these are relevant to the disposition of the prisoner\u2019s case. Counsel should not be permitted to employ trial tactics utilized in an adversary context. For example, he should not employ as his forensic text the parolee\u2019s entire life history prior to his release on parole. Nor is it counsel\u2019s function by cajolery or blandishment or oratory to interfere with the Board\u2019s judgment in applying its special expertise to the facts of the case at hand. We emphatically stress that our decision does not detract in the least from the Board\u2019s power to limit counsel\u2019s participation in revocation proceedings so that parole hearings do not become legal battles. Counsel\u2019s proper role is to <em>assist </em>the Board, not to impede it, and the Board may take appropriate measures to assure that the counsel appreciates his limited role and presents his client\u2019s case accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-12\">Appellant has suggested that the lapse of time and resultant staleness of the evidence bearing on Bey\u2019s revocation require that we summarily order his release from prison. But there is no presumption that the Board\u2019s initial disposition of Bey\u2019s case was erroneous and we will remand the case to the district court for entry of the conditional order usually appropriate in this situation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>Bey must be given a new revocation hearing with participation by counsel within the bounds we have defined. He will be released only if such a hearing is not conducted within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">. It appears that the first parole statute became law in 1877 and thereafter parole rapidly gained favor over its antecedent, the conditional general executive pardon, as part of the progressive movement in penal reform that gave birth to many presently standard correctional tools.
