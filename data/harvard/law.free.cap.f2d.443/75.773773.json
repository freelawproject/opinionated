He also challenged the validity of his parole revocation on the ground that he was denied counsel at his parole revocation hearing, though he was an indigent and had requested counsel. The District Court denied relief, and Nelson appealed. Thereafter an affidavit by the Administrative Assistant of the United States Penitentiary at Atlanta, Georgia was filed in this Court certifying that Nelson was released from federal custody on April 30, 1971. Since Nelson is no longer incarcerated by virtue of the challenged parole revocation proceedings, the issues presented upon this appeal are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
