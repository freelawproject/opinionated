Freed, 1971, 403 U.S. 912, 91 S.Ct. 2201, 29 L.Ed.2d 690. The evidence was sufficient to warrant the verdict of guilty in light of the fact that entrapment was not established as a matter of law. The question of entrapment was for the jury. The charge on entrapment was without error, and there was no error in failing to give appellant\u2019s requested charge on entrapment. The case being otherwise without error, the judgment of conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
