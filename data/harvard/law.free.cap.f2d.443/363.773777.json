Hillin in Hillin\u2019s suit on an employment contract terminated before its expiration date by Herff Jones. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-16\">Herff Jones hired Hillin in 1963 to serve as a sales representative in south Texas. Hillin\u2019s employment contract was to continue in force through June 30, 1968, unless earlier terminated as provided therein. The contract authorized the company to terminate Hillin\u2019s employment should he at any time fail, in the company\u2019s discretion, to perform his duties in accordance with standards of reasonable care and prudence. The Trial Judge found that the company discharged Hillin in 1966, not because it was dissatisfied with the caliber of his performance (for which it had commended him in the months prior to termination), but because it had decided, based on its assessment of its long-run profit potential in the Houston region, to disband its entire sales force in that area. The District Court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous; there is adequate evidentiary support for it in the record. The Judge\u2019s determination that the company wrongfully terminated Hillin was sound. We reach the same conclusion, after careful study of the record, with respect to the Court\u2019s findings and conclusions as to the quantum of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
