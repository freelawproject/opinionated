John LEVEY, Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b1425-10\">No. 23544.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b1425-11\">United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b1425-12\">July 16, 1971.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1425-14\">Stephen D. Miller (argued), of Miller, Glassman &amp; Browning, Beverly Hills, Cal., Harry J.

We arrive at this adjustment because of a credit to be allowed Levey and out of reconstruction of the final computation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-19\">We accept the trial court\u2019s computation of a charge against Levey of $117,-942.01 and a charge of $6,896.12 (money received) against Leeds. (This is not a true partnership case but the same rules of accounting would be applicable here). We find the $117,942.01 figure should be reduced by a $5,000 credit for an amount paid by Levey to Perma Stamp Products. See Godbey &amp; Sons Const. Co. v. Deane (1952) 39 Cal.2d 429, 246 P.2d 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-21\">So we conclude that the \u201cpartners\u201d accounts with the \u201cpartnership\u201d were $112,942.01 (drawn by Levey) and $6,-896.12 (drawn by Leeds) or a total of $119,838.13. Thus Leeds is entitled to one-half of the total, which is $59,919.-06, less $6,896.12 already received, leaving a net of $53,022.93 due Leeds by Levey.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-22\">With the foregoing adjustments we find no reversible error in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-23\">Remanded for modification in accordance with the foregoing. Appellant shall have one-half his costs on the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
