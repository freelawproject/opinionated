He requires a transcript, he claims, in order to prepare a petition for post-conviction relief from his convictions. The district court dismissed the complaint because Smith had failed to show a \u201cparticularized need\u201d for a transcript. United States v. Glass, 4 Cir., 317 F.2d 200; United States v. Shoaf, 4 Cir., 341 F.2d 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">We dismiss the appeal as moot. At oral argument we were informed that, having exhausted his state remedies, Smith has now filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for habeas corpus in the district court. The state has been ordered to file an answer together with pertinent court records; it states that the requested transcript is among these records, and that a copy of its answer, together with a copy of the transcript, already prepared, will be served on Smith. Since the state intends to supply the requested transcript, we need not consider whether it, or its agents, could be required to do so under other circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-16\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
