We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-12\">On December 17, 1969, the defendant, Edwards, testified at the trial of Walter Patrick Peyson in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. Peyson was being tried under an indictment brought under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3150 for failure to appear before that court for trial on December 3, 1968, after being released on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-16\">In that trial for failure to appear, Peyson testified that he did not inform his wife, or the government, of his whereabouts after being released on bond, because he was concerned about his own safety; that he was a member of the Minutemen; and that he was afraid that if he was apprehended, he might be assassinated by agents of the FBI or others. In support of that testimony, Robert DePugh testified that in late November or early December of 1967, he received a telephone call from Edwards during which Edwards advised DePugh that a Mr. Brown and a Mr. \u201cZ\u201d \u201cwere working with some government agency who was determined to destroy the Minutemen organization even to using these people to assassinate Mr. Peyson and myself [DePugh] and frame us for these bank robberies if the assassination plot backfired.\u201d DePugh further testified that he communicated this message to Peyson and told him that for his own safety Peyson should not turn himself in.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-17\">Edwards testified that in late November of 1967, while he was a federal fugitive, he had called DePugh and told him of a conversation that he, Edwards, had engaged in the prior day with one Henry Floyd Brown. This testimony was later the basis of the perjury indictment of Edwards.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>Prior to his trial on the perjury-charge, Edwards determined to act as his own counsel and the trial court appointed an attorney to assist him in conducting his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">At this trial, the government offered testimony to show that Edwards had testified at Peyson\u2019s trial as alleged in the indictment, and a stipulation was received relating to the testimony of the court reporter at the Peyson trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1350-26\">The government\u2019s case in chief included testimony that on November 9, 1967, and immediately prior thereto, Edwards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>was in federal custody but escaped on that date from a U. S. Marshal at LaCrosse, Indiana. Edwards was in federal custody continuously at all pertinent times prior thereto and thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-4\">The government\u2019s witnesses also testified that Henry Floyd Brown was in federal custody in Leavenworth, Kansas from December 8, 1958, to November 24, 1967, when he was discharged on mandatory release. The position of the government was that since Edwards was free only from November 9, 1967, to November 12, 1967, and since Henry Floyd Brown was then in federal custody in Leavenworth, Kansas, that Edwards and Henry Floyd Brown could not have had a personal conversation in Indiana during that, time period. At the close of the government\u2019s evidence, defendant made a motion for acquittal, which was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">Edwards produced witnesses who testified that another Brown, Glen B. Brown, was in fact the person to whom Edwards had reference in his testimony in the Peyson trial and identified him by pictures produced by Mr. Zarter, Administrative Assistant, Classification and Parole, United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kansas. Two <em>witnesses, </em>both inmates at the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, testified that they had seen Edwards in the company of Glen B. Brown in Lafayette, Indiana in November of 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">In rebuttal, the government called Glen B. Brown, who testified that he was working in Florida during the period in question, that he had not been in Indiana during 1967 and that he had not met Edwards there or anywhere else since Brown\u2019s parole in July of 1967. Two additional witnesses, fellow workers of Glen B. Brown at the Jacksonville, Florida shipyards, corroborated the testimony of Glen B. Brown as to his whereabouts during the period in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-11\">Defendant then renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal which the court overruled. The jury found Edwards guilty of perjury as charged, and he was sentenced to a term of four years. A written motion for judgment of acquittal and a motion for new trial were filed by Edwards and overruled. This appeal was then taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-12\">Edwards alleges seven grounds for reversal on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-13\">1. That the indictment fails to allege a violation of Section 1621, Title 18, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-14\">2. That there was no evidence before the jury that Edwards was sworn under an oath to testify truly or an oath authorized by the United States when he testified in the Peyson trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-15\">3. That the trial court should have instructed the jury that they must unanimously agree as to Edwards\u2019 guilt or innocence as to each statement alleged to have been falsely made by him; that the failure of the trial court so to instruct denied defendant a fair trial and trial by jury as required by the fifth and sixth amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-16\">4. That the trial court erred in admitting evidence of Edwards\u2019 escape from federal custody on November 9, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-17\">5. That the jury was not sufficiently informed of the surrounding circumstances of Edwards\u2019 testimony at the Peyson trial to reach an intelligent determination whether the allegedly false testimony was willfully given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-18\">6. That there was not a finding sufficient on the record that these allegedly false statements were material to the subject under inquiry at the Peyson trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-19\">7. That there was not sufficient evidence for conviction as a matter of law at the close of the government\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>I. SUFFICIENCY OF THE INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">Edwards contends that the terms of the indictment, \u201cduly appeared,\u201d \u201cwas sworn as a witness,\u201d \u201cbeing under oath\u201d and \u201ctestify falsely,\u201d did not suffice when the statute requires that the one charged must have \u201ctaken an oath * * * that he will testify * * * truly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">Rule 7(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that the indictment \u201cbe a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.\u201d There is no requirement that the indictment be phrased in the exact words of the statute so long as it describes each element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">In United States v. Debrow, 346 U.S. 374, 376, 74 S.Ct. 113, 115, 98 L.Ed. 92 (1953), the Supreme Court determined that \u201c[t]he essential elements of the crime of perjury as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 are (1) an oath authorized by a law of the United States, (2) taken before a competent tribunal, officer or person, and (3) a false statement wilfully made as to facts material to the hearing.\u201d The Court also stated at page 377, 74 S.Ct. at page 115:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-7\">\u201cThe oath administered must be authorized by a law of the United States. This requirement is met by the allegations in the indictments that the defendants had \u2018duly taken an oath.\u2019 \u2018Duly taken\u2019 means an oath taken according to a law which authorizes such oath. See Robertson v. Perkins, 129 U.S. 233, 236, 9 S.Ct. 279, 280, 32 L.Ed. 686. The name of the person who administered the oath is not an essential element of the crime of perjury; the identity of such person goes only to the proof of whether the defendants were duly sworn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">Measured by these pronouncements of the law, the wording of the indictment is obviously sufficient. The indictment alleges that Edwards \u201cbeing under oath\u201d testified in a criminal trial in \u201cthe United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri\u201d; that he \u201cduly appeared and was sworn as a witness in the course of the trial\u201d; and that Edwards, \u201cbeing under oath, did, in violation of Section 1621, Title 18, United States Code, wilfully and contrary to such oath, testify falsely as to matters material to said trial. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">As stated by the Supreme Court in <em>Debrow, supra </em>at 376, 74 S.Ct. at 114-115, \u201c[a]n indictment is required to set forth the elements of the offense sought to be charged.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-11\">\u2018The true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could have been made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, \u201cand sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet, and, in case any other proceedings are taken against him for a similar offence, whether the record shows with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.\u201d Cochran and Sayre v. United States, 157 U.S. 286, 290, 15 S.Ct. 628, 630, 39 L.Ed. 704; Rosen v. United States, 161 U.S. 29, 34, 16 S.Ct. 434, [435], 480, 40 L.Ed. 606.\u2019 Hagner v. United States, 285 U.S. 427, 431, 52 S.Ct. 417, 419, 76 L.Ed. 861.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-12\">These requirements have been fully met by this indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-13\">II. ADEQUACY OF PROOF THAT DEFENDANT WAS UNDER OATH</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-14\">Edwards\u2019 contention that there was no evidence before the jury that the defendant was under oath when he was testifying during the Peyson trial is without merit for two reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-15\">1. Edwards stipulated that if the court reporter at the Peyson trial were called as a witness, she would testify \u201cthat defendant herein, William Carey Edwards, Jr., appeared in such proceedings as a witness for the defendant, Walter Patrick Peyson, and after having taken an oath adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>tered by a Deputy Clerk of the United States District Court, William Carey Edwards, Jr., testified before such Court; . . .\u201d (see n. 2, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-4\">2. The government offered into evidence at the Edwards trial, portions of the transcript of evidence of the Peyson trial. This includes the following statement of the court reporter in that transcript:</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">\u201cWILLIAM CAREY EDWARDS, called as a witness by the Defendant, having been duly sworn, testified as follows: \u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">As stated in Jackson v. United States, 330 F.2d 679, 681 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 855, 85 S.Ct. 105, 13 L.Ed.2d 58 (1964);</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-7\">\u201cIt is a well-settled general rule of law that facts which are stipulated during the course of a trial are to be taken by the jury as conclusively proven.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\"><em>Accord, </em>Osborne v. United States, 351 F.2d 111, 120 (8th Cir. 1965); Vuckson v. United States, 354 F.2d 918, 921 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 U.S. 991, 86 S.Ct. 1896, 16 L.Ed.2d 1007, <em>reh. denied, </em>385 U.S. 893, 87 S.Ct. 27, 17 L.Ed.2d 127 (1966). Smith v. United States, 363 F.2d 143, 145 (5th Cir. 1966), is cited by Edwards on this proposition, but is distinguishable by reason of the fact that in <em>Smith </em>there was no stipulation relating to the oath and no evidence other than the transcript to indicate the oath had been administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-16\">III. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-17\">Edwards contends that the court should have instructed the jury that it must unanimously agree as to his guilt of perjury on one or more of the individual statements attributed to Edwards which were the subject of the perjury charge; that it was possible that one or two jurors found one or more of the statements to be true without all twelve jurors agreeing on the truth or falsity of any one of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-18\">\u2022The trial court instructed the jury that there are five essential elements to be proved in perjury cases and that it required twelve jurors agreeing to return a verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>No objection was voiced to these instructions and no instruction was proposed which embodies the unanimity theory of the defendant set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">Rule 30, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, provides in part: \u201cNo party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d Edwards concedes no objection was raised or instruction proposed, but claims that the Court had a duty to instruct the jury on his theory of unanimity and that its failure to do so constituted \u201cplain error\u201d under Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">In Black v. United States, 309 F.2d 331, 342 (8th Cir. 1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 934, 83 S.Ct. 880, 9 L.Ed.2d 765 (1963), this Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1354-6\">\u201cThis Court has \u2018repeatedly held that the plain error rule should be applied with caution and should be invoked only to avoid a miscarriage of justice.\u2019 Johnson v. United States, 8 Cir., 291 F.2d 150, 156. Similar pronouncements of this Court as to the noticing of plain error may be found in: Page v. United States, 8 Cir., 282 F.2d 807, 810; Bell v. United States, 8 Cir., 251 F.2d 490, 494; Kreinbring v. United States, 8 Cir., 216 F.2d 671, 674; Mitchell v. United States, 8 Cir., 208 F.2d 854, 858.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\"><em>Accord, </em>Armstrong v. United States, 228 F.2d 764, 768 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>351 U.S. 918, 76 S.Ct. 710, 100 L.Ed. 1450 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-11\">Assuming, however, <em>arguendo, </em>that, since Edwards was (by his own choice) proceeding during trial <em>pro se, </em>the Court should permit a more liberal application of Rule 52(b), this Court believes the instructions to be proper. The wording of the indictment and the wording of the instruction made it clear that the allegation of falsity to be determined by the jury was that Edwards \u201chad not met with said Henry Floyd Brown at or near New Liberty, Indiana, during the month of November 1967.\u201d Considering the testimony at the trial, it is highly unlikely that one or more members of the jury could find that this statement was false only in part. The government\u2019s testimony proved conclusively that Henry Floyd Brown could not have met Edwards at that time. When Edwards attempted to shift the identity to Glen B. Brown, the government adduced evidence that Glen B. Brown did not meet with Edwards either. Thus the evidence was such that the jury could either believe Edwards\u2019 witnesses that Glen B. Brown met with Edwards in Indiana in November of 1967 or the government\u2019s witnesses, including Glen B. Brown, who testified that he, Glen B. Brown, was in Florida during all of the period in question. It is obvious that they chose the latter course and the instruction complained of could not have contributed to that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-12\">This same unanimity argument urged by Edwards was rejected in the recent case of Vitello v. United States, 425 F.2d 416, 422 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U. S. 822, 91 S.Ct. 43, 27 L.Ed.2d 50 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>IV. ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE OF ESCAPE</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-4\"> Edwards testified at the Peyson trial that he made the telephone call to DePugh after meeting with Henry Floyd Brown and that both the call and the meeting took place while he was a \u201cfederal fugitive\u201d having \u201cescaped from a marshal some previous day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">While evidence of another crime is generally inadmissible, it is admissible when used to establish a material fact or issue in the case. Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 560, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606, <em>reh. denied, </em>386 U.S. 969, 87 S.Ct. 1015, 18 L.Ed.2d 125 (1967); Love v. United States, 386 F.2d 260, 266 (8th Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 985, 88 S.Ct. 1111, 19 L.Ed.2d 1286 (1968); Tucker v. United States, 375 F.2d 363, 371 n.9 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 888, 88 S.Ct. 128, 19 L.Ed.2d 189 (1967); Hess v. United States, 254 F.2d 585, 588 (8th Cir. 1958); Smith v. United States, 236 F.2d 260, 267-268 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U.S. 909, 77 S.Ct. 148, 1 L.Ed.2d 118 (1956), <em>reh. denied, </em>353 U.S. 989, 77 S.Ct. 1280, 1 L.Ed.2d 1147 (1957); Bram v. United States, 226 F.2d 858, 863 (8th Cir. 1955); Hardy v. United States, 199 F.2d 704, 707 (8th Cir. 1952). We extensively discussed this exception in Hardy v. United States, <em>supra, </em>where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-6\">\u201c[I]t has repeatedly been held that the [exclusionary] rule will not be given application to exclude evidence which may incidentally .show arrest, incarceration or conviction for some other offense, but which has relevancy and competency otherwise, and which the trial court responsibly deems a necessary or not inappropriate means in the particular situation of establishing some material fact or aspect of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1355-7\">and in Love v. United States, supra, 386 F.2d at 266, where we held :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-8\">\u201cEvidence of other criminal acts may, however, become relevant and admissible where such evidence tends to determine certain issues in the case tried.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1355-9\">The admissibility of such evidence is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>See </em>United States v. Lewis, 423 F.2d 457, 459 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 905, 91 S.Ct. 146, 27 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970) and cases cited therein. In Wakaksan v. United States, 367 F.2d 639, 645 (8th Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 994, 87 S.Ct. 1312, 18 L.Ed.2d 341 (1967), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-10\">\u201cUnless it is clear that the questioned evidence has no bearing upon any of the issues involved, this determination is left to the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">The evidence of Edwards\u2019 escape from federal custody was certainly a material fact in this case (made so by Edwards\u2019 original testimony), and there was no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in admitting it; especially since the only opportunity Edwards had to make the call in question and to meet with Brown was during this period of escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-12\">The Court properly instructed the jury that the evidence relating to escape was not evidence of the commission of the crime of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-13\">V. WILLFULNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-14\">Edwards claims that the evidence was insufficient to establish that his testimony in the Peyson trial was \u201cwillfully given.\u201d The government adduced evidence to the effect that Peyson was being tried for failing to appear and surrender himself to the U. S. Marshal as required by order of the United States District Court; that Edwards appeared as a witness therein and testified under oath that he had telephoned DePugh to convey information that a threat had been made on the life of Peyson by Henry Floyd Brown; and that Edwards had testified in the Peyson trial concerning the alleged meeting between Edwards and Henry Floyd Brown which was the basis for the phone call to DePugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>The Court in this ease instructed the jury that they must find that Edwards\u2019 testimony was false and was willfully given and further instructed the jury that \u201c[a]n act is done \u2018willfully\u2019 if done voluntarily and intentionally, and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">This Court has consistently held that \u201c[i]n a prosecution for perjury the government must prove the defendant knowingly and willfully made a false statement upon a material matter in a case in which the law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered before a competent tribunal.\u201d LaRocca v. United States, 337 F.2d 39, 43 (8th Cir. 1964). <em>Accord, </em>Blumenfield v. United States, 306 F.2d 892, 897 (8th Cir. 1962); Brown v. United States, 245 F.2d 549, 556 (8th Cir. 1957). The degree of proof required of the government to establish these elements has been defined as substantial evidence excluding every other hypothesis than that of guilt. LaRocca v. United States, <em>supra, </em>337 F.2d at 43; Blumenfield v. United States, <em>supra, </em>306 F.2d at 897; Brown v. United States, <em>supra, </em>245 F.2d at 556.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In order to meet its burden, the government did not have to retry the Peyson c\u00e1se. It only had to introduce sufficient evidence and testimony from that case to permit the jury to make a rational decision as to its falsity and its willfulness. <em>See </em>United States v. Letchos, 316 F.2d 481, 485 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 824, 84 S.Ct. 65, 11 L. Ed.2d 57 (1963). In determining whether the government met its burden, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, as the prevailing party in the trial. United States v. Whitney, 425 F.2d 169, 171 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>399 U.S. 935, 90 S.Ct. 2267, 26 L.Ed.2d 808 (1970); United States v. Wilson, 424 F.2d 997, 998 (8th Cir. 1970) (Per Curiam); United States v. May, 419 F.2d 553, 555 (8th Cir. 1969). We must also give the government the benefit of all inferences reasonably drawn from the proven facts. United States v. Kye, 411 F.2d 120, 121 (8th Cir. 1969), and cases cited therein. Having so done, we feel that the government met their burden. The record fully supports the jury\u2019s finding of willfulness under proper instructions by the. trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">\u25a0 VI. MATERIALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">Edwards\u2019 sixth point on appeal is that the record fails to support the materiality of his alleged false statement. Materiality in a case such as this must be determined by the court. Masinia v. United States, 296 F.2d 871, 874 (8th Cir. 1961); Dolan v. United States, 218 F.2d 454, 457 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>349 U.S. 923, 75 S.Ct. 665, 99 L.Ed. 1255 (1955). The governing criterion recognized by this Court concerning the materiality of false testimony is whether or not the perjurious statements impeded and hampered the course of the trial in the sense that they had a tendency to affect the ultimate decision of the jury. <em>See </em>LaRocca v. United States, <em>supra, </em>337 F.2d at 43. After reviewing the record of the Peyson trial (which was received in evidence in its entirety without objection for the purpose of permitting the Court to determine materiality), we agree with the trial court that Edwards\u2019 testimony was material. Edwards\u2019 testimony that Brown had intended to eliminate Peyson had a definite tendency to affect the issue of Peyson\u2019s willful failure to appear for trial, an issue which the jury had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>in decide to reach its ultimate decision the Peyson case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">VII. SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">Edwards claims that his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s case based upon alleged insufficiency of the evidence should have been sustained and that Edwards did not waive his right to allege this as error by introducing evidence in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">A review of the testimony adduced by the government in its case in chief convinces this Court that it was sufficient to sustain a conviction. The government established that Edwards testified under oath at the Peyson trial that he had personally spoken with Henry Floyd Brown near New Liberty, Indiana during late November 1967; that Edwards had known Henry Floyd Brown during imprisonment in Leavenworth, Kansas; that Edwards had been in Federal custody prior to November 9, 1967, and ever since November 12, 1967; that from November 9, 1967, to November 12, 1967, Edwards was in escape status near New Liberty, Indiana; and that, during the same period, Brown was in federal custody in Kansas. The transcript of the Peyson trial was introduced to establish materiality. This evidence, which was extensively corroborated, and all inferences drawn therefrom, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> establishes that Edwards could not have met with Brown as he testified at the Peyson trial and that his testimony at the Peyson trial was material and willfully false.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>however, that the motion should have been sustained, the law is well settled in this Circuit that an individual waives his objection to the court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal when he introduces evidence in his defense. Cline v. United States, 395 F.2d 138, 144 (8th Cir. 1968); Hiatt v. United States, 384 F.2d 675, 676 (8th Cir. 1967); <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 998, 88 S.Ct. 1203, 20 L.Ed.2d 97 (1968); Jaben v. United States, 349 F.2d 913, 916-917 (8th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">The fact that Edwards was proceeding <em>pro se </em>does not change the rule. Edwards refused to be represented by counsel and the Court still appointed counsel to assist him in his own defense. Under these circumstances, Edwards proceeded <em>pro se </em>at his own risk. Minor v. United States, 375 F.2d 170, 172 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 882, 88 S.Ct. 131, 19 L.Ed.2d 177 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1349-13\">.
