However, these employees do not allege that they protested such expenditures, or that they have demanded a pro rata refund or reduction in their dues. The alleged injury is the imposition on such employees of political and ideological conformity in violation of the first, fifth, ninth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution, the UAW\u2019s duty of fair representation, a duty implied under \u00a7 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u201cthe Act\u201d) and of an implied condition in the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jurisdiction is alleged under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 (\u00a7 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaint requested a declaratory judgment, monetary damages and injunctive relief. Upon defendants\u2019 separate motions to dismiss, District Judge Allen E. Barrow dismissed the action against the UAW on the ground that the preemption doctrine created exclusive jurisdiction to hear the matter in the National Labor Relations Board and dismissed the claim against McDonnell Douglas on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim against McDonnell Douglas for which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-17\">The plaintiff-employees here recognize that the Supreme Court in San Diego Building Trades Council, Millmen\u2019s Union, Local 2020 v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236, 79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775 (1959), held that whenever a party challenges union activity arguably protected by \u00a7 7 or prohibited by \u00a7 8 of the Act, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction requires \u201cfederal courts [to] defer to the exclusive competence\u201d of the NLRB. <em>Id. </em>at 245, 79 S.Ct. at 780. Plaintiffs contend, however, that their claim comes within one of the several exceptions to primary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-18\">The first exception invoked by the plaintiffs regards their claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u201c[t]he exaction of compulsory agency fee payments * * * abridges rights guaranteed to them under the First [and] Fifth Amendments * * * of the United States Constitution.\u201d Plaintiffs assert this claim is sufficient to bring them within the \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By their terms, the first and fifth amendments proscribe federal governmental action, not the actions of private persons. In International Association of Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740, 81 S. Ct. 1784, 6 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1961), the Supreme Court met this issue by relying on its analysis in Railway Employees Department v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225, 231-232, 76 S.Ct. 714, 100 L.Ed. 1112 (1956). In <em>Hanson, </em>Justice Douglas reasoned that the Railway Labor Act expressly superseded state laws prohibiting the union shop. Accordingly, contracts negotiated with a union shop provision necessarily carry the \u201cimprimatur of the federal law\u201d, the element which provides the required governmental action. Indeed one may argue further that the union shop is a device which Congress had decided to encourage in the railway industry by nullifying any state laws to the contrary. Union activity pursuant to such encouragement is thus within the traditional ambit of \u201cstate action\u201d analysis under the fourteenth amendment <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 a concept bearing close analogy to the federal governmental action required to invoke the first and fifth amendments. Whatever the wisdom of this reasoning for the Railway Labor Act, it has no applicability to the National Labor Relations Act. For in Retail Clerks International Association, Local 1625, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. Schermerhorn, 373 U.S. 746, 83 S.Ct. 1461, 10 L.Ed.2d 678 (1963), the Court held that the agency shop, authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8(a) (3) of the Act, is limited by \u00a7 14(b) of the Act, thus permitting the states to forbid it. Unlike the union shop in <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Allen, </em>the agreement here could be \u201cmade illegal [or] vitiated by * * * the laws of a State.\u201d <em>Hanson, supra, </em>351 U.S. at 232, 76 S.Ct. at 718. While the union shop provision in the Railway Labor Act is not compulsory in the sense that management and labor are not required to establish such a shop, the provision does give management and labor the right to bargain for a union shop and mandates that states not interfere with that right. This mandate is part of a most comprehensive regulatory scheme whose entire history has been one of very active governmental supervision and treatment. See <em>Street, supra, </em>367 U.S. at 750-764, 81 S.Ct. 1784. Moreover, the rail unions have been given extremely broad responsibilities for their union members beyond anything permitted or mandated under the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See e. g., </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 152, 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">By contrast, the policy with respect to union security agreements expressed in the NLRA is more neutral and permissive than the policy of the RLA. See the analysis of governmental action in Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U.S. 369, 373-381, 87 S.Ct. 1627, 18 L.Ed.2d 830 (1967); <em>cf. </em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961). In NLRA matters, the federal government does not appear to us to have so far insinuated itself into the decision of a union and employer to agree to a union security clause so as to make that choice governmental action for purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>first and fifth amendments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In Seay v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 427 F.2d 996 (9th Cir. 1970), the Ninth Circuit relied on <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Street </em>as demonstrating the existence in the federal courts of jurisdiction to hear the type of constitutional claim raised here. However, the <em>Seay </em>court did not consider the question of governmental action, and for the reasons stated above, we cannot agree that the rationale of the Railway Labor Act cases applies to the present controversy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Plaintiffs alleged in their brief on appeal that the NLRA is unconstitutional if its effect is to allow the UAW to spend the plaintiffs\u2019 dues on political purposes opposed by them. However, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint nowhere attacks the constitutionality of the Act on this or any other basis. If such an attack were made, it might well be insubstantial in light of National Labor Relations Board v. General Motors Corp., 373 U.S. 734, 83 S.Ct. 1453, 10 L.Ed.2d 670 (1963), which held the agency shop to be valid, and International Association of Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740, 81 S.Ct. 1784, 6 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1961), which held the RLA does <em>not </em>permit political expenditures by unions contrary to the philosophy of their members. Although the Supreme Court has not examined the NLRA in the context of the constitutionality of union political expenditures, it may be contended that the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Street </em>is applicable by analogy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">Plaintiffs next claim that the UAW has breached its duty of fair representation, thereby invoking the doctrine of Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967), to establish jurisdiction in the federal courts. As the exclusive bargaining representative for the employees here, the UAW does have the statutory duty to represent fairly all employees within the unit. Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, 345 U.S. 330, 73 S.Ct. 681, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953). Plaintiffs\u2019 claim on this theory is couched in terms of a breach of the UAW\u2019s \u201cfiduciary duty * -\u00ed\u00ed * to use [the plaintiffs\u2019 dues] for purposes reasonably necessary and germane to collective bargaining only\u201d and that expenditures for political \u201cdoctrines and candidates\u201d opposed by plaintiffs constitutes a violation of that fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A related jurisdictional claim of plaintiffs depends on finding a similar implied duty of fair representation in the collective bargaining agreement, thereby making possible a suit under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Again, the Ninth Circuit suggests that such an allegation is sufficient to invoke federal court jurisdiction. <em>Seay, supra, </em>427 F.2d at 1000-1001. Plaintiffs have cited no other cases where a union was held to violate its duty of fair represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>tation by its actions regarding an employee with respect to internal union matters as contrasted with its actions vis-a-vis the employer. In cases such as Brady v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 401 F.2d 87 (3rd Cir. 1968), and Cunningham v. Erie R. Co., 266 F.2d 411 (2d Cir. 1959), both cited by appellants, the employee had been dismissed by the employer upon the union\u2019s complaint for failure to pay dues. Yet, the plaintiffs here do allege that the UAW will cause McDonnell Douglas to discharge them if they do not pay the contractually required agency fees. Such allegation appears sufficient as a basis for denying a motion to dismiss a complaint seeking the declaratory judgment relief requested by the employees. On the present state of the record, we can do no more than conclude that jurisdiction of the District Court conceivably does exist under these theories to hear the claim of the employees against the union.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In the District Court, the UAW raised the defense of failure of the plaintiffs to exhaust either the available internal union remedies<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or the grievance procedures established under the contract.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, we cannot make any judgment with respect to this issue since it involves factual questions which the District Court has not resolved. In addition, the UAW suggested in the District Court that the case may be moot because the union has adopted internal machinery whereby dissident members or persons compelled to pay agency fees may secure a pro rata refund of dues spent for political purposes with which they disagree. This issue also presents controverted questions of fact \u2014 for example, whether plaintiffs, as non-union members, are entitled to use the UAW\u2019s claim procedures to secure rebates\u2014 which we cannot resolve on this appeal. In addition, there is a question whether the text of the UAW\u2019s refund provision in its constitution is properly before this Court since the provision was merely attached to UAW\u2019s suggestion to the District Court to dismiss the action as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The District Court dismissed the complaint against McDonnell Douglas for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted. Plaintiffs allege McDonnell Douglas will fire them if they fail to pay the agency fees.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> McDonnell Douglas replies that the Supreme Court has made clear in International Association of Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740, 81 S.Ct. 1784, 6 L. Ed.2d 1141 (1961) and Brotherhood of Railway and S. S. Clerks, etc. v. Allen, 373 U.S. 113, 83 S.Ct. 1158, 10 L.Ed.2d 235 (1963) that the possible violation of employees\u2019 rights is caused by the expenditure by the union, not the collection by the company, of dues paid under union security agreements. In <em>Street </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">\u201c * * * the union-shop agreement itself is not unlawful * * * The appellees therefore remain obliged, as a condition of continued employment, to make the payments to their respee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>tive unions called for by the agreement * * * [A]ppellees\u2019 grievance stems from the spending of their funds for purposes not authorized by the Act in the face of their objection, not from the enforcement of the union-shop agreement by the mere collection of funds. * * \" We think that an injunction restraining enforcement of the union-shop agreement is therefore plainly not a remedy appropriate to the violation of the Act\u2019s restrictions on expenditures.\u201d 367 U.S. at 771, 81 S.Ct. at 1801.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">But in <em>Allen, </em>while reiterating the above language, the Court expanded the appropriate remedies available to the dissenters to include not only an injunction against the union prohibiting the expenditure for objectionable purposes of that pro rata portion of total union political expense as is derived from dissenting employees, or a pro rata refund from the union of funds spent for objectionable purposes, but also \u201ca reduction of future such exactions [from dissenting employees] by the same proportion.\u201d 373 U.S. at 122, 83 S.Ct. at 1164. Although it is conceivable that the effectuation of the last alternative might require some injunctive relief against McDonnell Douglas, this possibility appears to be too remote to justify the reversal of the dismissal against McDonnell Douglas. The gravamen of the employees\u2019 complaint pertains to the conduct of UAW. Although an employer may sometimes be required to look behind the union\u2019s claim that an employee has failed to tender the requisite dues, Brady v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 401 F.2d 87, 99-101 (3rd Cir. 1968); James v. Marinship Corp., 25 Cal.2d 721, 155 P.2d 329 (1944), such situation is not contemplated by the complaint as it now stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court will be reversed as to the dismissal of UAW and affirmed as to the dismissal of McDonnell Douglas, in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-11\">. <em>See generally </em>The Agency Shop, Federal Law, and the Right to Work States, 71 Yale L.J. 330 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-13\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(a); <em>see </em>Ford Motor Co. v.

Plaintiffs later sought to amend their complaint to allege jurisdiction also under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337.
