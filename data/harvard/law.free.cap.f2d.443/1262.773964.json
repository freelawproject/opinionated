This action followed a denial by the Army\u2019s Conscientious Objection Review Board of his application for a discharge from the Army which he had filed on September 18, 1970 on the same ground. The district court held that there was no objective evidence upon which the Department of the Army could have based its denial and granted the relief requested. The principal issue on appeal is whether there was any \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for the Army\u2019s determination that petitioner\u2019s beliefs lacked the necessary sincerity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-4\">At a time when Lovallo faced draft induction he admittedly looked for an easy way out and when his attempt to join the Peace Corps failed, he enlisted in the Army as a bandsman because he considered it better to carry an instrument than a weapon. In March of 1969 he was assigned to the 26th Army Band, Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island where he expected to remain throughout the period of his enlistment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 5, 1970, however, he received notice that he was to be transferred to Korea. It was this order for reassignment and the circumstances which surrounded it that precipitated his application for discharge as a conscientious objector.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">In the application petitioner stated, \u201cMy condemnation of killing is a religious conviction based upon both formal and derived religious beliefs.\u201d He recounted his life-long instructions as a Roman Catholic, his study of philosophy at a university, and the influence of fellow members of the Army band from which his \u201cconscience assumed a new depth of commitment to beliefs that [he] had long before internalized\u201d as the sources from which his convictions derived. Petitioner explained that his ideas concerning the sanctity of life and his repugnance to participation in military operations did not mature until he received his orders to Korea and that ultimately it was this scheduled transfer that effected the fruition of his beliefs in the form of his application for discharge as a conscientious objector.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-11\">Following prescribed procedures,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the petitioner was interviewed on September 21, 1970 by Lt. Col. Lenk, Staff Chaplain, who found Lovallo \u201csincere in his belief,\u201d but as the Catholic Chaplain he was troubled because in Lovallo\u2019s personal statement he made reference to the commandment \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d as the eighth instead of the fifth commandment, an error which, the Chaplain said one \u201cversed in the Catholic faith would not make.\u201d The Chaplain added, \u201cThen, too, after reading the case, it is my opinion that Specialist Lovallo is not a Conscientious Objector in the strict sense of the word. I believe that Specialist Lovallo is sincere in his belief but the source of his belief may be questionable.\u201d On September 24, 1970 the petitioner was given a psychiatric examination by Captain Phillips who found him to be a \u201csincere sounding young man,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cpsyehiatrically cleared for any administration [sic] action deemed appropriate by command.\u201d That same day Lt. Col. McDonough, a hearing officer familiar with the policies and procedures relating to conscientious objector matters,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> interviewed the petitioner and reported that he was \u201csincere in his convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>On the following day, September 25, 1970, Personnel Clerk Kase submitted a sworn statement which described petitioner\u2019s displeasure when he was informed that he had been included among those assigned to Korea.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Lovallo was first advised that he was about to be transferred, he indicated that reassignment would cause him no personal difficulties; but Kase said, \u201cWhen I mentioned Korea his happy attitude changed completely. He got quite upset and he told me that he was informed by the company that he was going to Germany and I informed him that he was going to Korea and at no time was he ever on orders for Germany. He left my office in a very bitter and depressed mood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">To these reports petitioner\u2019s commanding officer, Chief Warrant Flores, added his recommendation that the application for discharge be denied. He based his recommendation upon two facts: first, that petitioner had not indicated his intention to apply for a discharge when he was asked on September 10th and 11th whether he would \u201cclear post\u201d on September 14, 1970, the date on which petitioner requested a seven-day delay of orders to compile his application ; and second, that although petitioner reported that his beliefs \u201ccrystallized\u201d on September 12, 1970, three letters supporting his application were written a day or two before that date. From this Flores concluded that Lovallo \u201cchose to mislead the undersigned * * * as to his intentions. * * * Therefore I consider Sp. 4 Lovallo\u2019s sincerity and integrity questionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">After reviewing the petitioner\u2019s file, Lt. Hall, Assistant Adjutant General at Fort Hamilton, recommended disapproval of the application and forwarded it on October 1, 1970, to the Army\u2019s Conscientious Objection Review Board. In an opinion dated November 9, 1970, the Board disapproved and rejected petitioner\u2019s application on the ground that Lovallo was not sincere. The Board placed great weight on the statement of Chief Warrant Flores; it also noted the report of Chaplain Lenk, and noted with interest the affidavit of Kase. The district court, however, found that none of the enumerated factual findings afforded a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for the Board\u2019s denial and granted the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-9\"> To be conscientiously opposed to participation in war implies by definition that the objector in fact entertains the belief to which he has given expression. United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 185, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965). Thus, although a claimant\u2019s statement may set forth a prima facie case for discharge, the military reviewing agency may determine that the claimant is not to be believed and deny his application on that basis. Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 381-382, 75 S.Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428 (1955); see Hansen, Judicial Review of In-Service Conscientious Objector Cases, 17 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 975, 998-999 (1970). Where the applicant has stated his beliefs with apparent sincerity and no adverse demeanor evidence has been introduced, the Conscientious Objection Review Board must predicate any finding of insincerity upon objective evidence affording a rational basis for the Board\u2019s refusal to accept the validity of the applicant\u2019s claims. Witmer v. United States, <em>supra; </em>United States v. James, 417 F.2d 826, 832 (4 Cir. 1969); Kessler v. United States, 406 F.2d 151, 156 (5 Cir. 1969). Absent such evidence, the military\u2019s administrative de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>termination lacks a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d and is, therefore, rendered in violation of its own directive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-4\">Applying this standard to the evidentiary materials before the Board, we agree with the district court that the statement of Chief Warrant Flores did not afford a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for the Board\u2019s denial. The fact that petitioner apparently requested letters supporting his application several days before disclosing his intention to Flores did not necessarily show a lack of integrity or demonstrate his insincerity. The regulations permitted Lovallo only seven days in which to compile his application; under the circumstances of the present case no more should be inferred from the fact that he began to acquire the requisite documentation three days before he reportedly made his ultimate decision than that he wanted to be prepared to act upon that decision when and if he made it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">Chaplain Lenk\u2019s concern over the petitioner\u2019s technical error in citing the numerical position of the particular commandment is not the kind of evidence that <em>\u201csubstantially </em>blurs the picture painted by the [applicant] and thus casts doubt on his sincerity.\u201d Kessler v. United States, <em>supra. </em>However, even though the Chaplain thought Lovallo was sincere he reported that his claimed beliefs had a questionable foundation and that he did not, strictly speaking, consider Lovallo a conscientious objector. The Board was not bound to conclude that the latter rested solely on the misnumbered commandment. A reading of the petitioner\u2019s application to the Board indicates that at some points he asserted a hostility to all wars and at others he espoused a doctrine of (differentiation between just and unjust wars and implied he would refuse only to engage in the latter. Likewise he at times expressed hostility to all use of force or violence; at other times he conceded that under certain, not very clearly delineated, circumstances some violence was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">There was evidence before the Board that Lovallo showed no objection to an assignment to Germany but objected strongly to being ordered to Korea. This taken together with his expressed belief in the right of an individual to differentiate between just and unjust wars furnished a sufficient factual basis for the Board to decide that Lovallo was claiming the right to pick and choose the war in which he would engage, based upon his belief in whether or not it was just. Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-9\">The district court erred in ruling that Kase\u2019s affidavit afforded no \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for the determination of insincerity. The Army could rationally infer from this account that petitioner\u2019s application was in large measure the product of his disappointment at being assigned to Korea rather than to Germany. The Army might justifiably have found that the anticipation of deployment as a bandsman to a less desirable duty station was not the kind of prospect that could legitimately bring to fruition a conscientious objection to participation in war.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-10\">The Board\u2019s opinion does, therefore, disclose a legally sufficient reason for its denial. That subjective determination was, in turn, predicated upon objective evidence affording a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for the Board\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-11\">The order of the district court is reversed and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1325-6\">.
