The sole issue presented for review is whether a misstatement of Connecticut law by a Connecticut trial court to a jury regarding provable elements of the crime charged, held by the Connecticut appellate courts to constitute nonreversible error, is a question of constitutional dimension thereby creating a substantial federal question cognizable by the federal courts under their habeas corpus jurisdiction.

The conviction was affirmed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court finding that \u201c[rleading this portion of the charge as well as the charge as a whole, it meets the test of correctness and adequacy and should be sustained.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On September 24, 1969, the Connecticut Supreme Court refused to certify the jury charge issue for appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Having exhausted his State remedies, Shaefer petitioned the United States District Court for a writ of habeas corpus on October 6, 1969, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The thrust of Schaefer\u2019s petition is that the trial court\u2019s assumed misinterpretation of the requirements of the applicable Connecticut statute in his charge to the jury (which is set forth in the margin),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in failing to include reference to criminal intent,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> resulted in Shaefer\u2019s allegedly unconstitutional conviction of a nonexistent crime, in violation of his rights under the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Although the challenged instruction concededly was objected to specifically and in timely fashion, and although \u201cmere possession\u201d is not one of the five sets of circumstances under which one can be found guilty of \u201cpool selling\u201d in Connecticut, we reverse because the District Court did not properly have jurisdiction over Shaefer\u2019s habeas corpus petition, as it had not raised any question of substantial constitutional significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">In justifying the existence of a fundamental question of constitutional significance, Schaefer and the District Court have relied on the authority of Cole v. Arkansas.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Cole, </em>the Supreme Court reversed convictions which had previously been affirmed by State appellate courts on the basis of a substantive statutory section completely different from that for the violation of which the defendants were charged, tried and convicted in the first instance. As this <em>precis </em>and the language of <em>Cole </em>itself indicate the issue there was one of reasonable notice to a defendant of the charge brought and a fair opportunity to prepare and present a defense thereto. No allegation of constitutionally inadequate notice is made here. Rather, Schaefer strongly urges us to uphold the District Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Cole </em>and asks us to disregard the facts (1) that he had fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>notice of the substantive charge against him, and (2) that he was afforded a full and fair trial thereon, followed by appellate review of the jury instruction question through Connecticut\u2019s highest court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Morissette v. United States,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> also relied upon by Schaefer and the District Court in attempting to demonstrate the \u201cfundamental unfairness\u201d of the State trial court\u2019s error of omission, is clearly distinguishable from the case at bar. <em>Morissette </em>was concerned not at all with any constitutional question, but solely with determining the import of Congressional omission of the requirement of guilty intent in a statutory offense. The Supreme Court in <em>Morissette </em>granted certiorari for the narrow purpose of reviewing a federal trial court\u2019s instruction with respect to the elements of a federal offense in its supervisory capacity over the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Upon the facts here presented, we hold that the legality of Schaefer's conviction was properly the exclusive province of the Connecticut courts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Were we to hold otherwise, the District Court\u2019s rationale would turn every disagreement by a federal district judge with a State court\u2019s interpretation of a State statute and their appraisal of a State trial court\u2019s instructions thereunder potentially into a question of \u201cfundamental due process.\u201d This result would impose an additional burden on our already overburdened federal courts and pose an unnecessary and undesirable threat of greatly increased federal intervention in cases involving the sufficiency of jury instruction and the construction of State law. Any such interpretation would be contrary to the proper role of historic federal habeas corpus jurisdiction, namely, not to serve as the basis for merely an additional appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-12\">\u201cHis [the trial judge\u2019s] action has been affirmed by the highest court of the Commonwealth. We are not at liberty to conjecture that the trial court acted under an interpretation of the state law different from that which we might adopt and then set up our own interpretation as a basis for declaring that due process has been denied. We cannot treat a mere error of state law, if one occurred, as a denial of due process; otherwise, every erroneous decision by a state court on state law would come here as a federal constitutional question.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Reversed.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\">.
