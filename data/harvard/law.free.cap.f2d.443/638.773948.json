Metzenbaum and Glenn; and in the American Independent Party (AIP) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> primary, Richard B. Kay, the petitioner here, who was unopposed <em>on the ballot. </em>In addition, in the AIP primary, one person who had <em>not </em>filed for the nomination as required by Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>statutes, and whose name would not be printed on the ballot, had declared himself as a \u201cwrite-in candidate\u201d under a permissible section of the Ohio election law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Prior to the date of the primary election a number of TV and radio stations in Ohio announced that they would sponsor two programs in the two weeks before election. One program was scheduled to be held on April 24th to which all candidates in the primary running for the nomination for United States Senator on the Democratic Party ticket were invited by the stations to appear. The second program was scheduled for May 2nd and all similar candidates on the Republican Party ticket were similarly invited to appear. No similar TV or radio program for the Senate candidates of the AIP Party was announced by any of the Ohio stations which had announced the programs for the candidates on the Democratic and Republican tickets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">When the invitations of the broadcasting stations to the Republican and Democratic Senate candidates became known to him, petitioner Kay on April 21, 1970 sent letters to a number of the TV and radio stations which were sponsoring the programs, or proposed to run the tapes of such programs, for the Democratic and Republican candidates and requested them to \u201cmake available to [him], before the primary election, <em>equal time </em>and use of the facilities of the various stations that are or will be involved.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioner asserted that his request was based upon \u201cthe Equal Time and Fairness Doctrines set forth in the United States Code.\u201d Petitioner received replies to his April 21st request from only a few stations and so on April 28th he sent a second letter in which he raised the fairness issue more sharply. Therein he pointed out that all the Democratic candidates on the April 24th programs expressed views which were opposed to his on the President\u2019s announced position on the My Lai court martials, which he termed \u201ca particular important issue of a controversial nature.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He also indicated that he was referring the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>to the FCC, and he did so by letter also dated April 28, 1970.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The FCC in a letter to petitioner dated July 15, 1970 ruled against his requests under \u201cthe equal opportunities\u201d provision of section 315 of the Communications Act, the fairness doctrine, and discrimination in news coverage. With respect to petitioner\u2019s claim under section 315, the FCC ruling stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">* * * * * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">The Commission has held that primary elections or conventions held by one party are to be considered separately from the primary elections or conventions of other parties. Therefore, \u201cequal opportunities\u201d need only be afforded legally qualified candidates for nomination for the same office in the same party\u2019s primary or nominating convention. The Commission believes that Congress, in enacting Section 315 of the Communications Act, intended to assure equality of broadcasting opportunities only to candidates competing with each other in the same contest. See Q &amp; A V3, Public Notice of April 27, 1966, \u201cUse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>of Broadcast Facilities by Candidates for Public Office,\u201d 31 F.R. 6660, 6669; Letter to Henry M. Johnson, Esq., Public Notice of October 22, 1948, (28055), 4 R.R. 886. Thus, if your opponent <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had been given free time on a broadcast facility, Section 315 would require that the station also afford you equal opportunities should you make a timely request, because you both would be competing candidates for the same office. However, since you were not a candidate for either the Democratic or Republican nomination for U. S. Senate, and since you have furnished no information to indicate that your write-in opponent \u201cused\u201d any broadcast facilities, Section 315 of the Communications Act is not applicable in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">* -X- * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">With respect to his claim under the fairness doctrine the FCC ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">The principal controversial issues of public importance involved in your complaint appear to have been the contests for the Republican and Democratic nominations for the United States Senator from Ohio and the issues surrounding these contests; i. e., which candidate would best represent the party whose nomination he was seeking. Since choices of spokesmen on these issues are within licensees\u2019 discretion, since you were not a candidate for either the Democratic or Republican nomination for Senator, and since you have not shown that the presentation of your view on the issues (as to choice of candidates to represent the Republican and Democratic parties) was necessary in order to achieve fairness during the coverage of the primary campaigns of the Democratic and Republican parties, it appears that the television and radio stations referred to in your complaint did not act unreasonably in their decisions to deny your requests for broadcast time under the fairness doctrine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-11\">With respect to issues regarding the Viet Nam War, the My Lai incident, and other such matters of public importance which may have been discussed by the Republican and Democratic candidates, you have not shown that any station in its overall programming has failed to present contrasting views on these issues. As indicated above, the methods of presenting these views are within the discretion of the licensees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">The FCC ruling also denied petitioner\u2019s claimed discrimination in news coverage <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> after noting the nature of the strong proof required for such showing and asserting \u201cYou have not supplied such information and, therefore, no Commission action is warranted at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">The only contention made by petitioner on this appeal is that the FCC ruling of July 15, 1970 violates section 315(a) of the Communications Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This statute, he asserts, is not ambiguous but is simple and straightforward. He particularly points to the words \u201ccandidate\u201d and \u201cpublic office,\u201d as used in the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>and argues that as such words are used in the statute \u201ca legally qualified <em>candidate </em>for any <em>public office\u201d </em>is not restricted to \u201cnominees\u201d for such office. Thus petitioner asserts that he, Governor Rhodes, Congressman Taft, Metzenbaum and Glenn were all candidates for the same ultimate office and must be dealt with accordingly under the statute and all be given \u201cequal opportunities * * * in the use of * * * broadcasting stations.\u201d If this is not done he points to the possibility that it would permit stations to give saturation publicity to the candidates of one party during a primary election campaign to the exclusion of candidates of other parties and that such primary publicity could be so great that it would determine the ultimate winner in the general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The Commission replies that its ruling was in accordance with the law, was reasonable and particularly that petitioner was not entitled under section 315(a) to broadcast time comparable to that afforded to candidates who were engaged in wholly separate and distinct primary contests of other parties. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Section 315(a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the Communications Act of 1934 was identical to section 18 of the Radio Act of 1927.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> One of the original purposes of the 1927 law, as stated in the congressional debates, was to prohibit radio stations from discriminating in favor of one candidate<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and to make certain that if radio time was allowed to one candidate that his opponent or opponents would also be allowed the same privilege.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-18\">When section 315 was enacted in 1934, Congress recognized that its provisions were merely general guidelines and that to enact a definitive statute to cover all circumstances would be too \u201cburdensome and too complicated.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Congress accordingly reenacted the provision contained in section 18 of the Radio Act of 1927 directing the Commission to \u201cmake rules and regulations to carry [the equal opportunities provision of section 315] into effect.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In the Communications Act Amendments of 1952 this provision was designated as subsection (c) of section 315.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is something more than the usual grant of authority incorporated in an act creating a commission and authorizing it to make ordinary rules and regulations, because the Commission as early as the Radio Act of 1927 already had authority to make regulations as it may deem necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Commission presently possesses the general power to \u201cmake such rules and regulations and prescribe such restrictions and conditions [as are] not inconsistent with law.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under such circumstances section 315(c) amounts to a congressional direction to the FCC to recognize the importance of this particular section of the statute and to prescribe separate rules and regulations to deal with the multitudinous situ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>ations that arise in applying it to all federal, state and local candidates for office throughout the nation. The Commission responded faithfully to this congressional mandate and on September 8, 1954 issued a Public Notice (FCC 54-1155) entitled \u201cUse of Broadcast Facilities by Candidates for Public Office\u201d in which was collected many of its principal determinations and rulings under section 315. This Public Notice was updated, revised and codified on October 6, 1958 <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and April 27, 1966.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">In 1959 the Congress reviewed the rulings made by the Commission under section 315, recognized the \u201cworkable knowledge\u201d possessed by the FCC to administer the general guidelines of the statute \u201cthrough rules and regulations and wherever possible by interpretations\u201d and confirmed the power in the Commission of \u201cfull flexibility and complete discretion to examine the facts in each complaint which may be filed with the Commission.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The Commission\u2019s July 15th ruling in petitioner\u2019s case conformed to its prior rulings in similar cases and to the rules and regulations issued in the currently effective Public Notice, previously referred to, which essentially decides the issue here through two questions and answers :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201cQ. If the station makes time available to candidates seeking the nomination of one party for a particular office, does section 315 require that it make equal time available to the candidates seeking the nomination of other parties for the same office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">\u201cA. No, the Commission had held that while both primary elections or nominating conventions and general elections are comprehended within the terms of section 315, the primary elections or conventions held by one party are to be considered separately from the primary elections or conventions of other parties, and, therefore, insofar as section 315 is concerned, \u2018equal opportunities\u2019 need only be afforded legally qualified candidates for nomination for the same office at the same party\u2019s primary or nominating convention. The station\u2019s actions in this regard, however, would be governed by the public interest standards encompassed within the \u2018fairness doctrine\u2019. (Letters to KWFT, Inc., Oct. 22, 1948, 4 R.R. 885; Socialist Labor Party of America, May 13, 1952, 11 R.R. 234; WCDL, Apr. 3, 1953; Senator Joseph S. Clark, Jan. 25 and April 13, 1962; telegram to Dr. Edward J. Leuddeke, Oct. 25, 1961; Letter to E. C. French, Oct. 28, 1964, 3 R.R.2d 811, Q. and A. V. 5; and In re WCBS-TY, Telegram of Oct. 29, 1965.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">\u201cQ. If the station makes time available to all candidates of one party for nomination for a particular office, including the successful candidate, may candidates of other parties in the general election demand an equal amount of time under section 315 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-12\">\u201cA. No. For the reason given above. (Letter to KWFT, Inc., Oct. 22, 1948, 4 R.R. 885.)\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4h\">Such Public Notice answers the question here posed in the negative. The gist of its ruling is that the appearance on the broadcast media, prior to a primary, of candidates of one party does not entitle the primary candidates of another party to \u201cequal opportunities\u201d under section 315(a) because in a primary election the candidates of each political party are running against each other for the party\u2019s nomination and not against candidates of other political parties. This has been the consistent ruling of the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>mission <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In ruling on petitioner\u2019s request it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">The Commission believes that Congress, in enacting Section 315 of the Communications Act, intended to assure equality of broadcasting opportunities only to candidates competing with each other <em>in the same contest.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In petitioner\u2019s attacks upon this interpretation he calls attention to the specific language of section 315(a) which refers to a \u201clegally qualified candidate\u201d for a \u201cpublic office\u201d and he claims that such terms do not recognize that candidates may be divided into two groups, <em>i. e., </em>those in a primary who are candidates for the nomination, and those after the primary who are more accurately termed nominees for the office. He stresses these two points to the extreme and concludes that the FCC is legislating by the interpretation it has placed on section 315 over the years. It is of course true that the power conferred by Congress on the FCC to \u201cprescribe appropriate rules and regulations\u201d is limited by the further direction that these must \u201ccarry out the provisions of [section <em>315].\u201d </em><footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, the Commission is not at liberty to depart from the fair intendment of the congressional act, as Congress made clear in the statute. But we do not consider that the Commission has overstepped its bounds, for there is a further statutory provision that petitioner\u2019s argument has not faced. We refer to the direction of the Act that the FCC \u201clicensee\u201d shall afford equal opportunities \u201cto all other <em>such </em>candidates for that office.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">As we interpret that provision it indicates that Congress did not intend to make equal time available to \u201call other * * * candidates for that office.\u201d If that had been the intent of Congress, it would not have used the word \u201csuch\u201d or it would have said \u201call other <em>legally qualified </em>candidates for that office.\u201d That Congress chose neither of these alternatives indicates to us that Congress intended by the language it did employ to direct a different result, to wit, to restrict the benefits of \u201cequal opportunities\u201d to <em>candidates of the same class or character </em>as the candidate or candidates who may have been permitted to use a broadcasting station in the first place. So construed, we conclude that those who are to be considered \u201csuch candidates\u201d in the multitudinous different circumstances that arise in all political contests throughout the nation is a proper matter for the rules, regulations and rulings of the Commission. We also decide that the Commission conformed to the direction of Congress when it published its Public Notices previously referred to<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and that its questions and answers set forth as Y3 and V4 of its Public Notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>April 27, 1966 properly dispose of the issues raised by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">While the issue is not completely free of all doubt, an added circumstance which has some persuasive weight is that Congress on two recent occasions has taken action to amend section 315 without making any change in the provisions which the Commission has interpreted so as to deny all claims similar to petitioner\u2019s in this case. And in 1959 when section 315 was amended to add the newscast provisions, Congress fully reviewed</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">the Commission\u2019s-rulings under the section, including its definition of \u201clegally qualified candidate\u201d and its rulings with respect to candidates in the primary of one party requesting equal time because broadcast facilities have been furnished to candidates in the primary of other parties.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Congress, of course, is not required to act each time a statute is interpreted erroneously<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and legislative silence in the face of such interpretation is not necessarily equivalent to legislative approval.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> However, a consistent administrative interpretation of a statute, shown clearly to have been brought to the attention of Congress and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>changed by it, is almost conclusive evidence that the interpretation has congressional approval.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">It is clear that petitioner was not contesting in the primary for the nomination against either the Republican or Democratic candidates. His contest for the nomination was only in the AIP primary where he was unopposed <em>on the ballot,</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and petitioner won the nomination overwhelmingly by a vote of 3,867 to 24. So, since petitioner ran in a separate primary race and received substantially all the votes cast, he has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced in his race for the AIP nomination by the time afforded those Senate candidates having opposition in the other two parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Petitioner also contends, as previously noted, that the Commission\u2019s ruling in his case would permit broadcasting stations to give extensive free time amounting to saturation publicity only to candidates of one party during the campaign in the primary and then to refuse any time to any candidates in the general election. Under such circumstances it is argued, and we believe justifiably so, that the amount of free time afforded in the primary could determine the winner in the general election. To this argument the Commission replies that this could not be done (if the matter were called to their attention) because under the Communications Act broadcast stations are required \u201cto operate in the public interest\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and \u201cto devote a reasonable percentage of their broadcast time to the presentation of news and programs devoted to the consideration and discussion of public issues.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This involves the fairness doctrine which requires stations (1) to make \u201creasonable provision for the discussion of controversial issues of public importance\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and (2) in doing so \u201cto operate on a basis of overall fairness.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The Commission brief further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-11\">Were a station to afford extensive time to candidates in one primary race and give little or no coverage of other races involving ultimately the same office, or having given extensive coverage to one party\u2019s primary race, a station did not cover the general election campaign involving the same race, a serious question would arise under the fairness doctrine as to the licensee\u2019s performance as a public trustee. See Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. F.C.C., 123 U.S. App.D.C. 328, 359 F.2d 994 (1966). There is thus no merit to petitioner\u2019s contention that the Commission\u2019s ruling opens the way to this kind of program imbalance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>We have set forth the above statement because we consider it to be a fair interpretation of the law and one with which we concur and which, considering its source, may be relied upon by candidates who may be aggrieved in this manner in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">We have also considered the 1969 amendments to the Ohio Election Code which allowed any voter, regardless of prior party affiliation, to vote in 1970 in the AIP primary,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> but we consider that this does not alter our conclusion. All states provide some means for voters to switch from one party to another though the rapidity, timing and method with which this may be accomplished varies greatly with the states. In primary elections some states limit the eligible voters to registered party members and provide different means whereby a voter may change his party. Other states permit one to announce his party to the judges at the time of the party primary. Still others go so far as to permit any voter to vote in any party primary at any time without regard to past or present announced party affiliation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> So, considering that all Members of Congress are necessarily thoroughly familiar with the election laws of their states, competition among parties for votes in the primaries must have been thoroughly in the mind of Congress when it enacted section 315 and on those subsequent occasions when it reviewed the Commission\u2019s rulings under section 315 and considered amendments to it. It is thus not without significance in the context of the issues raised here that Congress in section 315 has elected to limit \u201cequal opportunities\u201d to <em>individual candidates </em>and not to confer a corresponding right upon political parties or other organizations or individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">It is accordingly our conclusion that the Commission ruled correctly on petitioner\u2019s complaint. We also note that petitioner, having been successful in obtaining the nomination he was seeking by a vote of 3,867 to 24 for his opponent, has not in that or any other respect demonstrated any prejudice which, if it had resulted, should under ordinary circumstances have been corrected in the primary which has now passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\">. <em>Candidates for public office; facilities; rules</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">(a) If any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station: <em>Provided, </em>That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provisions of this section.

AVhen the 86th Congress was considering Public Law 86-274, 73 Stat. 557, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., Sept. 14, 1959, the House committee fully reviewed the definition of a \u201clegally qualified candidate\u201d as promulgated in the rules and regulations of the Commission. This rule made a distinction between candidates for the nomination in the primary and candidates in the general election who may have been nominated by primary or convention. The relevant part of the FCC definition provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\"><em>\u201cBroadcasts by candidates for public office </em>\u2014 -(a) <em>Definitions:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">A \u2018legally qualified candidate\u2019 means any person who has publicly announced that he is a candidate for nomination by a convention of a political party or for nomination or election in a primary, special, or general election, municipal, county, state or national. * * * \u201d H.R.Rep.No. 802, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 7, to accompany H.R. 7985.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">The same committee report printed in extenso as an appendix to its report the entire text of the Public Notice entitled \u201cUse of Broadcast Facilities by Candidates for Public Office,\u201d <em>supra </em>note 23, and in the body of the report set out the Commission\u2019s two questions and answers that are above set forth in this opinion at page 13. Thus, Congress was fully informed of the Commission\u2019s regulations and its rulings thereunder which are here challenged. Thereafter Congress amended \u00a7 315(a) without in any way altering any provision thereof which would have indicated any dissatisfaction with the rules, regulations or rulings of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">A somewhat similar situation has just transpired in which Congress sought to amend \u00a7 315(a) so as to except candidates for President and Vice President from the \u201cequal opportunities\u201d provisions and to limit the sums certain candidates for major elective office could expend for the use of broadcasting stations in primary and general elections. Petitioner here appeared before the House committee considering this bill on June 3, 1970 in support .of having the bill include primary contests. In his appearance before the committee, he called the attention of the committee to the substance of the complaint that he here presents to this court. Hearings before the Subcommittee on Communications and Power of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Rep., 91st Cong., 2d Sess. on H.R. 13721, etc., and S. 3637, June 3, 1970, pp. 57-65. The bill which Congress ultimately passed (and the President vetoed) amended \u00a7 315(a) but made no change whatsoever in the \u201cequal opportunities\u201d provisions. Such action under such circumstances while not conclusive, carries some persuasion that Congress adopted the rules, regulations and rulings of the FCC on this point as being, in its opinion, a satisfactory interpretation of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b708-16\">.
