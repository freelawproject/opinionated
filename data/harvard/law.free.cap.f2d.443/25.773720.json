A public prosecutor is immune from liability under the Act except where the alleged wrongful conduct is \u201cclearly outside their jurisdiction,\u201d Bauers v. Heisel, 361 F.2d 581, 590 (3 Cir. 1966), cert. denied 386 U.S. 1021, 87 S.Ct. 1367, 18 L.Ed.2d 457 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">A generous reading of appellant's pro se pleading, couched largely in conclusory language,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> suggests that appellant presses a deprivation of the Sixth Amendment right to speedy trial because his prosecution was delayed beyond the statutory 180-day period provided in the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, N.J.Stat.Anno. 2A:159A-3, and a deprivation of due process based on an improper detainer lodged by the State of New Jersey with New York authorities at a time when appellant, although there in custody, had not \u201centered upon a term of imprisonment\u201d as provided in the Interstate Agreement. But there was no allegation that the role of appellee was not limited to processing the detainer and prosecuting the appellant. Accordingly, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was not beyond the scope of his jurisdiction so as to divest the cloak of official immunity. Bauers v. Heisel, supra; Kauffman v. Moss, 420 F.2d 1270 (3 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">The caption of these proceedings will be amended to delete \u201cUnited States of America ex rel.\u201d and the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-12\">. Negrich v. Hohn, 379 F.2d 213, 215 (3 Cir. 1966), requiring a Civil Rights Act complaint to state facts in support of its conclusion, holds that a complaint is insufficient when averments \u201care broad and conclusory.\u201d See also Fletcher v. Hook, 446 F.2d 14 (3 Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
