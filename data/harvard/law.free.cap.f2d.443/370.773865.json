Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b432-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b432-23\">This is an appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of the appellant\u2019s motion to vacate judgment and sentence in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-24\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that entry or attempted entry of a federally insured bank at a time when the bank\u2019s premises are unoccupied, does not as a matter of law constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-25\">The identical question was presented in United States v. Poindexter, 6th Cir. 1961, 293 F.2d 329, at 330, which held that \u201c[i]t makes no difference whether the offense is committed when the bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>is open for business or whether it is closed after banking hours. There is no merit to the claim that the bank was unoccupied.\u201d Following the <em>Poindexter </em>decision the Seventh Circuit in Williams v. United States, 7th Cir. 1962, 301 F.2d 276 at 277, pointed out that, \u201c[w]hereas, in the first paragraph of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(a) the attempt must be \u2018to take, from the person or presence of another\u2019 the second paragraph which was the part added in 1937, stands mute on this point.\u201d That court concluded that \u201cthe intent of Congress was to make any unlawful entry or attempted entry of a bank, regardless of its current state of habitation, a federal crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">We agree with the Sixth and Seventh Circuits that there is no merit to the appellant\u2019s contention. Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-13\">. Section 2113(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-14\"><em>\u201cBank robbery and incidental crimes </em>(a) Whoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any bank, or any savings and loan association; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-26\">Whoever enters or attempts to enter any bank, or any savings and loan association, or any building used in whole or in part as a bank, or as a savings and loan association, with intent to commit in such bank, or in such savings and loan association, or building, or part thereof, so used, any felony af\u2022fecting such bank or such savings and loan association and in violation of any statute of the United States, or any larceny\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-27\">Shall be fined not more than $5,-000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
