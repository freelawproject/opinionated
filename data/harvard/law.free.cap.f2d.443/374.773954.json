The appeal is from the order entered in this action by the District Court on the Mandate of the Court of Appeals and from the order of the District Court refusing to grant a further hearing premised on plaintiff-appellant\u2019s interpretation of this Court\u2019s opinion in the original appeal (Brunswick Corporation v. Howell W. Clements, Trustee, No. 19,689, 6 Cir., 424 F.2d 673). The District Court, in denying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>request for a hearing, held that appellant\u2019s interpretation of this Court\u2019s opinion was incorrect; raised questions not pertinent to the controlling issue; and that the opinion and mandate of this Court was clear. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The motion to dismiss filed by appellee is sustained and it is ordered that the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
