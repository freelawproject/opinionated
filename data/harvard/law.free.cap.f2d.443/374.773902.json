They have been consolidated for hearing and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">The orders required the company to rehire and grant back pay to three employees whom the Board found to be discharged because of union activities, in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (3) (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">The discharges were justified by company officials on the ground that each of the men had violated a general no solicitation rule by soliciting union memberships.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">From the evidence given before the Hearing Examiner and from the fact that each man had a prior good work record before the discharge, the Board inferred that the discharges were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-18\">On review of the evidentiary record, we find substantial support for the findings of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-19\">Additionally, in Case No. 20,454, petitioner contends that the union had not filed timely exceptions to the Trial Examiner\u2019s decision. On review of the record, we find no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-20\">The orders of the National Labor Relations Board will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
