Attaching two supporting affidavits, he alleged that his pleas were the result of a promise made to him by his attorney that he would only be sentenced to fifteen years on a count under which he had already served over four years and that he would only receive concurrent ten-year sentences on the other two counts. Crispo further alleged that the count under which he had served a partial sentence was transferred from the Eastern tp the Northern District of California in violation of Rule 20(a), Fed.R.Crim.P., which requires the written consent of the accused for such a transfer. We reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing on both allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">Ordered to show cause, the Government responded to Crispo\u2019s motion with two affidavits of its own. These contained representations by the U.S. Attorney in charge of Crispo\u2019s prosecution and by Crispo\u2019s attorney that nothing had ever been promised to Crispo. Apparently in sole reliance upon the affidavits before it, the District Court denied Crispo\u2019s motion, finding that no promise had been made and that Rule 20(a) was inapplicable because a new indictment was issued in the Northern District.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">Section 2255 requires the District Court to hold an evidentiary hearing unless the \u201cfiles and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d However, the affidavits on which the District Court placed sole reliance do not constitute the \u201cfiles and records\u201d contemplated by the statute. Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 494-495, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962); Doyle v. United States, 336 F.2d 640, 641 (9th Cir. 1964). Even a transcript of the arraignment and sentencing might not conclusively show that Crispo had not been promised a more lenient sentence. <em>See </em>United States v. Tweedy, 419 F.2d 192, 193 (9th Cir. 1969). Moreover, we cannot find from the record before us any indication that such a transcript was ever prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">The Government argues that the Court had discretion to place greater weight on the Government\u2019s affidavits than on Crispo\u2019s and could properly determine, without further inquiry, that Crispo had not been promised anything in exchange for his pleas. We reject this contention. That portion of <em>Machibroda, supra, </em>quoted by the Government to support this proposition (368 U.S. at 495-496, 82 S.Ct. 510) refers merely to the Court\u2019s discretion to hold a hearing in the petitioner\u2019s absence. The Court has no such discretion to resolve controlling factual disputes solely from conflicting <em>ex parte </em>affidavits. <em>See </em>Reed v. United States, 441 F.2d 569 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Cir. 1971); Christy v. United States, 437 F.2d 54 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">On the transfer issue, the record does not conclusively support the District Court\u2019s finding that a new indictment was returned in the Northern District. At best, the record is ambiguous. It is also subject to the interpretation that the indictment, No. 14860 in the Eastern District, was transferred to the Northern District on March 27, 1968 and simply renumbered as the latter Court\u2019s No. 42,000. The \u201cnew\u201d Northern District indictment employed the same cover sheet as did the \u201cold\u201d Eastern District indictment; the word \u201cEastern\u201d was simply lined through, the word \u201cNorthern\u201d written in, and, on it, a new number was stamped. While docket entries indicate a transfer to have been executed under the provisions of Rule 21(b), Fed.R.Crim.P., not Rule 20(a), the transfer order itself is silent as to the authority upon which it rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
