The evidence adduced at the hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>sufficient to establish that the search of the vehicle was incident to a valid arrest of Clark and that it was reasonable. Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">The district judge, having made a pretrial determination on the issue, was not obliged to again consider it during trial and before ruling upon Clark\u2019s objection to the introduction of evidence. Such is the import of Rule 41(e) F.R. Crim.P., and nothing appeared or was shown to avoid its application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Solomon v. United States, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 103, 408 F.2d 1306, 1309 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The hearing judge (who was not the trial judge) may have applied an erroneous test for probable cause; but his factual findings, when measured by the correct test [Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 102, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1959)] fully warrant our own independent legal conclusion that probable cause did exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">2. <em>The failure to instruct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Clark asserts that the trial court committed plain error [F.R.Crim.P.] 52(b) in failing to instruct the jury with respect to the possible application of the general smuggling statute \u2014 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 545 \u2014 it being his contention that the charge as laid in the indictment also included as a lesser offense a crime created by the smuggling statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-18\">We disagree. The essential elements of the section 545 crime include those which constituted the alleged 176a crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> True, section 545 is generic in scope, covering \u201cany merchandise,\u201d while 176a is limited, being restricted solely to marihuana. But marihuana is merchandise [United States v. Scott, 425 F.2d 55 (9th Cir. 1970)] and \u201c[a] lesser-included offense instruction is only proper where the charged greater offense requires the jury to find a disputed factual element which is not required for conviction of the lesser-included offense.\u201d Sansone v. United States, 380 U.S. 343, 350, 85 S.Ct. 1004, 1009, 13 L. Ed.2d 882 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-19\">3. <em>The sufficiency of evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"pAxf\">The government did not, as Clark contends, fail to meet its burden to prove that the marihuana discovered in Clark\u2019s automobile was imported into the United States \u201ccontrary to law\u201d and that Clark knew his automobile contained such marihuana. The record contains substantial evidence to support a factual conclusion on both issues favorable to a determination of Clark\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAfRg\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-8\">. It also appears that the officers had probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained contraband and hence to search it independent of any right to arrest Clark. Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970), citing with approval Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 158-159, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-10\">. Rule 41(e) F.R.Crim.P. \u201c * * * The motion [to suppress] shall be made before trial or hearing unless opportunity therefor did not exist or the defendant was not aware of the grounds for the motion, but the court in its discretion may entertain the motion at the trial or hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b883-11\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545 \u201c* * * Whoever * * * in any manner facilitates the transportation, [or] concealment * * * of such merchandise after importation, knowing the same to have been imported or brought into the United States contrary to law * * * \u201d shall be punished. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a \u201c* * * whoever * * * in any manner facilitates the transportation, [or] concealment * * * of such marihuana after being imported or brought in, knowing the same to have been imported or brought into the United States contrary to law * * * \u201d shall be punished.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b883-26\">. The government adduced considerable testimony tending to establish that the origin of this particular marihuana was Mexico. Thus there was evidence to permit an inference of its illegal importation. United States v. Avey, 428 F.2d 1159 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 903, 91 S.Ct. 140, 27 L.Ed.2d 139 (1970). And, on the issue of Clark\u2019s knowledge, there was evidence which was in all essential respects the same as that in Buelna-Mendoza v. United States, 435 F.2d 1386 (9th Cir. 1971), a case in which such evidence was held sufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
