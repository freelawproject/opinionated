An award of $290,000.00 was paid to the defendants. The plaintiffs brought suit alleging that the Parish of St. Andrew\u2019s was entitled to the benefit of the condemnation award. The court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, but gave leave to the plaintiffs to amend within twenty days \u201cif it is contended that a special, express trust was imposed as part of the original grant or in connection with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-19\">The order of the district court is not a final judgment and we therefore lack jurisdiction to hear the appeal. \u201cA dismissal of a complaint by the district court with leave to the plaintiff to amend is not a final decision.\u201d Atwater v. North American Coal Corp., 111 F.2d 125 (2d Cir. 1940); American Broadcasting Co. v. Wahl Co., 121 F.2d 412, 413 (2d Cir. 1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Plaintiffs have expressed concern at what they consider to be an unwarranted limitation on the type of amendment to the complaint which will be allowed by the district court. We dismiss the appeal without prejudice to plaintiffs\u2019 filing, within 20 days from the date of this decision, an amended complaint without prior limitation on the manner in which the complaint is to be amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
