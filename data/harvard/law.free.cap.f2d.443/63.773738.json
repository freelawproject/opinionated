After trial to the court and conviction, he appealed and this court in United States v. Cepelis, 426 F.2d 134 (9th Cir. 1970) remanded for further proceedings. We asked the trial court to make clear by special findings whether it relied on the statutory presumption of illegal importation for one in possession of marijuana or upon admissions or other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Upon resubmission to the district court, the trial judge reviewed the transcript, announced that he relied solely on the evidence introduced at the trial in finding that the hashish was illegally imported and that the defendant knew it, and that the presumption of illegal importation and knowledge found in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a was in no way relied upon. Upon this second appeal we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">The procedure followed was affirmed in our recent case of United States v. Andrews (Sloan), 439 F.2d 155 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">The judgment is affirmed and the mandate will issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
