This registration is of the word \u201cforemost\u201d in decorative type for whiskey. The board denied the petition to cancel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>The opposition and cancellation were brought by Foremost Dairies, Inc., now by merger Foremost-McKesson, Inc., Dairies having merged during these proceedings with McKesson and Robbins, Inc. The basis of the opposition and petition is appellant\u2019s use and registration of FOREMOST for various dairy products and related food and beverage items. Both parties took testimony and developed a record of over 500 printed pages with many exhibits. It appears that both parties have been concurrently using FOREMOST on their respective goods and services over a long period and on a large scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">The board unanimously adopted an extensive and very thorough opinion in support of its decisions which we find, on review, enjoys very substantial support in the record and contains no clear error. We have given careful consideration to all of appellant\u2019s arguments in its brief and to appellee\u2019s replies thereto. We agree with appellee\u2019s statement that \u201cThe entire thrust of DAIRIES\u2019 appeal is that the Board exercised a wrong judgment, rather than that it erred about the law or the important facts.\u201d What we said in Witco Chemical Co. v. Whitfield Chemical Co., 418 F.2d 1403, 57 CCPA 804 (1969), applies equally here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1254-5\">It is, after all, a matter of judgment and appellant\u2019s position is, fundamentally, that the board exercised a wrong judgment, not that it was in any way mistaken about the law or the important facts. We are not disposed to overturn the unanimous judgment of the board in a case such as this one where judgments may differ but in which it appears to have done a careful job and where there is substantial support in the record for what it has done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">The decisions of the board in the opposition and the cancellation are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
