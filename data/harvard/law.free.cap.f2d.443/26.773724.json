Our independent examination of the record leads us to the same conclusions. White v. United States, 354 F.2d 22 (9th Cir. 1965), resolves many of the issues against appellant. Our facts do not fit Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967), appellant\u2019s main case. The reporter\u2019s transcript of the March, 1963, proceedings clearly supports the lower court\u2019s findings on the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">Implicit in the decision on White\u2019s previous appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a conclusion that he was not entitled to counsel at the <em>time of signing </em>the \u201cConsent to Transfer\u201d under Rule 20, F.R.Crim.P. This conclusion is warranted by Meyer v. United States, 424 F.2d 1181, 1192 (8th Cir. 1970); Roeth v. United States, 417 F.2d 94 (5th Cir. 1969); Nanney v. United States, 301 F.2d 57 (10th Cir. 1962). Appellant\u2019s reliance on Rini v. Katzenbach, 403 F.2d 697 (7th Cir. 1968) is completely misplaced. In <em>Rini, </em>the accused actually entered a plea of guilty while under the belief he was not entitled to an attorney. He was never advised of his right to an attorney before entry of his guilty plea. Here, prior to the entry of the plea of guilty, appellant was advised of his right to counsel and that counsel would be appointed for him if he was indigent. He declined the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-23\">. 354 F.2d 22, 23 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
