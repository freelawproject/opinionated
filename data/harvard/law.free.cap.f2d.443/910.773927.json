On appeal he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that he drove the car described in the indictment because the Government\u2019s ease at trial indicated that the \u201cengine number\u201d and \u201ctrue vehicle identification number\u201d was 288503.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-18\">The contention is without merit. At trial the Government proved that a car was stolen in Los Angeles, that appellant drove a car matching the physical description of the stolen vehicle from Los Angeles to Las Vegas; and that appellant described to a passenger the exact circumstances surrounding his theft of the vehicle. Hence, even absent the evidence concerning the numbers, there was sufficient evidence to permit the case to go to the jury. Moreover, the insignificant difference between the two numbers simply raised a question for the jury as to identity, not one of sufficiency. Morandy v. United States (9 Cir. 1948) 170 F.2d 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-19\">Appellant\u2019s remaining contentions\u2014 that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial and that the district court prejudicially commented on the evidence \u2014 -both raised for the first time on appeal, are likewise without merit. 0</p>\n<p id=\"b972-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
