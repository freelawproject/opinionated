Appellant filed a response to the motion to dismiss, declined to discuss the merits of the appeal and instead indicated that he preferred to discuss these questions in his brief, which was scheduled to be filed on May 10, 1971. We determined to suspend consideration of the matters presented pending the filing of appellant\u2019s brief. The brief was filed on May 10, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-24\">Having considered appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, appellant\u2019s response to the motion and appellant\u2019s brief, we conclude that this case is controlled by our decision in Hodgin v. No-land, 435 F.2d 859 (4 Cir. 1970). Appellant worked for the City of Roanoke, and the city charter gives appellee, as the city manager, the \u201cpower to discipline and remove\u201d any city employee. Thus, as in Hodgin, the appellant in the instant case was employed at the will and pleasure of the city and thus was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>subject to dismissal so long as it was not in retribution for an exercise of some constitutionally protected right. The district court, 322 F.Supp. 236 was clearly correct in relying upon <em>Hodgin </em>in dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">We dispense with oral argument, the judgment below is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
