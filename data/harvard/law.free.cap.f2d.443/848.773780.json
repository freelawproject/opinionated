BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b911-18\">Once again we are confronted with a perplexing question of State law that resists satisfactory resolution by this Court alone. At issue is the construction under Florida law of a Family Automobile Liability Insurance policy and the scope of its coverage. Existing State decisions cast little <em>Erie </em>light. Believing that here we are blessed with no greater prescience after absorbing Erie-FIorida law than before, and following our oft-established practice<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of declining to accept our own judicial hypotheses when State decisional certainty is within legitimate reach, we accordingly certify the question in the attached appendix to the Supreme Court of Florida for its authoritative resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-19\">We could, of course, pre-guess the Florida courts and dispose of this controversy immediately, as we often have to do in diversity cases, by trying to divine what the State law will be though the markers are nonexistent or indistinct. But our duty is not merely to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>cide eases, as though there is some virtue in the travail of a decision <em>now </em>which turns out a moment later to be wrong.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our goal ought to be to decide them rationally and (we hope) correctly, so as to achieve results roughly paralleling those that would have been reached by the State courts had they heard the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The idea that there are State Courts and that they may, and sometimes must, be used has received much recent favor <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014even in the field of federal constitutional claims on which the federal judiciary has the last say, if not the last word. To take full advantage of this remarkable Florida judicial tool is in keeping with this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Following our preferred practice of having the parties participate directly in the preparation of the certified question and supporting statement,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> counsel for the contestants have done an admirable job in formulating an agreed statement of the issue for decision. The answer will resolve the question finally and decisively, relieving us of the burden of camouflaging intuitive hunches about Florida law as more precedent-based pronouncements. When the uncertainty of the principles presented primarily involves state policy choices in the process of interpretation on our part, and when alternatives such as certification are available, we need not be content with <em>Erie </em>shots in the dark at the shifting and oft-times illusory target of State law as a basis for disposing of the controversy here and now.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Certificate from the United States Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agh\">of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to the Supreme Court of Florida, pursuant to \u00a7 25.031, Florida Statutes 1959, and Rule 4.61, Florida Appellate Rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">To the Supreme Court of Florida and the Honorable Justices thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-12\">It appears to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the above-styled case in this Court involves a question or proposition of the law of the State of Florida which is determinative of the cause, and there appear to be no clear, controlling precedents in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Florida. The Court hereby certifies the following question of law to the Supreme Court of Florida for instructions concerning said question of law, based on the facts recited herein, pursuant to \u00a7 25.031, Florida Statutes 1959, F.S.A., and Rule 4.61, Florida Appellate Rules, as follows:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">STATEMENT OF CASE AND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AW6\">1. <em>Introduction </em>\u2014 The parties stipulate to the following statement of case and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>facts. The parties will alternately be referred to herein as they stand on appeal and as follows: plaintiff /garnishor/appellant, as Boyd; and garnishee/appellee/insurer, as U.S.F. <em>&amp; </em>G. U.S.F. &amp; G.\u2019s alleged insureds, Charles M. Bowman and Amelia Bowman, will be referred to as Husband and Wife respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">2. <em>Statement of Case </em>\u2014 Boyd sued Husband and Wife in the the Dade County Circuit Court for personal injuries sustained in an automobile accident. That case was settled by entry of a stipulated judgment in favor of Boyd in the amount of $50,000.00. Wife\u2019s insurance carrier, Western Casualty &amp; Surety Company, paid its policy limits of $10,-000.00 against the judgment, and Husband and Wife personally paid $1,500.00. Boyd then brought garnishment proceedings against Husband\u2019s carrier, U.S.F. &amp; G\u201e seeking $38,500.00. U.S.F. &amp; G. caused the garnishment proceeding to be removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on grounds of diversity and amount in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Boyd\u2019s petition to remand on the ground that the federal court had no jurisdiction of this proceeding was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">U.S.F. &amp; G. answered the writ admitting issuance of the policy to Husband, but denying coverage for the subject accident, and denying that the stipulated judgment was binding on U.S.F. &amp; G.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Pursuant to the trial court\u2019s order for pre-trial conference, the parties filed a pre-trial stipulation agreeing that \u201cthere are no disputed issues of fact\u201d and that the \u201ccase can be resolved by the court without trial on purely legal issues.\u201d A stipulation of facts was also filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">After some intermediate skirmishing, the trial court, 313 F.Supp. 579, granted the summary final judgment appealed in favor of U.S.F. &amp; G. The subject appeal followed in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">3. <em>Statement of Facts </em>\u2014 Boyd was a pedestrian when struck by a Pontiac automobile owned by Wife and operated by Husband. Boyd sued Husband and Wife in the Dade County Circuit Court, and they were defended by Western Casualty and Surety Company, the insurer of Wife\u2019s car. Husband was the owner of a Ford automobile, which was not involved in this accident, which Ford was insured, by U.S.F. &amp; G. U.S.F. &amp; G. denied coverage for the accident and refused to participate in the defense of the Boyd personal injury action. Thereafter, that ease was settled by agreement between the parties to said lawsuit, and their respective attorneys, by entry of a Final Judgment in the sum of $50,000.00. Payment on said judgment was made by Western Casualty in the sum of $10,-000.00, its full coverage; and personal payment was made by the Husband and Wife in the sum of $1,500.00. Thereafter, Boyd filed her garnishment directed to Husband\u2019s insurer, U.S.F. &amp; G., seeking payment of the unpaid portion of the judgment from his policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Prior to her marriage to Husband, Wife\u2019s name was Amelia Melvin, and she was the owner of an automobile upon which an automobile liability insurance policy was written with the Western Casualty and Surety Company. Husband and Wife were married on June 25, 1966, and since that time have resided together in the same household.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">At the time of the marriage, Husband was the owner of a 1965 Ford, which he had purchased new in July, 1965, and upon which an automobile liability insurance policy was written by U.S.F. &amp; G.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">After the marriage, Husband continued ownership and use of his vehicle, and the insurance coverage continued with U.S.F. &amp; G., with him as the named insured, including a renewal policy commencing July 1, 1967; and Wife continued ownership and use of her vehicle, and the insurance coverage continued with Western Casualty, with her as the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">On September 30, 1966, Wife traded in her automobile on the purchase of a new 1967 Pontiac automobile which was titled in her married name, and the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>surance continued with Western Casualty, and her use continued as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The automobile liability insurance on Wife\u2019s Pontiac was renewed by Western Casualty thereafter for the period of March 1, 1967 to March 1, 1968, under which policy she remained named insured, and which policy included her \u201cspouse\u201d as an insured. This policy had bodily injury liability coverage with limits of $10,000.00 for each person, and $20,000.00 for each occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Husband\u2019s insurer, U.S.F. &amp; G., renewed the coverage on his Ford automobile for the period of July 1, 1967 to July 1, 1968, and issued to him its Family Automobile Policy, under which policy Husband was the named insured, and which policy also provided coverage when Husband operated a \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobile. This policy had bodily injury liability coverage with limits of $50,000.00 for each person, and $100,-000.00 for each occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">In January, 1968, Husband and Wife decided to vacation in Florida. Their respective automobiles were operable, and they chose to drive from their home in Indiana to Florida in Wife\u2019s Pontiac. At the time of the collision with Boyd, Husband was driving wife\u2019s car, and Wife was a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Husband and Wife reported the accident to Wife\u2019s insurance agent, since her automobile was the one involved in the accident. Husband did not report the matter to his insurer, U.S.F. &amp; G., until he was served with a summons and complaint in the lawsuit filed by Boyd in the Circuit Court of Dade County, Florida, which pleadings he received by registered mail on September 23, 1968. They notified Western Casualty\u2019s agent of the suit, and Husband immediately reported the matter to Darrel Johnson, U.S.F. &amp; G.\u2019s agent in Albion, Indiana, in person, and requested U.S.F. &amp; G. to participate in the defense of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">Wife\u2019s insurer, Western Casualty, entered an appearance in said suit on behalf of Husband and Wife, and defended them in said lawsuit. U.S.F. &amp; G. neither appeared nor participated in the defense of the lawsuit, but took the position that its policy did not afford coverage to Husband when Husband was operating a vehicle titled in the name of his Wife, who resided with him, when such automobile was insured with another company.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Thereafter, Husband was notified that the suit had been set for trial in the two-week period commencing April 28, 1969, and Western Casualty\u2019s attorneys contacted Husband and Wife with regard to settlement discussions that had been commenced between them and the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">As the demand for settlement was in excess of the $10,000.00 coverage afforded under the Western Casualty policy, Husband and Wife retained Attorney William F. McNagney, Fort Wayne, Indiana, to represent their personal interests in this litigation. Mr. McNagney thereupon contacted Mr. Darrel Johnson, who again checked with U.S.F. &amp; G., and Johnson again confirmed denial of coverage. Mr. McNagney then sent U.S.F. &amp; G. a letter dated May 6, 1969, and obtained thereon said insurer\u2019s written agreement of the denial of coverage, which denial was also incorporated in U.S.F. <em>&amp; </em>G.\u2019s reply letter of May 7, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">With regard to these letters, Adjuster Robert E. Campbell had the authority to sign said letters; his signing\" said letters was within the scope and course of his employment; and his signing said letters was with the consent and approval of U.S.F. &amp; G.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">Thereafter, negotiations for settlement continued between the attorneys for the plaintiff, the attorneys for Western Casualty, and Husband and Wife\u2019s personal attorney, McNagney, which culminated in a settlement in the sum of $50,000.00, and a judgment being entered therefor. Payment toward this judgment was made by Western Casualty by payment of its full coverage of $10,000.00; and a personal payment was made by Husband and Wife in the sum of $1,500.00. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>The pertinent portions of Husband\u2019s U.S.F. &amp; G. policy are set out below:</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">\u201cPART I \u2014 LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"A6h\">\u201cCoverage A \u2014 Bodily Injury Liability;</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">\u201cCoverage B \u2014 Property Damage Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">To pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of:</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">A. bodily injury * * * sustained by any person;</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">****** arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the owned automobile or any non-owned automobile * *</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Persons Insured</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">The following are Insureds under Part I:</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">(a) with respect to the owned automobile,</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">(1) the Named Insured and any resident of the same household,</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">(2) any other person using such automobile with the permission of the Named Insured. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">(b) with respect to a non-owned automobile,</p>\n<p id=\"b915-19\">(1) the Named Insured,</p>\n<p id=\"b915-20\">(2) any relative * * *, provided his actual operation * * * is with the permission * * * of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-22\">******</p>\n<p id=\"Aa5\">Definitions</p>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">Under Part I:</p>\n<p id=\"b915-23\">\u2018Named Insured\u2019 means the individual named in Item 1 of the declarations and also includes his spouse, if a resident of the same household;</p>\n<p id=\"b915-24\">\u2018Insured\u2019 means a person * * * described under \u2018Persons Insured\u2019; \u2018relative\u2019 means a relative of the Named Insured who is a resident of the same household;</p>\n<p id=\"b915-25\">\u2018owned automobile\u2019 means</p>\n<p id=\"AC7\">(a) a private passenger * * * automobile described in this policy for which a specific premium charge indicates that coverage is afforded.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-26\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b915-27\">(c) a private passenger * * * automobile ownership of which is acquired by the Named Insured during the policy period, provided</p>\n<p id=\"b915-28\">(1) it replaces an owned automobile as defined in (a) above, or</p>\n<p id=\"b915-29\">(2) the Company insures all private passenger * * * automobiles owned by the Named Insured on the date of such acquisition and the Named Insured notifies the Company during the policy period or within 30 days after the date of such acquisition of his election to make this and no other policy issued by the Company applicable to such automobile, or</p>\n<p id=\"b915-32\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b915-33\">(d) a temporary substitute automobile;</p>\n<p id=\"b915-34\">\u2018temporary substitute automobile\u2019 means any automobile or trailer, not owned by the Named Insured, while temporarily used with the permission of the owner as a substitute for the owned automobile or trailer when withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction; \u2018non-owned automobile\u2019 means an automobile or trailer, not owned by or furnished for the regular use of either the Named Insured or any relative, other than a temporary substitute automobile.\u201d ******</p>\n<p id=\"b915-35\">The sole basis of the court\u2019s \u201cno-coverage\u201d finding was that the \u201cnon-owned\u201d provision excludes vehicles owned by the named insured and that Wife was a named insured under the policy; and this was bottomed upon \u201cthe intent of the parties\u201d to exclude coverage for those vehicles not specifically listed in the policy, but which were \u201cowned and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>regularly used by members of the family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">QUESTION TO BE CERTIFIED The parties agree that the following question is certified to the Supreme Court of Florida for decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-5\">Whether, under the Law of Florida, the subject family automobile insurance policy provides or excludes liability coverage for the specifically named insured husband while he is operating an unscheduled automobile owned by his resident-in-household spouse and insured by another carrier for a lesser amount.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The entire record in this ease, together with copies of the briefs of the parties in this Court, are transmitted herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">.
