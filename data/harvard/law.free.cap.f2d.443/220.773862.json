Hahn, Inc. (\u201cHahn\u201d) or Hahn\u2019s subcontractor Masonry Builders, Inc. (\u201cMasonry\u201d) with a strike in order to force these employers to assign to employees represented by respondents the tasks of assembling and dismantling scaffolding 14 feet or more in height. The Board found that all parties to this jurisdictional dispute had agreed to be bound by the determination of the National Joint Board for Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes, Building and Construction Industry (\u201cJoint Board\u201d). It accepted the Joint Board\u2019s decision without making an independent determination. Because we conclude that Masonry did not agree to be bound by the Joint Board\u2019s determination, we remand for a hearing under section 10(k) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (k).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">Hahn, a general contractor, subcontracted masonry work to Masonry. In 1968, a dispute arose over whether Masonry\u2019s scaffolding exceeding 14 feet in height should be erected and dismantled by Masonry\u2019s employees, who were represented by Laborers International Union of North America Local 585 (\u201cLaborers\u201d), or by members of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners Union (\u201cCarpenters\u201d). The Carpenters unilaterally submitted this dispute to the Joint Board. In 1969, the Joint Board awarded the work to the Carpenters. Thereafter, Hahn\u2019s general superintendent was informed by Masonry that the Laborers would perform the scaffolding work. The general superintendent then asked Espinoza, the field representative of the Southern California District Council of Laborers (\u201cCouncil of Laborers\u201d), what position the Laborers would take if Hahn removed the scaffolding from Masonry and assigned it to employees represented by the Carpenters. Espinoza replied that he \u201cwould remove all the Laborers from the job and file charges with the National Labor Relations Board * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">Section 10(k) of the Act requires the Board to determine which of two or more groups of employees is entitled to do certain work for an employer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>(NLRB v. Radio and Television Broadcast Engineers Union, Local 1212, IBEW (1961) 364 U.S. 573, 579, 81 S.Ct. 330, 5 L.Ed.2d 302.) However, if the parties agree upon a means for resolving the dispute, the Board must accept the voluntary settlement. (NLRB v. Local 825, Operating Engineers (3d Cir. 1969) 410 F.2d 5, 8-9, remanded on other grounds (1971) 400 U.S. 297, 91 S.Ct. 402, 27 L. Ed.2d 398; Iron Workers Local 25 (Pittsbuirgh Plate Glass Co.) (1959) 125 N.L.R.B. 1035, 1038; Lathers Local 2 (Acoustical Contractors Ass\u2019n) (1958) 119 N.L.R.B. 1345, 1351-54.) The threshold question is whether Masonry has agreed to accept the determination of the Joint Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">Hahn, a member of the Association of General Contractors (\u201cAGC\u201d), is bound by two collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the AGC with the Laborers and with the Carpenters. Both agreements require the submission of jurisdictional disputes to the Joint Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, the Laborers\u2019 agreement provides that the general contractor Hahn should require its subcontractors to observe the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Carpenters\u2019 agreement specifically requires the general contractor to bind his subcontractors to the decisions of the Joint Board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">Through its membership in the Mason Contractors Exchange of Southern Cali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>fornia, Inc., Masonry has a collective bargaining agreement with the Council of Laborers. This agreement mentions neither the settlement of jurisdictional disputes nor the Joint Board. Masonry does not have a collective bargaining agreement with the Carpenters. Masonry\u2019s subcontract with Hahn provides that Masonry will \u201c[cjomply with all terms and conditions of the Labor Agreement between the Association of General Contractors and the A.F. of L. Building &amp; Construction Trades Unions now in existence and any revision or extension thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The Board contends that the quoted clause in Masonry\u2019s subcontract is an agreement by Masonry to submit jurisdictional disputes to the Joint Board. The respondent unions reply that Masonry did not so agree: Masonry never signed a stipulation that it submitted to the Joint Board\u2019s authority, and Masonry refused to accept the Joint Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">As recently as 1965, the Joint Board\u2019s procedures bound only those contractors who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">\u201chave signed a stipulation setting forth that they are willing to be bound by the terms of the agreement establishing the Joint Board, or who are members of a signatory association of contractors with authority to bind its members, or who are parties to a collective-bargaining agreement providing for the settlement of jurisdictional disputes under the procedures herein set forth * * (Millwrights Local 1102 (Don Cartage Co.) (1966) 157 N.L.R.B. 10, 16 n. 6, remanded for determination of jurisdictional dispute sub nom. Quinn v. NLRB (D.C.Cir. 1966) 53 L.C. 11,156; <em>accord, </em>NLRB v. Local 825, Operating Engineers (3d Cir. 1964) 326 F.2d 213, 216; Cement Masons Local 694 (Edgar H. Hughes Co.) (1963) 144 N.L.R.B. 1358, 1362.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">Although the Laborers argue that Masonry did not sign a stipulation, they introduced no evidence that, as of the time the dispute in question arose, the Joint Board required a stipulation. Without this proof, we cannot infer that Masonry\u2019s failure to sign a stipulation precluded action by the Joint Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">The unions\u2019 contention that Masonry\u2019s rejection of the Joint Board\u2019s determination requires a section 10 (k) hearing is without merit. If the employer has agreed upon a voluntary means of settling the dispute, it cannot avoid an adverse decision by refusing to comply. To hold otherwise would condone breaches of the agreement and discourage voluntary settlements. (Ironworkers Local 708 (Armco Drainage &amp; Metal Products Co.) (1962) 137 N.L.R.B. 1753, 1757.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">Nevertheless, the clause in question is not without ambiguity. In Building &amp; Const. Trades Council v. NLRB (1964) 117 U.S.App.D.C. 239, 328 F.2d 540, the union argued that a similar clause in the prime contract<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> only required subcontractors to meet union standards in wages, hours, and working conditions. <em>(Id. </em>at 541.) In Construction, Production and Maintenance Laborers Union, Local 383 v. NLRB (9th Cir. 1963) 323 F.2d 422, the union picketed to secure a collective bargaining agreement with a general contractor. The agreement contained a similar clause <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> designed to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>vent the subcontracting of work to nonunion employers. Although Hahn\u2019s contract with the Laborers refers to the Joint Board, the Laborers\u2019 contract with Masonry omits any mention of jurisdictional disputes. The omission suggests that the Laborers do not regard the settlement of jurisdictional disputes as a compulsory term or condition of their collective bargaining agreements. Since the clause is subject to varying interpretations, we are not satisfied that Masonry and Hahn intended the clause to bind Masonry to the Joint Board\u2019s procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The Board has not provided us with persuasive authority for construing the disputed clause to require submission of jurisdictional disputes to the Joint Board. The trial examiner cited two cases supporting his finding that Masonry had agreed to be bound, while the Board cites three other cases. None helps to resolve this controversy. In both Iron Workers Local 25 (Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co.) (1959) 125 N.L.R.B. 1035, and in Local 825, Operating Engineers (Burns &amp; Roe, Inc.) (1967) 162 N.L.R.B. 1617, remanded for consideration of Board\u2019s order (1971) 400 U.S. 297, 91 S.Ct. 402, 27 L.Ed.2d 398, the subcontractor explicitly agreed to abide by the Joint Board\u2019s determination. In Carpenters Local 753 (Blount Bros. Corp.) (1969) 175 N.L.R.B. No. 81, 1969 CCH NLRB Dec. 26, 232, there was no evidence that the subcontractor had agreed to submit disputes to the Joint Board. In Electrical Workers Local 26 (McCloskey &amp; Co.) (1964) 147 N.L.R.B. 1498, the Board found that the employer bound itself to the Joint Board by submitting information and requesting that the Joint Board reconsider and clarify its decision. Masonry took no steps to affirm the Joint Board\u2019s assumption of authority. The Board found no agreed method of settling disputes in Local 2, Bricklayers (Decora, Inc.) (1965) 152 N. L.R.B. 278, because the dispute was intraunion and therefore beyond the Joint Board\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">We are not prepared to construe the clause to bind Masonry to each and every provision in Hahn\u2019s contract with the Laborers absent more persuasive reasons. To do so would negate several provisions in Masonry\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with the Laborers that are more favorable to Laborers than corresponding provisions in the Hahn contract. Because Masonry is not a signatory to any agreement clearly requiring submission of jurisdictional disputes to the Joint Board, we conclude that there was no agreed method for voluntary settlement of this dispute, and we remand the cause to the Board to resolve the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">We note that Espinoza\u2019s statement to Hahn can reasonably be interpreted as a threat to call a strike of the Laborers employed by Hahn and Masonry. The object of the strike would be to force Hahn to assign the disputed work to the Laborers. The Laborers argue that Hahn is not an employer within the meaning of section 8(b) (4) (ii) (D) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b) (4) (ii) (D), because the employees of the subcontractor Masonry are not controlled by Hahn. However, the threat entailed removal of all workers represented by the Laborers. Certain of these workers are employed by Hahn. The Act embraces their threat to strike Hahn in order to force Hahn to assign subcontracted work to Laborers. <em>(See </em>Local 450, International Union Operating Engineers v. Elliott (5th Cir. 1958) 256 F.2d 630, 635.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">The application of the Board for enforcement of its order is denied, and the cause is remanded for a hearing under section 10 (k) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (k), for further proceedings consistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-4\">.
