We have examined the record and conclude that it adequately supports the findings of fact incorporated in the district court\u2019s opinion denying the motion. In the circumstances of this case and for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion we hold that the challenged seizure was lawfully incidental to a valid arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-21\">We also have considered appellant\u2019s challenges to the indictment and to the sufficiency of the evidence, as well as his several contentions concerning the admissibility of evidence and the court\u2019s charge to the jury. In none of these matters do we find reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-22\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
