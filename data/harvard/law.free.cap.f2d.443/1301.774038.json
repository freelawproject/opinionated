Accordingly, after hearing argument in each case on a motion to dismiss raising that issue, we consolidated the motions for the purpose of decision. In the first case, Ruth Korn sues individually and as executrix of the estate of Ben Korn, for alleged violations of the federal securities acts, the New York State General Business Law, and the common law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants are Franchard Corporation, several of its officers and directors, and a related corporation. In the second case, Madeline Milberg similarly alleges violation of federal law and common law fraud against Western Pacific Railroad Company and Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc., as the publisher of Barron\u2019s Weekly. For reasons set forth below, in Korn v. Franchard Corp. we hold that the appeal may continue, and in Milberg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>v. Western Pacific R. R. we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">The gravamen of the complaint in <em>Korn </em>is that plaintiff and the members of the purported class purchased interests in 63 Wall Associates, a New York limited partnership, in reliance upon an allegedly misleading prospectus issued by defendants. The average investment of the over 1,000 class members was $5,000. Mrs. Korn and her husband purchased two \u201cunits\u201d at a cost of $10,-000, which have not been sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">In March 1970, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Walter R. Mansfield, J., conditionally granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for class suit designation under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c) (1). Pursuant to the court\u2019s ruling, 50 F.R.D. 57, a notice and \u201cProof of Claim\u201d was mailed to members of the prospective class. On the basis of the returns, defendants moved that the class suit designation be revoked. In October, Judge Mansfield held, CCH Fed.See.L. Rep. P2.845 at 90,167, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1365-8\">Now that we have received the additional information resulting from the notice to investors we do not believe that the number of claimants is sufficiently numerous to render impracticable their joinder as individual plaintiffs. Furthermore, we do not believe that plaintiffs\u2019 interests are typical of the proposed class or that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1365-9\">The judge also criticized the attorney for plaintiff,<footnotemark>1a</footnotemark> concluding that he \u201cwould not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed class.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90,169. Accordingly, on November 4, 1970, an order was entered withdrawing the class suit designation, and directing defendants to notify the investors that they could intervene as individual plaintiffs by filing a notice and pleading, with designation of counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff Korn appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-13\">The second case before us, Milberg v. Western Pacific, is based upon a May 19, 1969 article in Barron\u2019s Weekly, published by defendant Dow Jones, which contained what proved to be an overly optimistic prediction of what the current quarter net earnings of defendant Western Pacific would be. According to plaintiff Madeline Milberg: This false information influenced the general market climate; she purchased 65 shares of Western Pacific common stock at a cost of $2,299.38; and the value of her stock dropped precipitously when the actual earnings of Western Pacific turned out to be far below the estimate. Plaintiff\u2019s theory is that either Barron\u2019s or Western Pacific made the statement \u201cwith careless, reckless, and wanton disregard as to * * * truth or falsity.\u201d Plaintiff still owns her stock.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In March 1970, plaintiff commenced her action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In November, plaintiff moved for an order of class action designation, with the class defined as all persons who bought common stock of Western Pacific between May 19, 1969 and July 31, 1969 in reliance upon the Barron\u2019s article or the market climate induced thereby. Citing Dolgow v. Anderson, 43 F.R.D. 472 (E.D.N.Y.1968), Judge Croake denied the motion because plaintiff failed to \u201cmake a preliminary showing that there is a substantial possibility of success.\u201d 51 F.R.D. 280, 282. He viewed plaintiff\u2019s claim as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1365-15\">attempting to * * * establish a new rule of law to the effect that, when a financial publication prints an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>est\u00edmate of a company\u2019s earnings, the company must earn at least that amount or both the publication and the company will be held strictly liable for any loss in market value of the stock after the date when the estimate is printed. This would be a most unusual rule of law to say the least. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\"><em>Id. </em>From the order denying class suit designation this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">If the district judges in these cases had dismissed both the class suit allegations and the complaint itself, each judgment would clearly have been final and appealable as of right under 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1291. However, in each case the order under attack affected only the class suit aspect of the complaint and allowed the named plaintiff to continue to press her individual claim. The question whether an appeal may nevertheless be taken from such an order has been the subject of a number of opinions in this court. In Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 370 F.2d 119 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1035, 87 S.Ct. 1487, 18 L.Ed.2d 598 (1967), we denied a motion to dismiss an appeal from a district court order dismissing a class action, which alleged antitrust and securities act violations. In that case, plaintiff Eisen sued both for himself and on behalf of all odd-lot purchasers and sellers on the Exchange. Eisen\u2019s individual claim for damages amounted to only $70, and we noted, 370 F.2d at 120-21:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1366-7\">We can safely assume that no lawyer of competence is going to undertake this complex and costly ease to recover $70 for Mr. Eisen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1366-8\">* * * * X- X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1366-9\">Dismissal of the class action in the present case, however, will irreparably harm Eisen and all others similarly situated, for, as we have already noted, it will for all practical purposes terminate the litigation'. Where the effect of a district court\u2019s order, if not reviewed, is the death knell of the action, review should be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1366-11\">The appeal was allowed to continue, and we eventually reversed the district court order and directed an evidentiary hearing on the advisability of a class action. Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 391 F.2d 555 (2d Cir. 1968).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-12\">In Green v. Wolf Corp., 406 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 977, 89 S.Ct. 2131, 23 L.Ed.2d 766 (1969), the issue again arose in the context of a claimed federal securities act violation, which allegedly caused plaintiff Green and the members of the supposed class to pay too much for publicly traded securities. Green himself had purchased only 100 shares of stock at $10% a share for a total price of $1,-042.27 (including commissions). He alleged that the \u201cunmanipulated value\u201d of the stock was between $1 and $2%. We assumed that \u201cthe total damage to Green is thus less than $1,000.\u201d 406 F.2d at 295. On the issue of appealability we then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1366-13\">[T]he order striking the class action aspects of the complaint is appealable at this time, since if a class action is not permitted the litigation will very likely terminate without reaching the merits. * * * Green obviously does not intend to press what will probably be an enormously complex and expensive action to recover less than $1,000. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1366-14\">Since the question of appealability first arose during consideration of the full appeal on the merits, we went on to consider the propriety of the district court order striking the class action allegations. On that issue, we reversed the district court and held the case a proper one for class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-15\">In two more recent decisions, however, we dismissed appeals from orders refusing class suit designation. City of New York v. International Pipe &amp; Ceramics Corp., 410 F.2d 295 (2d Cir. 1969), was an antitrust action in which New York City alone alleged treble damages of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>over $1,560,000. Upon a motion to dismiss, we held that the \u201cdeath knell\u201d rule did not apply because the City and various intervenors had \u201cadequate resources to continue the action and with substantial amounts at stake will undoubtedly carry on.\u201d _ <em>Id. </em>at 299. We also noted that \u201csome 66 other actions,\u201d presumably similar, were pending. Accordingly, we granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">The issue came up again in Caceres v. International Air Transport Association, 422 F.2d 141 (2d Cir. 1970), which also involved antitrust claims. In that case, we pointed out that the average claim alleged was $150,000 per member of the class and agreed with the district court\u2019s conclusion that no claim was of \u201csuch a low order of magnitude that it would be unfeasible or uneconomic for the claimant to seek redress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144. Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal. Accord, Weingartner v. Union Oil Co., 431 F.2d 26 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1000, 91 S.Ct. 459, 27 L.Ed.2d 451 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-6\"> In <em>Caceres, </em>a little over a year ago, we reviewed the cases and underlying policies involved, and we see no need for further extended discussion of either. We adhere to the view: \u201cthat_absent the \u2018death knell\u2019 rationale relied on in <em>Eisen </em>\u2014 orders striking class suit allegations are not appealable\u201d as final orders under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. 422 F.2d at 143. Moreover, for the reasons stated in <em>Caceres, </em>we do not think that the doctrine should be too liberally applied. It is true that we there conceded that the arguments for a rule of broad appealability from refusals to designate a class are \u201cnot without force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See also Note, Interlocutory Appeals from Orders Striking Class Action Allegations, 70 Colum.L.Rev. 1292 (1970). But the logical end of such arguments is, as we noted in <em>Caceres, </em>\u201cthat an order refusing class action treatment *- * * should almost always be appealable.\u201d 422 F.2d at 143. This runs directly contrary to the policy of the final judgment rule embodied in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and the sound reasons for it, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1367-11\">an appellant\u2019s ultimate right of review upon an appeal from a final judgment in the action; * * * the potential for harassment of litigants by nuisance appeals, and the fact that any appeal tends to delay or deter trial or settlement of a lawsuit. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1367-12\">American Express Warehousing, Ltd. v. Transamerica Insurance Co., 380 F.2d 277, 280 (2d Cir. 1967). Moreover, the federal courts of appeals are now being overwhelmed by an unprecedented number of appeals,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which augurs ill for the speedy resolution of the rights of those complaining of eoncededly appealable judgments and lessens the time so badly needed for the consideration and decision of such cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It may be, as Judge Friendly indicates in his concurring opinion, that experience will show that the \u201cdeath-knell\u201d rule is not \u201ctruly workable,\u201d and that we may have to formulate a different rule that might also deal with attempts by defendants to appeal from class suit designations, an issue not now before us. We express no view as to these possibilities other than to say that at the present time we are not persuaded that we should reconsider our precedents and augment the onrushing tide of appeals. Cf. West v. Zurhorst, 425 F.2d 919 (2d Cir. 1970); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>Donlon Industries, Inc. v. Forte, 402 F.2d 935 (2d Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">Our lack of enthusiasm for generous appealability of orders refusing class suit designation implies no hostility to the changes in Rule 23, which we have characterized elsewhere as \u201cfar reaching and beneficial.\u201d <em>Caceres, supra, </em>422 F. 2d at 144. On the contrary, we believe that we can rely on the good judgment and discretion of the district judges to apply amended Rule 23 fairly and sensibly. There may be a few cases in which error will occur, but it should be remembered that many class suit requests will arise in a context in which preliminary injunctive relief may frequently be sought, e. g., civil rights or welfare cases. In such instances, an early appeal from the substantive ruling on the appropriateness of preliminary relief is available,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> at which time the appellate court may well choose to review the class suit ruling as well. Cf. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. Continental Record Co., 386 F.2d 426 (2d Cir. 1967); Hurwitz v. Directors Guild of America, Inc., 364 F.2d 67 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 971, 87 S.Ct. 508, 17 L.Ed.2d 435 (1966); Brunson v. Board of Trustees, 311 F.2d 107 (4th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 933, 83 S.Ct. 1538, 10 L.Ed.2d 690 (1963); 9 J. Moore, Federal Practice j[ 110.25[1] (2d ed. 1970). Moreover, in any case where a plaintiff simply cannot continue his law suit alone, the \u201cdeath knell\u201d doctrine will provide immediate review of a refusal of class suit designation. Short of that, at the present time we believe that we should allow the case to take its normal course in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-11\">Turning from these general principles \u2022 to the cases at hand, we believe we have no choice but to allow the appeal in <em>Korn. </em>Defendants argue that plaintiff valued her damages expansively in earlier stages of the litigation and this appears to be so. However, it seems undisputed that after plaintiff filed her action, the partnership property of 63 Wall Associates was sold, and distributions were made to investors. As a result, according to plaintiff\u2019s papers before us, the \u201cactual losses\u201d are now only $193 per unit, or a total of $386 for the two units involved. We do not see how this plaintiff can be treated differently on the issue of appealability from the plaintiff in <em>Green, </em>whose individual damages were greater. It is true that there are a few interveners here, see note 2 <em>supra, </em>but their per unit damage would be no greater.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are convinced that at this stage Mrs. Korn\u2019s action will go no further without class suit designation. Accordingly, we deny the motion to dismiss the appeal. We do not pass upon the merits of Judge Mansfield\u2019s order, since, as plaintiff points out to us, those issues have not been thoroughly briefed or argued by the parties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-12\">We reach a contrary conclusion in <em>Milberg. </em>While it is true that plaintiff Madeline Milberg\u2019s individual claim, according to her papers, is about $1,-000,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we refuse to look at her suit through blinders. The papers make clear that plaintiff\u2019s husband, who signed her complaint as attorney,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> has a claim for at least $7,500, so that the combined claim is at a minimum about $8,500. That figure is close enough to the fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>eral jurisdictional minimum for certain types of cases<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to suggest that it is sufficient incentive to keep a case alive. The $10,000 jurisdictional minimum impliedly recognizes that a plaintiff with damages close to that amount would find it worthwhile to litigate. Otherwise, the minimum would serve no purpose. Accordingly, we do not believe that the \u201cdeath knell\u201d doctrine is properly applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-4\">Plaintiff Milberg claims that the issues in the action are so complicated that no competent counsel would handle the case for her and her husband alone. While we agree that complexity of the case is a relevant factor in deciding whether to apply the death knell doctrine, we do not accept plaintiff\u2019s argument. For a securities act case, the factual issues seem remarkably simple, related to one statement published in Barron\u2019s. Plaintiff also suggests that we should allow review because there is a conflict in the districts over whether a party seeking class designation must make a preliminary showing of substantial probability of success. Compare Dolgow v. Anderson, 43 F.R.D. 472, 488, 501-503 (E.D.N.Y.1968),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> with Mersay v. First Republic Corp., 43 F.R.D. 465 (S.D.N.Y.1968); cf. Green v. Wolf Corp., <em>supra, </em>406 F.2d at 301-302 n.15. While we agree that the issue is significant, for reasons already given we do not consider it at this stage of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Motion to dismiss denied in <em>Korn; </em>motion to dismiss granted in <em>Milberg.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1364-19\">.
