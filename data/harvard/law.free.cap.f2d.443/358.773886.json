At issue is the validity of a Board-supervised election in which the Union won the right to represent Scovill\u2019s production and maintenance employees at its Wake Forest, North Carolina, plant. Scovill maintains that the election should have been set aside by the Board because the election atmosphere was tainted by Union misrepresentations of fact, physical and economic threats to Union opponents, and misconduct by the Board agent conducting the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-23\">We do not agree with these contentions. To the extent that factual misrepresentations were made, they either were minor and inconsequential or preceded the election date sufficiently to allow Scovill ample opportunity for rebuttal. The \u201cthreats\u201d were perhaps as restrained as could be hoped for in a close representation election with firm partisans on each side. The Board agent\u2019s conduct was unexceptionable in momentarily interrupting the election to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>trieve a missing page of the list of eligible voters. No irregularity resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Scovill\u2019s petition for review is dismissed; the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
