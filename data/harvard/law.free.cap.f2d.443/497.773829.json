According to the Government, it was Small and appellant who had committed the robbery on February 11, 1969.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Small\u2019s testimony was central to the Government\u2019s case, since appellant had allegedly worn a ski mask during the robbery and no other witness was able to place him at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">During Small\u2019s direct examination, the prosecutor alluded extensively to a written statement implicating appellant which Small had given to the FBI on January 18, 1970. Small referred to it several times. Upon inquiry by the Court following redirect examination, however, Small completely repudiated the statement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the statement was admitted into evidence at the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case in chief, and was submitted to the jury as substantive evidence of the facts asserted therein.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-21\">At trial, the Government urged the substantive use of Small\u2019s statement on the basis of California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970). In this Court, the Government has rightly abandoned its position that <em>Green </em>is controlling<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and has instead argued from a policy point of view: \u201cThe substantive use of a prior inconsistent statement was properly permitted because the dangers against which the hearsay rule is designed to protect are largely non-existent where the witness testifies at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-22\">The Government\u2019s view has received much support from scholars and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>commentators<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and is embodied in the new Proposed Federal Rules of Evidence at Rule 801.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The \u201corthodox\u201d majority view, however, is that \u201cprior self-contradictions are not to be treated as having any <em>substantive </em>or <em>independent testimonial value.\u201d </em><footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) As the Supreme Court observed in Bridges v. Wixon, supra, footnote 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">We may assume [prior inconsistent statements] would be admissible for pui'poses of impeachment. But they certainly would not be admissible in any criminal case as substantive evidence. (Citations omitted). So to hold would allow men to be convicted on <em>unsworn testimony </em>of witnesses \u2014 a practice which runs counter to the notions of fairness on which our legal system is founded. (Footnotes omitted ; emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">An exception to the orthodox rule has been carved out by the Second Circuit in United States v. DeSisto, 329 F.2d 929 (1964), in which Judge Friendly, observing that \u201cwe do not think the Supreme Court [in Bridges v. Wixon] meant to require rigid adherence to the much criticized orthodox rule in the situation here presented,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> allowed the substantive use of prior inconsistent <em>sworn testimony </em>before a grand jury or at a previous trial. While we express no view as to whether this circuit ought to adopt the exception in <em>DeSisto, </em>we note that the exception is a limited one. As Judge Friendly later observed in Taylor v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., 344 F.2d 281, 283 (2d Cir. 1965);</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-17\">We went no further [in DeSisto] because we entertained doubts both as to whether we could, see Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 153-154, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 89 L.Ed. 2013 * * * and as to whether, having in mind the ease of putting thoughts into the minds of prospective witnesses, we should.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-18\">This court had occasion to consider the substantive use of prior inconsistent statements in United States v. Schwartz, 390 F.2d 1 (3d Cir. 1968), a tax evasion case. The defendant Schwartz was counsel for the corporate taxpayer. The chief government witness was one Bregman, the corporation\u2019s president, who had previously been convicted and sentenced on the same charge. Two days prior to his sentencing, in an effort to obtain a light sentence, Bregman had submitted to the trial judge a statement placing the responsibility for the illegal acts upon Schwartz and disclaiming any personal knowledge thereof. At Schwartz\u2019 trial, however, Bregman seemed to indicate that either he or one of his corporate associates was to blame, and not Schwartz. After pleading surprise, the prosecution was allowed to introduce Bregman\u2019s prior statement, and the jury was permitted to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>it, as proof of the matters asserted therein. In its opinion denying defendant\u2019s post-trial motions,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the trial court reasoned that this procedure was proper under three principles \u201cunderlying the hearsay rule and the exceptions to that rule. * * * \u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark>, (1) the principle of necessity (Bregman was apparently very ill and was somewhat rambling, evasive, and contradictory in his testimony); (2) the availability of cross-examination; and (3) certain guarantees of trustworthiness surrounding the preparation of the statement (including the facts that (a) since it was prepared by Bregman\u2019s attorney, it must have been drafted carefully, (b) Bregman admitted on the stand that he would not knowingly sign a false statement, (c) the statement was signed by Bregman and (d) his attorney must have advised him of the penalties under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 for submitting a false statement to the Government).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">This court reversed. In addition to finding no adequate evidence of necessity in the record and an incomplete opportunity for cross-examination at trial, the court stated that the guarantees of trustworthiness cited by the trial court were \u201coutweighed by the circumstances that [the statement] was made almost seven years after the events therein, in an obvious effort to obtain a light sentence, was not under oath, and there was no opportunity for cross-examination [at the time the statement was made]<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After discussing <em>DeSisto, Taylor </em>and <em>Nuccio </em>at length, the court concluded that \u201c[e]ven if we agreed with DeSisto, which we do not decide, the circumstances here would not permit its application.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">In view of this court\u2019s holding in <em>Schwartz </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Bridges v. Wixon, we are compelled to hold that the admission of Small\u2019s statement to the jury as proof of the facts asserted therein was reversible error. Since Small was available for both direct and cross-examination, there could have been no showing of \u201cnecessity\u201d in the usual sense, i. e., the unavailability of the witness. Other than Small\u2019s having signed the statement, none of the guarantees of trustworthiness found in <em>Schwartz </em>are present. Small was not under oath at the time he gave the statement. He was presumably not aware of the penalties for submitting a false statement. He was probably motivated at least in part by the desire to obtain lenient treatment for himself and \u201cspread the blame\u201d for the crime. We therefore conclude, as did the court in <em>Schwartz, </em>that, whatever the merits of <em>DeSisto, </em>its rationale cannot be applied to the instant case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">Since there must be a new trial in this ease, we ought also to observe that the prosecutor\u2019s representation in his closing argument, unsupported by any evidence in the record, that appellant had been a \u201cfugitive for six weeks in California once he knew he was wanted for bank robbery\u201d was clearly error and was extremely prejudicial to the defense. Such a representation ought not to be made at appellant\u2019s second trial unless, of course, the Government introduces evidence in substantiation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">The judgment of the District Court will be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-6\">. Appellant was convicted on two counts charging violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113 (a), one count charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b), one charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) and one conspiracy count (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371). He was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment on the \u00a7 2113(d) count and five years, to be served concurrently with the fifteen year sentence, on the conspiracy count. Imposition of sentence on the other three counts was suspended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">. Two others had been indicted for their part in planning the robbery, while a third had been indicted for harboring Small and appellant following the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\">. \u201cBY THE COURT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">Q. * * * Now, will you please tell the Court and the jury whether this is a true statement or whether it isn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">A.

The Court charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-26\">\u201cThe reason I am sending that [statement] out with the jury, although Small himself was here, is because in my opinion his testimony was hazy and was not clear, so that if it is in conflict in any way with what in your opinion he said in the statement, then you will have to resolve in your own minds what you believe. Do you believe what he said in the statement or do you believe what he said on the stand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-27\">\u201c * * * That is why you will have the statement, and you should and will I am sure determine from his testimony and from his statement what you conclude to be the true facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b560-28\">. <em>Oreen </em>merely held that a state <em>may </em>(as California has done in Cal.Evid.Code, \u00a7 1235) adopt a rule allowing the admission of prior inconsistent statements for proof of the facts asserted therein without running afoul of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause.
