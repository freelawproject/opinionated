We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-25\">In his petition filed in the court below, appellant contended that his sentence had expired and that he is entitled to immediate release from custody. The record reflects that appellant was first convicted and sentenced on March 12, 1963, to a term of five years imprisonment. Subsequently, after pleading guilty to two counts of a later indictment, he was sentenced on January 16, 1964, to <em>consecutive </em>terms of five years on each count to run concurrently with the earlier five year sentence. Appellant was paroled on March 16, 1968, but was returned to federal custody on May 18, 1970, as a parole violator.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-28\">As the district court concluded, it is obvious from the facts alleged that appellant\u2019s sentence has not yet expired and he is clearly not entitled to immediate release. The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-29\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
