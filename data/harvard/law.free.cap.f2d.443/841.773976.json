The trial court reserved ruling on TWA\u2019s motion for directed verdict until after the case went to the jury and a verdict of $5,994.59 was awarded to Mrs. Woolf and nothing was awarded her husband. After the verdict was returned, the trial court granted the directed verdict and also TWA\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. and entered an order and judgment vacating the verdict of the jury and entering a judgment for TWA. The Woolfs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-29\">The first issue is whether there was sufficient evidence to justify sending the case to the jury. At the outset, it is noted that all parties agree that as a common carrier for hire, TWA owed a high duty of care to all its passengers. Several passenger safety cases are cited by appellants <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but the one most analo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>gous to the instant suit is Oklahoma Transportation Company v. Claiborn, 434 P.2d 299 (Okl.1967). Plaintiff there was a passenger on a bus and was injured when the vehicle \u201csuddenly swerved.\u201d In deciding what was necessary to make out a prima facie case of negligence against a carrier, the court said: \u201cwhen it is shown that a bus is swerved and slowed, or stopped, with such suddenness and violence as to be beyond the reasonable anticipation of a passenger, and to be the cause of injury to the passenger, a prima facie case of negligence of the carrier is presented.\u201d Oklahoma Transportation Company v. Claiborn, 434 P.2d at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">There is one significant fact that distinguishes Claiborn from the instant case. In that suit there was no conflict that the bus had suddenly slowed to avoid an accident, whereas in the instant suit the only person who recalls an \u201cincredible jolt\u201d or, indeed, any jolt at all, is Mrs. Woolf. Because the testimony does not show that the airplane made an unusual landing, appellants failed to make a prima facie case, and the trial court properly granted the motion for directed verdict and judgment n.o.v. We have said on numerous occasions that if the proof is so overwhelmingly preponderant in favor of movant as to permit no other rational conclusion, it is the duty of the trial court to direct a verdict or enter a judgment n.o.v. Ketchum v. Nall, 425 F.2d 242 (10th Cir. 1970); C. H. Codding &amp; Sons v. Armour &amp; Company, 404 F.2d 1 (10th Cir.1968); Martin K. Eby Construction Company v. Neely, 344 F.2d 482 (10th Cir.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The only other testimony which suggests that the landing was out of the ordinary was another passenger\u2019s statement that \u201cit was a hairy landing.\u201d However, his explanation was that a cross-wind caused the airplane to tilt a bit before landing, but that it leveled off and then landed. Nothing whatsoever implies that the impact upon touching down was anything but normal. Excluding Mrs. Woolf, seven persons testified at trial. Neither the pilot, the copilot nor the engineer remembered the landing as unusual. The other witnesses were passengers on the same flight, and none of them remembered a rough landing and most had no recollection of the landing at all. Our conclusion from the testimony is that Mrs. Woolf simply did not proffer evidence to support her allegation that there was an \u201cincredible jolt\u201d when the airplane landed. We can only conclude that the trial court properly granted appellee\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Appellants\u2019 second contention is that the court\u2019s instructions were proper and that judgment should have been entered for appellants. Having decided that the case should not have been submitted to the jury because the evidence so overwhelmingly preponderated in favor of TWA, we need not decide this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-22\">.
