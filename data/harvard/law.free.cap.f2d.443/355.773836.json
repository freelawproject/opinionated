App. \u00a7 462, refusing to submit to induction into the military service. On appeal, Farrell asserts numerous errors in his classification process. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-28\">1. <em>Refusal to Reopen to Consider C. O. Claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-29\">Farrell asserts that the local board\u2019s refusal to reopen his I-A classification to consider his conscientious objector claim was improper and a denial of due process. Farrell did not assert a claim of conscientious objector status until <em>after </em>his induction order had been mailed. Thus, the board was without authority to reopen Farrell\u2019s classification under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>crystallization of conscientious objector beliefs is not a change of status resulting from circumstances beyond Farrell\u2019s control. Ehlert v. United States (9 Cir. en banc 1970) 422 F.2d 332, aff\u2019d 402 U. S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">2. <em>Denial of II-S Classification.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Farrell asserts that the board improperly denied his request for a II-S (student) deferment. Loyola University notified the local board of Farrell\u2019s enrollment. The regulations provide, however, that the <em>registrant </em>must make a written request for a II-S deferment [32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1622.25]. The local board clerk informed Farrell of the regulation\u2019s requirements. Farrell simply did not, at any time, make a written request for the deferment. Soon thereafter, Farrell withdrew from all classes at the university. We cannot find that the board erred, in any regard, by denying Farrell a II-S deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">3. <em>Denial of II-A Classification.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Farrell contends that the local board was without basis in fact in denying his request for a II-A (occupational) deferment. Farrell was an engineer with specialized technical training, but his employer\u2019s letter on his behalf to the board did not assert that he could not be replaced. Accordingly, Farrell did not establish the requisite facts to entitle him to a II-A deferment under 32 C.F. R. \u00a7 1622.23. Wallace v. United States (9 Cir. 1970) 435 F.2d 12; United States v. Kanner (9 Cir. 1969) 416 F.2d 522. The board\u2019s denial was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">4. <em>Constitutionality of Conscription.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Finally, Farrell asserts that the Selective Service Act violates the Ninth Amendment of the Constitution. This contention is without merit. United States v. Uhl (9 Cir. 1970) 436 F.2d 773; Harris v. United States (9 Cir. 1969) 412 F.2d 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
