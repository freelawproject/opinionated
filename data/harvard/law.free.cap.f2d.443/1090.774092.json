On November 15, 1949, Midgett was convicted of rape and sentenced to a term of 30 years in the Virginia State Penitentiary. Nearly ten years later he was paroled and remained free under supervision for nearly seven years, until on March 23, 1966, his parole status was revoked and he was returned to custody. At the time of revocation Midgett was not represented by counsel and none was proffered him. Implicit in the state\u2019s brief is the concession that if demand had been made for free counsel it would have been denied. Midgett does not urge upon us that the reason for revocation was inadequate or unlawful or that the parole authority proceeded arbitrarily and capriciously, but, instead, limits his appeal to the first question \u2014 whether an indigent has a constitutional right to have counsel furnished by the state when faced with possible revocation of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-18\">The answer is to be found in the penumbra of Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967). On its face, <em>Mempa </em>is a narrow decision limited to \u201cthe question of the extent of the right to counsel at the time of sentencing where the sentencing has been deferred subject to probation.\u201d 389 U.S. at 130, 88 S.Ct. at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-19\">In his opinion for the Court, Mr. Justice Marshall reviewed the evolution of the right to counsel in a criminal trial from Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948) (during sentencing), to Moore v. Michigan, 355 U.S. 155, 78 S.Ct. 191, 2 L.Ed.2d 167 (1957) (hearing after guilty plea on the degree of the crime), to Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961) (arraignment), and concluded that after Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), the decided cases clearly stand for the proposition \u201cthat appointment of counsel for an indigent is required at every stage of a criminal proceeding where substantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected.\u201d 389 U.S. at 134, 88 S.Ct. at 257. The Court then equated \u201crevocation of probation\u201d with \u201cdeferred sentencing\u201d and held that the Constitution required the assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>of counsel at \u201cthe deferred sentencing stage of the proceeding.\u201d 389 U.S. at 137, 88 S.Ct. at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">Undergirding the unanimous opinion are these expressed reasons for it:</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">(1) An assumption that counsel appointed for the purpose of trial or guilty plea would not be unduly burdened by following through at the deferred sentencing stage of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">(2) Certain legal rights may be lost if not exercised at the time of deferred sentencing, <em>e. g., </em>the right of appeal and the right to withdraw a plea of guilty prior to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">In determining whether to extend the right of counsel from the deferred sentencing procedure of the original criminal trial to a revocation of parole after every stage of the trial has been completed, we think these expressed reasons advanced by the Court ought to be evaluated in the new context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-8\">It should not lightly be assumed, we think, that counsel appointed to represent an indigent defendant at a criminal trial will not be \u201cunduly burdened\u201d to forever after represent him at any parole revocation hearing that may occur\u2014 in Midgett\u2019s case nearly seventeen years after the trial. There are differences of time, place, compensation and subject matter. A deferred sentencing procedure may occur soon or late after the trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but a parole revocation hearing is always late, for it cannot, of course, precede the service of at least a part of the sentence \u2014 usually one-fourth or one-third as a minimum. The venue of a deferred sentencing procedure presumably would be that of the original trial, quite probably the home town and place of business of the lawyer involved. The rev-</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-12\">ocation of parole hearing would not likely be at the place of trial, but is more probably to be laid at the penitentiary or central office of the Board of Paroles. If the state should provide compensation for lawyers who defend indigents in the criminal courts, presumably it would embrace the whole criminal trial including a deferred sentencing procedure. It is not so clear that it would embrace representation before the executive branch of government in a proceeding wholly removed from the judicial process. If it is not an undue burden on a lawyer to be asked to return for a deferred sentencing procedure, it may be in part because that procedure is related to the original criminal trial and is part of it. Conduct that may have triggered the motion of the prosecutor for imposition of sentence is only one aspect of the many factors that enter into the sentencing procedure. In a sentencing procedure the whole criminal trial and all of its manifestations are the subject of discussion in an attempt to determine upon just punishment. Presumably the original trial lawyer will remember the evidence at trial sufficiently to help his representation at sentencing. The issue at parole revocation is quite different. It is no longer important what occurred at the trial, but only what has occurred thereafter with respect to rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-13\">If it should ever be decided that every parolee must have free counsel furnished by the state, it seems to us that the burden should not be thrust wholly upon original trial counsel, who is scarcely better able to function than would new counsel and is likely to be far removed from the venue of the parole revocation hearing. Moreover, we doubt the inherent power of the courts to compel counsel as officers of the judicial branch to perform services without compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>in the executive branch of government. So far as we know, neither South Carolina nor Virginia, nor any of the other states within this circuit, have legislatively authorized the payment of lawyers to represent parolees faced with the possibility of revocation. Thus if the Constitution compels representation by counsel, it will compel lawyers to work in non-judicial business without compensation, at least until such time, if ever, as the legislatures of the several states may appropriate voluntarily or under court order monies for such a purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\"> We hold that the Sixth Amendment and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment do not require the states in every case to afford counsel to indigent parolees. In so holding, we adhere to our former decisions, Boddie v. Weakley, 356 F.2d 242 (4th Cir. 1966); Gaskins v. Kennedy, 350 F.2d 311 (4th Cir. 1962), and are in accord with the Third, Ninth and Tenth Circuits, Washington v. Hagen, 287 F.2d 332 (3rd Cir. 1960); Williams v. Dunbar, 377 F.2d 505 (9th Cir. 1967); Williams v. Patterson, 389 F.2d 374 (10th Cir. 1968), and Idaho, Heath v. State, 482 P.2d 76 (Idaho 1971). Other circuits and state courts have indicated that they would reach a like result, even going so far as to deny or narrowly restrict the right to any hearing of any sort, see Morrissey v. Brewer, 443 F.2d 942 (8th Cir. 1971); Rose v. Haskins, 388 F.2d 91 (6th Cir. 1968); Curtis v. Bennet, 351 F.2d 931 (8th Cir. 1965); Hiatt v. Compagna, 178 F.2d 42 (5th Cir. 1949); Richardson v. Markley, 339 F.2d 967 (7th Cir. 1965); Baxter v. Commonwealth, 468 N.E.2d 670 (Mass.1971), an extreme solution we reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">The present Chief Justice when a member of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said in Hyser v. Reed, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 318 F.2d 225 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1155-7\">No case has yet held that an interested party in an administrative or regulatory proceeding is entitled to be furnished with counsel if he cannot afford one of his own choice. We hold due process does not require that indigent parolees be provided with appointed counsel when they appear before the Parole Board in revocation proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1155-10\">318 F.2d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-11\">In rejecting the contention that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment required the appointment of counsel for indigent parolees the Chief Justice had this to say:</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-12\">The Bureau of Prisons and the Parole Board operate from the basic premise that prisoners placed in their custody are to be rehabilitat\u00e9d and restored to useful lives as soon as in the Board\u2019s judgment that transition can be safely made. This is plainly what Congress intends. Thus there is a genuine identity of interest if not purpose in the prisoner\u2019s desire to be released and the Board\u2019s policy to grant release as soon as possible. Here there is not the attitude of adverse, conflicting objectives as between the parolee and the Board inherent between prosecution and defense in a criminal case. Here we do not have pursuer and quarry but a relationship partaking of parens patriae. In a real sense the Parole Board in revoking parole occupies the role of parent withdrawing a privilege from an errant child not as punishment but for misuse of the privilege. \u201cProbation workers making reports of their investigations have not been trained to prosecute but to aid offenders.\u201d Williams v. People of State of New York, 337 U.S. [241] at 249, 69 S.Ct. [1079] at 1084 [93 L.Ed. 1337]. Perhaps the more correct view is that retributive justice is satisfied by the conviction whereas the sentence is a process of treatment. It is important to bear this in mind in determining whether there would be any gain to the parolee or to society in taking steps urged by the dissenting opinions which tend to equate parole processes with criminal prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq3\">318 F.2d at 237-238.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>In Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963), Mr. Justice Black noted the distinction between a paroled prisoner and one presumptively innocent of crime: \u201cHe can be rearrested at any time the board or parole officer believes he has violated a term or condition of his parole, and he might be thrown back in jail to finish serving the allegedly invalid sentence <em>with few, if any, of the procedural safeguards that normally must be and are provided to those charged with crime.\u201d </em>371 U.S. at 242, 83 S.Ct. at 377 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">In rejecting Midgett\u2019s contention that every parolee faced with the possibility of revocation has an absolute right to the assistance of counsel, we do not reject or undermine our decision in Hewett v. North Carolina, 415 F.2d 1316 (4th Cir. 1969). <em>Hewett </em>fell squarely within the rationale of Mempa v. Rhay\u2014 unless that decision was to be read so narrowly that it was without significance except in the context of the singular Washington state procedure with which it dealt. The result in <em>Hewett </em>was, we think, compelled by the very language of <em>Mempa, </em>for, as previously noted; Mr. Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion equates \u201crevocation of probation\u201d with \u201cdeferred sentencing\u201d. <em>Mempa </em>means, we think, that there is a constitutional right to counsel at every stage of a criminal proceeding and that one of those stages is revocation of probation. As Judge Winter said in <em>Hewett, </em>\u201cwhile the right to counsel applies to \u2018criminal proceedings,\u2019 we have little doubt that the revocation of probation is a stage of criminal proceedings.\u201d 415 F.2d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">Quite recently in United States ex rel. Bey v. Connecticut State Board of Parole, 443 F.2d 1079 decided May 17, 1971, the Second Circuit held that all state parolees are entitled to legal representation at parole revocation hearings that result in their reincarceration. Bey was released on parole from the Connecticut State Prison on June 10, 1960, where he had been serving a life term for second degree murder. He was arrested and his parole revoked about six months later and he has been confined under the murder sentence for the past decade. The only \u201cclear violation of a parole condition\u201d was the possession of a hunting knife which the parole officer himself characterized as \u201cin itself not of tremendous import.\u201d What apparently brought about revocation was simply unconventional behavior involving moral concepts and Bey\u2019s penchant for progressively disappointing, annoying, and disturbing his employers, and eventually his parole officer. We are not in disagreement with the Second Circuit that in a case of such factual complexity involving psychiatric evaluation and disputed behavior and its significance, the assistance of counsel would be valuable to the parolee, and probably helpful to the parole board in determining upon which one of its several options might best dispose of Bey\u2019s case. But we are respectfully of the opinion that a hard ease makes a poor vehicle for fashioning a broad rule of entitlement to counsel for all parolees regardless of the degree of certainty and nature of their violations of parole conditions. It would have sufficed, we think, to have simply held Bey entitled to the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">It remains for us to consider whether an indigent parolee may ever in a given case be entitled to the benefit of free counsel furnished by the state. In Jones v. Rivers, 338 F.2d 862 (4th Cir. 1962), Judge Sobeloff concurred in the decision that there is no absolute constitutional right to counsel for an indigent faced with possible parole revocation, but insisted that the appointment of counsel is required \u201cwhere the accused parole violator is indigent and denies that he has violated the conditions of his parole.\u201d 338 F.2d at 878. Judge Haynsworth, also concurring, expressed the viewpoint that the assistance of counsel is not essential to fairness in routine revocation hearings. He thought the Constitution required a parole board to furnish free counsel for the parolee only in the extraordinary case when the fairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>of the proceeding would be impaired by counsel\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">We presently adopt the empirical rule of Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595 (1942), fully aware that in adopting a case-by-case approach articulation of where the line should be drawn between those who should have been supplied with counsel and those lawfully refused such assistance is a most difficult undertaking. That <em>Betts </em>proved unworkable after 21 years of experimentation, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), does not mean, we think, that its rationale cannot be reasonably satisfactory in the administrative as opposed to the judicial context. Also, there may be other expedients short of the assistance of legal counsel that may suffice to satisfy fundamental fairness and due process. For example, Judge Wright has suggested assigning a parole or probation officer other than the officer initiating a revocation procedure to the duty of assisting the parolee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-6\">With me, however, the primary attribute of a good parole system is. a liberal parole policy. Requiring a full-dress second trial, even limited to questions of fact, would, in my judgment, militate against such a policy. Right to assigned counsel and compulsory process in revocation proceedings are obviously desirable, but the price in terms of the number of persons paroled, or more accurately, not paroled, may be too high. For the time being I would accept the nonadversary hearing with a probation officer assisting the parolee. As stated in the text, I believe that such protection conforms with the current concept of due process and it is possible within the statutory framework. Compare Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 507-508, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHB\">Hyser v. Reed, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 318 F.2d 225, 261 n. 1. (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">Bearden\u2019s case presents the second question. He was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment for murder in November 1938. He was paroled after serving a little more than seven years, and had been free under supervision for more than four years when he was arrested in August 1949 for an alleged violation of the conditions of probation. Imprisoned for another seven years, Bearden was again paroled on September 12, 1957. This parole was revoked on July 24, 1958, and Bearden is presently in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-10\">It has been settled federal \u201cpractice for more than 50 years * * * to allow a prisoner a hearing but not representation by counsel.\u201d Washington v. Hagan, 287 F.2d 332, 334 (3rd Cir. 1960). Although notice and opportunity to be heard are not constitutional prerequisites to the issuance of a parole violator warrant, Escoe v. Zerbst, 295 U.S. 490, 55 S.Ct. 818, 79 L.Ed. 1566 (1935), we think due process and fundamental fairness dictate a holding that within a reasonable period after arrest upon such a warrant the parolee is entitled to notice of his alleged default and opportunity to rebut the same, including the right to be heard pro se before someone representing the Board, and to present voluntary witnesses in his own behalf. See Alverez v. Turner, 422 F.2d 214, 220 (10th Cir. 1970); Boddie v. Weakley, 356 F.2d 242 (4th Cir. 1966); Rose v. Haskins, 388 F.2d 91, 97 (6th Cir. 1968) (Celebrezze, J., dissenting); Chase v. Page, 456 P.2d 590 (Okl.Cr. 1969); State ex rel. Murray v. Swenson, 196 Md. 222, 76 A.2d 150, 154 (1950). Cf. Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970) (termination of welfare payments prior to a hearing violates the due process clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-11\">We do not read South Carolina\u2019s brief to urge a contrary rule. Indeed, the South Carolina Director of the Department of Corrections insists that Bearden has been accorded three parole revocation hearings, the last one, at least, with the assistance of self-employed counsel. Bearden contends that the hearings were unfair, with or without counsel, and that the issue before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>parole board was extraordinary enough to require assistance, preferably by counsel, but, at the very least, by assignment of a parole officer to help him. One of the questions sought to be presented arises out of a change in the parole law of South Carolina after Bearden\u2019s first parole and prior to his second one, and the effect, urged to be ex post facto, of a new parole statute assertedly changing conditions of parole unfairly and unconstitutionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">Because the district judge conducted no hearing, the facts are not at all clear in the record. Indeed, Bearden\u2019s contentions are not even clear, and the best that court-appointed counsel for him in this court could do is to state in the brief \u201cIt may be fairly assumed from his factual allegations that he protests the failure to be afforded the opportunity to be heard and the failure of the board to notify him of the charged violations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">In this state of the record we must remand for an evidentiary hearing. Pri- or to the hearing the District Court should allow Bearden to plead with more particularity his contention that the 1958 revocation was unfair and illegal. The hearing should relate only to the validity of the 1958 revocation for it is clear that Bearden\u2019s release on parole in 1957 mooted questions involving the revocation of his parole in 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-9\">No. 14079 \u2014 Bearden\u2019s case reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-10\">No. 14197 \u2014 Midgett\u2019s case affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1154-9\">.

Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967). However facially limited was the exact question decided in the case, the ease holds \u201cthat appointment of counsel for an indigent is required at <em>every </em>stage of a criminal proceeding <em>where substantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied.) 389 U.S. at 134, 88 S.Ct. at 257.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>I cannot read <em>Mempa, </em>as the majority apparently does, to rest on the premise that the degree of burden on the convenience of counsel is a determining factor of whether the right to counsel attaches. True, the Court commented at the end of its opinion that \u201c[w]e assume that counsel appointed for the purpose of the trial on guilty plea would not be unduly burdened by being requested to follow through at the deferred sentencing stage of the proceeding.\u201d 389 U.S. at 137, 88 S.Ct. at 258. But the comment appears to be little more than an aside about the practical effect of the decision. To me, the factor of burden on counsel is largely irrelevant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, <em>Mempa </em>rests squarely on the propositions, first, that appointment of counsel for an indigent is required at every stage of a criminal proceeding where substantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected and, second, that the loss of liberty which may result from a revocation of probation or deferred sentencing is a substantial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">The right to continued liberty \u2014 the ultimate issue in a parole revocation hearing \u2014 is the same substantial right. When that right depends upon disputed questions of fact, I have no difficulty in concluding that there is also a right to counsel, for, as said by the Court in <em>Mempa, </em>\u201cthe necessity for the aid of counsel in marshaling the facts, introducing evidence of mitigating circumstances and in general aiding and assisting the defendant to present his case * * * is apparent.\u201d 389 U.S. at 135, 88 S.Ct. at 257. A parole revocation hearing, like a probation revocation hearing or \u201cdeferred\u201d sentencing, is an accusatory and adversary proceeding. The parole board performs the same function as a judge. In oral argument, counsel for Virginia advised us that . the Virginia parole board not only determines whether a parole violation has occurred, but also has discretion to continue parole despite the violation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Certainly, the parole officer who initiates the proceedings and has investigated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>facts of the alleged violation plays a role analogous to that of a prosecutor. Revocation of parole, like revocation of probation, is often based on the alleged commission of criminal offenses for which the accused is never tried. This fact was given significant weight in <em>Mempa </em>(389 U.S. at 136-137, 88 S.Ct. 254), with regard to probation revocation hearings, and highlighted the necessity for counsel to protect the accused from imprisonment for crimes never committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">Thus, I would conclude that <em>Mempa </em>requires us to hold that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments give to a parolee the right to counsel at a parole revocation hearing. Our prior decisions in Jones v. Rivers, 338 F.2d 862 (4 Cir. 1964), Gaskins v. Kennedy, 350 F.2d 311 (4 Cir. 1962), and Boddie v. Weakley, 356 F.2d 242 (4 Cir. 1966), all of which were decided before <em>Mempa, </em>should be overruled to the extent that they are inconsistent with this conclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-11\">There is, as the majority demonstrates, an apparent numerical majority of decisions from other jurisdictions supporting the majority\u2019s view.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But, in my judgment, the better reasoned cases reach the result I would reach.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Certainly, it is one recommended by legal scholars and various study commissions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> One of the most persuasive opinions is that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>People ex rel. Menechino v. Warden, Green Haven St. Pris., 27 N.Y.2d 376, 318 N.Y.S.2d 449, 267 N.E.2d 238 (1971).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In that case, Chief Judge Fuld, writing for the court, indicated that our decision in <em>Hewett </em>dictates the result we should reach here. Chief Judge Fuld also effectively answered the concepts, lurking in the majority\u2019s opinion and articulated more fully in some of the authorities on which it relies, that somehow the rules with regard to counsel are different with regard to parole revocation hearings because they are \u201cadministrative\u201d in nature, or because the parole board bears a relationship of parens patriae to the parolee, or because the presence and participation of counsel at a parole revocation hearing would impair the benevolent objectives of the parole system. After carefully pointing out that in order to return a parolee to prison a parole board must make factual determination as to the truth of specific allegations of misconduct, Chief Judge Fuld stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-9\">[cjertainly, a \u201cparole court\u201d or a parole board panel may not be permitted \u2014 simply because it is an administrative body rather than a judicial tribunal \u2014 to base its determination, having so serious an impact on the lives of the individuals who appear before it, on a possibly mistaken view of the facts owing to the parolee\u2019s inability to make a proper factual presentation. In the present case, for instance, counsel would have been able not only to analyze and question the accuracy of the parole supervisor\u2019s report but also would have been available to deduce and marshal the facts necessary to refute the technical and rather ambiguous charge of \u201cconsorting.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>He then added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-4\">It is for reasons such as these that the Supreme Court, rejecting all efforts to limit the right to counsel to the narrow confines of \u201ccriminal prosecutions\u201d under the Sixth Amendment, has treated such right as an essential element of due process, applicable to all proceedings, whether they be classified as civil, criminal or administrative, where individual liberty is at stake. * * * No matter how the proceeding be characterized, the demands of due process, under both the United States Constitution and the Constitution of New York State, require that a parolee be represented by a lawyer, and entitled to introduce testimony, if he so elects. The constitutional guarantee demands no less if the search for truth is not to be sacrificed to administrative speed and convenience.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-10\">And finally he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-11\">It is desirable, * * * to indicate that the hearings we are directing must not be permitted to unreasonably delay the proceedings. The presence of an attorney, the receipt of testimony offered by the parolee, are required in order to enable the board to ascertain the facts, pro and con, upon which it is to make its determination. In other words, participation by counsel need be no greater than is required to assure, to the board as well as to the parolee, that the board is accurately informed of the facts before it acts, and the permitted presentation of testimony by the parolee need be no greater than is necessary for that same purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>Meeting these requirements will not, we hasten to interpolate, occasion the slightest relaxation of supervisory-control over parolees. It is the board alone which is to ascertain the facts and decide their ultimate importance. The presence of counsel is merely designed to afford the prisoner an added measure of protection; the receipt of testimony which he may offer is one of the fundamentals of fair play. Together, these two elements, the presence of counsel and the receipt of evidence, constitute the essential characteristics of our system of administration of justice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">Having established what I think the general rule should be, I come to the precise disposition of Midgett\u2019s case. Midgett asserts that he is entitled to relief solely because it is established that he did not have counsel and because it is conceded that he would not have been furnished counsel even if he had requested it. I would not grant the writ or require the state to consider the revocation of Midgett\u2019s parole on this showing alone, but I would remand the case to the district court for a determination of whether the absence of counsel was harmless error under Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). This was the procedure followed in Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 11, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970), another denial of the right to counsel case. It is implicit in the concurring opinion in Jones v. Rivers, <em>supra, </em>and it is one which we adopted in Kemplen v. Maryland, 428 F.2d 169 (4 Cir. 1970). See also, Earnest v. Moseley, 426 F.2d 466 (10 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-11\">SOBELOFF and BUTZNER, Circuit Judges, authorize me to state that they concur in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">. The issue is directly presented and decided in Midgett\u2019s appeal. The issue is also presented in Bearden\u2019s appeal. Bearden was paroled twice in 1945 and 1957, and these paroles were revoked in 1949 and 1958, respectively. Bearden alleged that he was denied counsel at the 1949 revocation hearing. A state judge, after plenary hearing, found the allegation well-founded and ordered his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">On appeal the order was reversed on the ground that Bearden was being held pursuant to the 1958 revocation of parole. Bearden v. Manning, 238 S.O. 187, 119 S.E.2d 670 (1961). I would accept the finding that Bearden had no counsel at the 1949 revocation hearing. While Bearden is presently incarcerated as a result of the 1958 revocation of parole, he has alleged that the conditions of his 1957 parole were more onerous than those of his original 1945 parole. The record is not clear as to what the conditions of the 1957 parole were, the reasons why it was revoked in 1958, or the circumstances of the 1958 revocation, i. e., whether Bearden was present</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-15\">and had counsel. These are factual questions which I would have explored on remand. A new parole revocation hearing for Bearden under the terms of the original 1945 parole may be in order if the district court finds the conditions of the 1957 parole, or its revocation, were dependent upon the 1949 revocation. Even if revocation of the 1945 parole is found to have had no effect on the 1957 parole or its revocation in 1958, a new parole revocation hearing under the terms of the 1957 parole may be in order if it is found either that Bearden was not present or did not have the opportunity to be represented. As to these issues the record is silent. For these reasons, as well as the fact that I agree that Bearden was entitled to notice of his alleged violation of parole and an opportunity to rebut the same, I concur in the majority\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1158-16\">. A panel of this Court so construed <em>Mempa </em>in Hewett v. State of North Carolina, 415 F.2d 1316 (4 Cir. 1969), when we held that there was a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>counsel at a probation revocation hearing, although two members of that panel now subscribe to the majority opinion in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">. I call attention to the fact that when Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), was decided, few jurisdictions, including the federal government, had adopted legislation to provide compensation for court appointed counsel. Even when Congress finally responded by enacting the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, Pub.L. 88-455, compensation for counsel was not provided for significant areas in which, by later court decisions, counsel was subsequently required. Under the original Act, counsel was compensated solely for services rendered during trials before district courts and commissioners and for arguing appeals in courts of appeals. But the larger gaps were filled by the enactment of Pub.L. 91-447, amending the 1964 Act. Under the existing statute, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3006A(a) (g), as so amended, counsel <em>must </em>be appointed, <em>inter alia, </em>when the Sixth Amendment requires the appointment of counsel and, as a discretionary matter, counsel <em>may </em>be appointed for an indigent who is subject to revocation of parole. The existing statute is thus sufficient to provide counsel in a federal parole revocation bearing. The states have a similar history of legislative response, although it will not be stated in detail. The conclusion to be drawn is that, while there may be a temporary period of financial hardship on court-appointed counsel, the legislative branch of government has and will respond to the financial impact of extension of the right to counsel doctrine on members of the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-9\">I see no reason for concern over whether original trial counsel should or should not be counsel at a parole revocation hearing. Manifestly, the issues at a parole revocation hearing will differ from the issues at the original trial. It follows that original trial counsel may be counsel also at the parole revocation hearing, but he need not be if there is good reason to appoint another lawyer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1159-10\">. The Virginia Parole Board\u2019s discretionary authority is codified in Code of Virginia (1970 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 53-262. By contrast, in Bearden\u2019s case, the South Carolina Parole Board had a more limited function. If it finds that there has been a violation of a condition of parole the prisoner must be returned to serve the part of the sentence which remains unserved. However, the prisoner is made eligible for a successive parole there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>after \u201cwhen and if the Board thinks such parole would be proper.\u201d Code of S.C.

Reed, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 318 F.2d 225 (1963). Although decided approximately three weeks after the landmark decision of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), on the right to counsel, <em>Hyser fails </em>to mention <em>Gideon. </em>Of course, <em>Mempa, </em>which represented an extension of <em>Gideon, </em>did not follow until four years later, so that it could not have been considered. For these reasons, I do not find <em>Hyser </em>a persuasive authority. See discussion in K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise (1970 Supp.) \u00a7 7.16 at p. 352.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1160-9\">. The cases are collected and perceptively analyzed in United States ex rel. Bey v. Conn. State Bd. of Parole, 443 F.2d 1079 (2 Cir., 1971). Judge Irving R.

He, nevertheless, demonstrates conclusively that most of the cases denying the right to counsel were either decided prior to <em>Mempa, </em>or, if decided after <em>Mempa, </em>were decided before (or if decided after, failed to consider) Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970), a decision which undermines Escoe v.

Omitted from the text, for convenience of rending, are citations to other cases establishing the right to counsel in other contexts. One of the most important is In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), which held the right to counsel applies to juvenile delinquency proceedings. Its significance lies in its rejection of the argument that the parens patriae relationship of a judge of a juvenile court to the juvenile justified departure from strict application of constitutional principles, including Sixth Amendment rights. Rather, the Court concluded that the appearance, as well as the actuality, of fairness, impartiality and orderliness \u201cmay be a more impressive and more therapeutic attitude so far as the juvenile is concerned,\u201d because the juvenile would think that he had been treated fairly and his hostility to rehabilitative efforts would not be aroused. 387 U.S. at 26, 87 S.Ct. at 1443. The analogy between a juvenile court proceeding and a parole board revocation hearing and the analogy between an allegedly delinquent juvenile and an alleged parole violator are self-evident. Indeed, as Judge Kaufman stated in Bey: \u201cOne certain way to increase a prisoner\u2019s sense of resentment and to discourage his will eventually to return to a normal life would be to deny him basic safeguards essential to the fundamental fairness of a decision to deprive him of the liberty he gained upon parole release.\u201d 443 F.2d 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"Axc\">In addition to the cases cited by Chief Judge Fuld, an overview of the whole ambit of right to counsel cases from <em>Gideon </em>(right to counsel at trial, overruling Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595 (1942), which the majority now seeks to revive) to Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed. 2d 387 (1970) (counsel at preliminary hearing), lends support to the conclusion that the Court means a literal application of the <em>Mempa </em>test that counsel is required at <em>every </em>stage of a criminal proceeding where <em>sxibstwntxal </em>rights of an accused may be affected, viz: Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), and Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) (custodial interrogation), and United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), and Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967) (lineup). These cases, as well as other right to counsel cases cited elsewhere in this opinion, have one aspect in common: the right to counsel was held applicable to a facet of the criminal process where what occurred might have a significant effect on an accused\u2019s ultimate loss of liberty \u2014 the very issue in a parole revocation proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">. In accord are the views of the Second Circuit in <em>Bey. </em>There, Judge Kaufman wrote for the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-8\">\u201cBut the state has demonstrated no respect in which the presence of counsel for the limited purpose of developing and evaluating relevant events of a parolee\u2019s history on parole, and of recommending alternative dispositions to revocation, will tend to inhibit or constrict the parole process.

Indeed, competent counsel should augment the flow and the board, as well as the parolee, should benefit from a trained lawyer\u2019s capacity to guard against error and distortions. To the extent that a lawyer who misconceives his role in the parole process might resort to dilatory or distracting tactics or equate it with his role in the trial of a case, the board does not lack the power to so structure the proceedings as to maximize the lawyer\u2019s contribution and minimize his potential for disruption.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
