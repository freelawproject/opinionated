Glasser was convicted on Count I for conspiracy to affect interstate commerce by means of extortion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1951, and on Counts II and III for actually affecting interstate commerce through extortions, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 2. He was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of five years on each count and was fined a total of $20,000 \u2014 $10,000 on each of Counts I and II. The prison sentence was suspended, and a two-year period of probation was imposed by the court. We affirm Glasser\u2019s conviction on the conspiracy count, and reverse his conviction on Counts II and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">Glasser, the dominant officer of the only union representing plate glass installers in the New York metropolitan area, was indicted and tried with two co-defendants, Sam Kaplan and Larry Hill, also officers of the glaziers\u2019 union. Count I of the indictment charged that from December 1, 1964 until March 6, 1969, the three defendants engaged in a conspiracy to interfere with interstate commerce by spraying a special type of acid on, and thus causing damage to, windows which had been installed by nonunion glaziers, thereby having an ex-tortive effect on (a) the nonunion installers of such glass, (b) the owners of shops requiring installation of such glass, and (c) the insurance companies which insured the windows, because, after these incidents of spraying, Glasser allegedly sent lists of unionized glaziers to the insurance companies. Counts II and III charged the defendants with affecting interstate commerce by means of such extortions, committed on July 14, 1967 and September 10, 1967, respectively. Although Glasser was convicted on all three counts, Hill was convicted only on Count I and was acquitted on Counts II and III, and Kaplan was acquitted on all counts. Hill\u2019s appeal has been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-14\">At trial the government\u2019s chief witness was one Sheppard Gellert, who had been employed by the union as assistant financial secretary. Gellert testified that acid was kept in the union\u2019s basement and that spraying it on a nonunion window was referred to as \u201cdoing a job\u201d or \u201cpissing up a window.\u201d Gellert stated that he himself received the reports of nonunion job sites, collected them in a book and thereafter gave them to Kaplan. Kaplan in turn passed the information to Glasser for aciding, but only, as Kaplan explained to Gellert, after he, Kaplan, has personally determined that the glass should be acided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-15\">Gellert also testified that he had spoken to Glasser on certain occasions about the aciding and that he had overheard certain conversations between Glasser and Kaplan respecting the aciding. He stated, for instance, that in 1965 he overheard Glasser and Kaplan discussing the accidental spraying of a <em>union </em>job. In this particular case, Glasser stated that although this was a union job, it would teach the \u201cso-and-so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>* * * a lesson.\u201d Another time in 1965, Gellert stated, he saw Glasser rush into Kaplan\u2019s office and he followed. In the ensuing discussion, Glasser showed Gellert a news article disclosing that the Westchester district attorney was going to investigate aeidings of plate glass. Gellert asked whether the article referred to \u201cone of our jobs\u201d and Glasser replied, \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t do it.\u201d A few days later, Gellert was told by Kaplan, that although they did not do the particular aciding in question, Glasser \u201cwas worried because it put the heat on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">Gellert also testified that Hill had admitted to him that he did aciding for the union. For example, on many occasions throughout 1964 and 1965 and earlier, Hill complained to Gellert that although he did aciding for the union, he never received any money for it. Once in late 1964, Gellert saw a container of acid in the back of Hill\u2019s station wagon. Toward the end of 1964, Gellert was at the office working late one day when Hill telephoned saying that he was coming down to the office to drop off some medical forms since he had to come down anyway to do an aciding job for Glasser that night. Subsequently, Gellert told Glasser that it was risky using Hill to do aciding jobs because he was unstable. Glasser replied \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can control him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">Gellert testified, moreover, that on several occasions he had witnessed the delivery of acid to the union headquarters, and once he saw Glasser take the acid into his office. Finally, Gellert stated that his duties with the union included sending to insurance companies at Glasser\u2019s direction lists of certain unionized glaziers, accompanied by a covering letter from Glasser requesting that the insurance companies select only the shops on the list.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">The government next offered the testimony of various shopowners and glaziers to the effect that numerous nonunion installations were damaged with acid during the course of the alleged conspiracy and that thereafter the damage was repaired by union glaziers hired by insurance brokers. Finally, the government relied on the union\u2019s avowed policy that members were required to report nonunion installations to union headquarters, although they were cautioned to avoid using a telephone in rendering such reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">For the defense, Glasser testified in his own behalf and denied any personal involvement in any of the acts charged. The defense also attacked Gellert\u2019s credibility on the basis of his admitted hatred for Glasser and on the basis of his psychotic background. Finally, the defense claimed that the government totally failed to connect Glasser or the union with any of the acts charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">In seeking reversal of his conviction, Glasser makes several claims of error: (1) that various items of evidence were admitted in violation of the rule against hearsay; (2) that the district court erred in permitting the prosecution to impeach Glasser on cross-examination and through rebuttal evidence concerning an act which occurred in 1960 and was not charged in the indictment; (3) that the court erred in denying Glasser access to a psychiatric report of a government witness; (4) that the court erred in permitting the government to impeach three defense witnesses by eliciting from them the fact that they had claimed their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination before the grand jury; and (5) that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict on any of the three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">I. Glasser contends first that various items of evidence were admitted at trial in violation of the rule against hearsay and of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-11\">1. Gellert testified without objection on direct examination that codefendant Hill had told him that \u201che did aciding for the union and that he put his life on the line and nobody appreciated him and that he never got any money for it, and things of that nature.\u201d On redirect ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>amination of Gellert, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-5\">\u201cQ. Did Mr. Hill mention anything about acidings at that time and during that party?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-6\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I object. It is not proper redirect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-7\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-8\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-9\">\u201cA. He got drunk. He was loaded and he started to curse very badly and he started to talk about \u2014 he was mad at Sidney and Sidney Glasser doesn\u2019t appreciate him and he does \u2014 he puts his life on the line; he does aciding for Sidney and Sidney is so and so, along that line, and we had quite a job shutting him up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">Glasser argues that Gellert\u2019s statements were hearsay and also violated the Sixth Amendment under the rule of Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). In <em>Bruton, </em>the Supreme Court held that the admission of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements at a joint trial violates the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right of cross-examination where those statements inculpate the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\"> Since there was no objection on hearsay grounds to the admission of Gellert\u2019s statements at trial, Glasser\u2019s claim is not available on appeal unless that admission was plain error. Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P. Hill\u2019s extrajudicial statements were spontaneous and clearly against his penal interest. With these indicia of reliability, it is unlikely that cross-examination would have significantly weakened the effect of the statements in the jury\u2019s mind. Cf. Dutton v. Evans, 400 U.S. 74, 91 S.Ct. 210, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970) (opinion of Stewart, J.). Moreover, there was no way in which the trial judge could have forecast that Gellert\u2019s answer to the question asked would have inculpated Glasser. Finally, in light of the overwhelming evidence of Glasser\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy, established particularly by Gellert\u2019s other testimony, the admission of this statement, if error at all, was clearly harmless. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Under all these circumstances, we cannot say that the admission of Gellert\u2019s statement constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-13\">2. Leo Durocher, the owner of a victimized shop in Manhattan, testified, over defendant\u2019s objection, that he found a note after the aciding of his window, warning that when the glass was to be replaced, he was to make sure that it was \u201cunion glass.\u201d Durocher did not produce the note at trial, because he did not know where it was. Glasser argues that this testimony was hearsay and was in no way connected to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-14\">We disagree. The note was found immediately after the aciding of plate glass installed by nonunion glaziers \u2014precisely the objective of the unique conspiracy of which Glasser was a member. The circumstances of finding the note at the scene of such an event, coupled with the contents of that note, make the note sufficiently relevant to the conspiracy charge to permit its admission into evidence. See Carbo v. United States, 314 F.2d 718, 742-43 (9th Cir. 1963), cert. denied <em>sub nom. </em>Palermo v. United States, 377 U.S. 953, 84 S.Ct. 1625, 12 L.Ed.2d 498 (1964); Gridley v. United States, 44 F.2d 716, 740 (6th Cir. 1930), cert. denied, 283 U.S. 827, 51 S.Ct. 351, 75 L.Ed. 1441 (1931). Indeed, Glasser conceded at trial that this testimony was admissible under <em>Carbo </em>but contended merely that the court in the exercise of its discretion should exclude it. In view of the circumstantial evidence pointing to some member of the conspiracy as the writer or deliverer of the note, we cannot say that the district judge abused her discretion in admitting this testimony. The note was admissible as an utterance which was contemporaneous with an independently admissible nonverbal act \u2014 the aciding \u2014 and which relates to that act and throws some light upon it. United States v. Annunziato, 293 F.2d 373, 377 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>368 U.S. 919, 82 S.Ct. 240, 7 L.Ed.2d 134 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">3. Joseph Randazzo, a store owner from Brooklyn, testified, over objection, that he received a telephone call from a person identifying himself as from a union shop, warning him that if he hired a nonunion shop to replace his window, he would have trouble. He did hire a nonunion shop and the next day the store window was acided. Glasser contends that this testimony was hearsay and the call not connected with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">However, the statement made by Randazzo\u2019s caller was relevant not only because of the probative value of the assertion made therein, but because it tended to show that persons in the glazing business anticipated difficulty when nonunion workers installed glass. Widespread awareness of this danger was obviously a necessary element of the scheme with which Glasser was charged. We therefore cannot say that the trial judge abused her discretion in admitting this item of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">4. William Chustckie, a nonunion glazier, testified over objection that he received a call from a customer in Brooklyn who told him that he (the customer) had received a warning that since the glazier was nonunion, the customer\u2019s store would be acided. Chustckie then called Glasser and Glasser told him not to worry and that nothing would happen. Nothing did happen. Glasser argues that Chustckie\u2019s testimony as to the warning which his customer received was double hearsay and that Glasser\u2019s response not to worry had no probative value as implicating Glasser in any aciding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">While we agree with the defendant that Chustckie\u2019s testimony as to the warning was hearsay, it does not follow that it was therefore inadmissible. The warning was virtually contemporaneous with Chustckie\u2019s act of contacting Glasser, and threw significant light upon it. See United States v. Annunziato, <em>supra, </em>at 376-377; Morgan, A Suggested Classification of Utterances Admissible as Res Gestae, 31 Yale L.J. 229, 236 (1922). Indeed, if Chustckie had not been permitted to recount the warning conveyed by his customer, his telephone call to Glasser would have appeared to be an arbitrary and almost senseless act. Of course, Chustckie\u2019s testimony as to his conversation with Glasser and Glasser\u2019s statement not to worry was, by itself, not hearsay, and could only have been relevant in conjunction with the hearsay testimony about the warning. But even conjoined with that prior testimony, as Glasser himself argues, his statement not to worry was in no way an admission of his involvement in the conspiracy; and as we believe that the jury would not have seen it as such an admission, we can only conclude that the jury would not have reached a different verdict if Chustckie\u2019s testimony had not been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-12\"><em>5. </em>Joseph Cohen, another nonunion glazier, testified that while installing plate glass in Brooklyn in 1962, a stranger approached him and inquired about his union status. Cohen replied that he was nonunion. The man then walked across the street and entered a drug store. The next day the glass that Cohen had installed was damaged by acid. Although Glasser did not object to this testimony on hearsay grounds at trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he now contends that it was hearsay and proves nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-13\">We reject this contention. Inasmuch as the stranger merely inquired as to Cohen\u2019s union affiliation, the question was not hearsay. It was not admitted for the truth of what was said, but solely because it occurred. The incident was also independently admissible as contemporaneous with a non-verbal act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>and as explanatory of the act. United States v. Annunziato, <em>supra, </em>at 377. Furthermore, the testimony was properly admitted under Carbo v. United States, <em>supra, </em>as circumstantially showing that Glasser\u2019s instruction to union members to report locations of nonunion installations was being followed. Since we find no plain error in the admission of Cohen\u2019s testimony, this claim cannot be made on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">II. Glasser\u2019s second contention is that he was denied a fair trial when the court permitted the prosecution to impeach him on cross-examination and through rebuttal evidence concerning an act of misconduct which allegedly occurred in 1960, four years before the alleged conspiracy here had commenced, and which was not charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">In 1960, one Albert Propper, a member of the glaziers\u2019 union, was convicted of spraying acid on the windows of a store in Long Island which had recently been installed by a nonunion shop. At that time Propper stated that he had done this act on his own whim. Shortly before the trial in this ease, however, he claimed that Glasser had directed him to do the aciding in 1960. At a pretrial hearing in this case, Judge Motley ruled that the 1960 Propper incident was \u201cinadmissible on the ground that it would be too highly prejudicial to the defendants because it is too far removed in time from the allegations in this indictment and that great period of time makes the events of that early date not particularly probative with respect to the conspiracy alleged in the indictment here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-16\">At trial, Glasser testified that he \u201cdid not conspire with any man to spray acid on any job at any time.\u201d When on cross-examination he reiterated this, the prosecutor was permitted, over defense counsel\u2019s persistent objections, to question Glasser about the 1960 Propper incident.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Glasser denied any complicity in the event.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As part of its rebuttal, the government called Propper; and over defendant\u2019s objection, Propper testified that Glasser had directed him to do the aciding job in 1960. At no time did Judge Motley retreat from her earlier announced position that the incident was inadmissible in support of the charges in the indictment. Her ruling was that the Propper testimony would be admitted solely as to the credibility of Glasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-17\">Glasser contends that the trial court erred in permitting him to be cross-examined concerning the Propper incident, since he had never been convicted or even arrested in connection with it. He relies for this argument on our statement in United States v. Semensohn, 421 F.2d 1206, 1208 (2d Cir. 1970) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>\u201c[i]t is settled that in a trial a witness\u2019s acts of misconduct are not admissible to impeach his credibility unless the acts resulted in the obtaining of a conviction.\u201d Even if such cross-examination were permissible, Glasser argues, Judge Motley erred in allowing the government to call Propper as a rebuttal witness and thus to make Glasser\u2019s alleged prior misconduct the subject of direct proof. Glasser cites our decision in United States v. Masino, 275 F.2d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 1960), where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-4\">\u201cWhen a witness is cross-examined for the purpose of destroying his credibility by proof of specific acts of misconduct not the subject of a conviction, the examiner must be content with the answer. The examiner may not, over objection, produce independent proof to show the falsity of such answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">Admitting the Propper testimony here, says Glasser, was highly prejudicial for the very reasons stated by Judge Motley at the pretrial hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">The government responds that the Propper testimony was properly admitted in rebuttal for the purpose of impeaching Glasser\u2019s credibility, since Glasser denied eve.r having ordered any aeiding. Moreover, according to the government, the Propper testimony should have been admitted on the government\u2019s case-in-ehief as showing that on a prior occasion Glasser had planned and directed a highly unusual crime exactly the same in nature as the ones presently charged. See United States v. Deaton, 381 F.2d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 1967), and the cases cited therein. In addition, the government argues that the jury was entitled to believe that the conspiracy began earlier than 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">The ' question whether the Propper testimony should have been admitted on the government\u2019s case-in-chief was a matter committed to the trial court\u2019s discretion. United States v. Gardin, 382 F.2d 601, 604 (2d Cir. 1967); United States v. Palumbo, 401 F.2d 270, 273-274 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 947, 89 S.Ct. 1281, 22 L.Ed.2d 480 (1969). It is true that we stated in <em>Deaton </em>that \u201cevidence of similar acts, including other crimes, is admissible when it is substantially relevant for a purpose other than merely to show defendant\u2019s criminal character,\u201d 381 F.2d at 117; and here the virtual identity of the parties, the means used, the ends sought, and the interests to be benefited may have made Glasser\u2019s involvement in the 1960 incident probative on the proper issue of his responsibility for the crimes charged in this indictment, rather than indicative of the improper matter of his general proclivity to crime. Nevertheless, we went on to state in <em>Deaton </em>that \u201cthe trial Judge is required, as with any potentially prejudicial evidence, to balance all of the relevant factors to determine whether the probative value of the evidence of other crimes is outweighed by its prejudicial character.\u201d 381 F.2d at 117. In the present case, Judge Motley applied this test and found that the prejudice did outweigh the probative value of Propper\u2019s testimony. In light of the discretionary nature of this type of ruling, we cannot say that Judge Motley abused her discretion in ruling out the Propper testimony on the government\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">With respect to the question of the propriety of the cross-examination, Glasser\u2019s reliance on <em>Semensohn </em>is misplaced. The defendant-witness\u2019s prior misconduct there was being used to impeach his credibility in general, whereas here it was used to impeach Glasser\u2019s credibility on a particular statement\u2014 his emphatic declaration that he had never ordered anyone to throw acid on plate glass at any time. This broad denial of guilt and sweeping assertion of good conduct was not limited to the charges in the indictment. By so testifying Glasser put his prior good conduct in issue, and the government could therefore properly cross-examine him on the earlier incident. See United States v. Colletti, 245 F.2d 781, 782 (2d Cir.), cert. denied <em>sub nom. </em>Russo v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>States, 355 U.S. 874, 78 S.Ct. 125, 2 L.Ed. 2d 78 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">There remains the question whether Propper\u2019s testimony was admissible on rebuttal to impeach Glasser\u2019s credibility. As our opinion in United States v. Masino, <em>supra, </em>demonstrates, it is settled that prior criminal acts not resulting in a conviction may not be made the subject of direct proof. See 3A Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 979 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). The primary reason for this rule is the danger of confusing the issue of the truth of the indictment with the issue of a witness\u2019s alleged past crimes. This rule is the same when the witness is the defendant. Hence, while the questions about Propper were acceptable upon cross-examination of Glasser, the trial court erred in allowing the government to present Propper\u2019s testimony directly on rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">Nevertheless, after a careful examination of the entire record, we find that this error was harmless. Although we have sustained the trial court\u2019s ruling that Propper\u2019s testimony was not proper direct evidence, the contrary resolution of that question would also have been within the court\u2019s discretion. See United States v. Deaton, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Palumbo, <em>supra. </em>Thus the error was only in the formal label attached to Propper\u2019s testimony. Moreover, the remaining evidence of Glasser\u2019s participation in the conspiracy \u2014especially Gellert\u2019s testimony that he had spoken to Glasser about the aciding and had overheard conversations between Glasser and Kaplan respecting certain aciding jobs \u2014 was overwhelming as to his part in the 1964-69 acidings. The effect of an error is to be gauged by \u201cthe probable impact of the [statements] on the minds of an average jury.\u201d Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 254, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 1728, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1964). We believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have reached the same verdict had Prop-per\u2019s rebuttal testimony been admitted under the category of direct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">III. Glasser next contends that he was denied a fair trial because the district judge refused to let him see a report of Propper\u2019s mental condition rendered by Dr. Cerulli, a private psychiatrist, at Propper\u2019s own request in May 1960, three months after the 1960 aciding incident, and filed with the state court at that time. Judge Motley refused Glasser access to the report because it was marked \u201cConfidential and privileged for professional purposes only \u2014not to be used against the patient\u2019s interest.\u201d She stated: \u201cThere is no evidence that this record was a court ordered document and the defendants concede that it was not ordered by the Court. Therefore, it appears that this is a privileged document, and unless the witness waives his privilege it cannot be used against him.\u201d Moreover, Judge Motley, after examining the report, found that it said that Propper did not have any \u201cserious mental problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">Glasser argues that any psychiatrist-patient privilege should be limited to disclosures made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment and should not encompass reports, like Dr. Cerulli\u2019s, made for submission to a court; and that in any case Propper waived his privilege when he authorized its disclosure to the court. See Taylor v. United States, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 373, 222 F.2d 398 (1955); Ramer v. United States, 411 F.2d 30 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 965, 90 S.Ct. 445, 24 L.Ed.2d 431 (1969). He argues further that he was entitled to production of Dr. Cerulli\u2019s report not only for the purpose of inquiring into Propper\u2019s mental condition, but also for the purpose of learning whether it contained a prior statement by Propper concerning the aciding incident, which was inconsistent with his trial testimony. The government responds that since trial courts have the duty to protect witnesses from needless embarrassment, Judge Motley properly exercised her discretion in withholding it from Glasser, especially when Propper himself, not the court, had asked for the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>We believe that the trial court should have permitted Glasser access to Dr. Cerulli\u2019s report; but after examining the report itself, we conclude that the error was harmless. Glasser had unfettered access to two other medical records which showed Propper\u2019s mental health to be substantially unimpaired. Dr. Francis O\u2019Neill, a psychiatrist appointed by state court after Propper\u2019s initial plea of insanity to state aciding charges, examined him on September 6, 1960, six months after the events about which he testified, and found that he was without evidence of delusions, psychosis, major mental illness, or severe emotional disability. Moreover, records from the Veterans Administration Hospital showed that Propper\u2019s war-related anxiety neurosis, severe at the time of his discharge after he was wounded in the Second World War, was \u201cin full remission\u201d by 1954, six years before the events in question. Our examination of Dr. Cerulli\u2019s report reveals that it would have added little to the other two reports; as Judge Motley stated, it shows that Propper had no serious mental problems. Similarly, as impeachment material, the marginal utility of the Cerulli report was insignificant. Glasser already had Propper\u2019s confession after the 1960 incident and Dr. O\u2019Neill\u2019s report, both of which stated that Prop-per had acided the window on his own whim; and Glasser utilized both of these prior inconsistent statements in cross-examining Propper. Since Dr. Cerulli\u2019s report contains an identical version of the facts, it would have been of no additional benefit to Glasser in the cross-examination of Propper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">IV. Glasser\u2019s fourth contention involves the witnesses whose prior invocation of the Fifth Amendment was elicited at trial. Following the indictment herein, but prior to trial, three union officials were subpoenaed before a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York to testify concerning the facts of this case. Each of them claimed his Fifth Amendment privilege aginst self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">During the trial, counsel for the defendant advised the court that the defense intended to call them as witnesses for the purpose of impeaching Gellert\u2019s credibility through proof of bias. He requested that the court direct the prosecutor not to elicit the earlier claim of privilege during cross-examination. The court explicitly found that the witnesses had been prospective defendants and had rightly claimed their privilege, and that \u201cit would be improper to infer or permit the jury to infer from that fact that they had no such right and had something to hide.\u201d The court attempted to solve the problem by permitting the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-9\">\u201cto put this question to those witnesses, and that is whether they had testified similarly before the Grand Jury without mentioning the Fifth Amendment privilege which they later invoked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-10\">Defense counsel immediately took exception to the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-11\">At trial, the prosecutor asked each of the three witnesses whether he had ever heard of the acidings; and when each replied in the affirmative, the prosecutor asked, over defendant\u2019s objection, whether he had testified the same way before the grand jury. One witness volunteered the answer \u201cI took the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Judge Motley then instructed the jury to disregard this answer and told them the witness\u2019s refusal to answer before the grand jury was perfectly proper and that they were not to draw any unfavorable inference therefrom.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The other two witnesses replied that they had given no testimony at all before the grand jury. In his summation, the prosecutor referred to the witnesses\u2019 refusal to testify before the grand jury. But the court in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>charge again instructed the jury that such refusal \u201cmay not count against them in your evaluation of their credibility.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Glasser argues that the government\u2019s efforts to impeach defense witnesses by reference to the fact that they had claimed their Fifth Amendment privilege before the grand jury deprived Glasser of a fair trial. See Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391, 415-426, 77 S.Ct. 963, 1 L.Ed.2d 931 (1957); United States v. Tomaiolo, 249 F.2d 683, 690-692. (2d Cir 1957). Moreover, says Glasser, if the prosecution may subpoena close associates of the defendant before the grand jury, with the knowledge that they will probably invoke the Fifth Amendment, and then this may be used as a device effectively to neutralize those persons as defense witnesses at a later trial, fairness and justice would be subverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">The government concedes that this line of cross-examination was error, but argues that that the error was harmless. According to the government, none of the three witnesses involved had the slightest significance to the defense case; the questions were asked pursuant to an advisory ruling made in advance by the trial judge; the ultimate facts which the defense sought to establish through the three witnesses were not disputed, were already in evidence, and were merely collateral; there was no possible impact on the defendant\u2019s own Fifth Amendment privilege since he tes-</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\">tified in his own behalf; the trial judge gave prompt and adequate protective instructions when the matter first came up and again in her charge to the jury; the single question each witness had refused to answer was innocuous; and the defendant was in no way linked to their refusals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">We can see no justification whatsoever for the government\u2019s cross-examination of these three witnesses so as to elicit their prior invocation of the Fifth Amendment. Nevertheless, we agree with the government that the error was harmless. The three witnesses did not testify about aciding incidents or Glasser\u2019s role in them. Instead, their testimony went solely to Gellert\u2019s bias against Glasser. They testified that Gellert' repeatedly expressed hatred of Glasser and jubilation over the fact that Glasser was being prosecuted; and they enumerated assorted wrongs which Gellert claimed had been done to him by Glasser. This testimony was cumulative on an undisputed issue. Gellert himself already had recited his grievances against Glasser and had admitted his hostility. The government expressly conceded that \u201cof course\u201d Gellert had a \u201cbias\u201d against Glasser. The government\u2019s position was that Gellert nevertheless was telling the truth; and in support of that position, the government pointed to prior consistent statements made by Gellert before the hostility arose. Since the government conceded what these three witnesses testified to \u2014Gellert\u2019s hatred for Glasser \u2014 their tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>timony was superfluous to the defense case and hence Glasser in all probability was not harmed by the cross-examination which was intended to impeach their credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Moreover, unlike the situations in Grunewald v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and United States v. Tomaiolo, <em>supra, </em>the questions which the witnesses refused to answer before the grand jury were so remote from the crime charged that there was no possibility of a spill-over in the jury\u2019s mind linking Glasser to the witnesses\u2019 assertion of the privilege. See United States v. Sing Kee, 250 F.2d 236, 239-241 (2d Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 954, 78 S.Ct. 538, 2 L.Ed. 2d 530 (1958). As we stated in <em>Sing Kee, </em>\u201cthe crucial question is whether the jury would be likely to equate [the witness\u2019] refusal to answer these few questions before the grand jury with the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d 250 F.2d at 240. In this case, as in that, \u201cthe danger that the jury would believe [the defendant] to be guilty because of his association with [the witness], who had pleaded the Fifth Amendment, was minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Finally, in any event, Judge Motley\u2019s extensive protective instructions were sufficient to dispel any possibility that the jury might have been influenced to discredit the witnesses because of their prior refusal to testify. The jury was told generally and specifically that the refusals could not be the basis of any adverse inference, particularly with regard to credibility. Under all these circumstances, the error in this regard was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">V. Glasser next contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish the conspiracy charged. He argues that threats are necessary to establish \u201cextortion\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1951 of the Hobbs Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that there was no proof of communicated threats here, either through words or actions, especially since windows installed by union shops, as well as those installed by nonunion shops, were damaged with acid. With respect to any alleged threats to the insurance companies, Glasser says that the lists of union glaziers sent to them were not threats, but merely the ordinary solicitation lists sent by unions to insurance companies in the normal course of business. Thus, according to Glasser, there was no evidence that the alleged means were in any way reasonably calculated to accomplish the desired effect. The government replies that there were threats since \u201cactions speak louder than words\u201d; the nonunion glaziers, insurance companies, and store owners all got the point \u2014 nonunion glass installations were likely to be damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">We reject Glasser\u2019s contention. As the Supreme Court stated in American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 787, 66 S.Ct. 1125, 1128, 90 L.Ed. 1575 (1946), the conviction by a jury in a criminal case must be sustained if there is \u201crelevant evidence from which the jury could properly find or infer, beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 that the accused is guilty.\u201d See United States v. Sweig, 441 F.2d 114, 118 (2d Cir., 1971); United States v. Kahaner, 317 F.2d 459, 467-468 (2d Cir.), cert. denied <em>sub now,. </em>Keogh v. United States, 375 U.S. 836, 84 S.Ct. 73, 11 L.Ed.2d 65 (1963); United States v. Lefkowitz, 284 F.2d 310, 315 (2d Cir. 1960); United States v. Skinner, 425 F.2d 552, 554 (D.C.Cir. 1970).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the instant case, the evidence on Count I, the conspiracy count, was clearly sufficient to meet that test. The fact that such evidence was wholly circumstantial is irrelevant, for it is settled that the possible inference of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>defendant\u2019s guilt may be created either by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence. As we stated in United States v. Bowles, 428 F.2d 592, 597 (2d Cir. 1970), \u201ccircumstantial evidence is of no less probative value than testimonial evidence. * * * The question is always whether the jury may rationally and logically infer the ultimate fact to be proved from basic facts, whether established by circumstantial or testimonial evidence, and the surrounding circumstances of the case.\u201d See also Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 139-140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954); United States v. Aadal, 368 F.2d 962 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 970, 87 S.Ct. 1161, 18 L.Ed.2d 130 (1967); United States v. Brown, 236 F.2d 403, 405 (2d Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">The evidence of the existence of the Hobbs Act conspiracy charged here and of Glasser\u2019s participation in it was substantial, if not overwhelming. Destruction of plate glass by acid is a highly unusual, virtually unique method; it was obviously not the casual vandalism of a passer-by. One newly installed storefront after another was thus marred, and the specific type of incident was limited almost entirely to nonunion work. This distinctive and limited kind of destruction, coupled with anonymous communications and the subsequent sending of the lists of unionized glaziers, raises the fair inference that the acidings were indeed threats from the union, for purposes of \u00a7 1951 of the Hobbs Act. Gellert\u2019s testimony, moreover, shows the existence of a conspiracy to violate that Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">Section 1951 also requires \u201cthe obtaining of property from another.\u201d That test was met here. The insurance companies and the storeowners both suffered the direct financial harm resulting from the cost of replacing the ruined windows and paying escalated insurance premiums. The nonunion glaziers whose installations were destroyed also suffered damage, despite Glasser\u2019s argument to the contrary, for they were deprived of the right to seek future plate glass installation contracts. As we stated in United States v. Tropiano, 418 F.2d 1069 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied <em>sub nom. </em>Grasso v. United States, 397 U.S. 1021, 90 S.Ct. 1258, 25 L.Ed.2d 530 (1970), \u201c[the] right to solicit accounts * * * constitute [s] property within the Hobbs Act definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">Glasser\u2019s part in the conspiracy was revealed, albeit circumstantially, through his admitted requests for reports of nonunion activity, through his mailing of the union lists with a covering letter signed by him, and \u2014 primarily \u2014through Gellert\u2019s testimony as to his participation. Finally, there was ample proof that the conspiracy benefited the union and particularly Glasser. In almost every instance where a nonunion installation was destroyed, the replacement work was done by union companies, often those owned by Glasser\u2019s relatives. There was thus more work for members of the union, and more business for Glasser\u2019s family companies. All this was surely enough for the jury to infer beyond a reasonable doubt that the acidings constituted threats by the union, that a conspiracy to extort existed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>and that Glasser played an integral role in that conspiracy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">VI. Finally, Glasser contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt on Counts II and III \u2014 \u2022 the substantive violations of \u00a7 1951. Count II charged the defendants with aeiding the windows of Chemical Bank New York Trust Company on July 14, 1967. The only evidence to support this count was as follows; Benjamin Shepherd, a real estate agent, testified that in July, 1967, he arranged to have the window frames of the Chemical Bank repaired. This involved the temporary removal of the glass and then the replacement of the same glass. The work was done by Aachen Window Corporation, a nonunion shop which primarily does ironwork; it is not a glazier company. During the following weekend, the glass was vandalized by acid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">Count III charged the defendants with aeiding the windows of American Labor-Temp Service on September 10, 1967. The sole evidence supporting this count was testimony by Leo Durocher, the manager of American Labor-Temp, that as part of their building renovation, new glass was installed; that he did not remember the name of the glazier who did the installation; that on the day after the installation, the glass was vandalized by acid; that at that time his assistant found the note, described above, to the effect that when the glass was replaced, he was to make sure it was union glass; and that he hired a union glazier to do the replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-10\">Glasser argues that there was no evidence to connect him with these incidents, and hence that the court should have granted his motion to dismiss these two counts. The government responds that although the evidence was circumstantial, it was substantial enough to support the jury\u2019s verdict \u2014 that Glasser was responsible for the two acidings in question. The government argues that since Glasser was clearly in the center of the conspiracy to intimidate glaziers through aeiding their installations, the jury could well have inferred that he was responsible for these particular acidings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-11\">We disagree with the government on this issue. There was simply not enough evidence to connect Glasser with either of the two acidings which constituted Counts II and III of the indictment. With respect to Count II, since the acidizing substance was available to anyone who wished to purchase it, the vandalism could have been performed by anyone \u2014 steel workers angered at the use of nonunion steel workers, competitors of Aachen Window, or someone with a grievance against the Chemical Bank. The speculative nature of the source of the aeiding is increased by the fact that Aachen Window is a nonunion ironworker, not a glazier, and its competitors are unionized ironworkers. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>the jury\u2019s verdict, which found Glasser guilty on this count, was not supported by any evidence of Glasser\u2019s complicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">Count III was defective in proof for the same reasons. The anonymous note, not produced at trial, can hardly be called proof of guilt. The union itself had over eight hundred members, and evidence received at trial revealed that at least two of those members \u2014 Gellert and Hill \u2014 had on at least one occasion each taken it upon himself to acidize glass without any instruction or directive and without any conspiratorial intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">All that was established on these two counts was that the glass was vandalized and on one occasion a note found. We cannot see how this evidence could have led the jury to find or infer beyond a reasonable doubt that Glasser was guilty of the two acidings in question. Since the evidence was thus insufficient to support a verdict against Glasser on Counts II and III, his conviction on those two counts must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">Affirmed as to Count I; reversed as to Counts II and III.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">. Glasser did object to Cohen\u2019s testimony on the ground that it antedated the alleged conspiracy by two years; and when Cohen stated that the stranger entered a drug store and \u201cpresumably made a telephone call,\u201d Glasser objected to \u201cwhat [Cohen] presumes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">.

Glasser raises another claim of error\u2014 that the evidence was insufficient to show the requisite interference with interstate commerce and hence that there was no federal jurisdiction. He contends that the glass used by the nonunion glaziers was not in interstate commerce because they acquired it from local distributors. He also claims that the effect of his systematic destruction of plate glass store fronts was to enhance commerce rather than to obstruct or delay it, since each ruined window was replaced, thus doubling glass imports for the installations involved and increasing the total volume of commerce in glass.</p>\n<p id=\"AoA\">We reject these contentions. The actual and natural effect of Glasser\u2019s alleged activities was to diminish purchases of glass by nonunion glaziers; and since Glasser concedes that all the glass which they used came originally from outside the state, the deleterious effect on interstate commerce is obvious.
