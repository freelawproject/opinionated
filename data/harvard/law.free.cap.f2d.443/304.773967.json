The district judge acted on the belief that Blatt was denied procedural due process in consideration of his claim to be medically disqualified for military service. We think Blatt\u2019s case does not fall within the narrow exceptions to the bar of preinduction judicial review<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contained in Section 10(b) (3) of the Selective Service <em>Act</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Blatt has a medical history of nasal allergy. He noted this fact on his classification questionnaire when he first registered with his local board in September of 1965. He also enclosed a physician\u2019s letter verifying his condition. Blatt was subsequently classified II-S (student deferment), which he kept (with one slight interruption) until he completed college in 1969. While holding the II-S classification, Blatt submitted additional statements to his local board concerning his allergic condition \u2014once by a \u201ccurrent information questionnaire\u201d supplied by the board, and on two other occasions by letters from his physicians. His physical problems were described by one physician as \u201cperennial allergic rhinitis with a seasonal hay fever * * * \u201d and a history of migraine headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-17\">On July 7, 1969, Blatt was classified I-A (eligible for induction). Neither prior to nor immediately subsequent to this classification action was Blatt accorded a medical interview, nor did he ask for one. See, CFR 1628.2(b) (infra, note 3). After receiving his preinduction physical (not the same thing as a medical interview), he was pronounced acceptable for induction, and on October 14, 1969, was issued an order to report for induction. After receiving the induction order Blatt submitted additional letters from his doctors which emphasized the purported severity of the registrant\u2019s allergic condition. The State Selective Service Headquarters responded by ordering medical consultations at the Armed Forces Entrance and Examining Station (AFEES) where Blatt received a complete ear, nose, and throat (ENT) examination. The examining physician\u2019s findings were inconclusive, but recommended \u201creconsideration in this case before induction into the service.\u201d Pursuant to the recommendation, Blatt\u2019s medical records were again reviewed by the Army and again he was found physically qualified for induction. Blatt filed more letters, and his attorney requested the local board to grant him a hearing, a medical interview, and to reopen his classification. He was granted the hearing and the medical interview, but his case was not reopened on the finding that Blatt had presented no new evidence on which to base a reopening. Captain Ball of the AFEES entered the following on Blatt\u2019s medical file:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-18\">Letter of 16 May Dr. MacKnight and 27 May Dr. Thomas and 18 May Dr. Matson reviewed by USARE C Surgeons office, CPT Hakola. We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>no new </em>evidence presented to justify reopening case * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Blatt charges the defendants with procedural irregularities connected with the determination of the registrant\u2019s physical qualification for induction \u2014 that the local board did not grant Blatt a medical interview upon being classified I-A (no such request was made until after he had received his induction notice) pursuant to C.F.R. \u00a7 1628.2(b) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the board should have reopened Blatt\u2019s classification under C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not reach the merits of these claims because of our finding that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Section 10(b) (3) of the Selective Service Act presents a formidable barrier to preinduction judicial review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">No judicial review shall be made of the classification or processing of any registrant by local boards, appeal boards, or the President, except as a defense to a criminal prosecution instituted under section 12 of this Title [50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462] after the registrant has responded either affirmatively or negatively to an order to report for induction. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">50 U.S.C. App. 460(b) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">The prohibition is about as flat as the Congress could make it. Blatt contends he comes within the exceedingly narrow exception enunciated in Breen v. Selective Service Local Board No. 16, 396 U. S. 460, 90 S.Ct. 661, 24 L.Ed.2d 653 (1970), and Oestereich v. Selective Service Local Board No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968). In these cases, Oestereich\u2019s entitlement to his ministerial exemption and Breen\u2019s qualification for his student deferment were both <em>uncontroverted. </em>396 U.S. at 463-464, 90 S.Ct. 661; 393 U.S. at 238, 89 S.Ct. 414. Both were reclassified I-</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>A under the delinquency regulations after surrendering their draft cards to protest the Vietnam War. \u201cIn both situations a draft registrant who was required by the relevant law not to be inducted was in fact ordered to report for military service. In both cases the order for induction involved a \u2018clear departure by the Board from its statutory mandate,\u2019 <em>Oestereich, supra, </em>at 238, 89 S.Ct. at 416, and in both cases \u00a7 10(b) (3) of the Act should not have been construe to require the registrant to submit to induction or risk criminal prosecution to test the legality of the induction order.\u201d <em>Breen, supra, </em>396 U.S. at 467-468, 90 S.Ct. at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Here the underlying issue is not one of law, despite Blatt\u2019s effort to frame it as a purely legal and procedural question, but is simply whether Blatt is physically disqualified \u2014 a fact question resolved on conflicting medical opinions by the local board, albeit possibly in a procedurally defective manner. The exception to 10(b) (3) discerned in <em>Oestereich </em>and <em>Breen </em>is not one that allows preinduction review, under the guise of correcting procedural irregularity, of purely fact issues committed to the sound discretion and judgment of the local board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, the \u201ckey to the Oestereich rule, as enunciated by the Supreme Court, is whether the classification at issue is a clear statutory mandate preventing any exercise of discretion by the local board.\u201d Winick, Direct Judicial Review of the Actions of the Selective Service System, 69 Mich.L.Rev. 55, 75 (1970). The proper classification of the registrant must be obvious, if not uncontroverted, so that no factual issue exists as to his exempted or deferred status, Lane v. Local Board No. 17 (No. 7740) (1st Cir. 1971), making any attempted reclassification or induction an act that would \u201cflout the law.\u201d Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 260, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968) (Douglas, J., concurring) .</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Blatt\u2019s case does not meet this standard. There exists here a determination on conflicting evidence of medical fitness. We cannot say, as in <em>Oestereich </em>and <em>Breen, </em>even assuming procedural irregularity, that Blatt is clearly entitled to a medical disqualification. Since his medical condition is not clear, his claims must await adjudication until offered as a defense to a criminal action for refusing induction, or by way of habeas corpus after stepping forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">There are practical reasons for reading the statutory bar literally in this case. Presumably, the Army does not want an invalid. Also presumably, at the time of induction Blatt will be routinely examined by a medical officer and may yet be rejected. If not, and if his condition is in fact disabling, he may subsequently obtain a medical discharge. Certainly with respect to medical disability there is no hiatus between adequate medical grounds prior to induction which may be discovered or discerned subsequently. Compare Ehlert v. United States, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Blatt\u2019s case falls squarely within the category of cases causing \u201c \u2018litigious interruptions of procedures to provide necessary military manpower\u2019 (113 Cong. Rec. 15,426 (report by Senator Russell on Conference Committee action)) which Congress sought to prevent when it enacted \u00a7 10(b) (3).\u201d Clark v. Gabriel, <em>supra, </em>393 U.S. at 258-259, 89 S.Ct. at 426. The decision of the district court will be</p>\n<p id=\"As8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-10\">. <em>See </em>Breen v.

Further he alleges that the medical interview given on request later did not meet the standards of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1628.3(b). The government\u2019s position is that a claim for medical disqualification must be made while a registrant holds one of the enumerated classifications (I-A, I-A-O, or I-O) and that the local board is under no obligation to search a registrant\u2019s file to find such a claim submitted before it could be acted upon <em>(i. e., </em>while Blatt held a II-S deferment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b368-14\">. \u00a7 1625.2 When registrant\u2019s classification may be reopened and considered anew.
