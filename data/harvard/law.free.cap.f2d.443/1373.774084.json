Wood with directions to prepare and file his opinion on the issues of plaintiff\u2019s motion and defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment under the order of reference and Rule 166(c). The commissioner has done so in an opinion and report filed on May 12, 1970, wherein such facts as are necessary to the opinion are set forth. Requests for review by the court were filed by both parties and the case has been submitted to the court on oral argument of counsel and the briefs of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-23\">The plaintiff urges that the court go further than the trial commissioner and dispose of the whole of this old case, or at least of certain specified issues, at this time. We have examined each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>such questions raised by the contractor and are satisfied that, on the record as it now stands, we cannot resolve any of them, favorably to the plaintiff, under the standards laid down or implicit in United States v. Anthony Grace &amp; Sons, Inc., 384 U.S. 424, 86 S.Ct. 1539, 16 L.Ed.2d 662 (1966) and United States v. Utah Construction &amp; Mining Co., 384 U.S. 394, 86 S.Ct. 1545, 16 L.Ed.2d 642 (1966). We therefore agree with Commissioner Wood that those issues should not be decided now. As for the Government\u2019s exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s careful analysis of the Board\u2019s opinion in the light of the record, we find those exceptions wholly without merit and adequately answered by the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">Since the court agrees with the opinion and recommended conclusion of the trial commissioner, as hereinafter set forth, it hereby adopts the same, together with the foregoing paragraph, as the basis for its judgment in this case. Therefore, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted as to Count I and defendant\u2019s cross-motion thereto is denied; decision on Counts II and III of the petition is deferred; defendant\u2019s counterclaim is dismissed; and, further proceedings herein are stayed, pursuant to (and subject to the terms of) Rule 167, for a period of six months to afford plaintiff an opportunity to obtain further administrative consideration on the issue whether, on January 13, 1961, plaintiff was in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-5\">OPINION OF COMMISSIONER</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-6\">WOOD, Commissioner:</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-7\">By contract executed June 27, 1960, plaintiff (then styled Telecomputing Corporation), a California corporation, undertook to manufacture and deliver to defendant (acting through the Department of the Navy) 301 airborne terrain clearance radar systems, plus 43 separate power supply units, for a fixed price of $1,744,146. On January 13, 1961, defendant terminated the contract for default. Defendant then entered into a replacement contract with Stewart-Warner Corporation, and assessed against plaintiff, as the excess cost of reprocurement, the sum of $1,347,833.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-12\">On appeal, the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals upheld both the default termination and the assessment of excess cost. Appeal of Telecomputing Corporation, ASBCA No. 7154, 1962 BCA jf 3620.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case is now before the court on cross-motions for summary judgment for review, under Wunderlich Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> standards, of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s petition is in three counts. Count I alleges, <em>inter alia, </em>that plaintiff\u2019s performance was delayed a total of some 109 days by reason of defendant\u2019s failure timely to deliver an adequate Goverment-Furnished Property (GFP) drawing package. Accordingly, Count I asserts, at termination on January 13, 1961, only 44 days after a preproduction model was required to be (but concededly was not) ready for testing, plaintiff was not in default; termination for default was therefore improper; and the Board\u2019s contrary findings and conclusions do not deserve finality.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-14\">Count II, incorporating the allegations of Count I, asserts substantial payment on the assessment of excess cost; that the termination of plaintiff\u2019s contract and the assessment were improper and without legal basis; and that plaintiff is entitled to be repaid all amounts paid to defendant in consequence of the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>sessment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Count III alleges that in any event the assessment was excessive because of defendant\u2019s failure to mitigate damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">For reasons appearing hereinafter, it is concluded that plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be granted as to Count I;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment should be denied as to that Count; that decision on Counts II and III should be deferred; and that plaintiff should be afforded an opportunity to obtain further administrative consideration on the issue whether, on January 13, 1961, plaintiff was in default.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Compare J. D. Hedin Constr. Co. v. United States, 187 Ct.Cl. 45, 408 F.2d 424 (1969); Bailey Specialized Bldgs., Inc. v. United States, 186 Ct.Cl. 71, 404 F.2d 355 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-7\">The radar equipment in suit, commonly called the APG-53A, is a terrain scanning electronic complex largely designed and developed in 1957-1958 at the Naval Avionics Facility, Indianapolis, Indiana (NAFI) for use in low-level land strikes by Navy Douglas A4D carrier-based aircraft. One major component, the azimuth elevation range indicator, was designed and first produced about 1958 by IT&amp;T Federal (formerly known as Farnsworth). Upon demonstration of the feasibility of the APG-53A, it was adopted by the Navy as standard A4D equipment, and NAFI built 80 systems for installation in such aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">A -complete APG-53A system includes a receiver-transmitter group; a power supply; a terrain clearance altitude computer; an azimuth elevation range indicator; a wiring harness; and a control box. In November 1958, a contract for the first commercial procurement of the APG-53A was let to Stewart-Warner Corporation. This contract called for 230 systems, with deliveries ending in April 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-12\">On February 19, 1960, the Bureau of Naval Weapons distributed a Request for Proposals covering the four major components of the APG-53A (receiver-transmitter, power supply, computer, and indicator). Among other things, the Request stated that a model of the \u201cAPG-53A Radar Set, with Manufacturing Drawings\u201d would be available at NAFI for inspection by prospective bidders \u201cfrom 1 March 1960 through 20 March I960 * * * \u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-13\">According to the Board, the Request for Proposals contemplated a \u201ccontract time-table\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-14\">* * * opening of proposals on 30 March 1960; negotiation with contractor submitting low proposal, approvals of facilities, personnel, etc., and security clearance during the next 90 days; award of contract before the expiration of the 90 days, or by 30 June 1960; receipt by contractor of Government furnished property, purchasing or manufacture of component parts, and assembly of a preproduetion model of a complete APG-53A ready <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>for testing in contractor\u2019s plant by November 1960; .further testing of the model by NAFI at its own facilities for the next 120 days; delivery of the APG-53A in March 1961 at an initial rate of 7 per month, accelerating to 10 in April, 17 per month May-November, and 20 per month thereafter to completion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">The Board found that plaintiff \u201cviewed the design data package on display\u201d (hereinafter the \u201cdisplay package\u201d) and, on March 3, 1960, purchased \u201cits own data package * * * \u201d (hereinafter the \u201cbid package\u201d) from the Marbaugh Engineering Supply Company, which \u201creproduced for sale the data and drawings obtained from NAFI.\u201d The bid package (\u201c1 Complete set Prints Mfg., Tooling, Test Bench, etc. APG 53 [sic] Radar Set * * * \u201d) was the subject of many Board findings challenged by plaintiff and treated hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-6\">On March 28, 1960, plaintiff submitted its proposal on 356 systems and extras for which proposals were requested. Plaintiff was low bidder and, after demonstrating financial responsibility and a record of technical proficiency, was approved as a contractor, subject to security clearance, personnel checks, further negotiations, and the like. Security clearance was obtained June 1, 1960, and a contract for 301 systems (rather than the 356 systems \u201cadvertised\u201d), plus extras, was negotiated at a unit price of $5,306 and a total price of $1,744,146.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s contract, executed June 27, 1960, required it to have a preproduction model ready for testing not later than November 1960, and called for deliveries beginning in March 1961, timed to coincide with the phasing out of production under Stewart-Warner\u2019s 1958 contract.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiff failed to assemble the preproduction model ready for testing, in November 1960 or thereafter, and on January 13, 1961, defendant terminated the contract for default, on the stated ground of \u201cfailure to make delivery of preproduction models [sic] within the time specified in the contract.\u201d The re-procurement and excess cost assessment alluded to above followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-10\">THE CONTRACT</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-11\">The \u201cGovernment-Furnished Property\u201d (GFP) clause provided in pertinent part that defendant \u201cshall deliver\u201d to plaintiff, \u201cfor use in connection with and under the terms of this contract, the property described in the Schedule * *, together with such related data and information as the Contractor may request and as may reasonably be required for the intended use of such property * * \u201d and that plaintiff\u2019s \u201cdelivery or performance dates\u201d were \u201cbased upon the expectation that Government-Furnished Property suitable for use will be delivered to the Contractor - * * in sufficient time to enable the Contractor to meet such delivery or performance dates\u201d. The GFP clause further provided that if GFP \u201cis not delivered to the Contractor by such time or times,\u201d or in the event of delivery of such property \u201cin a condition not suitable for the intended use\u201d, the contracting officer, upon timely request, \u201cshall\u201d equitably adjust delivery or performance dates, contract price, or both. Such provisions for adjustment were \u201cexclusive\u201d, with defendant not to be liable to suit for breach of contract for delay in delivery of GFP, or its delivery in a condition \u201cnot suitable for its intended use.\u201d See Preuss v. United States, 188 Ct.Cl. 469, 412 F.2d 1293 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-13\">Section C of the contract Schedule (hereinafter Section C) listed, as government-furnished property, a receiver-transmitter group; a power supply; a computer; an indicator; a radar set con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>trol; and \u201cOne (1) Set AN/APG-53A Drawings\u201d. Immediately thereafter appeared this provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-4\">The Government will malte available to the Contractor for the Contractor\u2019s use hereunder equipment as listed above and, if available, drawings used in the manufacture of such model, provided that making such drawings available shall not constitute a representation by the Government * * * that such drawings, which are solely for informational and guidance purposes, are accurate or complete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1439-8\">The contract also stated that the components to be manufactured by plaintiff \u201cshall [with exceptions not here material] be in accordance with Specification MIL-R-21388 (Aer), dated 1 October 1958, and Amendment No. 1 thereto, dated 15 July 1959, * * * \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 2.1 of Specification MIL-R-21388, \u201cApplicable Documents\u201d, <em>General, </em>provided in part that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-9\">The following documents of the issue in effect on the date of invitation for bids, form a part of this specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-10\">* * ******</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-11\">DRAWINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-12\">\n<em>Bureau of Aeronautics</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-13\">List of Drawings Radar Set AN/APG-53A</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-14\">LD 286962 (see section 6)</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-15\">Section 6.2 \u201cNotes\u201d, <em>Availability of Drawings, </em>read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-17\">Complete sets of manufacturing drawings are available for Radar Set AN/APG \u2014 53A. LD 286962 is an index of all drawing lists required for all of the system components. If a complete set of manufacturing drawings is required, order LD 286962 and copies of all drawings referenced therein. If drawings which pertain to only a specific component are required, consult LD 286962 for the applicable List of Drawings Number, and order only the drawings referenced in the applicable list. Requests for drawings must contain a statement of justification for actual need in relation to a government contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-21\">THE DRAWINGS DELAY</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-22\">On July 1, 1960, four days after contract execution, plaintiff, by letter to the Bureau of Naval Weapons, requested shipment to its subsidiary, Value Engineered Products, Monterey Park, California, of \u201cGovernment-Furnished Property and available drawings to be supplied under the contract\u201d. On July 6 and 8, 1960, NAFI shipped, via airfreight, four \u201cblack box\u201d models and an incomplete set of APG-53A drawings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Omitted were drawings for the indicator; these drawings were then being converted from commercial to military form with, the Board said, information on the military drawings \u201cidentical to the IT&amp;T drawings shown in the display package and included in the [bid] package purchased by [plaintiff] on 3 March\u201d I960.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>The \u201cmilitary set of indicator drawings\u201d was shipped to plaintiff July 22, 1960; a \u201csecond reproducible set of the same drawings\u201d was shipped on July 28, 1960. The date of delivery of these shipments to plaintiff is not clear from the record, but plaintiff claimed, and here alleges, that it received the reproducible drawings on or about August 3, I960.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s position before the Board was, and here is, (1) that defendant did not furnish plaintiff essential drawings until August 3, 1960, and that this delay in furnishing required drawings delayed plaintiff\u2019s performance by 34 days; and (2) that the drawings defendant furnished were, when received, not \u201csuitable for the intended use\u201d, thereby delaying plaintiff an additional 75 days (including seven days claimed for mandatory engineering change orders). The Board found an excusable delay of seven days due to such change orders, but otherwise denied plaintiff\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-5\">\n<em>Late Delivery of Drawings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-6\">In rejecting plaintiff\u2019s contention that it was delayed 34 days by defendant\u2019s late delivery of GFP drawings, the Board found that the display package shown to prospective bidders and the bid package plaintiff purchased from Marbaugh Engineering Supply Company on March 3, 1960, each \u201ccontained about 2,500 drawings, * * * 1712 related specifically to the four black boxes * * * \u201d; that in each package there was a separate and complete set of drawings for each \u201cblack box\u201d; and, that, excluding duplicate drawings of parts and pieces common to more than one component, 1,274 different drawings were \u201cnecessary for the four black boxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-7\">The Board also found that the display package was \u201cthe same as\u201d the bid package; that the bid package contained all drawings necessary to build the four \u201cblack boxes\u201d in compliance with plaintiff\u2019s contract; that plaintiff, from and after March 3, 1960, had in its possession \u201cdrawings authorized and suitable for use in assembling the preproduction model * * * \u201d; that plaintiff \u201ccould have avoided the claimed delay of 34 days by use of the suitable drawings in its possession\u201d; and that any delay in delivery of GFP drawings to plaintiff by defendant was therefore within plaintiff\u2019s control and hence inexcusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-10\">Plaintiff asserts that the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions respecting the bid package drawings are arbitrary, unsupported by any substantial evidence, to the extent based on conclusions of law erroneous, and therefore not entitled to finality. Defendant contends that plaintiff did not pursue the \u201cadministrative procedure\u201d for obtaining an extension of time for late delivery of GFP drawings, and is therefore barred by its failure to exhaust administrative remedies, but that, failure to exhaust aside, the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-11\">Defendant\u2019s failure to exhaust argument has no merit. Both the contracting officer and the Board considered plaintiff\u2019s right to a time extension due to claimed late delivery of GFP drawings (and to a time extension due to claimed unsuitability of drawings as well) \u201con its merits without any point being made\u201d of lack of a proper request for extension of time. Dittmore-Freimuth Corp. v. United States, 182 Ct.Cl. 507, 511, 390 F.2d 664, 668 (1968); see also Blount Bros. Corp. v. United States, 191 Ct.Cl. 784, 787-788, 424 F.2d 1074, 1076, (1970); Fox Valley Engineering, Inc. v. United States, 151 Ct.Cl. 228, 237-238 (1960). Any failure to follow contractual avenues of relief has been waived. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1440-12\">Defendant\u2019s effort to counter plaintiff\u2019s attack on the Board\u2019s \u201cbid package\u201d findings and conclusions also fails. While defendant quotes extensively from, and relies strongly upon, the testimony of Mr. Carboa, the NAFI draftsman who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>made up the display package, and Mr. Hague, also of NAFI, the inventor and developer of the APG-53A, careful study of the administrative record makes it clear that the \u201cfacts affirmatively found by the Board are based on insubstantial evidence.\u201d Dean Constr. Co. v. United States, 188 Ct.Cl. 62, 67, 411 F.2d 1238, 1241 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">Mr. Carboa was admittedly \u201cnot competent to testify to the technical engineering matters.\u201d The bulk of his testimony was directed to the display package, not the bid package itself. He did not testify about the contents of the bid package, which he never saw. He did not furnish the display package to Marbaugh for reproduction, and did not know when it was furnished. He had no dealings with Marbaugh. He knew \u201cvery little\u201d about how Marbaugh reproduced drawings, and was familiar with Marbaugh in only one respect: that \u201cIn this instance they reproduced the display package as a subcontractor of the Government.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">Mr. Carboa did testify, over plaintiff\u2019s objection, that two unsuccessful bidders also purchased drawings from Marbaugh; that no complaint from these unsuccessful bidders had reached him; and that \u201cany question in the normal course of events\u201d would get back to him. The propriety of permitting such testimony aside, it has no probative value. Sternberger v. United States, 185 Ct.Cl. 528, 401 F.2d 1012 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\">Mr. Hague never saw the bid package, the display package, or the GFP package. He was no more than \u201cfamiliar\u201d with the drawings supposedly in the display and GFP packages. He did not,, and could not, testify that the \u201cbid package contained all the drawings necessary to build the four black boxes in compliance with the contract.\u201d His statement that both NAFI and Stewart-Warner had \u201cbuilt successful equipments to the drawings supplied to\u201d plaintiff deserves no weight.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He did not know what plaintiff was supplied. His testimony fails to buttress the Board\u2019s findings as to either the bid or display packages. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1441-10\">Careful scrutiny of the entire administrative record reveals no support for the Board\u2019s findings as to the contents of the bid package, nor for its decision that the bid package was authorized and suitable for use in contract performance. The conclusion that plaintiff could have avoided delay by use of the bid package is arbitrary, unsupported by substantial evidence, and legally erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-11\">While certain other findings and conclusions relating to the claim of late delivery of drawings do not appear to be central to the Board\u2019s disposition of that issue, plaintiff contends, and defendant denies, that they are fatally defective. In view of the necessity for further administrative consideration of this case, comment on certain of these controverted findings and conclusions is now appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-12\"><em>First: </em>The Board properly recognized that defendant was obligated to furnish to plaintiff a complete set of APG-53A drawings, and that plaintiff was entitled to use those GFP drawings in the performance of its contract. The Board nonetheless held that there were <em>two </em>sets of contract drawings (the bid package and the GFP package), \u201cidentical in content except for revisions made in updating the GFP package, and either one sufficient for contract performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-13\">Since, for reasons set forth above, the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions respecting the bid package do not deserve fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>nality under Wunderlich Act standards, these findings and conclusions also fall. There are, however, other difficulties with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">All of the 183 indicator drawings, in the display package in commercial form, were redrawn after February 19, 1960; during the process, which continued into July 1960, known errors in those drawings were corrected. The Board .failed to give any weight to Mr. Hague\u2019s admissions in this respect, for it found that the commercial and military indicator drawings contained \u201cidentical\u201d information.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Assuming the bid and display packages to be \u201cthe same\u201d, the Board\u2019s finding is arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">Moreover, underlying the conclusion that there were two differing sets of \u201ccontract drawings\u201d,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> either sufficient for contract performance, is the clear, if unarticulated, premise that <em>any </em>set of APG \u2014 53A drawings, of whatever vintages, would suffice. Indeed, in tacit concession that the Board held just that, defendant bluntly contends that which revision of a particular drawing was supplied \u201cmade no difference * * As will be seen <em>infra, </em>in connection with the issue of claimed unsuitability of GFP drawings, that holding is an untenable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-7\"><em>Second: </em>The Board also held, and defendant here contends, that the contract made a request by plaintiff for GFP drawings a condition precedent to defendant\u2019s obligation to deliver them to plaintiff. The holding was two-pronged: that it was \u201cincumbent\u201d on plaintiff to advise NAFI to which security cleared facility the drawings were to be shipped, and to notify NAFI, by list number, which drawings it required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-13\">Defendant\u2019s sole authority for the proposition that defendant\u2019s receipt of shipping advice was a precondition to its obligation to deliver GFP drawings is the Board opinion. That proposition has no support in the record, and does not survive analysis. The Board found that plaintiff received security clearance June 1, 1960. Indeed, the record strongly suggests that <em>facility </em>approval, and <em>facility </em>security clearance, were required and given. In any event, however, plaintiff was the \u201cContractor\u201d specified in the GFP clause, and no reason against delivery to that \u201cContractor\u201d is suggested or appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-14\">The second conclusion has no more substance. To quote from the GFP clause, defendant \u201cshall deliver\u201d to plaintiff, in \u201csufficient time\u201d to enable plaintiff to meet delivery or performance dates in its contract, a set of APG-53A drawings suitable for use. This mandatory, and unqualified,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> language, omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>ted by defendant in its quotation of the GFP clause, refutes the contention that defendant\u2019s duty to deliver GFP drawings arose only after a request from plaintiff for the drawings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-4\">But, defendant argues in substance, though not in precisely these terms, Section 6.2, <em>\u201cAvailability of Drawings,\u201d </em>of Specification MIL-R-21388, quoted <em>supra, </em>limits defendant\u2019s obligation under the GFP clause to \u201cdeliver [ing] the drawings upon application.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As defendant construes Section 6.2, it would conflict with the GFP clause and the latter would therefore take precedence. There is, however, no real inconsistency between the GFP clause and Section 6.2. The latter relates to procedures for requesting drawings not elsewhere unqualifiedly promised, \u201cIf * * * required\u201d. Properly read, Section 6.2 is not inconsistent with the GFP clause (itself referring to such <em>other </em>\u201crelated data and information as the Contractor may request and as may reasonably be required * * * \u201d) and does not narrow the obligations there imposed on, and undertaken by, defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-5\"><em>Third: </em>At the Board, defendant asserted, and plaintiff denied, that exculpatory language in Section C<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201ctakes precedence over the \u2018suitability for use\u2019 provision\u201d of the GFP clause, and that, accordingly, defendant was not obligated to provide GFP drawings, did not warrant their suitability, and did provide them \u201csolely for informational and guidance purposes.\u201d In this court, defendant does not go quite so far, but does assert a Schedule C \u201cdisclaimer\u201d. Plaintiff denies the disclaimer any efficacy, and rightly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-11\">Both defendant\u2019s contention administratively, and its present more limited position, are legally erroneous. The conditional and exculpatory portions of Schedule C must be construed as limited to drawings \u201cused in the manufacture of such model,\u201d promised only \u201cif available\u201d and then not warranted, and not as extending to APG-53A drawings suitable for use, to which, under the GFP clause and Schedule C, plaintiff was entitled as a matter of right. See Thompson Ramo Wooldridge Inc. v. United States, 175 Ct.Cl. 527, 535-537, 361 F.2d 222, 228-229 (1966).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-12\">In light of the foregoing, the Board\u2019s decision on plaintiff\u2019s claim of delay due to late delivery of drawings is arbitrary, unsupported by substantial evidence, legally erroneous, and not entitled to any finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s syllogism is that defendant was required to furnish plaintiff a suitable set of GFP drawings no later than July 1, 1960; that plaintiff did not receive a <em>complete </em>set of drawings until August 3, 1960; and, therefore, that defendant\u2019s delay in furnishing drawings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>in and of itself delayed plaintiff\u2019s performance a total of 34 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-4\">The Board made no findings of fact in these areas. The factual questions involved are for initial determination administratively. United States v. Anthony Grace &amp; Sons, Inc., 384 U.S. 424, 86 S.Ct. 1539, 16 L.Ed.2d 662 (1966).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is, however, worthy of present note that, assuming the accuracy of plaintiff\u2019s premises, its conclusion by no means follows inevitably. Drawings for the receiver-transmitter, power supply, and computer were delivered to plaintiff July 12 and 13, 1960, within two weeks from the time plaintiff says it should have had the GFP drawings. As defendant suggests, the excusable delay due to late receipt of a complete set of GFP drawings may prove to be less than that claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-5\">\n<em>The Claimed Unsuitability of Drawings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-6\">The Board also rejected plaintiff's argument that, when received, the GFP drawings were not suitable for use, and that it was thereby delayed some 75 days.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1444-7\">Plaintiff contended administratively that under the GFP clause it was entitled to drawings \u201csuitable for use for their intended use, * * * that is, an immediate release [for purchasing].\u201d As noted above, defendant urged before the Board (and plaintiff denied) that Schedule C \u201ctakes precedence\u201d over the suitability for use provisions of the GFP clause. The Board \u201cfound\u201d that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1444-8\">* * * the opposing arguments do not meet the real issue. The question to be decided is not whether the Government should be exculpated from liability for alleged failure to comply with Standard Provision 33(a) [the GFP clause], but, more precisely, whether the contractor was delayed for causes beyond its control and without its fault or negligence by virtue of the form and manner in which the GFP drawings were furnished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1444-12\">The Board findings and conclusions on this aspect of the case are summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-13\">The Board recognized that, with a five-month period from contract award to preproduction model testing, \u201cthere was no time to lose\u201d, but concluded that plaintiff\u2019s claimed intent to \u201cdump\u201d (release drawings for purchasing immediately upon receipt) was not supported by the evidence. Rather, the Board found, a 30-day period for checking and correcting \u201cinevitable errors, missing or illegible drawings, and in arranging and organizing of drawings,\u201d prior to release for purchasing, was a \u201cnormal interval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-14\">According to the Board, Mr. Cleary, plaintiff\u2019s technical manager,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> was \u201cdismayed and confused by the GFP drawings because some were not of the latest revision and the package was not organized or correlated in an \u2018ideal\u2019 manner suitable for immediate release or \u2018dumping.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Cleary, then asked for, but NAFI refused to make, \u201cthe \u2018ideal\u2019 correlation of drawings, or a take-off from its index of drawing revisions.\u201d In view of this refusal, plaintiff, at the beginning of August 1960, began to compile an inventory of drawings. The inventory, compiled by a technician and clerk, and submitted to NAFI August 25, 1960, \u201ccontained hundreds of errors and was worthless\u201d and plaintiff thus wasted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>the \u201ctime interval between the beginning of August and 5 September\u201d 1960. Plaintiff\u2019s request for a \u201ccorrelation\u201d was properly refused, and a \u201ccollation of such magnitude\u201d was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-4\">On September 5, 1960, plaintiff obtained the services of Mr. Holder, \u201ca mechanical designer and expert on plans who had done the same job for Stewart-Warner.\u201d After August 25, 1960, plaintiff \u201ccalled NAFI * * * and told them to disregard\u201d the August 25, 1960, list, because \u201ca better list, Holder\u2019s, was forthcoming.\u201d Mr. Holder \u201cbegan releasing drawings on 12 September to the purchasing agent\u201d; in two weeks he \u201ccorrelated the GFP drawings into the essential, nonduplicated 1274, and identified the drawings of which the latest revisions were desired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-6\">Mr. Holder \u201csent this list,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>\u201cdrawings of which the latest revisions were desired,\u201d to NAFI in a letter dated September 20, 1960, and received by NAFI September 27, I960.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Mr. Holder \u201chad just come from Stewart-Warner and knew or heard of some revisions out or in preparation of later date than the GFP drawings, which also contained indications of them.\u201d His letter of 20 September consequently states; \u201cwe <em>feel </em>that approximately 60 drawings are missing, chiefly on the indicator.\u201d (Emphasis by the Board.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-7\">The Board also found that \u201cthe GFP plans were ready for release, or dumping,\u201d by September 20, 1960, within the \u201cnormal [30-day] interval,\u201d \u201cexcept for the latest revisions\u201d; that plaintiff \u201cwanted the latest drawing revisions and was willing to wait for them * * * \u201d; that the revisions requested by Mr. Holder reached plaintiff October 17, 1960; and that from \u201cthat date forward [plaintiff] had all the plans and in the shape it needed * * Finally, the Board said, \u201cWe find that the GFP drawings as received by [plaintiff] were susceptible of checking and correcting by competent help into sets capable of being released for purchasing within a normal period of 30 days after receipt, and that such 30 days was not an excusable delay caused by the Government.\u201d This decision is, for reasons indicated below, \u201cin error as a matter of law.\u201d H. L. C. &amp; Associates Constr. Co. v. United States, 176 Ct.Cl. 285, 296, 367 F.2d 586, 592 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-11\">By the terms of its contract, plaintiff was obligated to manufacture a preproduction model conforming to \u201cthe detail design requirements, performance characteristics, tolerances, etc.,\u201d specified in applicable contract drawings, and also completely interchangeable with the GFP \u201cequipment\u201d furnished to plaintiff (as well as \u201cwith the latest model of any previously produced equipment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-12\">Under the GFP clause and Schedule C, defendant was required to furnish, and plaintiff was entitled to receive and to use in the performance of its contract, a suitable set of \u201cAN/APG-53A Drawings\u201d. And, harmonizing these two contract provisions and Specification MIL-R-21388, the Board properly held that the \u201ccontract drawings\u201d consisted of a set of \u201cdrawings of the revisions last issued prior to 19 February 1960.\u201d Thus, at the outset at least, plaintiff\u2019s contract contained an ascertainable, and finite, drawings standard, and one with which plaintiff, and defendant, were both obligated to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-13\">It is crystal clear, from defendant\u2019s continuing updating of the display package to an arbitrary, but unestablished, \u201ccut-off date\u201d for each of the separate components; from the post-February 1960 revision of all drawings for the indicator; from a July 8, 1960, letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>from the Bureau of Naval Weapons to NAFI;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and from other evidence in the administrative record, that plaintiff did not receive GFP drawings conforming to that initial drawings standard. Instead, the GFP drawings theoretically-included all drawings in effect on February 19, 1960 (and not superseded) plus every revision in the drawings between that date and the \u201ccut-off date\u201d for the particular component, and excluded all drawings superseded, either prior to February 19, 1960, or between that date and the cut-off date.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1446-4\">Plaintiff strenuously contends that, after its receipt of GFP drawings, there was mutual if unwritten agreement to a joint \u201cdrawing correction and verification program reconciling and updating the GFP drawings to the latest revisions of the drawings available rather than the IFB drawing revisions,\u201d and mutual agreement that the components would be built to the \u201cmost current revision date\u201d standard. Plaintiff argues that the Board wholly failed to consider this agreement, but contends that, tested by either IFB or most current revision date standard, the GFP drawings were unsuitable for their intended use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-5\">While defendant\u2019s brief perforce and perfunctorily asserts that there is substantial evidentiary support for the Board\u2019s finding of suitability, its arguments reveal both a fundamentally different position, and the real thrust of the Board\u2019s \u201cfinding.\u201d <em>E. g., </em>defendant asserts that there was a \u201ctacit agreement that plaintiff would produce the radar units from the latest revision supplied in the data package supplied to plaintiff as the working drawings * * *\u201d; that plaintiff \u201ccould build acceptable units * * * regardless of the revisions of any particular drawing you had\u201d; that \u201cany revision o,f any particular drawing could have been used to produce the equipment * * * \u201d; that \u201cwhether plaintiff did or did not receive the latest revised drawings is immaterial * * * \u201d; and that \u201cit made no difference as to which revision was used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-10\">Such a reading of the Board opinion is a valid one. The premise underlying the conclusion that the drawings plaintiff received were \u201csuitable\u201d is unstated but on analysis clear. The Board findings that plaintiff received GFP drawings <em>not </em>of the latest revision; that Mr. Holder \u201cgot them [the GFP drawings] into <em>dumpable </em>shape in two weeks,\u201d and that by September 20, 1960, the GFP drawings were ready for dumping <em>\u201cexcept for the latest revisions\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied), abundantly show that when the Board \u201cfound\u201d the GFP drawings suitable for their intended use, the decision was, in essence, a holding that a set of drawings, of any revision of any generation, superseded or not, was \u201csufficient for contract performance\u201d, and fully satisfied defendant\u2019s contractual obligation to plaintiff.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1446-11\">As defendant asserts, Mr. Hague, the inventor of the APG \u2014 53A, did testify that any revision of any drawing could be used to build a satisfactory product, and that he did not even regard as important whether or not the GFP package included drawings superseded by revision prior to February 19, I960.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>also cites, as showing that \u201cplaintiff, at all times, had adequate drawings * * \u201d, an affidavit to the effect that Mr. Hague testified that the preproduction model \u201ccould have been produced * * * from a set of NAFI drawings o,f <em>any </em>revision after the date (1958) when the APG-53A concept was finished.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1447-6\">It would be foolhardy from a technical standpoint, and it is unnecessary from a decisional one, to question the validity of Mr. Hague\u2019s conclusion. For, the crucial issue here is not whether any drawing revision of whatever generation would produce as \u201csatisfactory\u201d equipment as a later revision of that drawing, but whether plaintiff timely received a set of APG-53A drawings \u201csuitable for use\u201d within the meaning of the GFP clause of its contract. As the Board\u2019s opinion demonstrates, that controlling issue was neither reached nor resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-7\">A representation of suitability is \u201cessentially a representation of the existence of a fact\u201d: that government-furnished property is, \u201con the whole, <em>* * * </em>fit for its intended purpose.\u201d Thompson Ramo Wooldridge Inc. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>175 Ct.Cl. at 542, 361 F.2d at 232 (1966). But, this factual question must be \u201cdetermined by reference to the requirements of the contract as a whole * * Preuss v. United States, <em>supra, </em>188 Ct.Cl. at 482, 412 F.2d at 1300; Thompson Ramo Wooldridge Inc. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>175 Ct.Cl. at 544, 361 F.2d at 233; Topkis Bros. Co. v. United States, 155 Ct.Cl. 648, 297 F.2d 536 (1961), rehearing denied 155 Ct.Cl. 680, 299 F.2d 952 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-13\">The Board\u2019s conclusion that drawing revision status was wholly irrelevant resulted in a determination of suitability entirely apart from, not \u201cby reference to,\u201d the requirements of plaintiff\u2019s contract. This ruling involved a decision on a question of law, not of fact, and is erroneous. Aerodex, Inc. v. United States, 189 Ct.Cl. 344, 417 F.2d 1361 (1969). The suitability of the GFP drawings must be determined in light of the applicable contract standard,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> not abstractly and <em>dehors </em>contract terms. See Preuss v. United States, <em>supra, </em>188 Ct.Cl. at 482, 412 F.2d at 1300, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-14\">In the circumstances of this case,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> plaintiff was entitled to GFP drawings reasonably accurate, complete, and consistent, when tested against the applicable contract standard. That, in the bright gleam of hindsight, any revision of any drawing would have produced \u201csatisfactory\u201d equipment is here irrelevant. The Board misapprehended defendant\u2019s obligation under the GFP clause, and accordingly failed to resolve the question whether the GFP drawings were suitable for use when considered in light of plaintiff\u2019s contract as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>Plaintiff contends that the court should find the GFP drawings unsuitable, fix the extent of delay thereby resulting, and hold the default termination legally erroneous. Defendant, at equal length, argues that the GFP drawings were in fact suitable. The Board disposed of plaintiff\u2019s claim of unsuitability on an erroneous legal conclusion and there is notable absence of crucial factual decisions upon which to base a substantial evidence review.

Section C provided that GFP should include \u201cOne (1) Set AN/APG-53A Drawings.\u201d Immediately below the GFP enumeration, this sentence appeared: \u201cThe Government will make available to the Contractor for the Contractor\u2019s use hereunder <em>equipment </em>as listed above, and, <em>if available, draivings used in the manufacture of such model, </em>provided that making such drawings available shall not constitute a representation by the Government, either express or implied, that such drawings, which are solely for informational and guidance purposes, are accurate or complete.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1443-15\">. While defendant says that the language of the Schedule is \u201csimilar\u201d to that before the court in the cited case, the present provision does <em>not </em>\u201cdefine (and therefore limit the reach of) the\u201d GFP clause.

Contract termination occurred <em>44 </em>days after November 1960. Granting plaintiff\u2019s conclusion of 34 days\u2019 delay due to late delivery of drawings, it would still fall just short of being, at termination, not in default. As will be seen, the Board decision on suitability of GFP drawings is not entitled to finality, and further administrative consideration of default <em>vel non </em>is necessary. On the present administrative record, this is not a proper case for invocation of the doctrine stated in Maxwell Dynamometer Co. v. United States, 181 Ct.Cl. 607, 631, 386 F.2d 855, 870 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1444-17\">.

While the Board did not so find, attached to the September 20, 1960, letter \u25a0were, <em>inter alia, </em>lists of drawings bearing the following notations: \u201cWe do not have the following but have reference to\u201d (22 drawings); \u201cthe following are later revisions which we do not have but have reference to\u201d (28 <em>drawings),; </em>and some 27 \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d between drawing revisions plaintiff should have received, according to a list given to it by NAFI August 2, 1960, and what it actually had (or in two instances, \u201cdid not receive\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1446-6\">.

While there is evidence in the record that theory and practice did not coincide, the Board made no findings in this respect, nor did it treat the matter of a change in the applicable contract drawings standard. In the Board\u2019s view, these made no difference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1446-8\">. <em>Cf. </em>Ray D. Bolander Co. v.

Defendant\u2019s witness Haines, in 1960 and 1961 NAFI\u2019s technical representative for supervising private industry APG\u2014 53A contracts, testified that lie expected and wanted plaintiff\u2019s equipment to be built to NAFI\u2019s \u201clatest revisions\u201d; that both plaintiff and the Bureau of Naval Weapons knew of his desires and expectations; and that those \u201clatest revisions\u201d were necessary for plaintiff to build the equipment as NAFI wanted it built. Mr. Haines also testified that when he visited plaintiff\u2019s plant October 17, I960, \u201cthe fact that they were still struggling with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>the drawings to get the latest revision was something that [he was] in sympathy with and fully understood * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1447-9\">. Mr. Hague personally thought it \u201ccertainly desirable\u201d, however, that plaintiff build to latest revision drawings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1447-10\">. It is clear that the original contract drawings standard was not met. Precise definition of defendant\u2019s obligation to plaintiff under the GFP clause (and other relevant contract provisions), and of the source \u2014 mutual agreement or otherwise \u2014 of changes in the original contract standard, should, however viewed in Wunderlich Act terms, be deferred. Other factual matters which may be important in defining that obligation remain to be considered administratively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1447-15\">. As the Board found, when plaintiff received the GFP drawings, it discovered that some of them \u201cwere not of the latest revision * * As the Board in effect also found, defendant was promptly (and repeatedly) advised that plaintiff was having considerable difficulty with the GFP drawings. There is no finding, nor showing, that defendant ever proffered plaintiff any reliable assurances that revision status was immaterial. Evidence that defendant wanted and expected \u201clatest revision\u201d equipment points to the opposite conclusion. <em>Cf. </em>John McShain, Inc. v. United States, 188 Ct.Cl. 830, 412 F.2d 1281 (1969); Allied Contractors, Inc. v. United States, 180 Ct.Cl. 1057, 381 F.2d 995 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">. Since much of the Board record (including all oral testimony) antedates United States v. Carlo Bianchi &amp; Sons, 373 U.S. 709, 83 S.Ct. 1409, 10 L.Ed.2d 652 (1963) supplementation may well be essential to a just decision.
