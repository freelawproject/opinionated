Laws, c. 25, whereby title to property which the commissioner of transportation deems necessary for the construction or reconstruction of state highways vests in the State immediately upon the filing of a description and map of the property to be appropriated in the office of the county clerk or register of the county in which the property is situated,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> without any prior judicial proceeding such as that prescribed for other types of condemnation by Article 2 of the Condemnation Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">Plaintiff, Luther Knight, a resident of Queenstown, Maryland, brought this action against the State of New York apparently late in 1969. He alleged he was the owner of 101 acres of land in the Town of Greece, Monroe County and that, on or about February 6, 1968, the State \u201cattempted to appropriate\u201d 81 of these acres by filing a notice of appropriation and a map in the County Clerk\u2019s office. He further alleged that no notice of appropriation or similar document was served upon him either personally or by mail, although the notice of appropriation showed his address as Queenstown, Maryland, and he would receive mail so addressed; and that on or about July 9 the State attempted to serve notice of the appropriation upon him by filing and recording \u201ca document,\u201d presumably the certificate described in \u00a7 30, subd. 11 of the Highway Law. The complaint went on to allege that the appropriation was for a section of the Rochester Outer Loop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>leading to Lake Ontario State Highway; that the project is funded in part with monies furnished by the United States; that \u00e1 strip not in excess of 400 feet in width sufficed for the Loop except where areas were needed to provide access and that no more than this had been taken both to the south and the north of Knight\u2019s property; that, on reaching this, the State \u201cabruptly enlarged its appropriation to widths varying from over 900 feet to over 2,000 feet, depending upon the amount of plaintiff\u2019s property available\u201d; and that plaintiff had been left with a strip 40 feet wide and over 2000 feet long without any access to a public highway. On the basis of these claims Knight asserted that the appropriation \u201cwas not for a public purpose, was arbitrary, capricious and in bad faith and for the purpose of depriving plaintiff of the use of said property and not for any legitimate public purpose.\u201d The prayer was that the court set aside the appropriation, or set aside so much thereof as was not related to the public use and fix compensation for the part properly taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The State moved to dismiss, alleging that the court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person of the defendant, and that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Before the hearing date Knight made a motion to amend the complaint to add as a defendant Theodore W. Parker, the State Commissioner of Transportation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court denied Knight\u2019s motion and granted that of the State, declaring \u201cThe proper forum for claims that the state has wrongfully appropriated land is the New York State Court of Claims.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Knight\u2019s action against the State fell within the literal prohibition of the Eleventh Amendment. The view, apparently held by Chief Justice Marshall, see Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.), 264, 383, 392, 407, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821), that the Amendment was directed only to the clause of Article III permitting Congress to vest the federal courts with jurisdiction over controversies \u201cbetween a state and citizens of another state\u201d and not to the clause relating to \u201call cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>thority,\u201d was rejected long ago. Louisiana ex rel. Elliott v. Jumel, 107 U.S. 711, 2 S.Ct. 128, 27 L.Ed. 448 (1883); Hagood v. Southern, 117 U.S. 52, 6 S. Ct. 608, 29 L.Ed. 805 (1886); In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, 8 S.Ct. 164, 31 L. Ed. 216 (1887). Indeed, the Court has read the amendment as going beyond its language and has prohibited suit against the state, on constitutional grounds, by one of its own citizens, Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Knight\u2019s reliance on the decision of a closely divided Court in Parden v. Terminal Railway of the Alabama State Docks Department, 377 U.S. 184, 84 S. Ct. 1207, 12 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964), as taking his suit against the State outside the bar of the Eleventh Amendment, is misplaced. That ease held that when Alabama entered the interstate railroad business, nearly twenty years after enactment of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65 (1908), subjecting every \u201ccommon carrier by railroad * * * engaging in commerce between any of the several States\u201d to suits, in federal and state courts, for injuries to employees caused by negligence, it waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity <em>pro tanto. </em>Assuming that the highway project here at issue received federal aid under the Federal Highway Act, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq., we find nothing in that legislation that could be read as requiring a benefiting state to waive its immunity from suit in federal court for an allegedly illegal taking. See Citizens Committee for Hudson Valley v. Volpe, 297 F.Supp. 809 (S.D.N.Y. 1969); DeLong Corp. v. Oregon State Highway Comm., 233 F.Supp. 7 (D.Or.1964), aff\u2019d, 343 F.2d 911 (9 Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 877, 86 S.Ct. 161, 15 L. Ed.2d 119 (1965). Apart from the circumstances in <em>Parden </em>that plaintiff was suing on a cause of action expressly created by Congress with the intention, so the Court found, of conditioning the right to operate an interstate railway upon amenability to employees\u2019 suits in the federal courts, the decision was doubtless influenced by the fact that the state was engaging in activity, constitutionally subject to congressional regulation, which was generally performed by private persons or corporations, 377 U.S. at 196-198, 84 S.Ct. 1207. Highway construction, by contrast, is a distinctly governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The parties have not mentioned, in their exceedingly unhelpful briefs, a stronger basis for exempting this action against the State from the Amendment insofar as the complaint seeks to nullify the appropriation in whole or in part. Article 15 of the New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 81, contains broad authorization for actions to determine claims to \u201can estate or interest in real property,\u201d and \u00a7 1541 permits such an action to be maintained \u201cby or against the people of the state of New York.\u201d Article 15 proceedings have been held to be a proper means for a landowner to contest the appropriation of his land on the ground that the taking was not for a public use. See Buell v. Genesee State Park Comm., 25 Misc.2d 841, 206 N.Y.S.2d 65 (Sup.Ct. Monroe County 1960); cf. City of Albany v. McMorran, 34 Misc.2d 304, 230 N.Y.S.2d 421 (Sup.Ct., Albany County) rev\u2019d on other grounds, 16 A.D.2d 1021, 230 N.Y.S.2d 438 (3d Dep\u2019t 1962).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The availability of this remedy eliminates the concern, which we voiced at argument, over a situation where a state took property with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>out a judicial proceeding and afforded no forum for the owner\u2019s testing the issue of public use. However, it is settled law that a state may \u201cgive its consent to be sued in its own courts by private persons or by corporations, in respect of any cause of action against it and at the same time exclude the jurisdiction of the Federal courts \u2014 subject always to the condition, arising out of the supremacy of the Constitution of the United States and the laws made in pursuance thereof, that the final judgment of the highest court of the state in any action brought against it with its consent may be reviewed or re-examined, as prescribed by the act of Congress, if it denies to the plaintiff any right, title, privilege, or immunity secured to him and specially claimed under the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d Smith v. Reeves, 178 U.S. 436, 445, 20 S.Ct. 919, 922, 44 L.Ed. 1140 (1900). The question thus becomes one of interpreting the consent given in \u00a7 1541 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law. While we have found no New York decision on the point, the Supreme Court has admonished that federal courts ought not \u201cto be astute to read the consent to embrace Federal as well as state courts\u201d and that only a \u201cclear indication\u201d of the state\u2019s intention to submit to suit in federal courts will surmount the Eleventh Amendment\u2019s bar, Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U.S. 47, 54, 64 S.Ct. 873, 877, 88 L.Ed. 1121 (1944). See, to the same effect, Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury of Indiana, 323 U.S. 459, 465-466, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945); Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm., 327 U.S. 573, 577, 66 S.Ct. 745, 90 L.Ed. 862 (1946). We find no such \u201c\u2018clear indication\u201d here.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The question whether the court properly denied leave to amend so that the suit might proceed against the commissioner of transportation is considerably more difficult. It may be useful to begin by narrowing the frame wherein the issue falls. It is altogether plain that if the appropriation had been effected by a suit instituted by the State and Knight had raised the issue of public use, or if he had presented that issue by bringing a proceeding against the State under Article 15 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, a judgment against him would be subject to review by the Supreme Court. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska, 164 U.S. 403, 17 S.Ct. 130, 41 L.Ed. 489 (1896); Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles County, 262 U.S. 700, 43 S.Ct. 689, 67 L.Ed. 1186 (1923); Smith v. Reeves, <em>supra. </em>It is equally clear that, under the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), a person in Knight\u2019s position could have sued for an injunction in the federal courts, in advance of the taking, to restrain the commissioner from effecting the appropriation on the ground that this was not for a public use, although the court might perhaps have abstained if state proceedings would afford adequate relief. See Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25, 79 S. Ct. 1070, 3 L.Ed.2d 1058 (1959), and Martin v. Creasy, 360 U.S. 219, 79 S.Ct. 1034, 3 L.Ed.2d 1186 (1959), but contrast County of Allegheny v. Frank Mashuda Co., 360 U.S. 185, 79 S.Ct. 1060, 3 L.Ed.2d 1163 (1959). See C. Wright, Federal Courts 200-01 (2d ed. 1970). The question is whether the Eleventh Amendment demands a different result when the owner does not sue the officer in federal court until after title has vested in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Most of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions dealing with the application of sovereign immunity to suits against officers alleged to be holding property illegally taken have related to federal officials. No useful purpose would be served by a complete review; the Court itself has recognized that \u201cto reconcile completely all the decisions of the Court in this field prior to 1949 would be a Procrustean task,\u201d Malone v. Bowdoin, 369 U.S. 643, 646, 82 S.Ct. 980, 983, 8 L.Ed.2d 168 (1962). Nineteen forty-nine was the date of what many regard as the unfor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>t\u00fanate opinion of Chief Justice Vinson in Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628. The <em>Larson </em>Court said there were only two types of cases in which \u201csuits for specific relief against officers of the sovereign\u201d would not constitute \u201csuits against the sovereign,\u201d 337 U.S. at 689-691, 69 S.Ct. at 1461. \u201c[W]here the officer\u2019s powers are limited by statute, his actions beyond those limitations are considered individual and not sovereign actions\u201d; so also when \u201cthe power has been conferred in form but the grant is lacking in substance because of its constitutional invalidity,\u201d an action may be maintained. The approving quotation from Mr. Justice Hughes\u2019 opinion in Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, 223 U.S. 605, 620, 32 S.Ct. 340 (1912), and also the extract from the <em>Larson </em>opinion quoted in fn. 5, <em>infra, </em>make clear that the second category embraces cases where the statute is constitutional (in the <em>Stimson </em>case, preserving the navigability of a river) but the particular application is claimed not to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">If the <em>Larson </em>opinion had stopped there, it would occasion no difficulty to Knight since his claim is of the latter sort. However, the Court immediately qualified its statement by saying in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">11 Of course, a suit may fail, as one against the sovereign, even if it is claimed that the officer being sued has acted unconstitutionally or beyond his statutory powers, if the relief requested cannot be granted by merely ordering the cessation of the conduct complained of but will require affirmative action by the sovereign or the disposition of unquestionably sovereign property. North Carolina v. Temple, 1890, 134 U.S. 22, 10 S.Ct. 509, 33 L.Ed. 849 (1890).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aic\">The <em>Larson </em>footnote has become the subject of microscopic scholarly scrutiny. Professor Jaffe has seized on the use of \u201cmay\u201d rather than \u201cmust\u201d and notes that the <em>Temple </em>case cited in the footnote was a suit to require the state to levy taxes to fund bonds, an action lying at the very core of the Eleventh Amendment prohibition. He points out also that, if taken literally, the language would overrule a long line of decisions providing mandamus to order the grant of a patent to lands of the United States. Judicial Control of Administrative Action 226-27 (1965); cf. West Coast Exploration Co. v. McKay, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 307, 213 F.2d 582, cert. denied, 347 U.S. 989, 74 S.Ct. 850, 98 L.Ed. 1123 (1954). Whatever the merits of this position and of the even broader assaults of Professor Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, 1970 Supp., ch. 27, the Court has not shown itself disposed to narrow <em>Larson. </em>In Malone v. Bowdoin, <em>supra, </em>it reaffirmed that opinion\u2019s statement that United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 1 S.Ct. 240, 27 L.Ed. 171 (1882), had \u201ccontinuing vitality only \u2018where there is a claim that the holding constitutes an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation,\u2019 \u201d 369 U.S. at 648, 82 S.Ct. at 983-984, citing 337 U.S. at 697, 69 S.Ct. 1457. In Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 620, 83 S.Ct. 999, 1006, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963), the Court stated the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVu\">that a suit is against the sovereign if \u201cthe judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public administration,\u201d * * * or if the effect of the judgment would be <em>\u201cto </em>restrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>See also Fresno v. California, 372 U.S. 627, 83 S.Ct. 996, 10 L.Ed.2d 28 (1963). In Hawaii v. Gordon, 373 U.S. 57, 58, 83 S.Ct. 1052, 1053, 10 L.Ed.2d 191 (1963), the Court dismissed a suit against the Director of the Budget, seeking to compel him to take certain action with respect to Government land, as being an unconsented suit against the United States since \u201cthe order requested would require the Director\u2019s official affirmative action, affect the public administration of government agencies and cause as well the disposition of property admittedly belonging to the United States.\u201d While none of these cases involved a taking subject to substantial constitutional challenge as not for a public purpose, it does appear that the attack in <em>Gordon </em>was based upon the officer\u2019s failure to discharge a statutory duty \u2014 a challenge which would seem to fall within the first <em>Larson </em>exception to sovereign immunity. The Court\u2019s failure to note this may suggest that <em>Larson\u2019s </em>footnote 11 was deemed controlling. In any event, whether or not the Court could qualify note 11 without having to overrule any of these cases, the task of doing so, whether as regards suits against the United States or those encountering the bar of the Eleventh Amendment, is better left to the only body that can speak with authority. We find this course particularly attractive when, as has already been demonstrated and will further appear below, plaintiff has an adequate remedy in the New York courts and a decision by us, only dubiously valid, sustaining federal jurisdiction over a suit against New York officials would open the way for a host of actions on a subject where the knowledge of local conditions possessed by state courts may be peculiarly important.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">It remains to consider certain decisions that might be read to indicate that New York would not view an action against the commissioner of transportation challenging the constitutionality of the taking as a suit against the state. While a state surely cannot increase the scope of its Eleventh Amendment immunity by defining suits against state officers to be actions against the sovereign even though the Supreme Court would not deem them to be such under <em>Ex parte Young </em>and its progeny, it could be argued with some force that the converse does not hold. While Knight cannot bring a proceeding under Article 78 of the CPLR to review the commissioner\u2019s decision, because the determination of what land to take is deemed legislative in character,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> New York does permit a declaratory judgment or injunctive suit to challenge the acts of an officer making a legislative determination \u201con any of the grounds open to judicial review of quasi-legislative decisions, namely, that the [commissioner] acted in disregard of statutory standards, in excess of [his] grant of authority, in violation of due process or in a discriminating manner. [Such an action] may also attack the constitutionality of the statute delegating power to act.\u201d Lakeland Water Dist. v. Onondaga County Water Authority, 24 N.Y.2d 400, 301 N.Y.S.2d 1, 6, 348 N.E.2d 855, 858 (1969).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There have been a number of cases where New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>York courts, applying this general principle, have entertained complaints that takings have been beyond statutory authority or constitutional right. See, e. g., Schulman v. People, 10 N.Y.2d 249, 219 N.Y.S.2d 241, 176 N.E.2d 817 (1961) (Real Property Law Article 15 proceeding); Brown v. McMorran, 42 Misc.2d 211, 247 N.Y.S.2d 737 (Sup.Ct. Westchester County 1963) rev\u2019d on other grounds, 23 A.D.2d 661, 257 N.Y.S.2d 74 (2d Dep\u2019t 1965); City of Albany v. McMorran, 34 Misc.2d 304, 230 N.Y.S.2d 421 (Sup.Ct., Special Term, Albany County), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 16 A.D.2d 1021, 230 N.Y.S.2d 438 (3d Dep\u2019t 1962); Saso v. State, 20 Misc.2d 826, 194 N.Y.S.2d 789 (Supreme Court, Westchester County, 1959).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, in view of the State\u2019s explicit consent to be named as a defendant in proceedings under Article 15 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, it is difficult to determine whether such decisions are to be taken as expressing a less extensive notion of sovereign immunity than the Supreme Court has recognized for federal courts in the <em>Larson </em>footnote, or merely as acknowledging that there would be little point in holding sovereign immunity a bar to a declaratory or injunctive suit in a New York court when an Article 15 action which in effect seeks the same relief is allowed. Furthermore even if the decisions conveyed a clearer indication of New York\u2019s views on the subject of sovereign immunity than they do to us, there would be the same question, noted in our discussion of Article 15 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, whether a relinquishment by New York of the full permissible scope of sovereign immunity in actions challenging the validity of condemnations where the plaintiff has not expressly proceeded under Article 15, would extend beyond actions in its own courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\">. Section 30, subd. 6 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">A copy of such description and map shall be filed by the superintendent of public works in the office of the county clerk or register of each county in which such property, or any portion thereof, is situated and thereupon the appropriation by the state of the property described in such description and map shall be deemed complete and the title to such property shall be vested in the people of the state of New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0d\">Section 30, subd.. 1(b) provides that, in the case of major projects, there shall be a prior submission to the county board of supervisors, which is permitted but not required to conduct a public hearing on reasonable notice to the State and \u201cto such other party or parties deemed by said board of supervisors to be interested in the project.\u201d Section 30, subd. 10 requires the commissioner of transportation to cause a copy of the description, map and notice of appropriation to be served personally on each owner certified to him by the attorney-general \u201cif the person to be served, can be found within the state.\u201d If he is unable to effect such service \u201cafter making an effort so to do which he shall deem to be reasonable and proper,\u201d he is directed to file a certificate to that effect in the office of the county clerk who then effects service by filing and recording the description, map, and notice of appropriation and indexing the same in his deed index book. The two year period for filing a claim for compensation in the New York Court of Claims runs from personal service or, if personal service cannot be made within the state, from the filing of the description and map and the recording of the filing. Court of Claims Act, \u00a7 10, subd. 1.

In 1967, Laws c. 717, \u00a7 51, all functions and powers of the superintendent of public works which pertained to the Highway Law were transferred to the commissioner of transportation.

While we should not read the relevant statute as giving the Court of Claims jurisdiction to determine the propriety of the taking, as distinguished from the fixing of compensation, Court of Claims Act, \u00a7 9, subd. 2, the State argues that an unreported opinion does so hold. Idylbrook Farms, Inc. v. State, aff\u2019d without opinion, 22 A.D.2d 761, 253 N.Y.S.2d 747 (4th Dep\u2019t 1964). Examination of the opinion indicates it does not go quite so far as the State contends; it held only that a reservation purporting to limit the right of access from land formerly abutting a relocated highway to the period in which the retained land should be used \u201cfor retail store purposes\u201d was a nullity since \u00a7 30 of the Highway Law gave no authority to limit the character of an owner\u2019s easement of access. While there is language to the effect that the Court of Claims may award equitable relief when incidental to a claim for a money judgment, see Pearlman v. State, 18 Misc.2d 494, 191 N.Y.S.2d 422 (Ct.Claims 1959), this incidental equitable jurisdiction appears to be quite limited \u2014 e. g., awarding restitution incidental to a contractual claim, Pearlman v. State, <em>supra. </em>Since the Court of Claims has no independent equitable jurisdiction, see Mowers v. State, 168 Misc. 651, 6 N.Y.S.2d 408 (Ct.Claims 1938), it has been held that a suit to rescind a bid for a state contract and obtain an injunction for return of the funds cannot be maintained in that court. Psaty v. Duryea, 282 App.Div. 94, 121 N.Y.S.2d 703 (3d Dep\u2019t 1953) aff\u2019d, 306 N.Y. 413, 118 N.E.2d 584 (1954); cf. Tompkins v. State, 33 Misc.2d 828, 227 N.Y.S.2d 475 (Ct.Claims 1962) (court awards damages for nuisance but says it lacks jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the state as well).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\">. Since such an action would seem to fall under the 10-year period of limitations provided in CPLR \u00a7 212(a), cf. Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law \u00a7 311, Knight is still in a position to bring this type of suit. See Low v. People, 263 App.Div. 434, 33 N.Y.S.2d 1015 (3d Dep\u2019t 1942) (holding this to be the proper period of limitations under article 15 of the old Real Property Law and \u00a7 34 of the old Civil Practice Act); 16 Carmody Wait 2d New York Practice, \u00a7 101.8, at 606; cf. New York Water Service Corp. v. Palisades Interstate Park Comm., 12 A.D.2d 646, 208 N.Y.S. 2d 460 (2d Dep\u2019t 1960), appeal denied, 12 A.D.2d 817, 211 N.Y.S.2d 706 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">. While the Court said, later in the opinion, that \u201cthe action of an officer of the sovereign (be it holding, taking or otherwise legally affecting the plaintiff\u2019s property) can be regarded as so \u2018illegal\u2019 as to permit a suit for specific relief against the officer as an individual only if it is not within the officer\u2019s statutory powers or, if within those powers, <em>only if the powers, or their exercise in the particular case, are constitutionally \u25a0void,\" </em>337 U.S. at 701-702, 69 S.Ct. at 1467 (emphasis supplied), we do not read this summary as retracting the footnote.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b483-4\">. The Assistant Attorney General\u2019s statement at argument that an Article 78 proceeding against the commissioner would have been the proper way for Knight to liave sought relief seems to be clearly wrong. See Brent v. Hoch, 13 A.D.2d 505, 211 N.Y.S.2d 853 (2d Dep\u2019t 1961), affirming 25 Misc.2d 1062, 205 N.Y.S.2d 66 (Sup.Ct., Special Term, Suffolk County 1960), on the ground that the commissioner of mental hygiene\u2019s determination to acquire real property he deems necessary for a state institution is legislative in character and thus not reviewable under Article 78; cf. Schulman v. McMorran, 9 A.D.2d 1007, 195 N.Y.S. 2d 5 (3d Dep\u2019t 1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b483-11\">. Since such an action would not be and could not have been brought under Article 78, the four-month statute of limitations relating to such proceedings, OP LB. \u00a7 217, should not apply; rather the action would be governed by the six-year period for \u201can action for which no limitation is specifically prescribed by law,\u201d OPLB \u00a7 213(1). We thus have no occasion to consider whether New York could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>constitutionally enforce a four-month statute of limitations for challenging the validity of an appropriation when it had failed to take easily available steps to give personal notice of the taking. The contrary is strongly indicated by such cases as Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 315, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950); Walker v. City of Hutchinson, 352 U.S. 112, 77 S.Ct. 200, 1 L.Ed.2d 178 (1956); and Schroeder v. City of New York, 371 U.S. 208, 83 S.Ct. 279, 9 L.Ed.2d 255 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\">. None of these cases is cited or discussed in the briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">. A crowning irony of this ill presented case is that the complaint was clearly subject to dismissal on a ground that apparently did not occur to anyone, namely, its failure to allege that \u201cthe matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs * * * \u201d required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a). The action obviously does not fall within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (3), so long as Mr. Justice Stone\u2019s opinion in Hague v. C. I. O., 307 U.S. 496, 518, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939), remains the law in this circuit. See Eisen v. Eastman, 421 F.2d 560, 564\u2014566 (2 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 841, 91 S.Ct. 82, 27 L.Ed.2d 75 (1970). We have written on the assumption that plaintiff could have cured this defect by amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
