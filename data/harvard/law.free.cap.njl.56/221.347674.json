Sup., p. </em>29, <em>pi. </em>9), to recover penalties under the Gaming act for setting up a lottery in this state, it is necessary to set out in the affidavit, to procure the attachment, not only the title of the Gaming act, but also the title of the Crimes act, the fifty-first section of which declares what lotteries are prohibited by the laws of this state.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">On motion to quash attachment.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b249-7\">Argued at June Term, 1893, before Justices Van Syckel and Reed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-8\">For the motion, <em>William H.

Sup., p. 29, pl. </em>9.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">That act provides that the suit may be instituted by attachment, where the penalty is recoverable under and by virtue of the provisions of any statute or statutes, when the person who has incurred the penalty absconds or is non-resident in this state; <em>\u201cprovided, </em>that the oath or affirmation required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the act to which this is a supplement shall declare for what penalty the action is brought, and shall contain the title or titles of the statute or statutes under which such penalty or penalties have accrued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The affidavit upon which the attachment was issued sets forth that the defendant has incurred one hundred and forty-four penalties of *$2,000 each, under the provisions of an act entitled \u201cAn act to prevent gaming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The act of 1886 requires that the affidavit shall contain the title or titles of the statute or statutes under which such penalty or penalties have accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The only act referred to in the affidavit is the \u201cAct to prevent gaming.\u201d That act provides that any person who shall set up a lottery prohibited by the laws of this state shall be liable to the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The fifty-first section of the Crimes act <em>{Rev., p. </em>236) declares what lotteries are prohibited by the laws of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">That statute is therefore one of the legislative enactments under which the penalties sued for have accrued, and it is necessary, under the proviso of the act of 1886, to set out the title of that act also in a proceeding by attachment to recover the penalties. This is a necessary averment to give the court jurisdiction. The omission is fatal and the writ should be quashed. It is not necessary to decide whether the affidavit states with sufficient certainty what penalties are sought to be recovered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
