The ordinance ordering its construction cannot now be attacked, but Reassessment will be set aside, that it may be made under the act of 1882. .If the relators had not interposed promptly to set aside the assessment, public policy would constrain the court to deny the right of the relators to assail the assessment-..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
