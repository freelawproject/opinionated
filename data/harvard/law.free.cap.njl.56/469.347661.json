For a like reason, .the supplement to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>act, approved March 22d, 1886 <em>[Rev. Sup., p. </em>736), must be-condemned. <em>\u00a1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Except these two enactments, all laws empowering municipal authorities to publish their proceedings in newspapers\u2019 (so far' as we have discovered) are silent with regard to the language in which the newspapers must be published, and-therefore, according to <em>Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Jersey City, 25 Vroom </em>437, only newspapers published in the English language can. be employed. This conclusion defeats the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">But the ordinance is subject to another objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u201cAn act in relation to city printing and official advertisements in cities of the second class in this state,\u201d approved April 8th, 1892 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>414), declares that it shall be-lawful for the common .council, board of aldermen or other governing body, with the consent of the mayor, of any city of the second class in this state to designate by resolution the official newspaper or newspapers published in any such city, in which shall be solely published all official notices,, ordinances, advertisements, minutes and official proceedings relating to the municipal affairs of such city, and that all-inconsistent acts and parts of acts, general, special, local and private, are repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">This* statute seems to provide a complete scheme for the-designation of official newspapers in cities of the second class,, and consequently, under the rule sanctioned by the decisions in <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>11 Vroom 257; <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Cape May, </em>23 <em>Id. </em>180, and <em>Central Land Co. </em>v. <em>Bayonne, ante p. </em>297, it supplants and annuls all earlier laws having the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">As Trenton is a city of the second class,'the consent of the-mayor was, by this act, made necessary to the validity of the-council\u2019s resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">The ordinance must be set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
