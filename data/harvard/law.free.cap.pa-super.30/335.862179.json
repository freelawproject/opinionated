J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-5\">This is an appeal from a summary conviction under the Act of May 29, 1901, P. L. 802.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\">The defendant is charged with the violation of the provisions of the second section thereof, which reads as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-7\">\u201c That from and after the passage of this act it shall be unlawful to fish for game fish in any of the waters of this commonwealth in any manner except with rod, hook and line, or with hand line having not more' than three hooks; or for food fish with any device not specifically permitted in this act. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall, on conviction thereof, as provided in section thirty-eight of this act, be subject to a fine of twenty-five dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-8\">The case came before the court on appeal, as stated, and was heard in accordance with the practice in cases of summary conviction, when it appeared that the defendant was arrested by a special fish warden for fishing with rod, hook and line, and with hand lines, in the Susquehanna river. The justice fined the defendant $25.00. The evidence taken before the court clearly shows that he was fishing with a rod, hook and line, and also with one hand line with two hooks thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-9\">It was claimed by the commonwealth that he had two hand lines in use, but the weight of the evidence is against such contention. Therefore we find as a fact that he was fishing with but one hand line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-10\">The only question before us is this: Is it unlawful for a person to fish with a rod, hook and line, and a hand line having not more than three hooks, at the same time ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-11\">The section referred to makes all manner of fishing for game fish unlawful except two specified modes. Those two methods are legalized. The legislature has said to the individual: \u201cYou <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>may fish for game fish in two ways, first, with rod, hook and line ; second, with hand line haying not more than three hooks \u2014all other modes are prohibited.\u201d This, in our opinion, does not mean to confine the person to one or the other of these methods. If the word <em>\u201c </em>and \u201d had been substituted for \u201c or,\u201dit could have been contended with equal plausibility, that both modes were meant to be employed at the same time. To escape this construction, the word \u201c or \u201d may have been used. However this may be, we think the section under consideration simply distinguishes the unlawful from the lawful modes of fishing, and that, if a person avoids the former, he is not required to make a choice of the latter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-4\">If the meaning of this provision or the law is not clear, we must apply the rule of interpretation governing in such-cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-5\">Penal statutes must be construed in case of doubtful meaning, in favor of the accused, and it is a reasonable expectation that when the legislature \u201c intends the infliction of suffering, or an encroachment upon natural liberty or rights, or the grant of exceptional exemptions, powers and privileges, it will not leave its intention to be gathered by mere doubtful inference, or convey it in cloudy and dark words only; for an offense cannot be created or inferred by vague implications, \u2014 but will manifest it with reasonable clearness : \u201d Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes, p. 452. If the legislative intent had been to prohibit fishing with a rod, hook and line and a hand line at the sanie time, we think it would have been definitely expressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-6\">In the absence of such expression, we think it was not intended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-7\">Therefore, the defendant has not been guilty of a violation of the act under which he was arrested, and accordingly, he is now discharged. The county is directed to pay the costs of prosecution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the judgment of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-9\"><em>O.

L. 302, which provides that, \u201c it shall be unlawful to fish for game fish in any waters of this commonwealth, in any manner except with rod, hook and line, or with hand line having not more than three hooks.\u201d This is a penal statute and the rules governing the construction of such statutes are applicable notwithstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the fact that the penalty for its violation is simply a fine. The words of the section indicate that what the legislature had in mind was the \u201c manner \u201d of fishing; they do not clearly prohibit the use of both devices mentioned at the same time. The court below in a carefully considered opinion said that if the legislative intent had been to prohibit fishing with a rod, hook and line, and a hand line at the same time, it would have been expressed in definite and unequivocal language. We concur with the learned judge in his conclusion and the reasons set forth in his opinion in support thereof. We can add nothing profitably to what he has said upon the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
