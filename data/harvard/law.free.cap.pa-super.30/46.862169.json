The executors, Mary Ellen O\u2019Neill and Edward J. Brophy, \u201cacting in pursuance of the power and authority conferred upon them by the will of the said decedent, and for the purpose of. paying the debts of the said decedent,\u201d by a formal deed duly executed and delivered, sold the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>in dispute in this case, No. 1019 Master street, and other property of the decedent, No. 1017 Master street, to James Flaherty for $6,500 which purchase money was received by the executors and duly accounted for by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">This action of ejectment was brought to recover the possession of No. 1019 Master street from Elizabeth Burns, who occupied the premises by virtue of the ninth paragraph of John O\u2019Neill\u2019s will, and the only question raised by this appeal is whether, under the admitted facts of the case, the plaintiff was required to show affirmatively that the sale by the executors was in fact necessary in order to carry out the provisions of the will. Had John O\u2019Neill intended that Elizabeth Burns should have a life estate in the premises he could have declared his intention by easily understood words. The defendant accepted the devised property upon the condition annexed to it, viz : \u201c so long as the same may remain in its present condition, and the property of my estate \u201d and, she must be held bound by the terms of the condition if the power given the executors in the will was properly exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The executors were given ample power and authority to sell all or any part of the decedent\u2019s real estate for the purpose of paying the debts, and carrying out the other provisions of his will. It would be a strained construction to limit the application of the words \u201c as they shall deem best \u201d ; \u201c as in their judgment \u201d ; \u201c as they may deem proper \u201d to fixing the amount of the purchase money and securing its payment and not apply them to the power and authority to make the sale. The payment of the debts was not the sole and determining reasoil which would justify the sale, as the payment of the legacies and administration of the trusts mentioned in the will may have been as active and persuasive inducements as the payment of the debts. They were given a large discretion in their disposition of the estate, and this legatee could not require them to subordinate the interests of creditors or the other legatees to her own. Such was not the intention of the testator as gathered from the words of his will. Nor was the purchaser, after paying the fair price of the land, required to see to the application of the purchase money, as the testator had specifically exempted him from all liability in regard to it. It follows that the sale was a valid execution of the power given to the exec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>utors and vested a good title to the lot in the purchaser. If this purchaser would be required to investigate, whether a necessity for a sale existed and conclude that it did exist, and the legatee differ with him in such conclusion, the validity of the title would be made to depend on the verdicts of as many juries as the parties might be able to secure in determining the very question which the testator declared should be decided by his executors. \u201cIt would render the power useless, for no prudent man would buy under such a load of responsibilities : \u201d Grant v. Hook, 13 S. &amp; R. 259; Doran v. Piper, 164 Pa. 430. The plaintiff had a right to rely on the deed given to him in the execution of that power, and the court rightly rejected the offer to attack its validity by having one of the grantors, after having accepted the full consideration, contradict his solemn declaration made in the deed, and deny his authority to make it, without any suggestion of fraud, accident or mistake in the transaction. The witness had joined with his coexecutor in making the sale, and induced the plaintiff to part with his money, which represented the fair value of the land. The rules of law as well as the dictates of common honesty hold him to be estopped in denying that his exercise of this discretionary power, as executor, was for the best interests of the estate', and, from destroying the title which he created, after he had received full consideration for the property: McPherson v. Cunliff, 11 S. &amp; R. 422; Root v. Crock, 7 Pa. 378; Maple v. Kussart, 53 Pa. 348; Monticilli v. Meyer, 193 Pa. 545. The mistake in awarding the plaintiff money damages in\u2019 the verdict, was corrected, and the judgment entered was for the land described in the writ, without prejudice to his right to bring suit for mesne profits. The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
