J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-8\">On May 27, 1903, Charles H. Harper presented to the Fanners\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 National Bank of Winchester a check drawn by J. K. Lehman on the Elizabethtown National Bank for $900, with the request that it be cashed. It was not at that time paid, but a telegram was sent by the plaintiff bank to the Elizabethtown National Bank, as follows: \u201c Will you pay check J. K. Lehman $900 ? \u201d To this telegram, H. C. Lewis, cashier of the Elizabethtown National Bank, replied: \u201c Will pay J. K. Lehman check Nine Hundred Dollars.\u201d The plaintiff bank then notified Mr. Harper that the check was good and would be paid, and this was accordingly done. It was then forwarded for collection through the Girard National Bank of Philadelphia, in the usual course of business, but payment was refused by the Elizabethtown National Bank because Lehman had, in the meantime, stopped payment. The check was, as a consequence, protested. There was also some little difficulty about the indorsement, Harper having signed his name thereon as \u201c Charles H. Harper, Jr.,\u201d to distinguish himself from another person of the same name ; but this, we think, is of no vital importance, as the man to whom the check was given and with whom the transaction was had was the man who indorsed the check. Under the above facts, we were of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and so instructed the jury. The first question arising relates to the correctness of the instructions fixing liability on the defendant, and the second, to the quantum of proof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>In Central Guarantee Trust and Safe Deposit Company v. White, 206 Pa. 611, the present Chief Justice, in discussing the certification of checks, says: \u201c A check by a depositor on his account certified by the bank becomes an obligation of the bank to the payee or holder, and in the absence of fraud or similar exceptional circumstances, the amount is as much withdrawn from the depositor\u2019s account as if the money had been paid oyer the counter.\u201d By such a certification, the deposit, which is represented by the check, ceases to stand to the credit of the depositor and passes to the credit of the check holder, who is thereafter a depositor to that amount: Girard Bank v. Bank of Penn Township, 39 Pa. 92. The holder who.receives it in the ordinary course of business, in good - faith, is a bona fide holder, and entitled to recover from the drawee, even though the check was obtained by the original payee by false pretense and payment thereof has been stopped by the drawer: Nassau Bank v. Broadway Bank, 54 Barb. (N. Y.) 236; and a bpna fide holder, it is said, can enforce payment even in the absence of funds: Cook v. State National Bank of Boston, 52 N. Y. 96. In fact, the act of congress of March. 3, 1869, while declaring that it shall be unlawful for any officer, clerk or agent of any national bank association to certify any check -drawn upon the association unless the person or company-drawing the check has on deposit with the association at the time-such check-is certified an amount of money equal to the amount specified in such check, provides that any check so certified by duly authorized officers shall be a good and valid obligation against the association ; but that the person violating the statute shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The certification may be secured by either the drawer or the .payee or. holder. If the \u2022 drawer, for his own benefit, procures it' to be certified, and then delivers it to the payee, he is not' discharged from-liability to the holder; but, if the payee or holder, for his own benefit, gets it certified, all liability on the part of the drawer ceases: Minot v. Russ, 156 Mass. 458 (31 N. E. Repr. 489); First National Bank of Jersey City v. Leach, 52 N. Y. 350. A bank is, however, not liable to any save the drawer, except when it has - accepted the check by certification or otherwise: Essex County National Bank v. Bank of Montreal, 7 Biss. 193. <em>It </em>is usual for the certification to be in writing upon the face of the check; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>no particular, form of words is required. In First National Bank of Washington v. Whitman, 94 U. S. 343, it was said by-Mr. Justice Hunt : \u201c It is not to be doubted, however, that it is within the power of the bank to render itself liable to the holder and payee of the check. This it may do by a formal acceptance written upon the cheek, in which case it stands to the holder in the position of a drawer and acceptor of a bill of exchange. ... It may accomplish the same result by writing upon it the word \u2018 good,\u2019 or any similar words which indicate a statement by it that the drawer has funds in a bank applicable to the payment of the cheek, and that it will so apply them. . . . Whether this certificate be obtained by the drawer before the check is delivered, and is thus made an inducement to the payee to receive the same, or whether it is made upon the application of the payee for his security, is of no importance. It is a contract recognized by the law, valid in its character, which essentially changes the position of the parties. The privity of contract with the drawee, which before pertained to the drawer alone, is now imparted to the payee, and the duty which before existed only to the drawer, now exists to the payee.\u201d In In re Armstrong, 41 Fed. Repr. 381, it was held that a telegram promising to pay a certain draft constituted an acceptance of the draft, and no particular form was essential to the acceptance ; that it might be expressed in words or implied from the conduct of the drawee, and it might be verbal or <em>written; </em>that it might be before the bill was drawn, or afterwards; and in Coffman v. Campbell, 87 Ill. 98, that a telegram agreeing to accept a person\u2019s draft for a certain sum for \u201c stock \u201d is not a conditional contract, but an absolute undertaking to accept and pay the same, and a party discounting the draft on the faith of such telegram is entitled to recover the amount of the party so agreeing to accept. In Coolidge v. Payson, 15 U. S. 66, Chief Justice Marshall held that a letter written within a reasonable time before or after the date of a bill of exchange, describing it in terms not to be mistaken, and promising to accept it, was, if shown to the person who afterwards takes the bill on the credit of the letter, a virtual acceptance, binding the person who makes the promise; and in Central Savings Bank v. Richards, 109 Mass. 413, it was decided that one who has promised in a telegraphic dispatch to accept a bill of ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>change is liable as acceptor to an indorsee who takes it on the' faith of the dispatch, although the agreement to accept was made in expectation of a consignment from the drawer, which was never received. See, also, Daniel on Negotiable Instruments, sec. 496.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-3\">If, however, the certification, by writing upon the check, is a contract binding upon the bank, whether with funds of the drawer or not, cannot that same contract be established and become equally binding by a promise to pay the check, even though not indorsed in writing upon it, the money to pay the same being in the hands of the bank, and does the technical question of certification enter, to any degree of importance, into the question of liability upon such a promise to pay? This question, we think, is fully answered in the case of North Atchison Bank v. Garretson, 51 Fed. Repr. 168. In that case, Streeter, as agent for the Muscatine Cattle Company, sent a telegram to the bank as follows : \u201c Will you pay James Tate\u2019s check on you twenty-two thousand dollars ? Answer.\u201d The bank replied: \u201c James Tate is good. Send on your paper.\u201d On the faith of the telegram, the cattle company delivered cattle to Tate and accepted his check; but, when it was presented to the bank, payment was refused; the first reason assigned being \u201c want of funds,\u201d and, subsequently, when the check was again presented, that \u201c Tate had countermanded the same.\u201d Judge Shikas, in delivering the opinion of the circuit court of appeals, held that whether the check was to be deemed an inland bill of exchange or a certified check were matters aside from the real question at issue; that the rights of the parties were dependent solely upon whether the bank bound itself unconditionally in writing to pay Tate\u2019s check, and that, if that was the fair meaning of the telegrams passing between the parties, then the bank was bound to make good its promise. The court had no doubt but that this was what was intended by the telegrams, and held the bank liable for the amount of the check. To the same effect is Henrietta National Bank v. State National Bank, 80 Texas, 648 (16 S. W. Repr. 321). The latter case, it will be observed, was between two national banks. A check for $1,800, drawn by Ikards on the Henrietta National Bank, was offered to the State National Bank by an indorsee. The cashier of the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>bank telegraphed to the Henrietta National Bank, <em>\u201c </em>Will you pay E. F. and W. S. Ikard\u2019s check for $1,800 on presentation? \u201d The reply was, \u201cYes, will pay the Ikard check.\u201d Upon this, the check was discounted and at once mailed to the drawee, when payment was refused. It was held that the description given in the telegram, with the reply being acted upon, was sufficient in an action for failure or refusal to pay the check. In Pope v. Bank of Albion, 59 Barb. (N. Y.) 226, it was held that \u201c any language, whether verbal or written, employed by an officer of a banking institution whose duty it is to know the financial standing and credit of its customers, representing that a check drawn upon it is good and will be paid, estops the bank from thereafter denying, as against a bona fide holder of the check, the want of funds to pay the same; \u201d and in Brinkman v. Hunter, 73 Mo. 172, that a telegram of a defendant is a promise in writing within the statutes of the state of Missouri relating\u2019 to the acceptance of bills of exchange. Therefore, viewed from either side, it would seem to me that the Elizabethtown National Bank was liable to the plaintiff for the money paid out on the faith of its telegram, and, if the proof was sufficient, the verdict should be sustained. The learned counsel for the defendant, however, insists that the bank, in this case, was a guarantor, and, therefore, as a national bank, having no power to lend its credit, its act, for this reason, was ultra vires. One of the cases chiefly insisted upon to support this view is Bowen v. Needles National Bank, 94 Fed. Repr. 925. In that c\u00e1se, the bank advised the plaintiff that it would pay all checks of a third person, although such person had no funds on deposit, as was known to both plaintiff and the bank, and, in reliance on such promise, plaintiff cashed the checks and transmitted them to the bank for payment. The bank issued and sent to plaintiff its drafts on a correspondent for the amount of the checks, which drafts were refused payment, and it was held that this contract was one purely of guaranty, was ultra vires on the part of the bank, and the transaction gave the plaintiff no right of action against it on the drafts. Whatever may be thought of the force of the reasoning of the learned judge delivering the opinion, it is clear that the facts presented have no similarity to those in the present case. Here, the bank refused to pay, because the drawer of the check had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>stopped payment, and it nowhere appears in the case that there were not sufficient funds' in -the bank to pay the obligation. The eases upon this subject are based, as is shown in Commercial Nat. Bank v. Pirie, 82 Fed. Repr. 799, upon the fact that the act of congress authorizing the organization of national banks confers no authority upon them, either in express terms or by implication, to guarantee the payment of debts contracted by a third person and solely for his benefit; while, as to the certification of checks, there is, as has been noted above, express power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-4\">Upon the trial, the plaintiff called the cashier of the Farmers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 National Bank of Winchester as a witness, and attempted to show by him the sending of the telegram of inquiry to the Elizabethtown National Bank. It, however, unexpectedly appeared that the telegram produced was merely a copy and not the original, and thereupon counsel for the defendant objected to its admission. In order to overcome this difficulty, and also to prove that the defendant\u2019s officer sent the telegram of reply, the plaintiff offered in evidence the affidavit of defense, which, upon this point, reads as follows: \u201cIt admits that, on May 27, 1903, J. K. Lehman drew to the order of Charles H. Harper a check upon the Elizabethtown National Bank for nine hundred dollars (1900), a copy of which check, as originally drawn, appears at the top of page four of plaintiff\u2019s statement. ... It admits that on May 27, 1903, The Farmers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 National Bank sent to the defendant the telegram marked \u2018Exhibit B,\u2019 which reached Elizabethtown after the bank was closed, and which was answered on May 28,1903, by the telegram marked \u2018 Exhibit C.\u2019 \u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel, then closing his case without offering any testimony, requested to go to the jury on certain other allegations in the affidavit of defense, claiming that the affidavit of defense was before the jury for all purposes, and an issue of fact was raised thereby. It, however, was my opinion that the question before the court involved purely a legal liability of the defendant upon the telegrams, and that the collateral allegations in the affidavit of defense could not be considered. In Bowen v. DeLattre, 6 Whart. 430, in an action by the payee against the maker of a promissory note, it was held that an affidavit of defense made by the d\u00e9fendant, in which he admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>the making of the note, might be read in evidence by the plaintiff as an admission of the same. Mr. Justice Rogers said : \u201c If the same admission had been made, either verbally or in writing, it would have gone to the jury as competent proof, without objection, for the admissions of a party to the suit against his interest are always received in favor of the other side. Nor is it material when or where the admission is made, nor in what form or suit, or whether before or after the commencement of the action, before arrest or after, or whether written or by parol.\u201d This case has lately been cited with approval in Stewart v. Gleason, 23 Pa. Superior Ct. 325. In Stockwell v. Loecher, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 241, it was held that an affidavit of defense being admissible in evidence, it was not error for the court to admit the entire record, restricting the purpose of the offer to the affidavit of defense as showing an admission by the defendant; and in Jacoby v. North British and Mercantile Insurance Company of London and Edinburgh, 10 Pa. Superior Ct. 366, that, where an affidavit of. defense in a suit on an insurance policy admits the execution of the. policy and its delivery, but denies the adjustment and the furnishing of proofs of loss, the affidavit is admissible in evidence for the purpose of showing these admissions. See, also, Fisher v. The Fidelity Mutual Life Association of Philadelphia, 188 Pa. 1. In Neely v. Bair, 144 Pa. 250, a rule of court provided that if the plaintiff should file with his declaration or statement a specific averment of fact sufficient to support his claim, verified by affidavit, and served on the defendant or his counsel of record, such material averments of fact as were not denied by affidavit filed with .or before plea pleaded should be taken as admitted. A statement of claim in assumpsit averred the sale and delivery of certain chattels by the plaintiff to the defendant on a day certain and at a price agreed upon at the time. The affidavit of defense did not deny the sale, delivery or price of the chattels, but set up a substantive defense of matters in avoidance of all liability to the plaintiff. It was held that it was- error to refuse the plaintiff\u2019s offer of the statement of claim and affidavit of defense as evidence of the sale, delivery and price, of the property, and that, under the said rule of court, he had a right to rest upon the prima facie case thus presented. See, also, Whitehead v. School District, 145 Pa. 418. In Page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>v. Simpson, 172 Pa. 288, where, in an action of ejectment, the abstract of title of both plaintiff and defendant was offered in evidence for the sole purpose of showing that the defendant recognized the common source of title and claimed under it, it was decided that the defendant\u2019s abstract was before the jury for the specific purpose of the offer, and for no other purpose, and that the fact that the defendant\u2019s abstract was admitted in evidence in the plaintiff\u2019s case did not relieve the defendant of the burden of showing how he derived his title from the common source, and that the sale under which he claimed was prior in time to that under which the plaintiff claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-3\">I am of opinion that the plaintiff had a right to offer the affidavit of defense for the purpose of proving the admissions contained therein, and that this did not open up collateral issues in no way raised by nor contained in the offer. The right conclusion seems to me to have been reached by the verdict, and I, therefore, think that these rules should be discharged.
