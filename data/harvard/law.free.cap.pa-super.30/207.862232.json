When there are mistakes in a transcript they may be, and ought to be, corrected. The judgment is founded upon the record of the justice, and the transcript should be made to truly present that record ; whether it does so is to be determined by the court below, upon inspection of the docket, and all the papers and evidence before them: Caldwell v. Thompson, 1 Rawle, 370; Miles v. Tanner, 3 Penrose &amp; Watts, 95; Lyon v. Chalker, 2 Watts, 14. The first assignment of error is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Assuming the proceedings before the justice to have been as set forth by the amended transcript, there was no error in the refusal of the court below to strike off the judgment. The defendant did not in his petition to strike off the judgment allege that he did not owe the debt, nor that the summons issued by the justice had not been served upon him, nor that he did not know, at the time the judgment was entered by the justice in 1894, that said judgment had been so entered. His complaint that the summons issued by the justice was made returnable within a shorter time than allowed by law is not well founded. The summons was issued on May 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>and returnable on the 22d of the same month. The act of March 20, 1810, sec. 2; 5 Smith\u2019s Laws, 161, requires that the summons shall command him (the constable) \u201cto cause the said defendant to appear before the said justice on a certain day therein to be expressed, not more than eight nor less than five days after the date of the summons.\u201d In computing this time fractions of days are not to be regarded. Had the statute required that the summons should be returnable \u201c on a day certain, neither less nor more than five days after the date of the summons,\u201d there could be no question that a summons issued on May 17 must be returnable on the 22d of the same month. If fractions of days were to be considered in computing this time, a part of both the fifth and eighth days after the date of the summons would be without the period allowed by the statute. Each day is to be considered as a distinct unit. The time is to be computed by excluding the first day, that of the date of the summons, and including the last day, that of the return of the summons: Cromelien v. Brink, 29 Pa. 522; Lutz\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. <em>273; </em>Marks\u2019s Executors v. Russell, 40 Pa. 372; Duffy v. Ogden, 64 Pa. 240; Davis v. Davis, 128 Pa. 100; Whitton v. Milligan, 153 Pa. 376. The Act of June 20, 1883, P. L. 136 is declaratory of the law as it existed prior to its passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The contention of the appellant that the judgment was void because it was entered against a partnership without setting forth the names of the individual partners, cannot be sustained. While such an objection is good if made in time, the irregularity is cured by a judgment: Seitz &amp; Co. v. Buffum &amp; Co., 14 Pa. 69; McDonald v. Simcox, 98 Pa. 619; Moore v. Moore, 153 Pa. 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The other defects in the record of which the appellant complains are irregularities only, not jurisdictional in nature, and while they might have been sufficient to cause the judgment to be set aside, if proper diligence had been used and a writ of certiorari issued within the time prescribed by law, the defendant, having permitted the judgment to stand unquestioned for ten years, must be held to have waived the irregularities: Inquirer Printing Company v. Wehrly, 157 Pa. 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
