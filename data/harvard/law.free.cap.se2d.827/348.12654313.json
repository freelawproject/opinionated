Walbeck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Appellants argue (1) Walbeck and Adkins could not pursue this action as a derivative action; (2) Respondents' claims are barred by the statute of limitations; (3) the disputed recreational easement was valid and perpetual; (4) there was no fiduciary duty to convey certain amenities to the homeowners association, Respondent I'On Assembly, Inc.; (5) the directed verdict on Appellants' abuse of process counterclaim was improper; (6) Appellants were entitled to attorney's fees as the prevailing party on Adkins' breach of contract claim; (7) the attorney's fees award to Walbeck was unreasonable because he was awarded merely nominal damages on his ILSA claim; (8) the circuit court's ruling that Appellants were amalgamated was improper; and (9) Walbeck failed to show he relied on any representation made by Appellants and, therefore, he failed to establish a claim under ILSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial on Walbeck's breach of contract claim and the dismissal of all other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the heart of this convoluted case is a developer's promise to convey certain amenities in a residential community to a homeowner's association. Specifically, Respondents allege that Appellants promised they would convey to Respondent I'On Assembly, Inc. (the HOA) the Community Dock and Creekside\n   Park located on the civic lot on which the boat ramp was located (lot CV-6) in I'On Village but instead sold these amenities to a third party. Appellants, however, allege they promised to convey a \"generic\" community dock and creekside park to the HOA but not the specific ones located on lot CV-6. Appellants also allege they conveyed the amenities as promised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I'On Village is located in Mount Pleasant. It was conceived by Thomas Graham and his son, Vince Graham. Thomas Graham's company, Graham Development, was the original majority owner of the I'On Company, LLC (the I'On Company), and Vince Graham was the company's manager. The I'On Company's subsidiary, I'On Realty, LLC (I'On Realty), employed real estate agents to market the lots in I'On Village.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 27, 1999, Walbeck entered into a contract to purchase a lot in I'On Village. Walbeck's purchase contract incorporated a property report (the 1998 Property Report) that the I'On Company had filed with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on November 3, 1998, pursuant to ILSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The report set forth information deemed necessary to protect prospective purchasers, including the amenities that would be provided to lot owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Specifically, the report included a chart listing amenities to be built during the first two phases of the development. Among the amenities to be built in Phase II was a \"Creekside Park\" and a \"Community Dock.\" Under this listing was the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The recreational facilities listed in the chart above shall, upon completion of construction, be conveyed to the [HOA] by quitclaim deed free and clear of all monetary liens and encumbrances at no cost to the [HOA] or its members. Upon conveyance of these facilities to the [HOA], it shall assume full responsibility for the costs of ownership, operation, and maintenance of the facilities conveyed to it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The report also included the following notification:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   VARIOUS RECREATIONAL FACILITIES IN THE SUBDIVISION MAY BE OWNED AND OPERATED BY PERSONS OTHER THAN THE [HOA]. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY SUCH FACILITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR USE BY LOT OWNERS. ANY, OR ALL OF SUCH FACILITIES MAY BE OPERATED AS A PRIVATE CLUB FOR MEMBERS AND THEIR GUESTS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT YOU WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR MEMBERSHIP IN ANY SUCH PRIVATE CLUB IF YOU APPLY. IF ACCEPTED, THE COSTS OF SUCH A MEMBERSHIP MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL AND ARE IN ADDITION TO THE PURCHASE PRICE OF YOUR LOT. NO REFUND OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF YOUR LOT WILL BE MADE IF YOU CANNOT OBTAIN A MEMBERSHIP. SINCE THE VALUE OF YOUR LOT MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY YOUR INABILITY OR FAILURE TO OBTAIN A MEMBERSHIP, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER YOUR PURCHASE OF A LOT IF IT IS BASED UPON YOUR PRESUMED ABILITY TO OBTAIN A MEMBERSHIP IN ANY PRIVATE CLUB AND TO USE ITS RECREATIONAL FACILITIES.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Throughout the years after Walbeck received the 1998 Property Report, Appellants built multiple community docks and parks in I'On Village. Nonetheless, Respondents considered and expected the Community Dock and Creekside Park listed in the 1998 Property Report to be located on lot CV-6-this lot had at least 300 feet of deep water access to Hobcaw Creek. The I'On Company also completed construction of a building on lot CV-6 that became known as the \"Creek Club.\" The Creek Club was intended as a venue for wedding receptions and other events. It operated as a private club and hosted its first event circa 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Appellants vacillated throughout the years concerning what they designated as the Community Dock and Creekside Park. At trial, Thomas Graham admitted that the Creek Club overlooked a park. He also admitted that when the I'On Company was planning its parks in 1999, the plans included \"the Creek Club Park.\" In his deposition, Thomas Graham testified that the \"Community Dock\" listed in the 1998 Property Report\n   referred to the main dock at the Creek Club that was adjacent to the boat ramp on lot CV-6; the boat ramp was built in 1999 or 2000, and the Creek Club dock was completed in 2000 or 2001.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, at trial, Thomas Graham disputed that the \"Community Dock\" listed in the 1998 Property Report referred to the Creek Club dock. He explained the reference to a community dock in the 1998 Property Report \"was to a generic community dock\" and not to a specific property as Respondents contended. He stated, \"[T]his was before we had designed anything -- got anything permitted or approved, even bought the land .... We didn't know whether -- at that time, ... we thought sure we'd get one -- at least one community dock, but we didn't know how many, so that was a reference to that community dock.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 9, 2000, the I'On Club, LLC (the I'On Club) executed a \"Recreational Easement and Agreement to Share Costs\" (Recreational Easement) purporting to \"provide access to the [HOA] members for them to use the docks and the boating ramp\" off lot CV-6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Recreational Easement also included language purporting to grant an easement to the I'On Club for use and access to certain common areas within I'On Village. On page three of the document, the easement is described as perpetual. However, section 4.2 of the Recreational Easement states that either party can terminate the easement after thirty years upon six months' notice. Thomas Graham described this language as a mistake because the I'On Club intended for the Recreational Easement to be permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 3.1 of the Recreational Easement required the HOA to pay assessments \"to cover a share of the costs incurred by [the I'On Club] in maintaining, repairing, replacing, operating[,] and insuring the Boating Facilities.\" The Boating Facilities were identified as \"certain recreational facilities, including a boat ramp and dock and a driveway and parking area to serve them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 10, 2000, the I'On Company completed an amended property report for filing with HUD (first amended Property Report). Whereas the 1998 Property Report listed a \"Creekside Park\" and a \"Community Dock\" among the amenities to be built in Phase II, the first amended Property Report's list substituted \"Marshwalk (park)\" for \"Creekside Park\" and \"Community Dock\n   <em>\n    s\n   </em>\n   \" for \"Community Dock.\" (emphasis added). The first amended Property Report also changed the language regarding transfer of these amenities to the HOA-whereas the 1998 Property Report provided for transfer of the Creekside Park and Community Dock to the HOA, the first amended Property Report stated, \"The recreational facilities listed in the chart above,\n   <em>\n    other than the sidewalks and community dock\n   </em>\n   , shall, upon completion of construction, be conveyed to [the HOA] by quitclaim deed free and clear of all monetary liens and encumbrances at no cost to [the HOA] or its members.\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Jo Anne Stubblefield, the I'On Company's attorney for ILSA compliance, explained the amendment to the Property Report this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [I]n early 2000[,] the decision was made to have the I'On Club own and maintain a parking area, boat ramp[,] and dock as part of the Club Facilities and grant an easement to the [HOA] for use of all of these facilities so that property owners would have the same use rights they would have had in the \"community dock\" referenced in the original Property Report, but in addition would have rights to use the parking area and boat ramp (which had not been mentioned in the original Property Report and which the property owners would otherwise have had no right to use unless they joined the Club). The Recreational Easement was drafted to create that easement and to provide for the [HOA] to contribute to the costs incurred by the Club in maintaining the boat dock, boat ramp, and parking area. Once that was finalized and recorded, we amended the HUD Property Report (effective April 2000) to reflect that ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thomas Graham testified that the name of the Creekside Park was changed to Marshwalk after the 1998 Property Report was provided to Walbeck to avoid confusion with a nearby neighborhood called \"Creekside Park.\" He also testified that the Marshwalk was not on lot CV-6 or adjacent to\n   Hobcaw Creek but ran for over two miles along the marsh, which was adjacent to a tributary of Hobcaw Creek. Vince Graham also testified that the \"Creekside Park\" was actually the Marshwalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 15, 2000, the I'On Company conveyed ownership of lot CV-6, including the Creek Club and boat ramp, to the I'On Club. Appellants conveyed the Marshwalk park to the HOA on November 21, 2000. Vince Graham testified that the conveyance included \"docks two and three.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In July 2008, Mike Russo with 148 Civitas, LLC (Russo) submitted a proposal to buy lot CV-6, together with overflow parking on an adjacent lot (CV-5). The proposal included a provision for transfer of the \"boat docks\" to the HOA. Subsequent communications between Appellants and Russo indicated an intent to ultimately convey ownership of the boat ramp and dock off lot CV-6 to the HOA. However, in November 2008, Russo and Appellants entered into an agreement that included the boat ramp and Community Dock in the transfer of lot CV-6 to Russo, which was concerning to HOA members. The then-current president of the HOA's Board of Trustees (Board), Bruce Kinney, contacted Thomas Graham regarding modifying the Recreational Easement to protect the HOA members. One of the modifications Kinney sought was making the easement perpetual. However, on January 5, 2009, Thomas Graham notified Chad Besenfelder that Appellants would not modify the Recreational Easement while the Creek Club was under contract for sale to Russo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 11, 2009, Board President Kinney sent an e-mail to Thomas Graham indicating\n   the Board's discovery of the 1998 Property Report's representation that the Community Dock would be conveyed to the HOA. Kinney expressed the HOA's expectation that the Community Dock would be excluded from the sale to Russo. Kinney's e-mail also inquired about the 1998 Property Report's listing of the Creekside Park as an additional amenity to be conveyed to the HOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Later in March 2009, Russo advised Kinney that he was cancelling the purchase agreement, and subsequently, Thomas Graham advised Kinney that Besenfelder was working out details for transferring ownership of the Community Dock to the HOA. Likewise, Besenfelder advised the HOA's management\n   company that ownership of the Community Dock would be transferred to the HOA. However, by August 1, 2009, the HOA learned that Appellants and Russo had recently entered into a new contract for the sale of CV-6 to Russo, including the Creek Club, the boat ramp, and Community Dock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 5, 2009, the I'On Club conveyed ownership of lot CV-6 to Russo in consideration of $1,400,000. On this same day, Thomas Graham, Vince Graham, and Geoff Graham conveyed ownership of lot CV-5 to Russo in consideration of $225,000.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The conveyance of lot CV-6 to Russo was expressly subject to the Recreational Easement, and the I'On Club executed a written assignment of its rights and obligations under the Recreational Easement to Russo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On December 22, 2010, Walbeck filed his Complaint against Appellants and 148 Civitas, LLC, alleging causes of action for violation of ILSA, Breach of Contract, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud, Negligent Misrepresentation, Civil Conspiracy, violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act, Unjust Enrichment, Promissory Estoppel, \"Veil Piercing/Alter Ego,\" and Tortious Interference with Contract. The complaint also alleged that Walbeck was bringing the action on behalf of himself and derivatively on the HOA's behalf. On March 8, 2011, Walbeck filed an Amended Complaint adding Mike Russo (in his individual capacity) and I'On Realty as defendants. Appellants filed a motion to dismiss Walbeck's action on May 27, 2011 pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, asserting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Walbeck's claims were barred by the statute of limitations and Walbeck failed to satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 23(b)(1), SCRCP, for a derivative action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 7, 2012, Walbeck filed a Second Amended Complaint and Lea Ann Adkins joined Walbeck as a plaintiff. Walbeck and Adkins also added the HOA as a defendant and added an allegation that Appellants were amalgamated. On March 15, 2012, the circuit court issued an order denying Appellants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. On January 2, 2014, Respondents filed a Third Amended Complaint adding a cause of action for Aiding and Abetting against Russo. On January 13, 2014, Russo entered into a settlement agreement with Respondents. The terms of the settlement included Russo's\n   sale of lot CV-6 to the HOA for $495,000 and the HOA's lease of the building, lawn, and three parking spaces back to Russo. The settlement terms also allowed the HOA access to the Creek Club for 13 dates per year and Russo's future conveyance of lot CV-5 to the HOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Subsequently, Respondents' action against Appellants proceeded to trial on January 14, 2014, but the action ended in a mistrial on January 17, 2014. On February 21, 2014, the HOA realigned its party status and adopted the other Respondents' claims set forth in the Third Amended Complaint. On May 12, 2014, Appellants filed a separate action against Respondents, seeking a declaration that the Recreational Easement was perpetual. The circuit court granted Appellants' motion to consolidate their action with the present action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On June 16, 2014, Respondents filed their Fourth Amended Complaint reflecting the HOA's realignment as a plaintiff, Russo's dismissal from the action, and elimination of the claims for Tortious Interference and Aiding and Abetting. Exactly one year later, the circuit court issued an order declaring the Recreational Easement invalid and void ab initio because the I'On Club lacked title to lot\n   CV-6 at the time it executed the easement. The circuit court also concluded the easement was not perpetual but was limited to a term of thirty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The parties re-tried the case from July 28 through August 1, 2014. The jury returned verdicts for Walbeck on his claims for violation of ILSA ($1), Negligent Misrepresentation ($20,000), and Breach of Contract ($10,000) and for the HOA on its claims for Breach of Contract ($1,000,000), Breach of Fiduciary Duty ($1,750,000), and Negligent Misrepresentation ($1,000,000). The HOA elected to recover on its Breach of Fiduciary Duty claim, and Walbeck elected to recover on his Negligent Misrepresentation claim. The circuit court denied Appellants' motion for a JNOV or new trial absolute and new trial nisi remittitur. The circuit court also denied Appellants' motion for an award of attorney's fees against Adkins and awarded attorney's fees to Walbeck pursuant to ILSA. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES ON APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   1.

This language placed prospective HOA members on notice that they would be buying into a community that would likely be shared with non-HOA members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In sum, the record in this case does not support the conclusion that Appellants had a fiduciary duty to convey to the HOA those specific amenities associated with the Creek Club on lot CV-6. Therefore, the circuit court's conclusion that Appellants breached their fiduciary duty to the HOA's members by failing to convey title to the disputed amenities was controlled by an error of law.

However, Appellants argue the initial representation on which Respondents claim they relied was that Appellants would convey the disputed amenities to the HOA free of charge upon completion of construction, and Respondents knew or should have known upon completion\n   of construction in early 2001 that they did not receive such a conveyance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, at that time, Respondents knew or\n   should have known they might have claims against Appellants. The logical extension of this argument is that Walbeck, in his individual capacity and as a representative of the HOA, certainly should have known before December 22, 2007, approximately six years after the completion of construction, that he and the HOA had claims against Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Respondents, we agree with Appellants that the negligent misrepresentation and ILSA claims accrued well before December 22, 2007.

Paragraph 91 designates\n   the breach of Appellants' duty of care as misrepresenting facts that induced Walbeck to purchase his lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Thus, as to the negligent misrepresentation claims, the question is when Walbeck, in his individual and representative capacity, knew or should have known that the representation purportedly inducing him and other HOA members to buy their lots, i.e., the statement in the 1998 Property Report indicating that title to certain amenities would be conveyed to the HOA\n   <strong>\n    upon completion of construction\n   </strong>\n   , was unfulfilled. By April 10, 2001, Appellants completed construction of the Community Dock and Creekside Park. By early November 2004, when Walbeck received information indicating the HOA might not own the Community Dock or Creekside Park, Walbeck should have known that the statement indicating title to these amenities would be conveyed upon completion of construction was unfulfilled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"92265\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/321/360/#p363\">\n    321 S.C. at 363-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"92265\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/321/360/#p363\">\n    468 S.E.2d at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the \"exercise of reasonable diligence\" means \"the injured party must act with some promptness [when] the facts and circumstances of an injury place a reasonable person of common knowledge and experience on\n   <em>\n    notice\n   </em>\n   that a claim against another party\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   exist\" (second emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    Bayle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1195162\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/344/115/#p126\">\n    344 S.C. at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1195162\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/344/115/#p126\">\n    542 S.E.2d at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the discovery rule does not \"require absolute certainty a cause of action exists before the statute of limitations begins to run\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Walbeck admitted receiving copies of the HOA's proposed annual budgets, which began including a \"Creek Club Dock usage Fee\" as early as October 10, 2004, for the 2005 budget year, if not earlier. The proposed 2005 budget was mailed to HOA members on November 1, 2004. The listing of a fee being paid by the HOA for use of the Community Dock should have alerted Walbeck to the fact that the HOA might not have title to the Community Dock or the other\n   amenities listed in the 1998 Property Report, such as Creekside Park. He could have deduced from this budget item alone that the statement indicating title to these amenities would be conveyed upon completion of construction was unfulfilled. Hence, Respondents' negligent misrepresentation claims accrued no later than early November 2004 and expired no later than early November 2007.\n   Therefore, the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence is that Respondents' negligent misrepresentation claims accrued well before December 22, 2007.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15-3-535 (stating that with the exception of medical malpractice actions, \"all actions initiated under Section 15-3-530(5) must be commenced within three years after the person knew or\n   <em>\n    by the exercise of reasonable diligence\n   </em>\n   should have known that he had a cause of action.\" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3853319\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/381/101/#p110\">\n    381 S.C. at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3853319\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/381/101/#p110\">\n    671 S.E.2d at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen there is no conflicting evidence or only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, the determination of when a party knew or should have known that he or she had a claim becomes a matter of law to be decided by the trial court.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In its order denying Appellants' JNOV motion, the circuit court concluded that even if the date Respondents should have discovered their claims preceded the three-year limitations period, equitable estoppel would have served to toll the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   A defendant will be estopped to assert the statute of limitations in bar of a plaintiff's claim when the delay that otherwise would give operation to the statute has been induced by the defendant's conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   The doctrine is, of course, most clearly applicable [when] the aggrieved party's delay in bringing suit was caused by his opponent's intentional misrepresentation; but deceit is not an essential element of estoppel.

Attorney's Fees against Adkins\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Appellants claim they were entitled to an award of attorney's fees against Adkins on her breach of contract claim because they were the prevailing party pursuant to the fee-shifting provision in Adkins' lot purchase agreement. We affirm the circuit court's order denying attorney's fees against Adkins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Appellants sought an award of attorney's fees against Adkins pursuant to the following provision in her lot purchase agreement: \"If either party requires services of an attorney to enforce obligations under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be due from the non-prevailing party\n   <strong>\n    reasonable\n   </strong>\n   attorneys' fees, costs[,] and expenses\n   <strong>\n    actually incurred\n   </strong>\n   .\" (emphases added). The circuit court based its denial of the requested award on two grounds: (1) Adkins prevailed on three of her derivative claims against Appellants and there was \"no practical or legal way to separate the derivative verdicts from Adkins or to attribute them more to Walbeck[ ] just because he prevailed on his claim for personal damages and Adkins did not\"; and (2) while Adkins did not prevail on her breach of contract claim, she prevailed as to Appellants' counterclaim for abuse of process, \"resulting in a draw on the individual\n   claims.\" In light of our holding that the derivative claims were not properly filed, the first ground no longer serves as a valid basis for the circuit court's ruling. However, the second ground remains a valid basis for declining to rule in favor of Appellants as the \"prevailing party.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Moreover, this court may affirm for any ground appearing in the record. Rule 220(c), SCACR. Here, Appellants' petition for attorney's fees does not indicate that the addition of Adkins as a plaintiff required any significant increase in the efforts of counsel to defend this case. While the petition requests one-half of the total fees and expenses incurred from the date of the Second Amended Complaint's filing through the end of trial, it does not state that a corresponding amount of time and expenses were\n   <strong>\n    actually generated\n   </strong>\n   from Adkins' breach of contract claim or\n   the addition of Adkins as a named plaintiff for the derivative claims. Further, counsel's attorney's fees affidavit is not in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Appellants have not shown that the amount of attorneys' fees and expenses they requested was either\n   <strong>\n    reasonable\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    actually incurred\n   </strong>\n   , as required by the fee-shifting provision in Adkins' lot purchase agreement.
