Petitioners challenge the circuit court's holding that the Commission's awarding points to a candidate on competitive examination for promotion based on education credentials did not violate the requirements of the Police Civil Service Act set forth in West Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 8-14-6 to 8-14-24 (LexisNexis 2017). Having considered the briefs submitted on appeal, the appendix record, the parties' oral arguments, and the applicable legal authority, we find no error.

Under Rule VII, Section\n   2 of the Martinsburg Police Commission's Rules and Regulations,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [a]pplicants for promotion shall be graded on a scale of a maximum of one-hundred (100) points. This shall consist of a maximum of fifty (50) points for the written examination, a maximum of forty (40) points for the personnel file review and a maximum of ten (10) points shall be based on seniority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With regard to the Personnel File Review, the maximum forty (40) points available for review of the applicant's personnel file are given as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   a)\n   <em>\n    Efficiency Rating\n   </em>\n   - A maximum of ten (10) points shall be awarded for review of efficiency rating. The Chief of Police shall submit to the Commission an efficiency rating on each candidate scheduled to take the oral interview. Efficiency ratings may be based on the following: absenteeism, accident rating, character and conduct, attitude, personal appearance, ability to work under pressure and on dangerous assignments, ability to meet and deal with others, ability to organize work, knowledge of duties, laws, ordinances and rules applicable to his/her work, accuracy and attention to pertinent details, emotional stability, leadership and promoting high morale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   b)\n   <em>\n    Education\n   </em>\n   - A maximum of ten (10) points shall be awarded based on the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 10 points - Post graduate degree from an accredited college or university\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 8 points - Bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 6 points - 3 years college completed at an accredited institution\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 4 points - 2 years completed or associate degree from an accredited college or university\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 2 points - 1 year college completed at an accredited institution\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 1 point - post-secondary education\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   c)\n   <em>\n    Training\n   </em>\n   - A maximum of six (6) points shall be awarded for accredited law enforcement training of an official nature. No points under this section are to be awarded for activities which accrue points under the above education section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   d)\n   <em>\n    Commendations\n   </em>\n   - A maximum of four (4) points for outstanding performance beyond the call of duty evidenced by the Martinsburg City Council or other police or government entity.

Burner received the third highest score among the candidates for the two open Sergeant positions, and PFC Gibbons received the second highest score among the candidates for the one open Corporal position. The candidate with the highest score on the Sergeant examination received eight education points for his bachelor's degree, and the candidate with the second highest score received ten education points for his master's degree. Cpl. Burner received two points for his education. PFC Gibbons received no education points, while the candidate who outscored him received eight (8) points for his bachelor's degree. Without the consideration of points for education, Cpl. Burner and PFC Gibbons would have both finished with sufficient scores for promotion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After receiving their results, both Cpl. Burner and PFC Gibbons requested review of their scores and a public hearing with the Commission pursuant to West Virginia Code \u00a7 8-14-13a (LexisNexis 2017). On January 27, 2017, the Commission heard their arguments, through counsel, on the legality of awarding points\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for education.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission issued\n   its final order on February 1, 2017, and found \"no basis to deviate from its established rule and modify its prior respective awards for educational efforts as a component of experience.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On February 15, 2017, Petitioners filed an administrative appeal challenging the decision of the Commission, and also petitioned the Circuit Court of Berkeley County for a writ of mandamus compelling the Commission to dispense with the awarding of points for education, and to promote Cpl. Burner and PFC Gibbons to the ranks of Sergeant and Corporal, respectively. Petitioners argued in their appeal, that under the Police Civil Service Act, promotions are to be based only on \"experience,\" which they interpret to mean seniority, but not education. The Circuit Court of Berkeley County denied the Petitioners' appeal and petition for writ of mandamus, and affirmed the Final Order issued by the Commission. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As noted above, the issue at hand was decided originally by the Martinsburg Police Civil Service Commission.

Because of this, Petitioners go on to argue that the\n   <em>\n    Bays\n   </em>\n   Court's use of \"i.e.\" is of particular importance because \"i.e.\" means\n   <em>\n    that is\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    in other words\n   </em>\n   . On the contrary, \"e.g.\" would imply\n   <em>\n    example given\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    for example.\n   </em>\n   Thus, in the opinion of Petitioners, the use of \"i.e.\" signals that the Court unequivocally meant to state that \"experience\"\n   <em>\n    means\n   </em>\n   seniority, and nothing else.

The design of the act is to set forth a system for the appointment, promotion, reduction, removal and reinstatement of police officers which best ensures that these decisions are made according to the comparative merit and fitness of police officers and not according to personal or political whim. This design has the dual result of protecting the job security of those police officers who are best qualified while also guaranteeing that the public is served by police officers of the highest merit.

Under the Act, municipalities are given authority to promulgate rules and regulations\n   <em>\n    as long as they are not inconsistent\n   </em>\n   with the express provisions of the Act. We find little guidance in the statute or the case law that would expressly require police departments to base promotions\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   upon the results of a written exam and the quantity of \"experience\" without giving any consideration to the\n   <em>\n    quality\n   </em>\n   of the officer's \"experience.\" Rather, the consideration of education when awarding points for \"experience\" encourages promotions \"according to merit and fitness,\" and is consistent with the purposes of the Police Civil Service Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Additionally, we reject Petitioners' argument that there is no rational basis for considering education under the rubric of \"experience.\" As the circuit court explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   there is a rational basis for considering an officer's education level as a component of \"experience\" as set forth in the Act. ...

[H]igher education is a legitimate factor in determining the best candidates for promotion to positions where the officer will train and supervise other officers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The purpose of awarding points for an individual's education credentials is to ensure\n   that our State's police officers are individuals of the highest caliber. Higher education is not a requirement or a \"screening device\" devised to eliminate or prevent candidates from promotions, but rather, higher education is one element of a carefully planned multi-point system used to promote officers. The Commission is not considering an individual's education\n   <em>\n    to the exclusion\n   </em>\n   of seniority, but in tandem as a balance and complement to the other elements of the rubric. After careful consideration, we find there is a rational basis for considering an officer's education and that said consideration under \"experience\" is not inconsistent or in conflict with the provisions of the Police Civil Service Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As such, we find that the Berkeley County Circuit Court did not commit reversible error when it found that the Martinsburg Police Commission's consideration of higher education as a component of \"experience\" under the Police Civil Service Act was consistent with the Act's purpose of ensuring meritorious promotions.

I write separately to clarify my analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Promotions within the City of Martinsburg Police Department are competitive, with candidates scored on a one-hundred point scale. Under Martinsburg Police Civil Service Commission Rule VII, Section 2 (Rule VII), a candidate may earn up to fifty points based upon their performance on a standard, written examination; forty points based upon a review of their personnel file; and ten points for their years of service in the department. Rule VII further subdivides the scoring of a candidate's personnel file. Relevant to Petitioners' appeal, post-secondary education accounts for up to ten points of the possible forty points awarded based on the contents of a candidate's personnel file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   When City of Martinsburg police officers Quenton Burner and Erin Gibbons sought promotion in late 2016, they were passed over in favor of other candidates with more post-secondary education. But for the education points awarded to the successful candidates, Burner and Gibbons would have earned scores high enough for promotion to sergeant and corporal, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The pair grieved the promotional decisions to the Martinsburg Police Civil Service Commission, challenging the Commission's consideration of post-secondary education at promotion. In February 2017, the Commission affirmed its rule and denied Petitioners' grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Petitioners then appealed the Commission's order to the Circuit Court of Berkeley County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As they had done before the Commission,\n   Petitioners argued that the Commission's Rule VII violated the Police Civil Service Act, West Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 8-14-16 to 23 (2017) (the Act). The circuit court denied Petitioners' appeal, reasoning that consideration of an officer's educational background was \"not directly inconsistent with the express provisions of the Act which permits consideration of the officer's 'experience.' \" So, the circuit court denied Petitioners' appeal and their request for a writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Petitioners' grievance and appeals-to the Commission, then to the circuit court, and now to this Court-raise a single question of law: whether the Act authorizes the Commission to consider post-secondary education at promotion, so that officer-candidates such as Petitioners may lose promotions they may otherwise deserve to candidates with higher levels of post-secondary education. This Court may reverse the circuit court's order affirming the Commission if it was \"based upon a mistake of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Petitioners' appeal hinges on West Virginia Code \u00a7 8-14-17(b), which states in pertinent part that \"[p]romotions shall be based upon experience and by written competitive examinations to be provided by the Policemen's Civil Service Commission[.]\" Petitioners offer two arguments in support of their position that the Commission's Rule VII violates that section of the Act. First, that in our prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Morgan v. City of Wheeling\n   </em>\n   , we stated that the \"[A]ct prescribes the sole provisions for appointing police officers according to\n   <em>\n    merit and fitness\n   </em>\n   .... It provides all that is necessary for the appointment and promotion of the fittest applications.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because \u00a7 8-14-17(b) does not contain the word \"education,\" Petitioners conclude that Rule VII necessarily conflicts with the Act. Second, Petitioners assert that the word \"experience\" cannot include consideration of an officer-candidate's educational background because we have previously defined it to mean \"seniority.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   These arguments require interpretation of the Act, and specifically \u00a7 8-14-17(b), to determine the extent of the Commission's authority to include education in its assessment of a candidate's experience at promotion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a different context, this Court has explained that if a \"statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the Commission's authority and obligation to \"prescribe and enforce rules and regulations carrying into effect the civil service provisions of [West Virginia Code Chapter 8, Article 14],\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   I conclude that that explanation applies equally in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Act is silent as to the meaning of \"experience\" in \u00a7 8-14-17(b), so the question becomes whether the Commission's answer is based on a permissible construction of that statute, that is, one which flows rationally from the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   I believe that it is. As the circuit court reasoned, there is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [A]mple support for [the Commission's] position that officers with a higher education tend to possess better analytical and decision-making skills, better communication skills, and tend to draft better reports, warrants, etc. These skills may in turn aid an officer in the overall performance of his or her police work and interactions with the public in general. The [circuit court] further agree[d] with the [the Commission] that higher education is a legitimate factor in determining the best candidates for promotion to positions where the officer will train and supervise other officers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For those same reasons, I conclude that the Commission's Rule VII, which considers an officer's educational attainment as part of the overall assessment of his experience under \u00a7 8-14-17(b), is based on a permissible construction of that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Petitioners' arguments regarding\n   <em>\n    Morgan v. City of Wheeling\n   </em>\n   and this Court's comments in\n   <em>\n    Bays\n   </em>\n   miss the proverbial boat. In\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , we held that a city's residency requirement did not conflict with the express provisions of the Act, and therefore was permissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reasoned that the Act was primary and exclusive with regard to merit and fitness considerations, but that a residency requirement was not related to merit and fitness and so could not conflict with the Act. That reasoning does not dictate the conclusion that the Commission's Rule VII conflicts with the Act, and is, therefore, void. The Legislature chose not to define \"experience,\" and the definition adopted by the Commission is neither irrational nor contrary to the aims of the Act. As such, it would be very difficult to conclusively state that Rule VII is \"inconsistent with the express provisions of the Act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Bays\n   </em>\n   is not Petitioners' silver bullet, either. There, this Court considered whether the Charleston Police Civil Service Commission had authority under the Act to impose a 90/10 pass rate on written examinations for promotion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We held that it did not because the Commission's rule elevated one promotional consideration-written exam scores-over the others specified in \u00a7 8-14-17, essentially reading the other factors (service and experience) out of the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the course of our analysis, we stated in dicta that a prior version of \u00a7 8-14-17 (1969, 1986) \"requires promotions under the [Act] to be based upon merit and fitness as shown by (1) competitive written examination, (2) service, i.e., performance appraisal and (3) experience, i.e., seniority.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, that statement was dicta; as such, I do not read it to preclude the Commission's reasonable interpretation of the term, \"experience,\" in the amended version of \u00a7 8-14-17(b) (2012, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   I recognize that \"a municipality's powers are strictly construed[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission, however, is authorized by statute to \"prescribe and enforce rules and regulations carrying into effect the civil service provisions of\n   [West Virginia Code Chapter 8, Article 14]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, I believe it is proper to assess the legality of the Commission's Rule VII in the context of that statutory authority and the Legislature's decision not to define the term, \"experience,\" found in \u00a7 8-14-17(b). Based on that analysis, I concur with the majority that the circuit court's final order denying petitioners' appeal and affirming the final order of the Commission must be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%208-14\">\n     W.
