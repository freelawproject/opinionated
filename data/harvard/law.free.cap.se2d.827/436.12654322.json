In this appeal, the petitioner contends that the circuit court erred by finding that it was contrary to the best interests of the children to be returned to her custody even though she successfully completed her post-adjudicatory improvement period. Both respondents, the West Virginia Department of Health and Human\n   Resources (\"DHHR\") and the guardian ad litem, maintain that termination of the petitioner's parental rights was warranted despite her compliance with the services provided during her improvement period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Upon consideration of the parties' briefs and oral arguments, the submitted appendix record, and the pertinent authorities, we find no error. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth below, the circuit court's disposition order terminating the petitioner's parental rights to N.H., C.H., and B.H. is affirmed. However, we remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings because the record indicates that the petitioner gave birth to a fourth child shortly before the disposition order was entered by the circuit court. As discussed below, when a child is born to a parent whose parental rights to another child have been previously terminated, our statutory and case law require the circuit court to determine whether the problems that led to the prior involuntary termination have been sufficiently remedied or whether the parental rights to the subsequently-born child should be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When the DHHR initiated this abuse and neglect proceeding in March 2016, N.H., C.H., and B.H. were living with the petitioner and her boyfriend, M.L.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the abuse and neglect petition, the DHHR alleged that the children's health and safety were at imminent risk because of the petitioner's illegal drug use and their exposure to domestic violence between the petitioner and M.L. Specifically, the petition indicated that N.H., the oldest child,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   had disclosed that her mother \"has 'chill pills' to help her calm down\" and that her mother \"mostly just sleeps forever.\" The DHHR asserted that the petitioner's drug use was causing her to neglect the psychological treatment and education of her children, particularly that of C.H., who is autistic, by, among other things, not providing the school with the requisite medical documentation so that proper education services could be provided. The petition further asserted that the petitioner had not been present to meet her children at the bus stop on multiple occasions, necessitating their return to school until they were picked up by a parent or guardian. In one instance, the petitioner could not be located, and an aunt had to come and get the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With respect to the domestic violence allegations, the petition stated that the children had disclosed that M.L. broke the television and a vase during arguments with their mother. N.H. reported that the petitioner told her that \"[M.L.] is going to burn us\" and that she attempted to break up the fights by \"trying to talk [M.L.] out of beating up her mother\" or screaming to alert someone when she was unsuccessful. B.H. reported that \"[M.L.] told his mommy that he was going to kill her.\" Upon the filing of the abuse and neglect petition, the children were removed from the home and placed in foster care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The petitioner waived her right to a preliminary hearing and, subsequently, stipulated to the allegations set forth in the petition. The petitioner admitted that \"she has a drug abuse issue which has negatively impacted her parenting[.]\" She further acknowledged that there had been domestic violence in the home while the children were present. Upon the court's acceptance of the stipulated adjudication, the petitioner filed a motion for a post-adjudicatory improvement period, which was granted on August 8, 2016. Thereafter, the court granted the petitioner a three-month extension so she could complete an Intensive Outpatient Program (\"IOP\") for her drug addiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following multiple review hearings, the circuit court entered an order April 11, 2018,\n   regarding the petitioner's completion of her post-adjudicatory improvement period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that order, the circuit court concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [t]he weight of the evidence demonstrates [the petitioner] has substantially complied with the terms and conditions of her improvement period;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the only evidence suggesting deficient compliance is [the petitioner] having remained on Subutex,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   but she rebutted such by presenting reliable testimony that she did so only at the direction of her physician.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Footnotes added). With regard to the petitioner's continued use of Subutex, the order indicated that the petitioner tried to stop taking the medication in June 2017. However, she was pregnant at the time with her fourth child and was hospitalized for nausea and vomiting caused by her withdrawal from the medication. According to the circuit court's order, the petitioner's obstetrician testified that it was safer for her to continue to take the Subutex during her pregnancy so he referred her to a clinic that provided a step-down regime to have her off the medication within a year. At the final improvement period review hearing, the petitioner testified that she was still taking Subutex but indicated she expected to be weaned from the medication soon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, the circuit court scheduled the final disposition hearing, and the DHHR filed a motion to terminate the petitioner's parental rights. Disposition hearings were held on July 5, and July 13, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 29, 2018, the circuit court entered the disposition order terminating the petitioner's parental rights to N.H., C.H., and B.H., setting forth the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court has heard evidence herein of the [ ] children's need for substantial ongoing care from various providers: [C.H.] is a non-verbal, autistic child, requiring much care, close supervision, and frequent medical and therapeutic appointments. [B.H.] suffers from both serious behavioral issues and health problems which have necessitated trips to medical providers all over the State. [N.H.] suffers from anxiety and depression, which require counseling and psychiatric care. Contrary to the needs of her children, [the petitioner] has not acquired a driver's license during the pendency of this case, and still relies on others for transportation. Furthermore, despite the children's need for medical treatment and care, [the petitioner] made no attempt[ ] to attend any such appointments during this case, nor did she call the [DHHR] to check on the welfare of her children. And despite [the petitioner's] stated desire to reclaim custody of her children, by her own testimony, [the petitioner] has made no attempt to acquire any knowledge of the specific physical maladies which afflict her children, in spite of the [DHHR's] resources that have been made available to her for that purpose. In short, [the petitioner] has not taken advantage of the significant amount of time afforded to demonstrate a willingness to meet the needs of these children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Also, the children continue to display a fear of and a desire to have no contact with [M.L.] with whom [the petitioner] maintains\n   an ongoing relationship. Although the Court recognizes the unquestioned right of an individual to pursue such a relationship, the Court observes [the petitioner] has chosen to pursue her relationship with [M.L.] such that she has been hindered in correcting the conditions of abuse and neglect at issue in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Upon entry of the disposition order, the petitioner filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

These findings shall not be set aside by a reviewing court unless clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support the finding, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. However, a reviewing court may not overturn a finding simply because it would have decided the case differently, and it must affirm a finding if the circuit court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With this standard in mind, we consider the parties' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    A. N.H., C.H., and B.H.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In this appeal, the petitioner argues that because she successfully completed her improvement period, the circuit court erred by not finding that it was in the children's best interests to be returned to her custody. According to the petitioner, the only concern expressed by CPS worker Morgan Perrine at the disposition hearing pertained to her continued use of Subutex. However, Ms. Perrine acknowledged that the petitioner never failed a drug screen during the pendency of the proceeding and that she had been directed by her physician to slowly wean from the Subutex because of her pregnancy and subsequent breastfeeding of her newborn. With respect to the domestic violence, the petitioner points out that M.L. underwent counseling and anger management training during the proceeding and successfully completed his improvement period such that his custodial visitation arrangement he had with his biological children was restored.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the petitioner maintains that there was no clear and convincing evidence that that it would be unsafe to return her children to her custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Conversely, the DHHR and guardian ad litem argue that termination of petitioner's parental rights was warranted despite her compliance with services during her post-adjudicatory improvement period because she failed to change her overall attitude and approach to parenting, which was necessary for reunification with her children. In that regard, the respondents point out that the evidence established that the children were still traumatized by the domestic violence they witnessed and remained afraid of M.L. Yet, the petitioner continued her relationship with M.L., became pregnant, and gave birth to his child during the course of this proceeding. The respondents contend that the petitioner's lack of insight into how her relationship with M.L. has affected her children shows that she failed to change her overall attitude and approach to parenting. The respondents further argue that the petitioner failed to make the necessary changes with regard to her substance abuse because she was still using Suboxone at the time of the final disposition hearing, reflecting her failure to understand the urgency to become drug free so that her children could be safely returned to her care. Finally, the respondents argue that the petitioner failed to make meaningful changes to show that she has the ability to provide proper care for her children\n   given their special needs. They note that the petitioner remained disengaged and disinterested in the special needs of her children throughout the proceeding below, never asking to attend any of their medical appointments or even expressing concern when she was told that one of her children could possibly have a brain tumor. In sum, the respondents maintain that the circuit court properly determined, based upon all the evidence, that the best interests of the children necessitated the termination of the petitioner's parental rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It has long been established that \"although parents have substantial rights that must be protected, the primary goal in cases involving abuse and neglect, as in all family law matters, must be the health and welfare of the children.\" Syl.

Consequently,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [t]he question at the dispositional phase of a child abuse and neglect proceeding is not simply whether the parent has successfully completed his or her assigned tasks during the improvement period. Rather, the pivotal question is what disposition is consistent with the best interests of the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    In re Frances J.A.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9097948\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/213/636/#p646\">\n    213 W.Va. 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 646,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9097948\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/213/636/#p646\">\n    584 S.E.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 502 (2003).

Upon review of the record, we find that the evidence supports the circuit court's findings. Despite the improvement period, the petitioner failed to demonstrate a willingness to meet the needs of her children and the ability to correct the conditions of abuse and neglect. In particular, the petitioner made no attempt to educate herself about her children's medical and psychological diagnoses and never obtained a driver's license so that she could take them to their doctors' appointments. The final order indicates that during the disposition hearing, the petitioner was asked what she had learned about autism since the beginning of the proceeding. She replied, \"During this case, nothing.\" When asked why she had not taken any steps to prepare herself to maintain the level of care her children had received during the\n   pendency of this case, the petitioner said, \"I guess, I never really thought about it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is also evident that the petitioner failed to understand her children's fear of M.L. and desire to have no further contact with him. According to the record, the children were too afraid to participate in family counseling with M.L. during the improvement period. In addition, N.H. testified\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   that she was afraid that if she went home she would get hurt. She also stated that she was did not think her brother and sister would be safe, either.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Referring to M.L., N.H. explained that \"he beat my mom up and I always got in the middle of it and I didn't [sic] want to go back there, because I'm afraid it's going to happen again.\" When asked what M.L. did to her mommy, N.H. replied, \"punch[ed] her in the face and choke[d] her.\" When asked if she ever got hurt, N.H., testified, \"Almost ... when I was trying to get them away from each other I almost got punched [by M.L.].\" Although the petitioner was aware of her children's fear of M.L. and indicated at the beginning of the case that she would end her relationship with M.L. so her children could be returned to her custody, she did not do so. Instead, she pursued her relationship with M.L. and gave birth to his child while this case was pending before the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In sum, while the record shows the petitioner made some changes in order to comply with the requirements of her case plan, it also reflects that the petitioner did not modify her behavior to correct the conditions of abuse and neglect. \"We have recognized that it is possible for an individual to show compliance with specific aspects of the case plan while failing to improve ...

The relationship between DHHR and county prosecutors under the statute is a pure attorney-client relationship. The legislature has not given authority to county prosecutors to litigate civil abuse and neglect actions independent of DHHR.
