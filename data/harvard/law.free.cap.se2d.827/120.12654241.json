The Record before us demonstrates the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   On 15 August 2016, a Grand Jury indicted Defendant for Malicious Maiming of Privy Member and Assault Inflicting Serious Bodily Injury. On 6 February 2017, the Grand Jury entered a superseding indictment for Attempted Malicious Castration or Maiming of a Privy Member and Assault Inflicting Serious Bodily Injury. The Grand Jury additionally indicted Defendant for Assault, and for Habitual Misdemeanor Assault, a separate substantive offense. These indictments alleged, on 2 November 2015, Defendant attacked and tore the scrotum of A.R.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a transgender woman. In advance of trial, Defendant stipulated to two prior misdemeanor assaults as elements of Habitual Misdemeanor Assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   At the close of the State's evidence, Defendant moved to dismiss the charges against him on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence. Specifically, Defendant alleged the \"evidence is insufficient as a matter of law on every element of each charge to support submission of the charge to the jury,\" and \"there is a variance between the crime alleged in the indictment and the crime for which the State's evidence may have been sufficient for submission to the jury[.]\" Defendant also argued, \"as it relates to the attempted malicious maiming indictment, the [S]tate has failed to show there was ... any specific intent ... with malice to maim, disfigure, or render impotent\" A.R., A.R. was \"not permanently injured,\" and \"the [S]tate has failed to show that there was serious bodily injury\" to A.R. The trial court denied the Motion. Defendant declined to offer evidence on his own behalf and renewed his Motion to Dismiss, which the trial court again denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The trial court submitted to the jury the two felony charges of Attempted Castration or Maiming and Assault Inflicting Serious Bodily Injury. Rather than submit the charge of Habitual Misdemeanor Assault, the trial court submitted the underlying predicate misdemeanor offense of Assault Inflicting Serious Injury, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-33\">\n    N.C.

The jury further found as an aggravating factor Defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence to commit the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court found Defendant had a prior felony record level of III. The court sentenced Defendant to a minimum of 19 months and a maximum of 32 months, in the presumptive range, for Assault Inflicting Serious Bodily Injury; and a minimum of 9 months and a maximum of 20 months, in the presumptive range, for Habitual Misdemeanor Assault; to be served consecutively in the custody of the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction.

Serious Bodily Injury\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Our General Statutes define the offense of Assault Inflicting Serious Bodily Injury as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    Unless the conduct is covered under some other provision of law providing greater punishment, any person who\n    assaults another person and inflicts serious bodily injury is guilty of a Class F felony. \"Serious bodily injury\" is defined as bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death, or that causes serious permanent disfigurement, coma, a permanent or protracted condition that causes extreme pain, or permanent or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ, or that results in prolonged hospitalization.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-32.4\">\n     N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-32.4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) (2017). Thus, the offense requires the State to show (1) an assault, and (2) the assault inflicted \"serious bodily injury,\" as defined above. On appeal, as at trial, Defendant contends the State's evidence failed to establish this second element-whether Defendant's conduct resulted in \"serious bodily injury.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The evidence at trial tended to show after the assault, A.R. had a long rip in her genitals; A.R. required 15 stitches and pain medication; A.R. remained out of work for two weeks and upon return to work was placed on modified duties; A.R. continued to suffer pain for three months, and it was six\n    months before the pain completely abated. A.R. has a large, jagged scar from the assault. Additionally, A.R.'s doctor testified an injury like A.R.'s \"would be significantly painful[.]\" However, Defendant contends A.R. suffered no serious, permanent disfigurement and no protracted condition causing her extreme pain.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Our courts have consistently recognized whether a serious bodily injury has been inflicted depends upon the facts of each case and is generally for the jury to decide under appropriate instructions. Indeed, this Court has held a trial court properly denied a defendant's motion to dismiss under similar facts on numerous occasions. For example, we have held the State presented evidence of \"serious bodily injury\" sufficient for a jury to decide (1) where the victim testified his injuries were \"very painful[,]\" he suffered pain in his mouth for about a month, and a doctor testified those injuries caused \"severe\" and \"extreme\" pain,\n    <em>\n     State v.

Her pain lasted for as much as six months, and her doctor described it as \"significantly painful.\" This evidence, taken together and giving the State the benefit of every reasonable inference, tends to show a \"permanent or protracted condition that causes extreme pain.\" Moreover, the assault left A.R. with a significant, jagged scar, which would support a finding of \"serious permanent disfigurement.\" Thus there is substantial evidence supporting a finding of \"serious bodily injury\" as defined by statute.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-32.4\">\n     N.C.

Habitual Misdemeanor Assault\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    In his second argument, Defendant contends there was insufficient evidence to submit the predicate misdemeanor of Assault Inflicting Serious Injury to the jury. Alternatively, Defendant contends once the jury returned its verdict, including finding Defendant guilty of the Class F felony of Assault Inflicting Serious Bodily Injury, the trial court was required to arrest judgment on misdemeanor Assault Inflicting Serious Injury and to not enter judgment on Habitual Misdemeanor Assault. Specifically, Defendant argues\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-33\">\n     N.C. Gen.

We are, however, constrained to agree that once Defendant was convicted of a Class F felony assault, the trial court was required to arrest judgment on the misdemeanor assault conviction and not enter judgment on the charge of Habitual Misdemeanor Assault arising from the same assault.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <em>\n     A.

Thus, for example, in\n    <em>\n     State v.
