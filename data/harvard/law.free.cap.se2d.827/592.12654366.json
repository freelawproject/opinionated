ARTHUR KELSEY\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Fairfax County School Board disciplined S.C., a high-school student, for nonconsensual, sexual touching of three students at school. S.C. appealed to the circuit court and sought a judicial vacatur of the School Board's decision. Finding that the School Board's decision was arbitrary in violation of S.C.'s due process rights, the circuit court dismissed the disciplinary proceedings against S.C. with prejudice. The School Board appeals, arguing that the circuit court misapplied the governing legal standards and misinterpreted the factual record of the disciplinary proceedings. We agree and reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Code \u00a7 22.1-87 authorizes petitions for judicial review of school board actions. The circuit court sits as an appellate tribunal when hearing these petitions and may consider the school board's orders, the hearing transcript, \"and any other evidence found relevant to the issues on appeal by the court.\" Code \u00a7 22.1-87. In this case, the parties did not offer any evidence outside of the administrative record, and thus, our review, as well as the circuit court's, is limited to that record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we, like the circuit court, independently review the record from the perspective of an appellate court, we give no deference to the circuit court's recitation of the facts or to its interpretation of the inferences arising from the underlying record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2016, S.C. began her freshman year at a high school in Fairfax County. At that time, one of S.C.'s parents received a copy of the school's policy entitled \"Student Rights and Responsibilities: A Guide for Families\" (the \"SR&amp;R\"). 2 J.A. at 318. This policy addressed \"Acts for Which Students May Be Disciplined.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 382. Those acts included \"any behavior incompatible with a K-12 educational environment and good citizenship.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 383. The policy then identified specific \"examples of prohibited conduct\" after twice clarifying that these were mere examples.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In pertinent part, the SR&amp;R stated that \"[a]cts for which students may be disciplined include, but are not limited to ... [a]ssault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under the category of \"[a]ssault,\" a list of various prohibited acts appeared, including \"[i]mproper touching of another person (whether or not consensual)\" as well as \"[s]exual assault or battery upon any person.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 384;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 355 (listing \"Improper Touching and/or Sexual Activity\" as an \"Offense and/or Violation\"). The school tests the students at the beginning of each school year to measure their understanding of the SR&amp;R. In September 2016, S.C. answered \"T\" for \"True\" to a test question asking whether \"[a] student who touches another student intentionally in his or her private areas will face disciplinary action and may be reported to the police.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 319-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 22, 2017, three female students reported to a school counselor that S.C. had touched them in a sexually inappropriate manner. In detailed, written statements and in oral statements to the assistant principal, the students alleged that the sexual touching was intentional on S.C.'s part and\n   nonconsensual on their part. One of three students stated that she was \"being sexually harassed\" and that she felt \"a bit unsafe\" and \"uncomfortable\" seeing S.C. in the hallways at school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 294, 299. A second student felt not only \"uncomfortable\" but also \"anxious\" around S.C.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 301. The third student was \"extremely nervous\" seeing S.C. at school because \"if she gets mad it's bad. She has others gang up on people.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 295, 300. Even though S.C. \"knows not to confront me,\" this student worried, \"if she confronts others they don't have [the] capability to defend themselves verbally or physically that I can.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 300.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The school administration responded promptly. On February 23, the assistant principal informed S.C. of the \"suspected infraction\" and explained \"the facts known to school personnel,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 542, who had interviewed the three alleged victims.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 288. On that same day, S.C. provided the school with a written statement in response to the allegations. In it, S.C. admitted to touching students while at school but claimed that the touching was consensual, adding that \"[t]hese people are really good and close friends of mine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 293.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Later on that day, the principal suspended S.C. for 10 days. The principal also referred the matter to the division superintendent's hearing officer for a disciplinary hearing to determine \"whether [S.C.] should be long-term suspended, reassigned to an alternative educational setting, or recommended to the School Board for expulsion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 541;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 546.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The referral letter stated that the referral was \"necessary because [S.C.] was involved in a sexual assault against another student.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 541. On the same day, the principal informed S.C.'s parents - both orally and in writing - that the reason for the suspension and referral was that S.C. had \"engaged in the sexual battery of other students while on school grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 542.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The principal's letter also informed S.C. that, upon request, S.C. could obtain \"a redacted copy of the discipline packet that is submitted in support of the disciplinary referral.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 543. That packet included written victim-impact statements by the accusing students.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. at 757, 763. Before the disciplinary hearing, S.C. and her parents obtained the \"discipline packet,\" 2 J.A. at 331-32, which informed them of the allegations that would be presented at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Office of the Division Superintendent scheduled the hearing for March 7 (Day 8 of S.C.'s 10-day suspension) but rescheduled it at the request of S.C.'s father for March 9 (Day 10 of the 10-day suspension).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two hearing officers representing the division superintendent presided over S.C.'s disciplinary hearing. S.C. appeared at the hearing represented by legal counsel. A court reporter transcribed the proceedings. Before the hearing began, S.C. acknowledged that she understood that she was accused of \"[s]exual assault against other students.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 424.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Early during the hearing, S.C.'s counsel sought to establish that S.C.'s conduct was not \"sexual battery,\" a \"criminal charge\" with elements defined by statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 450-52. \"I'll be happy to submit the statute,\" S.C.'s counsel declared, \"so that we can all get on the same page as to what battery and sexual battery is because that's what's been alleged here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 452. Counsel returned to this theme later in her appeal to the School Board by adding that \" Section 18.2-67.4 of the Code of Virginia defines 'sexual battery' \" as sexual abuse that is \"against the will of the complaining witness, by force, threat, intimidation, or ruse.\" 2 J.A. at 564.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In her testimony at the disciplinary hearing, S.C. stated that the allegations against her were only \"somewhat accurate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   486. Among her qualifications, S.C. indicated that she had touched one student's vagina once, not twice as the student had alleged, and that she had done this only after the student had agreed to the touching by saying, \"yes, I would let anyone touch me there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response to her counsel's immediate request for clarification, S.C. testified that she had only touched the student's \"inner thigh.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 487. S.C. also testified that one of the other accusers had asked to be touched \"under the shirt\" and that while doing so S.C. \"accidentally\" had touched the student's breast.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   S.C. did not equivocate, however, regarding the prohibition in the school's disciplinary policy. When asked whether \"school rules allow[ed] [her] to touch anyone in a sexual manner,\" S.C. admitted, \"No.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 490-91. She then admitted, without qualification, that she had violated this disciplinary policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Hearing Officer]: Did you touch someone in a sexual manner on school grounds?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [S.C.'s Counsel]: When you say a sexual manner, what do you mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [Hearing Officer]: Breasts, vaginal area, buttocks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [S.C.]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 491. After this admission, S.C.'s counsel requested that the hearing officers limit S.C.'s discipline to a reassignment to another regular public school. Counsel also conceded that S.C.'s conduct, even under S.C.'s version of events, could constitute a violation of the SR&amp;R policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   I read the Rules and Responsibilities packet, and even though the definition of assault and what is sexual battery is different than what is in the statute, it specifically talks about touching that is consensual or nonconsensual if it's improper. So despite [S.C.'s] intentions and what she said today, there's a very good possibility that this does fall within a disciplinary realm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 506.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The hearing officers found that S.C. had \"committed serious offenses in violation of School Board policy by committing multiple acts of offensive touching of three fellow students.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 554. The acts involved \"various incidents of sexual touching\" that \"were not consensual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The hearing officers made clear that they did \"not believe [S.C.'s] denials.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, they found that S.C.'s actions had been \"willful, deliberate, and far outside the bounds of acceptable student conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The hearing officers added that they \"were unable to determine ... whether [S.C.'s] inappropriate touching of students rose to the level of sexual battery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The hearing officers' inability to make this determination was irrelevant, however, because they had already found that \" 'improper touching of another person (whether or not consensual)' is a violation of SR&amp;R,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The discipline for S.C. included reassignment to an alternative learning center, probationary conditions for a minimum of one year, and reassignment to a different, regular high school at the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year if S.C. could complete the year successfully at the alternative learning center and if she could comply with all of the probationary conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Code \u00a7 22.1-279.3:1 requires division superintendents statewide annually to report data of certain incidents regarding discipline, crime, or violence to the Virginia Department of Education (\"VDOE\"). To do this, division superintendents use uniform reporting codes. The hearing officers in S.C.'s case ordered that her \"discipline record\" be amended by removing any reference to \"battery/assault of student-no injury\" and replacing it with the expression \"offensive touch-student.\" 2 J.A. at 554. A reiteration of the later phrase, \"Offensive Touching Against Student,\" is a generic reporting code \"designated by the [VDOE] for school systems to use when reporting a student's 'improper physical contact against [another] student that is offensive, undesirable, and/or unwanted, as determined by the victim.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 570 n.2 (second alteration in original) (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The hearing officers' finding that S.C. had sexually touched students without\n   their consent - thus violating the SR&amp;R prohibition against \"improper touching of another person (whether or not consensual),\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 554 - fit within the generic reporting code of \"Offensive Touching Against Student\" required by the VDOE, R. at 726-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After an unsuccessful appeal to the Fairfax County School Board, S.C. filed a petition for judicial review under Code \u00a7 22.1-87 in the circuit court. The court reviewed the record of S.C.'s disciplinary proceedings, received briefs and arguments from counsel, and entered a final order holding that the School Board had acted arbitrarily in disciplining S.C. because its decision had violated S.C.'s constitutional right to due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In response to a motion to reconsider by the School Board, the court entered an amended final order amplifying its reasoning and restating that \"the disciplinary proceedings against [S.C.] are therefore dismissed with prejudice by this Court.\" 1 J.A. at 277.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its amended final order, the circuit court reasoned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 Prior to the disciplinary hearing, the school had notified S.C. of the allegations of \"sexual battery\" made against her by three students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 272 (citation omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 \"[I]n seeming contradiction\" to that finding, the hearing officers could not determine whether S.C.'s conduct \"rose to the level of sexual battery\" and directed that the \"battery/assault of student-no injury\" phrase be removed from S.C.'s disciplinary record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 273 (citation omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 \"The effect of [the hearing officers'] ruling was to impose on this Court deference to a finding of fact that no 'assaults' occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 After exonerating S.C. of assault or battery, the hearing officers held that S.C. had committed \"offensive touch-student.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 273-74.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 The SR&amp;R provided \"notice to students\" that they could be disciplined for \"some variant of 'assault' or 'improper touching of another person (whether or not consensual).' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the SR&amp;R did not provide notice to students that they could be disciplined for \"offensive touch-student.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 274.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 \"The main difficulty\" identified by the circuit court was that the hearing officers had rejected a holding that S.C. had committed \"assaults\" yet had held that S.C. had committed \"offensive touch-student,\" an undefined disciplinary offense not found in the SR&amp;R.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Based upon this reasoning, the court concluded: \"The Court HOLDS ... that the contradictory findings of fact and resultant disciplinary transgression of 'offensive touch-student' ascribed to S.C. by [the hearing officers], as affirmed by the School Board, are sufficiently dissonant from the process due to constitute arbitrary action\" in violation of Code \u00a7 22.1-87. 1 J.A. at 276-77. As a remedy, the court thus ordered that S.C.'s disciplinary record \"be changed to vacate the finding of 'offensive touch-student.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 277.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On appeal, the School Board finds fault with the circuit court's legal reasoning as well as its interpretation of the factual record of the disciplinary proceedings. We agree with the School Board's argument on several points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In Virginia, judicial review of school disciplinary decisions must take into account the unique constitutional status of school boards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Constitution of Virginia created school boards and vested them with constitutional powers.\n   <em>\n    Wood ex rel.

The hearing was initially scheduled for Day 8 of the suspension but was postponed until Day 10 at the request of S.C.'s father. As the circuit court implicitly acknowledged, the 10-day\n   suspension violated no due process principles. Under\n   <em>\n    Goss\n   </em>\n   , S.C. received \"oral or written notice\" of the accusations against her and \"an opportunity to present [her] side of the story.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177671\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/419/565/#p578\">\n    419 U.S. at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177671\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/419/565/#p578\">\n    95 S.Ct. 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Apparently unconcerned about the 10-day suspension, the circuit court focused exclusively on the hearing officers' decision to reassign S.C. to an alternative school and to impose probationary conditions on her readmittance to a regular public school. The court focused its analysis on the specific wording of the principal's letter to S.C. before the hearing (which referred to a \"sexual battery\" charge) and the referral letter, issued the same day to the division superintendent's hearing officer (which recited a \"sexual assault\" charge).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 J.A. at 272-74. These two letters, the court presumed, constituted the only legally relevant notice that S.C. had received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The court then determined that S.C. was exonerated of these charges because the hearing officers had declined to find that S.C. had committed \"sexual battery\" and ordered the deletion of any mention of \"battery/assault of student-no injury\" from S.C.'s disciplinary record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 273-74, 276-77. \"The effect of the [hearing officers'] ruling,\" the circuit court reasoned, \"was to impose on [the circuit court] deference to a finding of fact that no 'assaults' occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 273. From there, the court observed that the disciplinary infraction that S.C. had allegedly committed - \"offensive touch-student\" - was not an infraction at all because this term was \"neither contained in nor defined by the SR&amp;R.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 274. It followed, the court concluded, that \"the contradictory findings of fact and resultant disciplinary transgression of 'offensive touch-student' ... are sufficiently dissonant from the process due to constitute arbitrary action\" in violation of Code \u00a7 22.1-87.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 276-77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We find the circuit court's factual predicates mistaken and its rationale legally erroneous. Our disagreement begins with the circuit court's view that the hearing officers boxed themselves in by stating that they \"were not able to determine\" whether S.C.'s nonconsensual sexual touching \"rose to the level of sexual battery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 273 (citation omitted). That finding, according to the circuit court, precluded the hearing officers from later finding that S.C. had offensively touched other students because battery (apparently according to its common-law definition) includes nonconsensual, offensive touching. The court's reasoning fails, however, because the hearing officers were not considering common-law battery. They were responding to the\n   <em>\n    statutory\n   </em>\n   definition of \"sexual battery\" that S.C.'s counsel had asserted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 450-52. That definition requires a showing that the act was accomplished \"by force, threat, intimidation, or ruse,\" Code \u00a7 18.2-67.4, a qualification that the VDOE's statutory policy guidelines recognize.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Thus, for good reason, the hearing officers found it unnecessary to determine whether S.C.'s sexual touching of other students had been accomplished by force, threat, intimidation, or ruse. It was enough that they specifically found that S.C. had sexually touched several students without their consent\n   and that they expressly rejected S.C.'s claims to the contrary. S.C.'s nonconsensual touching, the hearing officers found, had been \"willful, deliberate, and far outside the bounds of acceptable student conduct.\" 2 J.A. at 554. These factual findings fully justified the hearing officers' determination that S.C. had violated the SR&amp;R's express prohibition against \"improper touching of another person (whether or not consensual),\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The circuit court similarly misunderstood the hearing officers' use of the phrase \"offensive touch-student.\" The hearing officers never asserted that this phrase is a specific, verbatim disciplinary infraction in the SR&amp;R.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   1\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 273-74,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   2\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 554. Nor did the hearing officers hold, as the court presumed, that S.C. had violated some undefined disciplinary prohibition against \"offensive touch-student.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   1\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 276,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   2\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 554. Instead, they held that S.C.'s nonconsensual, offensive, and sexual touching had violated the clearly stated SR&amp;R prohibition against \"improper touching of another person (whether or not consensual),\" 2\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 554.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As noted earlier, \"offensive touch-student\" merely referred to a state-wide, uniform\n   <em>\n    reporting code\n   </em>\n   used for statistical purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 570;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 99; R. at 726-27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Code \u00a7 22.1-279.3:1 requires all division superintendents in Virginia annually to report data to the VDOE regarding certain incidents of discipline, crime, and violence. The hearing officers' finding that S.C. had sexually touched students without their consent - thus violating the SR&amp;R prohibition against \"improper touching of another person (whether or not consensual),\" 2 J.A. at 554 - fit within \"Offensive Touching Against Student,\" a generic reporting code required by the VDOE, R. at 726-27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court erred, therefore, in presuming that the latter, and not the former, was the specific SR&amp;R violation committed by S.C. that the hearing officers had found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   With these factual predicates corrected, we can now answer the question whether the School Board (by affirming the hearing officers' disciplinary decision) acted arbitrarily in violation of S.C.'s procedural due process rights.

The letter simply summarized in a single phrase (\"sexual battery\") the allegations that S.C. had already been told in detail. The assistant principal orally notified S.C. of \"the facts known to school personnel,\" 2 J.A. at 542, which were later disclosed in detailed, written,\n   victim-impact statements from the students,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. at 757, 763.
