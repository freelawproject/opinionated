Smith (Nephew) and Margaret P. Kelly (Niece) (collectively, Respondents). DeHaven argues summary judgment was improper because she presented sufficient evidence to the probate court of both undue influence and the existence of a confidential or fiduciary\n   relationship, thus establishing a presumption of invalidity. We affirm.\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Respondents are the children of Decedent's sister-in-law, who was the sister of Decedent's wife, Edith Pursley Tucker (Wife). After Wife died, her family remained close to Decedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In November 2011, Decedent was hospitalized at Carolinas Medical Center for ten days due to \"injuries in a large part of his body.\" According to Niece, hospital doctors indicated Decedent's injuries were inconsistent with a fall, which his caregiver, Brenda Snow, reported as the cause of his injuries. On December 13, 2011, Decedent moved to Westminster Towers in Rock Hill. When he was admitted, a social worker noted Decedent's family shared information seeking to prohibit the former caregiver, Snow, from visiting Decedent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 14, 2012, a physical therapist became concerned when she was unable to wake Decedent. She was eventually able to rouse him, but he was groggy. EMS transported Decedent to Piedmont Medical Center, where doctors diagnosed him with a 7.7 cm distal abdominal aneurysm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Emergency room physician Jason Ratterree located the aneurysm and explained the condition to Decedent on the evening of January 14th. As to Decedent's mental condition, Dr. Ratterree noted Decedent was \"oriented in time, place, and person. Grossly appropriate mood and affect.\" When asked in his deposition what this notation meant, Dr. Ratterree replied, \"He was totally normal. ... He knew where he was at that time and did not appear to be having any abnormal behavior and was conversational with me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Niece testified in her deposition that Decedent sought to make a new will that same evening, after he learned of the aneurysm. Niece recalled Decedent took the news of the aneurysm quite seriously because he \"had always been a very healthy person.\" After the doctor discussed the diagnosis and\n   left the hospital room, Decedent asked Niece to write a will for him and inquired whether she would \"be willing to put it down on paper the way he wanted it.\" Niece acted as scrivener for the will, which Decedent dictated to her in the presence of two witnesses. The two witnesses confirmed that Decedent raised the subject of a new will and Niece wrote down the terms as Decedent requested and according to his instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Decedent remained at Piedmont Medical Center until January 20, 2012, when he returned to Westminster Towers. On February 8, 2012, he executed a durable power of attorney for health care naming Niece as his primary decision maker. A social worker from Westminster Towers testified there had been issues with a previous healthcare power of attorney Decedent signed while hospitalized; thus, he executed the February 2012 document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Decedent passed away on May 12, 2012. On May 17, 2012, the probate court granted Respondents' application for informal probate and appointment of personal representatives. On the application, Respondents listed the date of the execution of the will as January 14, 2012 (the Will). They listed twelve nieces and nephews, including themselves, as the Will's named devisees. A niece from Decedent's side of the family, Margaret Dudley, and two nephews, Wayne Scott and Kevin Scott, were listed in the application for informal probate as intestate heirs who were not devisees named in the Will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 10, 2013, Mary Jean Tucker Swiger, Decedent's sister, petitioned the probate court for formal testacy and appointment and sought to set aside the informal probate, claiming Respondents initiated the request for informal probate with an invalid will. Swiger further asserted Respondents had exerted undue influence upon Decedent and sought removal of Respondents as co-personal representatives of Decedent's estate. In the petition, Carol DeHaven, Swiger's daughter, is listed as a successor-in-interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Respondents answered and counterclaimed for formal testacy and appointment based upon the terms of the Will. Respondents\n   admitted Swiger was Decedent's sole-surviving sibling but denied that \"status as a sole surviving sibling itself establishes standing.\"\n   Swiger sought a temporary order to restrain Respondents from acting as personal representatives of Decedent's estate. Swiger also requested Respondents be required to post a bond. The probate court denied Swiger's motion for a temporary restraining order but granted her motion for a restricted bank account in lieu of bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Respondents moved for partial summary judgment, arguing no genuine issue of material fact existed to support Swiger's claims of undue influence, fraud, or lack of jurisdiction. Respondents further asserted the Will was executed with the appropriate formalities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the summary judgment hearing, Respondents moved to substitute DeHaven as a petitioner in the case so the caption would read \"Swiger by her attorney-in-fact Carol DeHaven\" due to Swiger's mental incapacity. Petitioner consented, and the probate court granted the motion to substitute. After the probate court granted Respondents' motion for partial summary judgment, DeHaven appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the probate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Respondents moved to dismiss DeHaven's appeal to this court, arguing DeHaven, acting as Swiger's attorney-in-fact, engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by filing the appeal. Respondents also claimed the notice of appeal was defective because DeHaven failed to include the probate court's order with the filing of the notice. DeHaven filed a return, asserting she had the authority to appeal on behalf of Swiger, who is now deceased,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as her \"legal representative\" because the probate court allowed her to substitute for Swiger. This court denied the motion to dismiss but ordered DeHaven to retain counsel. Counsel for DeHaven filed a notice of appearance on May 3, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Niece testified that when Decedent was hospitalized in November, his doctors and nurses believed his injuries were the result of \"some kind of abuse,\" rather than a fall. Although no charges were filed against Snow, doctors were concerned about Decedent returning to his home because they believed Snow was abusing him.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Swiger passed away on October 6, 2015.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    On May 4, 2016, Respondents again moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing DeHaven lacked standing to prosecute the appeal because DeHaven's status as Swiger's \"attorney-in-fact\" terminated upon Swiger's death, and DeHaven had not provided any information indicating a personal representative had been appointed, an executor had been appointed, or a probate estate had been opened. This court denied the motion\n    to dismiss but ruled Respondents could raise the standing issue during briefing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    <strong>\n     Standard of Review\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    \"An action to contest a will is an action at law, and in such cases reviewing courts will not disturb the probate court's findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses no evidence to support them.\"\n    <em>\n     Hairston v.

Decedent executed the Will on January 14, 2012. Thereafter,\n    on February 5, 2012, Marcy Thomas, Decedent's social worker, reported:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    [Decedent] spoke at length about nieces and nephews and his will. He understands that they want to be included in his will. He said \"this is why they are not in my will.\" He clearly stated that he \"loved his 'little girl' very much and she took good care of him\" and he \"wanted her to have the money he designated her to have in his will.\" [Decedent] stated how upset he was when one nephew came and asked for his money to be divided evenly.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Thomas opined Decedent was \"having a very cognitively clear afternoon\" the day they had this discussion, which occurred almost three weeks after the execution of the Will. But, there is no evidence that Decedent attempted to change his will at any point after its January 14th execution, despite this cognitive clarity. Therefore, we find the circuit court correctly affirmed the probate court's grant of summary judgment because DeHaven failed to provide more than a scintilla of evidence to establish undue influence was exerted upon Decedent\n    <em>\n     when he executed the Will\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Russell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"711194\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/353/208/#p218\">\n     353 S.C. at 219\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"711194\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/353/208/#p218\">\n     578 S.E.2d at 335\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"In order for the will to be void due to undue influence, '[a] contestant must show that the influence was brought directly to bear upon the testamentary act.' \" (alteration by court) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Mock\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2141055\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/266/274/#p277\">\n     266 S.C. at 277\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2141055\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/266/274/#p277\">\n     222 S.E.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    774 )).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Decedent had numerous nieces and nephews-those on his wife's side of the family, who are devisees under the Will, and those on his side, whom he chose not to include. In their interrogatory responses, Respondents claimed Decedent did not even want his side of the family to be notified of his death.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Although this conversation did not identify which specific nieces and nephews Decedent sought to exclude, other evidence in the record established Respondents were not among the disinherited group of relatives from Decedent's own side of the family.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Nephew believed any statement by Decedent that he wanted to give his money to \"his little girl,\" likely referred to Snow, the former caregiver. Niece knew Snow was included in Decedent's prior will and stated Decedent told her he wanted to \"look after\" Snow. However, Nephew testified Decedent's attorney told Nephew to destroy the prior will due to the conflict of interest presented by Snow's involvement and her\n    influence over Decedent, along with the abuse concerns raised upon Decedent's admission to Carolinas Medical Center.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The only evidence DeHaven provided to suggest the words in the Will were not Decedent's own was the testimony of Dr. James Jewell, a physician at Decedent's nursing home who indicated he would \"be surprised that given the situation ... that these words would be [Decedent's].\" He clarified, \"It would depend on the person themselves, whether they were legalese oriented in that way. I'm not saying that they wouldn't necessarily understand what was here.\" Dr. Jewell admitted he did not remember Decedent well and had visited Decedent only two or three times. Dr. Jewell further testified it was unlikely he had formally assessed Decedent's mental status.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Significantly, DeHaven did not set forth any evidence that Respondents restricted visitation with respect to her side of the family. The evidence in the record reflects Respondents sought only to prohibit Snow from visiting Decedent, and there is no evidence that Snow ever attempted to visit or contact Decedent while he lived at Westminster Towers.\n    <em>\n     Contra\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Estate of Cumbee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"799425\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/333/664/#p671\">\n     333 S.C. at 672\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"799425\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/333/664/#p671\">\n     511 S.E.2d at 394\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting the record contained evidence of undue influence where although testator had access to visitors, her son admitted he monitored her conversations with her other son via a baby monitor and testator created hand signals to communicate with her visitors);\n    <em>\n     Byrd v.

DeHaven provided no proof of actual restricted visitation nor evidence to establish how any alleged restricted visitation could have influenced Decedent's execution of the Will.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Similarly, there is scant evidence in the record suggesting family members from DeHaven's side of the family ever attempted to visit Decedent during any alleged restrictive period. For example, in their interrogatory responses, Respondents explained:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    When [Decedent] received notice from Margaret Dudley [, Decedent's niece on his side of the family,] that she and\n    others were planning to visit during their travel to Florida, [Decedent] requested that he not be left alone with them because they were only interested in his money.

Even when viewed in the light most favorable to DeHaven, this interrogatory response constitutes, at most, a mere scintilla of evidence of restricted visitation-and suggests Decedent himself sought the restriction.

Even if Respondents had some influence over Decedent's disposition of his estate, such influence did not amount to undue influence because Decedent had the testamentary capacity to dispose of his estate, and DeHaven failed to provide sufficient evidence that Decedent's will was in any way restrained or overcome.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Howard\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1132925\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/364/279/#p289\">\n     364 S.C. at 289\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1132925\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/364/279/#p289\">\n     613 S.E.2d at 69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"If the testator had the testamentary capacity to dispose of his property and was free and unrestrained in his volition at the time of making the will, the influence that may have inspired it or some provision of it will not be undue influence.\" (quoting\n    <em>\n     In re Last Will &amp; Testament of Smoak\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2166892\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/286/419/#p424\">\n     286 S.C. at 424\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2166892\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/286/419/#p424\">\n     334 S.E.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    809 )).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Based on the foregoing, the summary judgment orders of the probate court and circuit court are\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    <strong>\n     AFFIRMED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    HUFF and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-61\">\n     Respondents assert DeHaven's argument as to the rebuttable presumption presented by a \"confidential or fiduciary relationship\" is unpreserved.
