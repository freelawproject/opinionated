Pursuant to this disposition, the circuit court placed the children, T.S. and V.A., in the \"legal and physical custody\" of the guardians, J.H. and T.H., V.A.'s nonabusing, biological father and stepmother. The petitioner assigns several errors but we only address whether the circuit court erred when it determined disposition regarding his child without first allowing him a meaningful opportunity to be heard at the dispositional hearing. Upon review of the parties' briefs and arguments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the appendix record, and all other matters submitted before the Court, we reverse the circuit court's decision on this issue, and remand the case to the circuit court for the limited purpose of providing the petitioner the opportunity to both testify and present evidence at a dispositional hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 27, 2017, the DHHR filed an \"Imminent Danger Petition\" against the petitioner\n   and the mother, J.S., alleging that the pair had exposed V.A., who is ten years old, and T.S., who is six years old, to domestic violence in the home. The allegations stemmed from the petitioner and the mother being involved in a domestic dispute during which the mother told V.A. to call the police. V.A. reported that she saw the petitioner punch her mother in the face \"causing bruises and marks\" and that T.S. was present during the altercation. V.A. also reported that the petitioner sometimes called both her mother and her names like \"bitch\" and \"asshole\" and that she only felt safe in the home \"sometimes.\" V.A. reported that she was interviewed by Child Protective Services (\"C.P.S.\") the prior month but was not truthful about the domestic violence in the home because her parents told her not to say anything. Both parents denied domestic violence in the home and later reported that V.A. had mental health issues and should not be believed. As for T.S., the DHHR alleged \"upon information and belief, ... [T.S.] was observed at the residence to be soiled with what was described to be coal dust; and very upset, ... screaming and crying for the Respondent Mother who left him inside the residence with the door closed, which was emotionally harmful to said Child.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The allegations reflected that the DHHR tried to put a \"Temporary Protection Plan\" in place with the parents for the children's safety and the parents refused to cooperate. Further, the parents refused to provide any names of relatives for the temporary placement of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   An adjudicatory hearing was held on February 22, 2017, and counsel for both the petitioner and the mother each requested a pre-adjudicatory improvement period, which the circuit court granted for a three-month period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a hearing on May 30, 2017, at the end of the pre-adjudicatory improvement period, because the parties did not have any witnesses to call, the circuit court, after considering the arguments of counsel, determined that there were disputed factual issues that needed to be resolved at an adjudicatory hearing. The petitioner then requested that the adjudicatory hearing be \"repurposed\" into an evidentiary hearing on whether the pre-adjudicatory improvement period conditions had been successfully completed. The circuit court granted the petitioner's request and set the matter for June 22, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The guardian ad litem (\"GAL\") filed an \"Amended Imminent Danger Petition\" on June 9, 2017. The allegations in the amended petition were that the petitioner and the mother had subjected the children to medical abuse and neglect and to physical abuse. The GAL alleged that prior to the abuse and neglect proceedings being instituted, the parents took the children to several physicians where the children were diagnosed with serious mental and physical maladies and that the diagnoses were based upon histories from the parents concerning behaviors claimed to have been exhibited by both V.A. and T.S. These diagnoses resulted in the children being prescribed medications. After the children were placed into foster care, the children were seen by a physician at the request of DHHR and the physician determined that most of the children's medicines should be drastically reduced or discontinued. The doctor found that the children did not suffer from most of the diseases with which they had been diagnosed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amended petition also contained an allegation that after the case began, V.A. reported during a Child Advocacy Center interview that there was additional domestic violence committed by the petitioner on both the mother and children, which included hair pulling and hitting. Both parents continued to deny domestic violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the adjudicatory hearing, the petitioner and the mother both signed stipulated adjudications\n   in open court. The petitioner stipulated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   the infant respondents have been exposed to neglect and/or abuse due to the following deficiencies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   a. He [the petitioner] admits that the DHHR, the Guardian ad Litem, and ... [V.A.'s] therapist all have addressed concerns regarding the need for the Respondent Father to make therapeutic admissions during family counseling sessions, recognizing that his prior actions have traumatized ... [V.A.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   b. He admits that ... [V.A.] has suffered emotional harm due to his actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The petitioner also stated that the stipulated adjudication was in the best interest of his children. The circuit court, based upon the petitioner's stipulation, adjudicated him an \"abusing and neglectful parent.\" The petitioner was granted a post-adjudicatory improvement period not to exceed six months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The case ultimately proceeded to a dispositional hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the hearing, which was held on March 21, 2018, the mother requested that the circuit court accept a \"Disposition 5,\" pursuant to West Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(b)(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DHHR, the Court-Appointed Special Advocate (\"CASA\") representative, and the GAL all agreed with the disposition. During the remainder of the hearing, the DHHR called its witnesses, who testified regarding the petitioner's disposition, which included the testimony of Christine Christy, an outreach coordinator with Home Base, Inc., who had supervised visits between the children and the petitioner, and Sharon McMillen, the children's licensed clinical psychologist, who discussed the children's progress during therapy, as well as her interaction with the petitioner during a therapy session.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The dispositional hearing was continued to April 16, 2018. At that time, the DHHR was allowed to proceed with its evidence with no time limitation being mentioned by the circuit court. The DHHR called, Carrie Poier, a CPS worker for the DHHR and the only witness to testify. Ms. Poier testified about the petitioner's progress with services offered by the DHHR, as well as the children's progress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Significantly, at the close of the DHHR's case, the circuit court asked the petitioner's counsel if he had any evidence to present to the court. The petitioner first wanted to call the CASA representative as a witness. When the circuit court asked what the CASA representative would testify to, the petitioner's counsel responded: \"I'm not sure, Your Honor.\" The circuit court inquired whether the CASA representative was on the petitioner's witness list, and counsel advised that she was not on either the petitioner's or the DHHR's list. The circuit court denied the petitioner's request to call the CASA representative as a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The petitioner's counsel then asked to call the petitioner to testify. The circuit court again asked the petitioner's counsel what his client would testify to and the petitioner's counsel responded: \"To his participation and services, what he's learned, what he's willing to do and what he's been willing to do this entire time.\" The circuit court converted this statement into a \"proffer\" as it proceeded to decision on disposition, stating: \"I've also heard proffer that ... [the petitioner] would tell the Court all the things he's willing to do, but I have to go by what's happened during the improvement period....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit\n   court then inquired of the petitioner's counsel as to the relief that the petitioner was seeking. The petitioner's counsel responded that he was asking for the case to be dismissed and that T.S. be returned to him as \"[t]here has been nothing in her[e] where ... [T.S.] suffered any trauma, whatsoever.\" The petitioner also sought a post-dispositional improvement period. The circuit court never asked the petitioner if he had other evidence to present or witnesses he would call to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Instead, the circuit court proceeded to disposition, with the judge stating that he was on a \"limited clock,\" that the hearing got started late, and that the court needed to get the case resolved as \"my tenure as Senior Status Judge is going to end this week.\" The judge stated that if the case was not resolved, it would go on for many more months. Despite both the DHHR and the GAL seeking termination of the petitioner's parental rights, the circuit court refused to terminate the petitioner's parental rights, and instead proceeded to impose a disposition pursuant to West Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(b)(5), finding that the petitioner was \"unwilling or unable to provide adequately for the needs of either child.\" The circuit court further stated that because of the petitioner's lack of empathy and refusal to acknowledge the trauma to V.A., there had been emotional harm to the children. It is the circuit court's dispositional order entered on July 9, 2018, that forms the basis for the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court applies the following standard of review to dispositional determinations made by the circuit court in abuse and neglect cases:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Although conclusions of law reached by a circuit court are subject to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, when an action, such as an abuse and neglect case, is tried upon the facts without a jury, the circuit court shall make a determination based upon the evidence and shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether such child is abused or neglected. These findings shall not be set aside by a reviewing court unless clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support the finding, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. However, a reviewing court may not overturn a finding simply because it would have decided the case differently, and it must affirm a finding if the circuit court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Syl.

We caution that Rule 11(j) expressly applies to \"all parties\" in an abuse and neglect appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Because of our decision to reverse the case, we need not address the petitioner's other assigned errors, which included: 1) whether the circuit court erred in imposing disposition pursuant to West Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(b)(5) when the conditions of abuse and neglect had been corrected prior to the dispositional hearing; 2) whether the circuit court failed to take evidence to determine whether the petitioner had successfully completed his improvement periods in this matter; 3) whether the circuit court erred in imposing disposition pursuant to West Virginia Code \u00a7 49-4-604(b)(5) with regard to T.S. when the circuit court never found that T.S. had been abused and neglected due to the actions of the petitioner; 4) whether the circuit court erred when it placed T.S. in the legal and physical custody of persons of no blood relationship to T.S., out of state, and without the benefit of a home study; and, 5) whether the circuit court erred in denying the petitioner's request for a dispositional improvement period, as a meaningful attempt at family counseling is in the best interests of the children. With regard to the petitioner's last two assigned errors, he neither provided the Court with any citation to the appendix record nor legal authority to support either of these alleged errors.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    W.
