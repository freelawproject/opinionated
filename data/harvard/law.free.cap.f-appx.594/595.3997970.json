On appeal, Jenkins argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court relied on unproven facts in imposing his sentence. He also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately consider all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-21\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion, and we will reverse only if the district court made a clear error in judgment. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment if the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant violated a condition of his supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In determining an appropriate sentence following the revocation of supervised release, \u201cthe court should sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust, while taking into account, to a limited degree, the seriousness of the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines ch. 7, pt. A(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-22\">Reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence is a two-part process that requires us to ensure that first, the district court did not commit a significant procedural error, and second, that the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>sonable. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">\u201cA sentence may be proeedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the Guidelines range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Jenkins cannot show that the district court committed a significant procedural error. At his revocation of supervised release hearing, the government introduced evidence that Jenkins had been arrested in Iowa and was subject to two arrest warrants in Georgia. Although Jenkins argues that there was insufficient evidence for the district court to find that he committed offenses in Iowa and Georgia, the district court made no such finding. Instead, the court stated only that the arrest and arrest warrants showed that Jenkins had left the Southern District of Florida without permission \u2014 which itself violated the conditions of Jenkins\u2019s supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Revocation Tr. 17, July 17, 2014 (\u201cAnd so am I considering those arrests at least in connection with his departure from the district, although I\u2019m not concluding that he committed those crimes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Nor can Jenkins show that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. In evaluating the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, \u201c[w]e consider the totality of the circumstances and evaluate whether the sentence achieves the sentencing purposes stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). As such, the district court need not specifically address every mitigating factor raised by the defendant in order for the sentence to be substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 873 (11th Cir.2010). In addition, the fact that a sentence is well below the statutory maximum sentence weighs in favor of reasonableness. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">In this case, Jenkins\u2019s 12-month sentence was one month above the high end of his advisory Guidelines range, but well below the 24-month statutory maximum for his offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Although Jenkins contends that the district court improperly balanced the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, his sentence is not substantively unreasonable simply because the district court failed to specifically address every mitigating factor he raised. <em>See Snipes, </em>611 F.3d at 873. Similarly, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to place greater emphasis on Jenkins\u2019s criminal history than on his acceptance of responsibility because the weight to give any particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>See Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">For these reasons, Jenkins has not established that his sentence was either procedurally or substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">. Jenkins does not dispute that he left the Southern District of Florida without permission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
