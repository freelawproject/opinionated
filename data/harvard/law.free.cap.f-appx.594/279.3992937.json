He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable and greater than necessary to satisfy the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-24\">We review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Dominguez-Godinez\u2019s arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>fail to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that we apply to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Canipos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). The district court, who was \u201cin a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d was presented with Dominguez-Godinez\u2019s mitigating arguments but concluded that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate. <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. As Dominguez-Godinez concedes, his argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not be applied to his sentence because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santi-ago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
