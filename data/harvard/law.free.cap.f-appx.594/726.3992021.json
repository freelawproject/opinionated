Because Brown\u2019s petition challenges an intervening judgment, it is not \u201csecond or successive\u201d and does not require our authorization for filing. We thus will transfer the petition back to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-25\">In 1990, Brown was convicted of first degree murder, arson, and a violation of the Pennsylvania Corrupt Organizations Act (PACOA) in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. The case involved a drug distribution ring. A person who was suspected of stealing funds from the ring was lured to a drug house where he was stabbed and beaten to death; the house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>was then set on fire. Brown was not present during the murder, but one member of the ring testified that the crimes were carried out based on Brown\u2019s instructions. Brown was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for the murder, no additional penalty for the arson, and a consecutive sentence of 48-86 months\u2019 imprisonment for the PACOA charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In 2008, Brown filed a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, raising ten claims of prosecutorial misconduct and one claim challenging his PACOA conviction. The District Court dismissed the prosecu-torial misconduct claims as untimely, granted relief on the PACOA claim based on <em>Commonwealth v. Besch, </em>544 Pa. 1, 674 A.2d 655 (1996) (superseded by statute; <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 911(h)(3), as amended June 19, 1996),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and remanded the matter to the state court, ordering that the PA-COA sentence be vacated, and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall release petitioner from his present confinement unless the. Commonwealth provides him with a new sentencing hearing, within ninety (90) days of the court\u2019s order, so that petitioner can be re-sentenced on all the remaining charges for which he was convicted and sentenced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">A99-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">On remand, the Common Plea\u2019s Court docket sheet reflects entry of this order: \u201cFinding of guilt on charge of Corrupt Organization is vacated, and def. found not guilty. Therefore the sentence imposed on 04/27/94 is also vacated as to THIS CHARGE ONLY.\u201d A47. Brown appealed, arguing that the trial court erred by failing to provide him with counsel for resentenc-ing. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania agreed, noting that it was \u201cof no moment\u201d that \u201cthe trial court merely vacated a portion of [Brown\u2019s] prior sentence and imposed no additional terms,\u201d as [n]either party could have known what sentence the trial court would impose at the January 7, 2009 sentencing hearing.\u201d A109.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court noted that \u201cthis was a sentencing hearing concerning multiple felonies, and Appellant had the right to counsel at this critical stage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court vacated the trial court\u2019s order and remanded \u201cfor the appointment of counsel at resentencing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">After counsel was appointed, Brown was again sentenced to life in prison without parole. The trial court rejected Brown\u2019s argument that he should receive a new trial because the murder and arson convictions were inextricably intertwined with the vacated PACOA conviction. A174-81.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Superior Court agreed that Brown was not entitled to relief, finding that his issues were not cognizable in the appeal from resentencing, but noting in the alternative that Brown\u2019s \u201ccontention that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>[PACOA] charge was the sole avenue to admissibility of evidence used to convict him of murder and arson is not supported by the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence or by case law.\u201d <em>Commw. v. Broum, </em>No. 34 EDA 2011, slip op. at 8, 12, 60 A.3d 857 (Pa.Super.Ct. Sep. 20, 2012) (non-preee-dential) (A120, 124). The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied review on April 11, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Brown then filed the \u00a7 2254 petition at issue here, raising seven claims. The first four claims<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> are based on his allegation that the murder and arson convictions were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the PACOA conviction. The last three claims are entirely new claims (a Vienna Convention claim, and claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately inform Brown about his right to testify and for failing to request a directed verdict). The Court found that the petition was an unauthorized second or successive petition, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b), and transferred the petition to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We directed the District Attorney for Philadelphia to enter an appearance and respond to the application, addressing whether, in light of <em>Magwood v. Patterson, </em>561 U.S. 320, 130 S.Ct. 2788, 177 L.Ed.2d 592 (2010), the District Court erred in treating Brown\u2019s petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 as second or successive. We also invited Brown to respond to the issue, and both parties have filed responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">We turn to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Magwood </em>to answer the question of whether Brown\u2019s petition was \u201csecond or successive\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(b). In that case, after a state prisoner had filed a \u00a7 2254 petition challenging his Alabama murder conviction and death sentence, the district court conditionally granted his petition and vacated his death sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 323-26, 130 S.Ct. 2788. The trial court subsequently held new sentencing proceedings, and it again sentenced the prisoner to death. <em>Id. </em>at 326, 130 S.Ct. 2788. He then filed a \u00a7 2254 petition challenging his new sentence on the ground that, <em>inter alia, </em>he did not have fair warning that his conduct would be sufficient to warrant a death sentence under Alabama law. <em>Id. </em>at 328, 130 S.Ct. 2788. After the district court conditionally granted the writ, the court of appeals reversed in relevant part. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 130 S.Ct. 2788. \u201cIt concluded that the first step in determining whether \u00a7 2244(b) applies is to \u2018separate the new claims challenging the resentencing from the old claims that were or should have been presented in the prior application,\u2019 the appeals court then found the fair-warning claim was second or successive. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Magwood v. Culliver, </em>555 F.3d 968, 975 (11th Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">The Supreme Court disagreed with this approach, and held that this petition was not \u201csecond or successive\u201d under \u00a7 2244(b). <em>Id. </em>at 342, 130 S.Ct. 2788: The Court explained that \u201cthe phrase \u2018second or successive\u2019 must be interpreted with respect to the judgment challenged,\u201d and that, where \u201cthere is a new judgment intervening between the two habeas petitions, ... an application challenging the resulting new judgment is not \u2018second or successive\u2019 at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333, 341-42, 130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>S.Ct. 2788 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Additionally, the Court held that the phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d applies to entire habeas petitions, and not to individual claims in those petitions. <em>Id. </em>at 384-35, 130 S.Ct. 2788. Because the state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was his first collateral attack on the \u201cintervening judgment\u201d between his first and second \u00a7 2254 petitions, the Court concluded that it was not successive under \u00a7 2244(b). <em>Id. </em>at 339, 342, 130 S.Ct. 2788. The Court stated that it had no occasion to decide whether a petitioner who had \u201cobtain[ed] a conditional writ as to his sentence\u201d could \u201cfile a subsequent application challenging not only his resulting, <em>new </em>sentence, but also his original, <em>undisturbed </em>conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342, 130 S.Ct. 2788.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Respondents argue that <em>Magwood </em>is distinguishable because Brown is not challenging any aspect of his resentencing but instead is \u201cehalleng[ing] the guilt-phase portion of his entirely different judgment of sentence for first-degree murder, which was unaffected by the limited grant of the writ arising from his 2008 habeas litigation.\u201d Resp. Br. at 24. We disagree. Although the first trial court order after remand attempted to simply vacate the PACOA \u201cfinding of guilt,\u201d and leave the rest of the conviction unaltered, the Superior Court vacated that order, and the matter was remanded for appointment of counsel at resentencing, noting that \u201cthis was a sentencing hearing concerning multiple felonies,\u201d and that \u201cneither party could have known what sentence the trial court would impose.\u201d Thus, the Superior Court, like the District Court, required something more than a mechanical correction of the docket. And the trial court fulfilled that requirement on remand. After considering and rejecting Brown\u2019s argument that he should receive a new trial on the remaining counts, the court \u201cresen-tenced [Brown] to life imprisonment without parole on his first degree murder conviction.\u201d A176.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">We conclude that there was an \u201cintervening judgment\u201d between Brown\u2019s first and second habeas petition, and that Brown\u2019s second-in-time \u00a7 2254 petition was thus \u201cnot \u2018second or successive\u2019 at all,\u201d as \u201cthe existence of a new judgment is dispositive.\u201d <em>See Magwood, </em>561 U.S. at 341-42, 338, 130 S.Ct. 2788; <em>see also Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 132, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993) (judgment of conviction includes both adjudication of guilt and sentence). Further, given Magwood\u2019s focus on whether the applicant is challenging a <em>new judgment </em>rather than focusing on whether the applicant is bringing a new <em>claim, we </em>hold that \u201cwhere a first habeas petition results in an amended judgment, a subsequent petition is not successive regardless of whether it challenges the conviction, the sentence, or both.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>623 F.3d 41, 46 (2d Cir.2010); <em>see also Wentzell v. Neven, </em>674 F.3d 1124, 1127 (9th Cir.2012) (same); <em>Blanco v. Sec., Florida Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>688 F.3d 1211, 1240 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that \u00a7 2254 petition was not \u201csecond or successive\u201d even though the factual predicate for petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim was available when he filed his first \u00a7 2254 petition, because there was an intervening judgment resentencing him to death).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">We recognize that some of our sister courts have interpreted <em>Magwood </em>differently. <em>See Suggs v. United States, </em>705 F.3d 279, 285 (7th Cir.2013) (holding that where a movant\u2019s new motion challenges his underlying conviction and not the re-sentencing, the motion is successive and subject to the gatekeeping requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244); <em>cf. In re Lampton, </em>667 F.3d 585, 588-89 (5th Cir.2012) <em>(Magwood </em>does not apply where federal sentence and conviction were vacated as to one count of a multi-count conviction, but the court en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>tered no new judgment of conviction; judgment as to remaining counts \u201cremained intact\u201d). But we believe that the Supreme Court decision makes clear that \u201ca habeas petition is deemed initial or successive by reference to the <em>judgment </em>it attacks \u2014 not which <em>component </em>of the judgment it attacks or the nature or genesis of the <em>claims </em>it raises.\u201d <em>Suggs, </em>705 F.3d at 287-88 (Sykes, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">We thus will deny as unnecessary Brown\u2019s application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 petition, and direct the Clerk to transfer Brown\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition back to the District Court, to be considered as his first challenge to his new judgment. We express no opinion on the merits of Brown\u2019s claims, and Respondents remain free to raise any procedural defenses to the claims, if applicable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-15\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-9\">. <em>Besch </em>held that a' PACOA conviction for activity in a wholly illegitimate enterprise (such as Brown's) was invalid. <em>Besch, </em>674 A.2d at 655, 659.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b755-10\">. According to Respondents, no hearing had been held.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b755-11\">. It appears that the trial court may have misread the District Court\u2019s order. It appears to have believed that a full resentencing was simply a recommendation of the District Court, rather than an order. <em>See </em>A175 (noting that \"[Judge] Fullam ... 'respectfully recommend[ed] that\u2019 \u201d the Commonwealth provide Brown a new sentencing hearing, and \"further <em>recommend[ed] </em>that the remand be for resentencing on all the remaining Bills of Information\u201d (emphasis added by trial court)). In fact, the cited recommendations were those of the Magistrate Judge <em>to the District Court. </em>The District Court adopted the recommendations and wrote an <em>order </em>conditionally granting the writ. Nevertheless, because the trial court considered Brown\u2019s contention that the remaining sentences were affected by the vacation of the PACOA count, any misunderstanding was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">. The four claims are: (1) Petitioner's fundamental right to a fair trial has been denied; (2) Conviction obtained on a factual basis different than as charged; (3) Jury instruction improperly shifted burden of proof; and (4) Conviction of less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of the crime charged. Brown does not clearly articulate what each of these claims is, but for the \"supporting facts\u201d of each he declares that the claim is valid because the convictions were all inextricably intertwined.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
