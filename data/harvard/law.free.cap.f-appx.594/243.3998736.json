For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">LCLS prepares aspiring contractors for their state licensing exams. As part of this business LCLS provides review questions. ACES, a competitor business to LCLS, also helps contractors prepare for state exams. LCLS brought a copyright infringement suit against ACES for allegedly using its copyrighted study materials. The district court granted ACES\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that of the \u201c1,083 multiple-choice questions in the plaintiffs copyrighted materials ... [at most] 14 questions were copied from the overall work,\u201d which \u201ccannot be deemed anything more than <em>de minimus.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">ACES then moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The court granted the motion. The court offered four reasons for granting the fees: (1) LCLS did not present an actionable claim; (2) the case was objectively unreasonable; (3) \u201cthere is at least some evidence that the suit may have been filed in an attempt to drive [ACES] out of the Louisiana market\u201d; and (4) the fees advanced \u201cthe considerations of compensation and deterrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">A district court\u2019s grant of attorney\u2019s fees in a copyright infringement case is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Creations Unlimited, Inc. v. McCain, </em>112 F.3d 814, 817 (5th Cir.1997). An abuse of discretion exists where the district court bases its ruling on \u201can erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Bocanegra v. Vicmar Servs., </em>320 F.3d 581, 584 (5th Cir.2003). When a district court properly applies the factors set forth in <em>Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 517, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994), there is generally not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Creations Unlimited, </em>112 F.3d at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to ACES. First, as the district court explained, in copyright cases the award of attorney\u2019s fees is \u201cthe rule rather than the exception and should be awarded routinely.\u201d <em>Micromanipulator Co. v. Bough, </em>779 F.2d 255, 259 (5th Cir.1985) (citing <em>Engel v. Teleprompter Corp., </em>732 F.2d 1238, 1241 (5th Cir.1984))., The district court followed the Supreme Court\u2019s requirement that the decision to award attorney\u2019s fees be based on certain equitable considerations. . <em>See Fogerty, </em>510 U.S. at 534 &amp; n. 19, 114 S.Ct. 1023 (citing <em>Lieb v. Topstone Indus., Inc., </em>788 F.2d 151, 156 (3d Cir.1986), which held that courts should consider \u201cfrivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness ... and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.\u201d) Indeed, examining the district court\u2019s grant of attorney\u2019s fees, it considered exactly the factors set forth in <em>Lieb. </em>Moreover, having reviewed the record, there is nothing unreasonable in how the district court applied the factors to these facts. Thus, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>awarding attorney\u2019s fees to ACES. We AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
