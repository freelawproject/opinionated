Nelson appeals the above-guidelines sentence imposed. He also contends that the district court committed reversible plain error when it reimposed the same condition that warranted revocation, Special Condition No. 5, which requires that he \u201cneither possess nor have under his control any pornographic, sexually oriented, or sexually stimulating materials, including visual, auditory, telephonic, or electronic media, computer programs, or services,\u201d that he \u201cnot patronize any place where such material or entertainment is available,\u201d and that he \u201cnot use any sex-related telephone numbers.\u201d Nelson argues that the district court failed to set forth factual findings to justify the imposition of Special Condition No. 5, that Special Condition No'. 5 is not reasonably related to the statutory supervised release factors, that Special Condition No. 5 restricts his liberty interests more than is reasonably necessary to achieve the statutory goals, and that Special Condition No. 5 is impermissibly vague. Because Nelson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>did not object to the reimposition of Special Condition No. 5 at the revocation hearing, his arguments are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Weatherton, </em>567 F.3d 149, 152 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The district court\u2019s reasons for reimposing Special Condition No. 5 can be inferred from the record. <em>Cf. United States v. Salazar, </em>743 F.3d 445, 451-53 (5th Cir.2014). Moreover, even if we were to conclude that the district court\u2019s explanation was inadequate and that the district court\u2019s error was clear or obvious, Nelson cannot show that the error affected his substantial rights because nothing in the record suggests that the outcome would have been different if the court had provided more extensive reasons. <em>See United States v. Tang, </em>718 F.3d 476, 483 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Nelson\u2019s contention that Special Condition No. 5 is not reasonably related to the statutory factors and that it restricts his liberty interests more than is reasonably necessary to achieve the statutory goals is also belied by the record. Nelson\u2019s 2004 presentence report .detailed his history of sexually deviant and disturbing behavior. At the revocation hearing, Nelson admitted that he had a sexual addiction which required \u201cconstant accountability.\u201d He acknowledged that he struggled with this addiction and that it was \u201ca life-long circumstance.\u201d Notably, Nelson admitted that since his release from custody he had visited adult pornographic websites 15 to 20 times and, in doing so, he stumbled onto a website that showed nude children. We have upheld special conditions prohibiting the possession of sexually oriented or sexually stimulating materials under similar circumstances. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>720 F.3d 220, 227 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 681, 187 L.Ed.2d 555 (2013); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>665 F.3d 114, 135-36 (5th Cir.2011). Moreover, we have repeatedly rejected vagueness challenges to similar supervised release conditions concluding that they provide adequate notice of the prohibited behavior because they are to \u201cbe read in a commonsense way.\u201d <em>United States v. Phipps, </em>319 F.3d 177, 193 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see Ellis, </em>720 F.3d at 226-27; <em>Miller, </em>665 F.3d at 137. Therefore, Nelson has failed to show that the district court committed reversible plain error when it re-imposed Special Condition No. 5 following the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Nelson also contends that the above-guidelines revocation sentence is unreasonable. He argues that the district court failed to adequately explain the sentence and that the court either completely disregarded his extensive mitigation evidence or was mistaken regarding the facts of his case. Because Nelson did not object to the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation for the chosen sentence or to the reasonableness of the sentence, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The record reflects that the district court sufficiently articulated its reasons for imposing the above-guidelines revocation sentence. <em>See United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 498-99 (5th Cir.2012). The district court considered the recommended imprisonment range of three to nine months, the two-year statutory maximum term of imprisonment, the nature and circumstances of Nelson\u2019s supervised release violation, Nelson\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to deter Nelson\u2019s criminal conduct, the need to protect the public from any further crimes by Nelson, and Nelson\u2019s mitigation arguments. The district court ultimately concluded that an 18-month term of imprisonment followed by an additional 18 months of supervised release was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case and the permissible 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We have routinely upheld revocation sentences exceeding the recommended range, even where the sentence is the statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 332 (5th Cir.2013). The fact that we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Nelson has failed to show that his revocation sentence is plainly unreasonable or plainly erroneous, <em>see id. </em>at 326, 332-33, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
