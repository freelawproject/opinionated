She appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for modification or reduction of her sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-17\">Although this court liberally construes pro se briefs, \u201ceven pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them.\u201d <em>Mapes v. Bishop, </em>541 F.3d 582, 584 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993)); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(8). Moss has failed to make any argument challenging the district court\u2019s ruling denying her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. When an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). Moss has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See' id. </em>Because Moss\u2019s appeal presents no legal points arguable on their merits, the appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-22\">Moss has unsuccessfully sought relief in three 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions and now in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. She is WARNED that future frivolous filings will invite the imposition of sanctions, which may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on her ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-23\">DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS, SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
