Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>768 F.3d 437, 437-38 (5th Cir.2014). In Rodriguez-Salazar, we rejected the argument that the Texas offense of theft is broader than the generic, contemporary definition of theft for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) because the Texas offense, which includes theft by deception, can be committed by taking property with the owner\u2019s consent. Id. Accordingly, the unopposed motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
