On appeal, Hankerson argues that the district court, erred in dismissing his mandamus petition because the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522a(g)(l), provides him with a civil remedy against the Probation Office. He also argues that the sentencing court used allegedly inaccurate information in the PSI to impose an unwarranted career offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">We review a district court\u2019s refusal to issue a writ of mandamus for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Stewart, </em>641 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir.2011). In the case of a <em>pro se </em>action, we will construe the petition more liberally than we would formal pleadings drafted by attorneys. <em>Powell v. Lennon, </em>914 F.2d 1459, 1463 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, federal courts have jurisdiction over mandamus actions seeking \u201cto compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. However, mandamus relief is \u201can extraordinary remedy which should be utilized only in the clearest and most compelling of cases.\u201d <em>Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1257 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, a writ of mandamus is only appropriate if the petitioner demonstrates that: (1) he has a clear right to the relief requested; (2) the respondent has a clear duty to act; and (3) no other adequate remedy is available. <em>Cash, </em>327 F.3d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">In certain circumstances, the Privacy Act allows an individual to bring a civil action against a government agency if that agency refuses to correct inaccurate information in its records. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(l). However, this private right of action only applies to federal agencies. <em>Schwier v. Cox, </em>340 F.3d 1284, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). The definition of \u201cagency\u201d does not include \u201cthe courts of the United States.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1)(B). Because the Probation Office acts as a liaison between the sentencing court and the defendant, it serves as \u201can arm of the court.\u201d <em>United States v. Bernardine, </em>237 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Although we have not squarely addressed whether the Probation Office is exempt from the Privacy Act, it is clear that \u00a7 551(1)(B) exempts court documents and reports from disclosure under the Privacy Act and FOIA. <em>See Lovell v. Alderete, </em>630 F.2d 428, 434 (5th Cir.1980) (holding that a parole recommendation report was exempt from FOIA due to the exception for federal courts in \u00a7 551(1)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Hanker-son\u2019s mandamus petition. Hankerson has not demonstrated a clear right to relief against the Probation Office because, by definition, the Privacy Act only applies to federal agencies, not to federal courts. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551(1)(B), 552a(g)(l). Furthermore, Hankerson could have asserted his Privacy Act claim in a civil action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(l), and his arguments related to his sentence could have been brought on direct appeal or in an earlier 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. As such, Hankerson has not demonstrated a clear right to relief, and, even if he has, there were adequate remedies other than mandamus available. Accordingly, mandamus relief was not appropriate, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>district court did not err in dismissing his mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
