Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 368 (5th Cir.2009). Because Jonguitud-Ovie-do\u2019s offense was a \u00a7 1326(b)(1) violation rather than a \u00a7 1326(b)(2) violation, we REMAND for the limited purpose of reforming the judgment to reflect the proper statute of conviction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. In all other respects, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
