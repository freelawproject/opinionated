Heslop also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">On November 2, 2005, Heslop was admitted to the United States as a conditional permanent resident. He obtained that status after USCIS approved his petition for classification as an \u201calien entrepreneur\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(5). As the name suggests, an alien entrepreneur \u201center[s] the United States for the purpose of engaging in a new commercial enterprise ... [that] will benefit the United States economy.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(5)(A)(ii). The alien must create full-time jobs for at least ten workers in the United States before the condition on his residence can be removed. <em>See id.; id. </em>\u00a7 1186b(e)(l), (d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In October 2007, Heslop petitioned for removal of the condition on his residence. USCIS denied his petition, finding that he had failed to demonstrate that he created or would soon create the requisite number of full-time jobs. Heslop appealed and submitted additional evidence for USCIS\u2019s consideration. On December 15, 2010, USCIS vacated its prior decision but denied Heslop\u2019s petition once more. Specifically, it found that Heslop had \u201csubmitted evidence of only 2 full-time employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">In March 2010, Heslop married a United States citizen. He later filed an application to adjust his status to permanent resident on the basis of that marriage, and USCIS approved that application on May 18, 2011. Like the grant of permanent resident status to an alien entrepreneur, the grant of permanent resident status to an alien spouse is also on a conditional basis. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(a)(l). In order for the condition to be removed, the alien and spouse generally must timely file a joint petition requesting removal of the condition and submit to an interview by immigration authorities. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1186a(c)(l), (d)(2)(A). Heslop does not allege that he petitioned for removal of the alien spouse condition on his residence or that the condition has been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">On November 11, 2011, Heslop applied for naturalization. On the application, he stated that he was eligible for naturalization because he had resided continuously in the United States for at least five years \u201cafter being lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a)(1); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.2(a)(2). Heslop calculated that five-year period beginning on November 2, 2005, when he was granted conditional permanent resident status as an alien entrepreneur. USCIS denied his application, explaining that, because Hes-lop did not create the requisite number of full-time jobs as an alien entrepreneur, he had not been \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d on November 2, 2005. As a result, the relevant start date for naturalization purposes was May 18, 2011, when he was granted conditional permanent resident status based on his marriage. Counting from that date, Heslop was ineligible for naturalization. Heslop requested a hearing before an immigration officer, who affirmed the denial of his application in January 2013. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Having exhausted his administrative remedies, Heslop filed suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in April 2013. He sought review of USCIS\u2019s denial of his application for naturalization under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421, and under the Administrative Pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>eedures Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Specifically, Heslop alleged that USCIS had improperly denied his application because it considered him admitted to the United States as of May 18, 2011, instead of November 2, 2005. He also alleged that USCIS\u2019s denial of his application was \u201carbitrary, capricious, [an] abuse of discretion, [or otherwise] not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). In response, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss Heslop\u2019s complaint, arguing that Heslop had failed to state a claim under the INA and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his APA claim. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In February 2014, the district court granted that motion to dismiss. Concerning Heslop\u2019s INA claim, the court observed that Heslop had obtained conditional permanent resident status based on his marriage but had failed to allege that the condition had been removed. The court determined that Heslop\u2019s failure was fatal to his claim because conditional permanent residents were ineligible for naturalization. Alternatively, the court noted that, even if the condition on Heslop\u2019s permanent resident status based on his marriage had been removed, \u201cthere would still be an issue regarding whether he [had] resided in the United States for at least five years after being lawfully admitted\u201d for permanent residence. Essentially, the court reasoned that, if Heslop could not show that he satisfied the \u201ccondition\u201d for alien-entrepreneur status \u2014 that he created full-time jobs for at least ten workers in the United States \u2014 then he also could not show that he had been \u201clawfully admitted\u201d for permanent residence on November 2, 2005. And, by extension, he could not establish that his time in the United States from that date through May 18, 2011 counted towards the INA\u2019s five-year residency requirement. As for Heslop\u2019s APA claim, the court determined that he could not seek review under the APA because the INA provided an adequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Heslop timely filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied in April 2014. This is Heslop\u2019s appeal of both of the district court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting the well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Adinolfe v. United Techs. Corp., </em>768 F.3d 1161, 1169 (11th Cir.2014); <em>see Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Likewise, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Maradiaga v. United States, </em>679 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.2012). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration. <em>Equity Inv. Partners, LP v. Lenz, </em>594 F.3d 1338, 1342 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Generally, in order to become a naturalized United States citizen, an applicant must show (among many other things) that he resided continuously in the United States for at least five years \u201cafter being lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a)(1); <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 316.2(a)(2); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429. Heslop contends that the district court erred in dismissing his INA claim for failure to state a claim because he met that statutory requirement. Specifically, Hes-lop argues that he \u201chas been a Lawful Permanent Resident since he was admitted as an alien entrepreneur on November 2, 2005.\u201d Although his argument is unclear, Heslop seems to assert that USCIS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\u201creinstated\u201d his status as a lawful permanent resident on December 15, 2010, when it vacated its prior decision denying his petition for removal of the condition on his residence. Heslop does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he failed to allege that the condition on his permanent resident status based on his marriage had been removed, or its conclusion that conditional permanent residents are ineligible for naturalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">\u201cWhen an appellant fails to challenge properly on appeal one of the grounds on which the district court based its judgment, he is deemed to have abandoned any challenge of that ground, and it follows that the judgment is due to be affirmed.\u201d <em>Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680 (11th Cir.2014). Here, the district court relied on two alternative grounds to conclude that Heslop had failed to state a claim under the INA: first, that conditional permanent residents are ineligible for naturalization; and second, that Heslop had not plausibly alleged that he had resided in the United States for at least five years \u201cafter being lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d Heslop challenges only the second ground. As a result, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his INA claim for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Heslop also contends that the district court erred in dismissing his APA claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. He argues that the APA entitles him to judicial review of USCIS\u2019s denial of his application for naturalization, and he asks us to set aside that decision because it was \u201carbitrary, capricious, [an] abuse of discretion, [or otherwise] not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The APA provides for judicial review of \u201cfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. Here, the INA gives Hes-lop an adequate remedy: the ability to seek in federal district court <em>de novo </em>review of USCIS\u2019s denial of his application for naturalization after he exhausts his administrative remedies. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421(c). Indeed, Heslop brought his INA claim under that very provision. The APA does not authorize judicial review \u201cthat adds to the sweeping <em>de novo </em>review\u201d that the INA provides. <em>Escaler v. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs., </em>582 F.3d 288, 291 n. 1 (2d Cir.2009). We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hes-lop\u2019s APA claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Heslop\u2019s notice of appeal designates the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration. In his brief to this Court, however, Heslop did not argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying that motion. Indeed, he failed to list any issue at all related to the denial of his motion for reconsideration. Thus, Hes-lop has abandoned any challenge to that order. <em>See Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., </em>680 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
