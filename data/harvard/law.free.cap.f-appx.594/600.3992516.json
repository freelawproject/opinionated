At his plea hearing, he made a factual proffer admitting the crimes. Although the Government presented evidence that Robinson\u2019s acts were in, or affected, interstate commerce, neither the court nor the parties referenced Robinson\u2019s knowledge of this jurisdictional hook. Robinson argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court erred by accepting his guilty plea because there was no evidence that he knew that his actions affected interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">When appropriate, we review issues that are raised for the first time on appeal for plain error only. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1287 (11th Cir.2006). Under plain error review, the defendant must show: \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). We may then exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if the error seriously \u201caffects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Error is not plain unless it is clear or obvious under current law. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591(a),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">Whoever knowingly\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-12\">(1) <em>in or affecting interstate </em>... <em>commerce, </em>entices ... a person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-13\">(2) benefits ... from participation in a venture which has engaged in an act described in violation of paragraph (1), knowing, or in reckless disregard of the fact, that ... the person has not attained the age of 18 years, and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591(a) (emphasis added). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1594(c), \u201c[whoever conspires with another to violate section 1591 shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">\u201cBefore entering judgment on a guilty plea, the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3). A defendant who seeks reversal of a conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, however, must show that the error affected substantial rights. <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 81-82, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2339-40, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). Namely, a defendant must \u201cshow a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83, 124 S.Ct at 2340.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-18\">In <em>United States v. Evans, </em>476 F.3d 1176 (11th Cir.2007), we held that the term \u201cknowingly\u201d in \u00a7 1591(a) did not apply to the interstate commerce element, because \u201cthe existence of the fact that confers federal jurisdiction need not be one in the mind of the actor at the time he perpetrates the act made criminal by the federal statute.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>476 F.3d at 1180 n. 2 (quotation omitted). This case forecloses the issue. The Government did not need to present any evidence of Robinson\u2019s knowledge of the interstate commerce element at the time he committed his crimes. The district court made no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Robinson tries to explain away <em>Evans </em>by contending that the Supreme Court overruled the case in <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). The Supreme Court addressed the interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A, which punishes anyone who \u201cknowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). The Supreme Court, noting that an adverb that modifies a transitive verb generally describes \u201chow the subject performed the entire action, including the object as set forth in the sentence,\u201d held that the word \u201cknowingly\u201d in that statute applied to the phrase \u201cof another person.\u201d <em>Flores-Figueroa, </em>556 U.S. at 650, 129 S.Ct. at 1890.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><em>Flores-Figueroa </em>does not overrule <em>Evans. Flores-Figueroa </em>applies only to an adverb modifying a substantive element of an offense, not a jurisdictional element. Furthermore, <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>mentions neither <em>Evans </em>nor 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
