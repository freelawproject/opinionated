Ramirez raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because it exceeded the statutory maximum sentence available upon revocation of a class E felony, and his original indictment failed to allege the facts necessary to support a conviction for a class C felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Second, he contends his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was excessive in light of the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Upon review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">We conclude Ramirez\u2019s claim for procedural unreasonableness fails because a defendant facing incarceration upon the revocation of supervised release may not challenge the validity of his original sentence during the revocation proceedings. <em>See United States v. White, </em>416 F.3d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[A] defendant may not challenge, for the first time on appeal from the revocation of supervised release, his sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d); <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 317 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201cA sentence is presumed valid until vacated under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">We also hold Ramirez\u2019s sentence was not substantively unreasonable because the district court imposed it after properly considering the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the need for deterrence. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court____\u201d (quotation omitted)). The district court acted well within its discretion in fashioning the 24-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Ramirez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-9\">. We review Ramirez's procedural unreasonableness claim for plain error because he did not raise it in district court. <em>United States v. Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir.2014). We review the sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release for reasonableness, <em>id., </em>applying a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
