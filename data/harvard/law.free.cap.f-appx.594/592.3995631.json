That new evidence included a psychological evaluation by Dr. David Wilson, made three months after the ALJ\u2019s decision, diagnosing Recia with major depression. The Council determined that Dr. Wilson\u2019s evaluation was not chronologically relevant to the ALJ\u2019s decision. It then considered the additional evidence that was chronologically relevant and found that it did not provide a basis for changing the ALJ\u2019s decision. The Council thus denied review. Recia now contends that (1) the Council did not adequately articulate its rationale for denying review and (2) a remand is necessary so that the ALJ can consider Dr. Wilson\u2019s evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Lewis v. Barnhart, </em>285 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir.2002). We also review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination of whether a remand is necessary based on new evidence. <em>Vega v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>265 F.3d 1214, 1218 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">First, Recia contends that the Council did not provide a sufficiently detailed basis for denying review. When a claimant properly presents new evidence to the Council, the Council must adequately evaluate the evidence rather than \u201cperfunctorily adher[ing]\u201d to the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Epps v. Harris, </em>624 F.2d 1267, 1273 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even so, the Council is \u201cnot required to provide a detailed, rationale for denying review.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>771 F.3d 780, 784 (11th Cir.2014). Here, the Council considered Recla\u2019s arguments and new evidence. It then (1) stated that it had considered the additional evidence, (2) made the evidence predating the ALJ\u2019s decision part of the administrative record, and (3) stated that it had determined that the new information did not provide a basis for changing the ALJ\u2019s decision. That was as much detail as it was required to provide. <em>See Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1259, 1262 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">Second, Recia argues that the district court should have remanded the case for consideration of Dr. Wilson\u2019s evaluation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>But Recia fails to show that the evaluation was chronologically relevant to the ALJ\u2019s decision of January 11, 2011. Generally, a claimant is allowed to present new evidence at each stage of the administrative review process \u201c[s]ubject to the limitations in [20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 ] 404.970(b) and 404.976(b).\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.900(b), 416.1470(b); <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1261. The Council must consider \u201cnew and material evidence\u201d that \u201crelates to the period on or before the date of the [ALJ\u2019s] hearing decision.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(b); <em>see Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1261 (noting that evidence must be \u201cchronologically relevant\u201d to the time period considered by the ALJ to be considered by the Council). The Council was thus required to consider only new evidence that \u201crelate[d] to the period on or before\u201d January 11, 2011, the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.970(b), 416.1470(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Dr. Wilson evaluated Recia on April 6, 2011 \u2014 nearly three months after the ALJ\u2019s decision. According to Dr. Wilson\u2019s report Recia said he suffered from depression as early as 1997, but Recia conceded the depression was being treated effectively. Even assuming that the ALJ determined Dr. Wilson\u2019s report showed disabling depression in April 2011, the report would provide the ALJ with no evidence of when Recla\u2019s depression worsened from the admittedly non-disabling depression he suffered earlier. Nor is the report\u2019s classification of the depression as \u201c[r]ecurrent\u201d enough, without more, to show the evaluation\u2019s chronological relevance to the time period before January 11, 2011. <em>See Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1261. The district court correctly determined that no remand was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-16\">. Recia mentions only Dr. Wilson\u2019s evaluation. He has thus abandoned any remand argument with respect to any other evidence. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
