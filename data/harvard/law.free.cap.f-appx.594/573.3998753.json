On appeal, Duhaney argues that the district court erred in applying a 12-level increase to his base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), based on his prior California drug conviction. After review, we affirm.-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">I. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">A citizen of Belize, Duhaney has been removed from the United States four times, in 1984, 1998, 1999, and 2004. Du-haney illegally reentered for a fifth time and was arrested on new drug charges in July 2013. Subsequently, Duhaney was charged with, and pled guilty to, the \u00a7 1326(a) illegal reentry offense that resulted in the 30-month sentence now on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), a defendant\u2019s base offense level for a \u00a7 1326(a) offense is increased by 12 levels if he was previously deported after being convicted of a felony \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). For purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, the commentary to that guideline defines a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d as \u201can offense <em>under </em>federal, <em>state, </em>or local <em>law </em>that prohibits the manufacture, <em>import, </em>export, <em>distribution, </em>or dispensing of, or <em>offer to sell </em>a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iv) (emphasis added). The sole question on appeal is whether Duhaney was convicted under California law of a drug offense for importing, selling or offering to sell a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-17\">II. DUHANEY\u2019S CALIFORNIA CONVICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b602-18\">Duhaney does not dispute that he has a 2001 drug conviction under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a) (\u201c\u00a7 11352(a)\u201d). Section 11352(a) covers a wide range of drug-offense conduct, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-19\">[E]very person who transports, <em>imports into this state, sells, </em>furnishes, adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>ters, or gives away, or <em>offers to </em>transport, import into this state, <em>sell, </em>furnish, administer, or give away, or attempts to import into this state or transport ... any controlled substance ... shall be punished by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code for three, four, or five years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a) (emphasis added). This is a divisible statute in that any one of the acts listed \u2014 such as importing, selling, or offering to sell \u2014 constitutes a drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The record here contains a certified copy of the charging document against Du-haney. Count 1 of the information charged Duhaney in the conjunctive, that is, with having committed all the conduct that violates \u00a7 11352(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">On or about March 13, 2001, in the County of Los Angeles, the crime of SALE/TRANSPORTATION/OFFER TO SELL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE, in violation of HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE SECTION 11352(a), a Felony, was committed by ELPHIN-STON DUHANEY, who did unlawfully transport, import into the State of California, sell, furnish, administer, <em>and </em>give away, <em>and </em>offer to transport, import into the State of California, sell, furnish, administer, <em>and </em>give away, <em>and </em>attempt to import into the State' of California <em>and </em>transport a controlled substance, to wit, COCAINE BASE....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">(Emphasis added). By using the conjunctive \u201cand,\u201d Count 1 alleged Duhaney did all of the drug conduct charged in that Count 1, which included importing, selling, and offering to sell cocaine base. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Count 2 of the information charged Du-haney with, on the same date, \u201cunlawfully possessing] for sale and purchasing] for purposes of sale cocaine base,\u201d in violation of California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11351.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">The record also contains a certified copy of the Los Angeles County Superior Court\u2019s eight-page docket for Duhaney\u2019s criminal case. That eight-page docket contains the court minutes, dated June 22, 2001, which state that Duhaney \u201cPLEADS NOLO CONTENDERE WITH APPROVAL OF THE COURT TO A VIOLATION OF SECTION 11352(A) H &amp; S IN COUNT 01.\u201d The court minutes then reflect that the California court: (1) found \u201cthat there is a factual basis for\u201d Duha-ney\u2019s plea and accepted Duhaney\u2019s plea; (2) found Duhaney guilty of Count 1; (3) dismissed Count 2; and (4) imposed a prison sentence of nine days, reduced to time served, and placed Duhaney on three years\u2019 formal probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">Under California law, when the charging document alleges the offense was committed in the conjunctive and a defendant pleads to the offense as charged, the defendant admits committing the offense in all the ways alleged. <em>See, e.g., People v. Mendias, </em>17 Cal.App.4th 195, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d 159, 164 (1993); <em>People v. Tuggle, </em>232 Cal.App.3d 147, 283 Cal.Rptr. 422, 425-27 (1991), <em>overruled on other grounds, People v. Jenkins, </em>10 Cal.4th 234, 40 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 893 P.2d 1224, 1233 (1995); <em>see also People v. Chadd, </em>28 Cal.3d 739, 170 Cal.Rptr. 798, 621 P.2d 837, 842 (1981) (\u201cAs to the merits, the plea is deemed to constitute a judicial admission of every element of the offense charged.\u201d); <em>People v. Palacios, </em>56 Cal.App.4th 252, 65 Cal.Rptr.2d 318, 321 (1997) (\u201cA plea of guilty admits every element of the offense charged, all allegations and factors comprising the charge contained in the pleading.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">Further, under California law, a plea of nolo contendere to a felony offense has the same legal effect as a guilty plea \u201cfor all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>purposes.\u201d Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 1016(3); <em>People v. Wallace, </em>33 Cal.4th 738, 16 Cal.Rptr.3d 96, 93 P.3d 1037, 1043 (2004); <em>People v. Bradford, </em>15 Cal.4th 1229, 65 Cal.Rptr.2d 145, 939 P.2d 259, 346 (1997). Thus, like a guilty plea, a defendant\u2019s no contest plea admits all the elements of the offense as charged. <em>See People v. French, </em>43 Cal.4th 36, 73 Cal.Rptr.3d 605, 178 P.3d 1100, 1108-09 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">After examining certified copies of the information and the court minutes, the district court concluded that Duhaney\u2019s California conviction was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) and overruled Duhaney\u2019s objection to that 12-level increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">A. Modified Categorical Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">To determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l), we generally apply the categorical approach, looking to the statute and the judgment of conviction to assess whether the elements of the crime of conviction are consistent with any of the offenses listed in \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a drug trafficking offense. <em>See United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1273 (11th Cir.2006). However, where the statute of conviction is \u201cdivisible,\u201d meaning that it sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative, and some alternative elements would not qualify as drug trafficking, we apply the modified categorical approach. <em>See United States v. Estrella, </em>758 F.3d 1239, 1243, 1245 (11th Cir.2014) (involving a 16-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d increase under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(a)(A)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">Under the modified categorical approach for \u201cdivisible\u201d statutes, the sentencing court may consider a limited set of documents, referred to as the Shepard documents. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334, 1342-43 (11th Cir.2014) (citing <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1263, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)). The <em>Shepard </em>documents include the charging document, a written plea agreement, the transcript of the plea colloquy, any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant consented, or \u201csome comparable judicial record\u201d of this information. <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 16, 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1257, 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">B. Court Minutes as <em>Shepard </em>Documents</p>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">Duhaney first argues that the district court improperly relied upon the certified state court minutes because they are not a Shepard-approved document. We disagree. The court minutes are a judicial record entered on the state court\u2019s docket that summarizes the criminal proceedings conducted by the state court. A certified copy of the court minutes from the court of conviction reflecting that court\u2019s acceptance of Duhaney\u2019s nolo plea and finding of guilt as to Count 1 of the information is a \u201ccomparable judicial record\u201d of Duhaney\u2019s plea and conviction on Count 1. <em>See Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1263; <em>see also Coronado v. Holder, </em>759 F.3d 977, 985-86 (9th Cir.2014) (concluding that a California court\u2019s certified electronic dock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>et and the court minutes are \u201cequally reliable to the documents approved in <em>Shepard\u201d); Kwong v. Holder, </em>671 F.3d 872, 879-80 (9th Cir.2011) (explaining that California state court documents such as abstracts of judgment and minute orders, which are statutorily authorized and contemporaneously prepared by a neutral officer of the court, are of \u201cequal reliability\u201d to the illustrative list of documents in <em>Shepard).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">C. Government\u2019s Burden Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Duhaney next contends that even if the district court properly considered the court minutes, the government still failed to carry its burden of proof as to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The court minutes establish that Duha-ney pled no contest to the \u00a7 11352(a) violation alleged in Count 1. That means, under California law, Duhaney admitted all the elements alleged conjunctively in Count 1. Thus, when Duhaney pled no contest, he admitted to, among other things, importing, selling, and offering to sell cocaine base, acts he does not dispute are drug trafficking offenses under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iv) (listing importation, distribution, and offering to sell a controlled substance among the offenses that constitute a drug trafficking offense). In short, Duhaney \u201cnecessarily admitted\u201d committing statutory elements of a \u00a7' 11352(a) offense that also constitute a drug trafficking offense. <em>See Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 16, 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1257, 1263 (explaining that the sentencing court may look to the approved judicial documents to determine what the defendant\u2019s earlier guilty plea \u201cnecessarily admitted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Duhaney argues the fact that Count 1 charged multiple elements conjunctively is insufficient to carry the government\u2019s burden because prosecutors routinely charge offenses in the conjunctive, but are required to prove only one of the alleged statutory bases to obtain a conviction at trial. We reject this argument because, under California law, a defendant, by pleading guilty to a \u00a7 11352(a) charge pled in the conjunctive, admitted guilt as to each of the listed offenses. <em>See United States v. Ojeda-Estrada, </em>577 F.3d 871, 877 (8th Cir.2009) (concluding that a prior conviction under \u00a7 11352(a) constituted a controlled substance offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, the career offender provision); <em>United States v. Garcia-Medina, </em>497 F.3d 875, 878 (8th Cir.2007) (concluding that a prior conviction under \u00a7 11352(a) constituted a drug trafficking offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Similarly, under our Circuit\u2019s precedent, a defendant is bound at sentencing by the factual allegations establishing the elements of a crime and the elements of the crime which he admitted by pleading guilty to those elements. <em>See United States v. Fairchild, </em>803 F.2d 1121, 1124 (11th Cir.1986) (stating that a guilty plea \u201cadmits all the elements of a formal criminal charge\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Taffe, </em>36 F.3d 1047, 1049 (11th Cir.1994) (concluding that defendant who pled guilty to a charge, listed in the conjunctive, that he used and carried four firearms, one of which was equipped with a silencer, made a legally binding admission that he used and carried a firearm equipped with a silencer even though an accomplice actually carried the firearm with the silencer); <em>see also United States v. Drayton, </em>113 F.3d 1191, 1193 (11th Cir.1997) (concluding that a nolo contendere plea, followed by an adjudication of guilt, is a conviction under Florida law for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Further, the government need not affirmatively disprove a defendant\u2019s speculation, unsupported by any evidence, that he may have pled to something less than what was alleged in Count 1, where the <em>Shepard </em>documents the government submitted show that the defendant pled to Count 1. <em>See Ojeda-Estrada, </em>577 F.3d at 877 (stating that to require the government to disprove the defendant\u2019s theory that he may have pled guilty to something narrower than the charged offense \u201coverstates the government\u2019s burden\u201d to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was convicted of a qualifying offense). The court minutes showing Duhaney entered a no contest plea to Count 1, which alleged the offense in the conjunctive, carries the government\u2019s burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Du-haney had a prior conviction for a drug trafficking offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B)\u2019s 12-level increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-13\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a prior conviction constitutes a drug trafficking offense for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B). <em>See United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\">. Contrary to Duhaney\u2019s contention, the Supreme Court's recent-opinion in <em>Descamps </em>v. <em>United States, </em>570 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), and this Court's subsequent opinion in <em>United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334 (11th Cir.2014), applying <em>Des-camps, </em>do not control this case. <em>Descamps </em>and <em>Howard </em>addressed indivisible statutes, to which the modified categorical approach does not apply. Here, as Duhaney concedes, \u00a7 11352(a) is a divisible statute to which the modified categorical approach properly applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-9\">. We recognize that Duhaney cites <em>Young v. Holder, </em>wherein the Ninth Circuit applied its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>own circuit precedent, not California law, to conclude, in the immigration context, that a guilty plea to a conjunctively charged \u00a7 11352(a) violation established at least one of the charged offenses, but not necessarily all of them. <em>Young, </em>697 F.3d 976, 986 (9th Cir.2012) (en banc). We need not address whether state or federal law controls because the result is the same under either California law or our circuit precedent given the particular record in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">. Because we conclude that Duhaney\u2019s plea to the conjunctively charged \u00a7 11352(a) offense in Count 1, as shown by the information and the court minutes, is sufficient to establish that Duhaney\u2019s conviction was for a drug trafficking offense, we need not address: (1) the government\u2019s alternative argument that the probation-ineligibility allegation in Count 1 narrowed Duhaney\u2019s \u00a7 11352(a) charge to only selling or offering to sell cocaine base; or (2) Duhaney\u2019s argument that a police report and disposition of arrest also submitted to the district court at sentencing were not Shepard-approved documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
