Williams asserts that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied in his case; however, he acknowledges that his arguments have been rejected by this court in <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001). Williams raises his arguments solely in order to preserve them for possible further review. Given the foregoing, Williams\u2019s motion for summary disposition is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
