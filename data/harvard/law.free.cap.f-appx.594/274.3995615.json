He contends that his prior conviction does not bar his eligibility for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C), which provides that a nonpermanent resident may be eligible for cancellation of removal if he has not been convicted of an offense under three statutes, including 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2). He argues that \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) should be interpreted to include all of the immigration-related elements in the three statutes and that the BIA improperly concluded that only language regarding the criminal offense determines whether an offense is \u201cunder\u201d one of the three statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">We previously have rejected arguments virtually identical to those made by Arreo-la-Villa. In <em>Nino v. Holder, </em>690 F.3d 691, 697-98 (5th Cir.2012), we held that the plain language of \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) unambiguously refers to the elements of the offenses set forth in the three statutes and does not refer to any aspects of immigration law. In light of our holding in <em>Nino, </em>Arreola-Villa\u2019s argument that \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) should be read to include aspects of immigration law and his contention that the BIA wrongly interpreted the statute by reaching a contrary determination are effectively foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
