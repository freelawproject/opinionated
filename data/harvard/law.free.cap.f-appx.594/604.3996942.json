Patterson, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u201cMotion to Compel for Specific Performance of Plea Agreement or Withdrawal of Guilty Plea,\u201d which he filed under the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. Patterson claimed that the government breached a plea agreement he signed in 2003. The district court denied relief, concluding that Patterson was not entitled to mandamus because he had an adequate alternative remedy to pursue his claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-22\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a writ of mandamus. <em>See In re Stewart, </em>641 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). Mandamus is appropriate only if, among other things, no other adequate remedy is available. <em>Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1258 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). Patterson had several remedies. He could have raised his breach-of-plea-agreement claim on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1104-05 (11th Cir.2004). Or he could have raised it in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). He did neither. For that reason, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-15\">. The district court alternatively construed Patterson's filing as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it as successive. Patterson has neither obtained a certificate of appeala-bility on this issue nor argued that it was error. We thus consider only the district court's dismissal under \u00a7 1361.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
