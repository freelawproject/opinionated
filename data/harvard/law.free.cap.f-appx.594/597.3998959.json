California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In response, Burton has raised several issues he contends are meritorious and moved for appointment of new counsel and an extension of time in which to file his appellate brief. Our independent review of the entire record reveals counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, Burton\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and an extension of time are DENIED, and Burton\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
