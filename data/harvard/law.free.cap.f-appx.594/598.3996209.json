The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-21\">Whether Charest\u2019s current habeas petition was a second or successive petition and subject to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, or whether his 2005 sentence modification did not constitute a new and intervening judgment which, pursuant to <em>Magwood v. Patterson, </em>561 U.S. 320, 130 S.Ct. 2788 [177 L.Ed.2d 592] (2010), would restart the one-year period for filing a habeas petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-22\">We conclude that this COA was improvidently granted because it fails to indicate that jurists of reason would find Charest\u2019s underlying jurisdictional arguments debatable, insofar as he needed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1604, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We therefore vacate the COA and remand to the district court to consider whether Charest has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>formity with <em>Slack. See Spencer v. United States, </em>773 F.3d 1132, 1138 (11th Cir.2014) (en bane) (\u201cGoing forward, a certificate of appealability, whether issued by this Court or a district court, must specify what constitutional issue jurists of reason would find debatable.... A failure to specify that issue would violate the text enacted by Congress ... and will result in the vacatur of the certificate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The certificate of appealability is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
