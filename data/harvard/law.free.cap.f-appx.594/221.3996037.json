Plaintiff-Appellant Janet Cummings Smith appeals the district court\u2019s decision dismissing her Texas state law claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) as time-barred. The parties agree that the suit was filed more than four years after the cause of action accrued and that this case is indistinguishable from our decision in <em>Priester v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>708 F.3d 667 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 196, 187 L.Ed.2d 256 (2013) in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>we affirmed a district court\u2019s dismissal of a similar claim as time-barred after four years. Smith argues that this Court in <em>Priester </em>made an <em>Erie </em>guess that has not been ratified by the Texas Supreme Court, and, therefore, <em>Priester, </em>and the Texas case it relies on, \u201cis not controlling.\u201d Constrained by our prior precedent under our rule of orderliness, we disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">I. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">This Court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final judgment. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The district court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We apply Texas substantive law and federal procedural law to the state law claims. <em>See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, \u2018accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe ex rel. Magee v. Cov-ington Cnty. Sch. Dist. ex rel. Keys, </em>675 F.3d 849, 854 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc) (citation omitted). \u201cTo survive dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), plaintiffs must plead \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The dispute in this case is over a home equity line of credit that Defendants Appellee JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JP Morgan) extended to Smith in exchange for a lien on her home. Smith asserts JP Morgan\u2019s lien is invalid under article XVI, \u00a7 50(t) of the Texas Constitution because the principal on the loan exceeds fifty percent of the fair market value of her home. Smith argues the district court erred in dismissing this claim as time-barred. JP Morgan counters that the Texas \u201cresidual four year statute of limitations applies to claims a home equity loan violates the Texas constitutional requirements regarding home equity loans.\u201d JP Morgan cites our decision in <em>Priester, </em>708 F.3d at 674. We agree with JP Morgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">Article XVI, \u00a7 50 of the Texas Constitution provides that a second lien on a home is invalid \u201cif the total principal amount outstanding exceeds ... 50 percent of the fair market value of the homestead.\u201d Section 16.051 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides that \u201c[ejvery action for which there is no express limitations period ... must be brought not later than four years after the day the cause of action accrues.\u201d In <em>Priester, </em>we concluded this section of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code and its four-year \u201climitations period applies to constitutional infirmities.\u201d 708 F.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">As noted above, the parties agree that this suit was filed more than four years after the action accrued. But Smith contends that our decision in <em>Priester </em>was a wrongly decided <em>Erie </em>guess. Maybe so, but \u201c[i]t is a well-settled Fifth Circuit rule of orderliness that one panel of our court may not overturn another panel\u2019s decision, absent an intervening change in the law.\u201d <em>Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir.2008). As three other panels have previously noted, there has been no change in the law that would allow us to overturn the <em>Priester </em>decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>On the contrary, subsequent Texas decisions have followed <em>Priester\u2019s </em>reasoning and validated its holding. <em>Williams v. Wachovia Mortg. Corp., </em>407 S.W.Bd 391, 397 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2013, pet. denied) (\u201cWe find the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis persuasive.\u201d (citing <em>Priester, </em>708 F.3d at 674)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Therefore, the four-year residual limitations period continues to apply to claims of this nature, and Smith\u2019s claims are time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">IV. SANCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">We notice that Smith\u2019s counsel, Mark A. Swaim, of the Swaim Law Office in Irving, Texas has pressed this same argument on behalf of different clients in two other appeals before this Court, and each time this Court has swiftly rejected the argument. <em>See Bormio Invs., Inc., </em>2014 WL 4668390, at *1 (\u201cBormio does not dispute that if <em>Priester </em>applies, the statute of limitations has run. Instead it argues ... that <em>Priester </em>was wrongly decided.\u201d); <em>Bor-mio Invs., Inc., </em>2014 WL 2924915, at *2 (\u201cThe Plaintiffs contend that <em>Priester </em>was wrongly decided under an Fne-guess analysis.\u201d). One of these panels recently cautioned Mr. Swain \u201cnot to file frivolous appeals,\u201d but ultimately concluded \u201cthat sanctions [were] not warranted in [that] case.\u201d <em>Bormio Invs., Inc., </em>2014 WL 4668390, at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 authorizes the award of damages and single or double costs if an appeal is frivolous, and federal courts of appeals \u201ccan sanction an appellant for a frivolous appeal <em>sua sponte.\u201d Conner v. Travis Cnty., </em>209 F.3d 794, 801 (5th Cir.2000) (per curiam). An appeal is frivolous if it is \u201centirely devoid of colorable merit.\u201d <em>See Coghlan v. Starkey, </em>852 F.2d 806, 811-12 (5th Cir.1988) (supplemental opinion) (per curiam). We also have the authority to order counsel for the appellants to pay attorney fees and costs from his or her own resources. <em>See Atwood v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>850 F.2d 1093, 1094 (5th Cir.1988) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">The Appellant\u2019s argument borders on frivolity; however, in light of the timing of the two prior decisions of this Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we cannot say this appeal is \u201centirely de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>void of colorable merit.\u201d <em>See Coghlan, </em>852 F.2d at 812. But because the judgment of the district court is affirmed, costs are taxed against the appellant consistent with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 39(a)(2). In light of the repetitive arguments advanced by counsel for the Appellant without notice to the Court of their rejection, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(j), we HEREBY ORDER counsel for the Appellant to pay the costs taxed against the Appellant from his own resources. <em>See Atwood, </em>850 F.2d at 1094. We again caution Mr. Swaim \u201cnot to file frivolous appeals.\u201d <em>Bormio Invs., Inc., </em>2014 WL 4668390, at *1.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
