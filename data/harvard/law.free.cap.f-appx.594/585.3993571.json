We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Mr. Porter participated in an armed bank robbery of a Wachovia Bank in Anni-ston, Alabama in July of 2008. Mr. Porter did not possess a gun during the robbery, but at least one of his co-conspirators did. Consequently, Mr. Porter was charged in Count 1 with conspiracy to commit bank robbery and in Count 2 with armed bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) or, alternatively, the lesser included offense of bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">In relevant part, \u00a7 2113(a) defines bank robbery as the act of \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation ... obtaining] or attempting] to obtain ... any property or money ... belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management or possession, of any bank,\u201d and \u00a7 2113(d) defines armed bank robbery as the act of when in \u201ccommitting, or in attempting to commit, [bank robbery], assaulting] any person, or put[ting] in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device.\u201d The difference between armed bank robbery and the lesser included offense of bank robbery is \u201cthe use of a dangerous weapon or device\u201d to \u201cassault\u201d or \u201cput[ ] in jeopardy the life of any person.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2113. <em>See also United States v. DeAngelo, </em>13 F.3d 1228, 1234 (8th Cir. 1994) (\u201cthe use of a \u2018dangerous weapon\u2019 distinguishes armed bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(d) from simple bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">At trial, after the government presented evidence on Count 1 and Count 2, the government and Mr. Porter were shown the jury instructions and verdict form before they were read and provided to the jury. The verdict form asked the jury to find Mr. Porter guilty or not guilty of \u201cBank Robbery, accompanied by force, violence and intimidation\u201d or in the alternative to find him guilty \u201cof the lesser included offense of Bank Robbery.\u201d Neither the government nor Mr. Porter, however, raised any objection to the verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">The jury found Mr. Porter guilty of the conspiracy charged in Count 1 and guilty of the lesser included offense of bank robbery charged in Count 2. Mr. Porter did not challenge the verdict or the verdict form until the presentence investigation report was issued. At sentencing, Mr. Porter argued that the jury found him not guilty of bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a) and only guilty of bank larceny under \u00a7 2113(b), which involves no \u201cforce and violence, or intimidation\u201d and carries a shorter maximum sentence. The district court disagreed, noting that bank larceny was not part of the indictment and was not otherwise mentioned at trial. It, therefore, agreed with the government that the jury found Mr. Porter guilty of bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a) and conspiracy to commit bank robbery. The district court then sentenced Mr. Porter to 60 months on Count 1 and 210 months on Count 2, with the terms to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">Mr. Porter argues on appeal that his conviction for bank robbery should be vacated because the verdict form misstated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the .law and lacked an element of the offense. The verdict form, Mr. Porter explains, was flawed because it asked the jury to find him guilty or not guilty of \u201cBank Robbery, accompanied by force, violence and intimidation\u201d or in the alternative to find him guilty \u201cof the lesser included offense of Bank Robbery.\u201d Force and violence or intimidation are necessary elements of bank robbery under both \u00a7 2113(a) and \u00a7 2113(d), Mr. Porter notes, and bank robbery cannot be a lesser included offense of itself. Although we agree that the verdict form did not accurately and clearly describe the offenses, we conclude that Mr. Porter was not prejudiced by the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">As noted, Mr. Porter failed to object to the verdict form until sentencing. We, therefore, review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>146 F.3d 1338, 1342 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cBecause [the appellant] did not raise objections to the ... verdict form ... we review ... for plain error.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">\u201cThe plain error rule should be used sparingly, and a conviction should be reversed only if a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\u201d <em>United States. v. Frank, </em>599 F.3d 1221, 1238 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Elkins, </em>885 F.2d 775, 787 (11th Cir.1989) (internal quotations omitted)). For a conviction to warrant reversal under plain-error review, we must conclude that (1) there was an error; (2) the error is plain or obvious; (3) the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). <em>See also United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">The district court erred when it drafted the verdict form for Count 2 by failing to properly distinguish between armed bank robbery and the lesser included offense of bank robbery. The statute in question, \u00a7 2113, provides that both armed bank robbery and bank robbery include the use of \u201cforce and violence, or intimidation,\u201d but only armed bank robbery includes the \u201cuse of a dangerous weapon or device.\u201d We agree with Mr. Porter that bank robbery cannot be a lesser included crime of bank robbery. The verdict form as to Count 2, therefore, contained an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">The error was also plain or obvious. A plain error is one that is obvious and clear under the current law. <em>United States v. Dortch, </em>696 F.3d 1104, 1112 (11th Cir.2012). It is clear that bank robbery cannot be a lesser included offense of itself, and it is also clear that under the current law that the difference between armed bank robbery and bank robbery is the \u201cuse of a dangerous weapon or device,\u201d not violence and force or intimidation, as the verdict form might have implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">We do not believe, however, that the error on the verdict form affected Mr. Porter\u2019s substantial rights or seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. To affect a party\u2019s substantial rights, an \u201cerror must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>146 F.3d at 1343, <em>quoting Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotations omitted). In determining if the error on the verdict form affected Mr. Porter\u2019s substantial rights, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>look to \u201cwhether the jury instructions and verdict form, <em>considered as a </em>whole, were sufficient so that the jurors understood the issues and were not misled.\u201d <em>United States v. Poirier, </em>321 F.3d 1024, 1032 (11th Cir.2003) (emphasis added). In <em>Poirier, </em>we explained that we do not focus on a single sentence in the jury instructions, but rather look at the language together as a whole with the verdict form to determine whether a reversible error has occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">There was ample evidence presented at trial to support Mr. Porter\u2019s conviction for bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a). There was no confusion on the verdict form as to Count 1, which charged conspiracy to commit bank robbery, nor does Mr. Porter raise any objection as to that conviction. The verdict form, read in conjunction with the jury instructions, indicates that the difference between armed bank robbery and the lesser included offense of bank robbery was the use of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The instructions on Count 2 told the jury that, to find Mr. Porter guilty of bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a) or (d), it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">(1) the Defendant knowingly took money or property possessed by a federally insured bank from or iii the presence of the person described in the indictment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">(2) the Defendant did so by means of force and violence or by means of intimidation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">(3) the Defendant put someone\u2019s life in jeopardy by using a dangerous weapon or device while stealing the property or money, as charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The district court also instructed the jury that if it were to \u201cfind the Defendant \u2018Not Guilty\u2019 of the crime charged in Count 2 of the indictment, [it] must then determine whether the Defendant is guilty or not guilty of the lesser-included offense[,] of bank robbery <em>without </em>using a dangerous weapon or device and putting in [sic] someone\u2019s life in jeopardy.\u201d The court further clarified that the lesser included offense was the same \u201cexcept that the crime was committed without putting someone\u2019s life in jeopardy by using a dangerous weapon or device.\u201d Reading the verdict form in conjunction with the jury instructions, we conclude that the distinction between armed bank robbery and the lesser included offense of bank robbery was adequately explained to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">In sum, the error on the verdict form did not affect Mr. Porter\u2019s substantial rights or call into question the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. We, therefore, affirm Mr. Porter\u2019s conviction for bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">Mr. Porter also argues that the district court abused its discretion when it sentenced him to 210 months for bank robbery, because it erred in calculating the Sentencing G\u00fcidelines and because the sentence was unreasonable in light of the circumstances. Specifically, Mr. Porter asserts that the district court erred in calculating the Guideline range by adding a 6-level enhancement for use of a firearm during the commission of the bank robbery and failed to take into consideration or give due weight to the changes he made in his life and good behavior in the years since his conviction. Mr. Porter contends that the sentence imposed by the district court violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set out in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). We disagree with all of these arguments. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2008). Claims of procedural and substantive unreasonableness are reviewed under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>United States v. Overstreet, </em>713 F.3d 627, 636 (11th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1323. We review for both procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 1323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the sentencing court, for example, fails to consider the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), considers the Sentencing Guidelines mandatory, fails to properly calculate the appropriate guideline range, or fails to adequately explain the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1323. Here, the district court, at the sentencing hearing, explicitly discussed \u00a7 3553(a) factors, recognized the Sentencing Guidelines were only advisory, and adequately explained the sentence. Furthermore, if there was any error in calculating the appropriate guideline range, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">With respect to substantive unreasonableness, we cannot reverse a district court\u2019s sentence, under this standard, simply because we would have imposed a different sentence. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). Our review is limited to whether the sentence imposed by the district court is within the range of reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Mr. Porter argues the district court erred in applying \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) of the Sentencing Guidelines, which adds six levels to a defendant\u2019s offense level if, during a robbery, \u201ca firearm is otherwise used.\u201d If the jury convicted him of violating \u00a7 2113(a) and found him not guilty of violating \u00a7 2113(d), Mr. Porter argues that the district court erred in applying the 6-level offense enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) for use of a firearm because the jury made no finding that Mr. Porter knew or should have reasonably foreseen that a co-defendant would carry a firearm during the robbery. Mr. Porter specifically relies on the fact that the jury found him not guilty of using a \u201cdangerous weapon or device\u201d while committing bank robbery, and cites to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), which held that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum sentence for a crime must be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">We need not decide whether the district court erred in adding a 6-level enhancement for use of a firearm. The district court specifically stated at the sentencing hearing that the offense level of 32 was derived from \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender guideline. And that means that any error with respect to the 6-level enhancement was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact under the Sentencing Guidelines for clear error and the application of the Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278, 1280-81 (11th Cir.1999). The presentence report initially set Mr. Porter\u2019s offense level at 31, including a 6-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) based on a co-conspirator\u2019s use of a firearm. However, because Mr. Porter was a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 and the offense carried a maximum 20-year sentence his offense level was 32. When the offense level for a career offender is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) provides that the career offender offense level is the level applied. Based on an offense level of 32 and a criminal history category of VI, the advisory imprisonment range under the Sentencing Guidelines for Mr. Porter was between 210 and 240 months. Assuming Mr. Porter is correct, and the 6-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>level enhancement for use of a firearm was improperly applied, the error was harmless, as it did not affect Mr. Porter\u2019s ultimate guideline range or sentence, because the career offender offense level was applied. We, therefore, find the district court\u2019s sentence proeedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Mr. Porter next argues that the sentence was substantively unreasonable, because the district court failed to give due weight and consideration to \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which include the nature and circumstances of the offense, deterrence, reform, and protecting the public from further crimes. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>934 F.2d 1237, 1238 (11th Cir.1991). The weight the district court gives to any \u00a7 3553(a) factor, however, \u201cis a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). We will only reverse if the district court committed a clear error in weighing \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cby arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonableness].\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do not find that to be the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The district court carefully considered Mr. Porter\u2019s mitigating evidence and weighed it against other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court listened to.evidence regarding how Mr. Porter had changed his life and ultimately weighed the seriousness of the offense, respect for the law, deterrence, the testimony of Mr. Porter\u2019s family and pastor, and the good deeds Mr. Porter had performed since the offense. The district court then considered whether the advisory guideline range of 210 to 240 months in custody was reasonable. Balancing \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court determined that 210 months was a reasonable sentence and sufficient to satisfy these factors. We cannot second-guess the weight the district court gave to each factor, <em>Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743, and find the sentence imposed by the district court to have been substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">We affirm Mr. Porter\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\">. Given our disposition on this issue, we need not decide whether Mr. Porter invited the error he now complains of.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
