While Grant indicated his intent to appeal the dismissal of Dan Gannon as well, he makes no arguments as to this defendant and has abandoned review of his claims against Gannon. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 28(a)(8)(A); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-20\">Grant argues that a strip search conducted while he was in the prison library was unreasonable and that the defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity. Grant further argues that the district court should have extended his deadline to file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and given him 10 days of notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) before entering final judgment. Grant also moves for a stay of the appeal and remand to the district court so that an affidavit from Warden John Rupert can be included in the summary judgment record.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-21\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same standard as that employed by the district court. <em>Carnaby v. City of Houston, </em>636 F.3d 183, 187 (5th Cir.2011). When determining if a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, we evaluate \u201c(1) whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a clearly established constitutional right; and (2) if so, whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was objectively unreasonable in the light of the clearly established law at the time of the incident.\u201d <em>Stidham v. Tex. Comm\u2019n on Private Sec., </em>418 F.3d 486, 490 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Great deference is owed to a prison official\u2019s determination that an action is reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Elliott v. Lynn, </em>38 F.3d 188, 191 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-22\">The defendants\u2019 conduct was not objectively unreasonable in light of the clearly established law at the time of the search. <em>See McCreary v. Richardson, </em>738 F.3d 651, 657 (5th Cir.2013); <em>see also Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 558-59, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Accordingly, the district court did not err by concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Grant\u2019s argument that the district court was required to give him 10 days of notice before entering final judgment is without merit. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. In any case, Grant had ample notice and opportunity to respond to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Finally, there is no reason to remand the case. Although the Rupert affidavit was not in the record, the district court accepted as true Grant\u2019s statement of what the Rupert affidavit contained \u2014 that there was no record of a unit-wide shakedown\u2014 and nevertheless concluded that it did not alter the outcome. For the same reason, the district court\u2019s denial of any further extension of the deadline to file objections to the report and recommendation was not an abuse of discretion. See <em>Geiserman v. MacDonald, </em>893 F.2d 787, 793 (5th Cir. 1990). The district court likewise did not abuse its discretion by denying Grant\u2019s Rule 59 motions. See <em>St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Fair Grounds Corp., </em>123 F.3d 336, 339 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The motion to stay the appeal and remand is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
