Salley, a federal inmate proceeding pro se, appeals from the District Court\u2019s order dismissing a motion for relief pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). For the reasons set forth below, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">In April 2002, Salley filed a counseled amended complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging, among other claims, that he was denied medical attention in violation of the Eighth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties agreed to proceed before a Magistrate Judge who granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants related to Salley\u2019s claim that he was denied medical attention and a wheelchair, for injuries he had suffered to his head, neck, and spine, which left him unable to walk. In his memorandum, the Magistrate Judge thoroughly outlined the defendants\u2019 evidence, including reports and testimony from numerous medical examinations, showing that Salley was not injured. <em>Salley v. PA Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>No. 99-cv-0606, slip op. at 39-49 (M.D.Pa. April 11, 2003). The Magistrate Judge also noted that Salley had failed to offer any evidence to cast doubt on the defendants\u2019 medical expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 47-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">Following a two-day jury trial on claims not related to Salley\u2019s current motion, the Magistrate Judge entered judgment on June 8, 2003. Salley raised numerous claims on appeal, including a challenge to the grant of summary judgment relating to his claimed denial of medical attention and a wheelchair. We affirmed, noting that the defendants had \u201cpresented reports documenting [Salley\u2019s] numerous exams,\u201d while Salley had \u201cnot' produced any medical evidence to counter\u201d the defendants\u2019 evidence. <em>Salley v. PA Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>181 Fed.Appx. 258, 265 (3d Cir.2006) (not prec-edential).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\">On September 20, 2013, more than ten years after the Magistrate Judge entered final judgment, Salley filed a \u201cMotion for Relief From Judgment and Request For a New Trial\u201d pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Salley states that on May 1, 2013, he received medical rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ords from SCI-Houtzdale that support his position regarding his medical condition and his inability to walk. In his motion, Salley argues that \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d prohibited him from \u201cpresenting [this] factual medical evidence\u201d at trial. Salley claims that this medical evidence would rebut the finding by the trial court that Salley had failed to present medical evidence to counter the defendants\u2019 expert medical testimony. Salley further argues that his trial counsel had failed to obtain this medical evidence and had abandoned him on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The District Court construed Salley\u2019s filing as a motion for relief from final judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), and dismissed it as untimely. Salley timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the denial of relief under Federal Rule' of Civil Procedure 60(b), with the exception of claims raised under 60(b)(4), for abuse of discretion. <em>Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, </em>536 F.3d 244, 251 (3d Cir.2008). We may summarily affirm the decision of the District Court if no substantial question is presented on appeal. <em>See </em>L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">We agree with the District Court that Salley\u2019s September 20, 2013 filing is a Rule 60(b) motion seeking relief from the final judgment issued on June 8, 2003, and not a new 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. Salley\u2019s argument regarding his newly acquired medical records is properly brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(2), which permits a court to relieve a party from final judgment when the party offers \u201cnewly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial.\u201d A motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(2) \u201cmust be made ... no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1). Salley filed his motion more than a decade after final judgment in this matter; his motion is, therefore, untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">Nor can Salley find relief under Rule 60(b)(6) by claiming that \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exist requiring the District Court to consider the medical evidence he now offers. We have previously held that Rule 60(b)(6) cannot be used \u201cas a means by which the time limitations of 60(b)(l-3) may be circumvented.\u201d <em>Stradley v. Cortez, </em>518 F.2d 488, 493 (3d Cir. 1975). Moreover, Rule 60(c)(1) requires that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion must be filed \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d <em>Moolenaar v. Gov\u2019t of V.I., </em>822 F.2d 1342, 1348 (3d Cir. 1987) (holding that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion filed \u201calmost two years\u201d after the final judgment was not within a reasonable time). Salley filed his motion on September 20, 2013, more than ten.years after the final judgment entered on June 8, 2003, and, despite referring to \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d fails to offer any explanation for this ten year delay. Accordingly, inasmuch as Salley seeks relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6), the motion was not filed \u201c\u25a0within a reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">Because we find that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Rule 60(b) motion, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b85-14\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-15\">. Salley\u2019s amended complaint raised many claims, including multiple Eighth Amendment claims, unrelated to the motion now before us. We will briefly outline the procedural history only as it relates to Salley\u2019s current Rule 60(b) motion, limited to the Eighth Amendment claim stemming from the denial of medical treatment for injuries to his head, neck, and spine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-19\">. Salley\u2019s motion was docketed as a new complaint, and the case was given a new docket number, under which this case now proceeds. In a report and recommendation, the Magistrate Judge interpreted Salley\u2019s motion as raising a new 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim. However, the District Court reviewed Salley\u2019s filing and concluded that it was a motion seeking Rule 60(b) relief from the final judgment issued in the matter at Doc No. 9900606.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
