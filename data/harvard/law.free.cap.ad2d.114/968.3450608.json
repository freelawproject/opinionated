Complainant testified that she viewed defendant at close range for 35 minutes in good lighting conditions and that she was able to positively identify him in a lineup. The jury was not bound to accept the testimony of defendant and his alibi witnesses. We have considered defendant\u2019s other contentions and find them to be either unpreserved or without merit. Mollen, P. J., Thompson, Brown and Lawrence, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
