A complaint alleging negligence and medical malpractice was served on the hospital and treating physician in or about November 1982. Defendants pleaded, among other things, the affirmative defense of the Statute of Limitations, alleging the pleadings and examinations before trial established the gravamen of plaintiffs claim was assault and battery. Plaintiff moved, <em>inter alia, </em>to dismiss the affirmative defense, contending that the complaint limited itself to negligence and malpractice causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The record reveals a question of fact as to whether defendants could be found guilty of assault or malpractice. Therefore, it was error to dismiss the defense of the Statute of Limitations <em>(see, Santangelo v Parke Davis &amp; Co., </em>77 AD2d 566; <em>Francisco v Maniglia, </em>57 AD2d 807). Mangano, J. P., Gibbons, Thompson and Kunzeman, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
