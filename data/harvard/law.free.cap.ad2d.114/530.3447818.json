Application granted, and order entered May 8, 1985 vacated. Based upon our review of the petition, we are of the opinion that it is not patently frivolous or without some merit. Accordingly, the matter is remitted to Special Term for the issuance of an order to show cause authorizing commencement of a proceeding by such service as Special Term deems appropriate (see, <em>Matter of King v Gregorie, </em>90 AD2d 922, <em>Iv dismissed </em>58 NY2d 822). Main, J. P., Casey, Weiss, Mikoll and Yesawich, Jr., JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
