To preserve such a claim for appellate review on a direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, a defendant must move to set aside his plea prior to imposition of sentence, pursuant to CPL 220.60 (3).</p><p id=\"b954-8\">In the absence of unusual circumstances, not here present, we see no reason to exercise our authority to review an unpreserved claim in the interest of justice. As to defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentences, he has received the minimum legally permissible sentences with respect to the three felony counts <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [b]; [4] [b]) and there is no reason to disturb the concurrent sentences imposed with respect to the two misdemeanor counts. Mollen, P. J., Lazer, Weinstein and Rubin, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
