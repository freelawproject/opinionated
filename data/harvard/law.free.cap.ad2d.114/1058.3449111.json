[Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AoRC\">\u2014 In an action to recover the balance allegedly due for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies provided to alleged Medicaid eligibles under the New York City Medical Assistance Program, defendant appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Lerner, J.), dated November 18, 1983, which denied (1) its motion for (a) a preclusion order and (b) summary judgment and (2) its motion to vacate plaintiff's notice to produce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">Order modified by (1) granting that branch of defendant\u2019s motion which was for an order prohibiting plaintiff from adducing evidence concerning the matters set forth in defendant\u2019s demand for a bill of particulars dated February 4, 1980, unless plaintiff serves a bill of particulars responsive to said demand, (2) adding to the provision denying that branch of defendant\u2019s motion which was for summary judgment, a provision that such denial is without prejudice to renewal in the event that plaintiff neglects or fails to timely serve its bill of particulars, and (3) granting defendant\u2019s motion to vacate plaintiff\u2019s notice to produce. As so modified, order affirmed, with costs to defendant. Plaintiff\u2019s time within which to serve its bill of particulars is extended until 60 days after service upon it of a copy of the order to be made hereon, with notice of entry. Said extension of time is granted peremptorily against plaintiff; no further extensions will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">Trial Term denied defendant\u2019s preclusion motion on the ground that it was untimely. Plaintiff made no motion to vacate or modify defendant\u2019s demand, but failed to supply a bill of particulars. CPLR 3042 (c) provides that in the event that a party fails to furnish a bill of particulars he may be precluded from giving evidence at the trial of the items of which particulars have not been delivered. There is no time limit under CPLR 3042 (c), unlike the 10-day limit specified in CPLR 3042 (d) for a motion to preclude where a defective bill of particulars had been served. Therefore, defendant\u2019s motion, although made over three years after it served its demand for a bill of particulars, should have been granted conditionally <em>(see, e.g., Theocharidis v Weber Stores, </em>100 Misc 2d 364), upon plaintiff\u2019s failure to serve a proper bill as directed herein. Accordingly, that branch of defendant\u2019s motion which was for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>summary judgment must be denied, without prejudice to renewal in the event that plaintiff fails to timely serve its bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-4\">To be sufficient, a notice to produce must \u201cfairly [apprise] the other party as to what papers or documents are required and in all other respects [afford] a reasonable opportunity for compliance with its demands\u201d (21 NY Jur, Evidence, \u00a7 241; <em>see also, </em>Richardson, Evidence \u00a7 595 [Prince 10th ed]). Plaintiff\u2019s request for \"all records\u201d, \u201call paid checks\u201d, \"[a]ll correspondence\u201d, and \"all requests for payment\u201d is not specific enough to afford defendant a reasonable opportunity to comply with the demand <em>(see, e.g., Haroian v Nusbaum, </em>84 AD2d 532; <em>Ganin v Janow, </em>86 AD2d 857) and is, therefore, vacated.
