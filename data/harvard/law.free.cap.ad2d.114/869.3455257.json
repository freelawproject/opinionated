Mangano, J. P., Gibbons, Thompson and Kunzeman, JJ., concur.</p>\n<opinion><p id=\"AyQL\">\u2014Appeal by defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Delury, J.), rendered June 10, 1982, convicting him of robbery in the first degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.</p><p id=\"b915-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p><p id=\"b915-9\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the evidence adduced at trial established his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It is settled that on appeal, we must view the facts most favorably to the People who prevailed <em>(People v Malizia, </em>62 NY2d 755, 757, <em>cert denied </em>\u2014 US \u2014, 105 S Ct 327), and assume that the jury credited the prosecution witnesses and gave the prosecution\u2019s evidence the full weight that might reasonably be accorded it <em>(People v Bigelow, </em>106 AD2d 448). Further, on review of a criminal conviction where there is any evidence of guilt, the question of reasonable doubt should generally be left to the jury and the verdict left undisturbed unless clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>against the weight of the evidence <em>(People v Bigelow, supra, </em>at p 449).</p><p id=\"b916-3\">Viewed in this light, the evidence is clearly sufficient to support the verdict. The victim observed the defendant a number of times prior to his arrest and unequivocally identified him at trial. The accuracy of an eyewitness identification presents an issue of fact for jury resolution <em>(People v Dukes, </em>97 AD2d 445). The alleged inconsistencies in the eyewitness testimony were fully explored and we find no basis to disturb the jury\u2019s resolution of the issues <em>(see, People v Gruttola, </em>43 NY2d 116, 122; <em>People v Joyiens, </em>39 NY2d 197, 203).</p><p id=\"b916-4\">Although there was testimony by the police that bolstered the complainant\u2019s identification, it was not objected to and is not preserved for appellate review as a matter of law. Moreover, it appears that its use by defendant on cross-examination may have been part of a trial strategy to attack complainant\u2019s credibility as to identification.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
