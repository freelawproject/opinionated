The only payment made after that date was $242, which were paid out of the proceeds of the second loan. The total payinents were inadequate to the liquidation of both loans.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-15\">The following are the provisions of the charter relating to the points involved in the specifications of error :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-16\">\u201c Article <em>II. </em>\u2014 Stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-17\"><em>\u201cSection </em>1.

On the trial the defendant offered to prove the amount paid on the eight shares of stock, which was allowed by the court under exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-9\">The plaintiff requested the court to instruct the jury,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-10\">1. That all payments made on the four shares of stock not borrowed on, are merely payments on collaterals and not payments on account of the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-11\">2. That the second assignment of the stock not being expressed to be subject to the first assignment, entitles the said assignee to exhaust the entire eight shares in the payment of the second loan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-12\"><em>3. </em>If the defendant can claim to have payments on his stock credited as payment of the first bond, it is only the payments on the four shares actually borrowed on at the first loan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-13\">4. That the amount of the second bond ($400 with interest from October 8th 1859) must be first taken out of the amounts shown to have been paid in by defendant on his eight shares, the balance only with the payments of interest can be applied to the first bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-14\">The court below charged as follows: \u2014 \u201cI have been requested by plaintiffs to charge you upon certain points which they submitted. I decline to affirm them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-15\">\u201cAs there is no evidence of appropriation by either party, but there was a special pledge of the stock to the payment of the first bond, before the second bond was given, the payments are to be applied to the payment of the first bond in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>place, and until it is paid principal and interest;\u201d which was the error assigned, after a verdict and judgment for defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-5\"><em>Amos Briggs </em>and <em>James </em>Lynd, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3C0\">The plaintiffs\u2019 objection to the defendant\u2019s offer \u201cto prove the payments made on account of stock transferred as collateral security\u201d should have been sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-6\">The general doctrine is that payments on account of a collateral security are not payments on account of the debt: Lord <em>v. </em>Ocean Bank, 8 Harris 386; Kittera\u2019s Estate, 5 Id. 424.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-7\">It is said that the plaintiffs are a building association, and that, under the decisions of the Supreme Court, the payments- on account of the stock borrowed on are payments on account of the loan. The condition of the bond, as well as the amount of the loan, shows that but four shares were borrowed on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-8\">This court has never held that payments on account of stock not borrowed upon, though belonging to the borrower, are payments on account of a loan based upon other stock actually borrowed upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-9\">The four shares of stock not borrowed upon were certainly subject to the ordinary doctrine of collaterals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-10\">But it is said that the payments were made to the plaintiffs themselves. Bid that alter the absolute title to or ownership of the stock ? The second assignment is not subject to the first\u2014 it places anew the entire eight shares of stock in the control of the plaintiffs to secure the new loan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-11\">Is it consistent with equity or good faith that defendant should wrest this stock from them, and applying all its proceeds to the first debt, leave the latter one unpaid ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-12\">This second assignment even estops him from applying the payments, made on account of the four shares actually borrowed upon at the first loan, to the liquidation thereof, until after this second loan is paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-13\">Payments on account of stock borrowed on may be set off against the loan at the debtor\u2019s option \u2014 they are not <em>ipso facto </em>payments: Building Association <em>v. </em>Sutton, 11 Casey 463. And if the debtor has made any arrangement inconsistent with such option, he is clearly estopped from the exercise of it: Kelly <em>v. </em>The Building Association, 3 Wright 153; Schober <em>v. </em>Building Association, 11 Casey 223.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-14\">By the second assignment, plaintiffs acquired a new and distinct possession of the stock, and defendant could not demand it for any purpose whatever, without paying the second bond: Kittera\u2019s Estate, 5 Harris 424. The learned judge entirely ignored the second assignment, which, we think, supersedes the first, at least until the second debt is fully paid. Should this not be its effect, it certainly operates to enable us to apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>doctrine of appropriation to the payments that were made after the date of the second loan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-5\">Our first debt was secured by judgment \u2014 our second was unsecured. If the payments on account of the eight shares of stock are to be treated as payments on account of the loans made on them, then \u201cin the absence of any appropriation by the parties, the law appropriates the payments to the less secured debt Watt <em>v. </em>Hoch, 1 Casey 411; Schuylkill County <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 12 Id. 534; Johnson\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wright 268.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-6\"><em>Edward S. Campbell, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap7\">The contract, in this case, having been made pi\u2019ior to the Act of 12th April 1859, is to be governed by the law as it stood at that time, and the amount of the payments by defendant to plaintiff being amply sufficient to pay the first bond with interest and costs,-and a part of the second, discharges the first bond entirely. Because, at the time defendant received the first loan, he made a special pledge of \u201c all his (my) eight shares of the stock of the association as collateral security for the loan;\u201d and this was the only security given, for that judgment was not obtained on the bond by entry of the warrant of attorney annexed, until nearly six months afterwards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-7\">So far from payments on account of a collateral security not being payments on account of the debt, the law is just the reverse: Mann <em>v. </em>McDonald, 10 Watts 273; Kupfert <em>v. </em>Building Association, 2 Casey 465; Hughes\u2019s Appeal, Id. 471.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-8\">The eases cited by plaintiff in error in 8 Harris 386, and 5 Id. 424, do not touch this point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-9\">The fact is undoubted that all the eight shares of stock were assigned by the first assignment. Plaintiffs were not required to give up the stock or to reassign it, but only to place payments made on account of the stock <em>pro tanto, </em>to the liquidation of the first bond. They are still to retain the stock, applying the payment beyond the amount of the first bond to the liquidation of the second. Defendant, in addition to the second assignment, did not specially acknowledge, after giving of the second bond, that the payments made on the stqck were not on account of the first bond, as in 3 Wright 153. Nor was there here an assignment of the stock absolutely away to the third party for a debt foreign to the purposes of a building association, as in 11 Casey 232.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-10\">All the stock was specially pledged for the first bond without reservation, and the second assignment being between the same parties for a further loan, and on the same security as the first, was necessarily subject thereto. There being no evidence whatever to show any appropriation of the payment on the stock, the rule of law is that the debt first contracted must be the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>paid: Speck <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 3 W. &amp; S. 328; Berghaus <em>v. </em>Alter, 9 Watts 394; Pierce <em>v. </em>Sweet, 9 Casey 157.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b238-3\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b238-4\">Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad3\">The first bond, dated May 8th, 1858, was conditioned for the payment of $800, with interest, in one year from its date, and also for the payment of four dollar monthly instalments upon four shares held by Moore in the capital stock of the association. On the'4th of June 1858, less than a month after the bond was given, the debtor assigned to the company as collateral security for the loan, these four shares of stock together with four others which he then held. There had at that time been paid upon them about $440, the monthly instalments from June 1st, 1854, when the certificate was issued to him. Of course the assignment of the stock as collateral, was not a discharge of the loan to the extent of the instalments paid. The declaration that it was given as collateral negatives this. Besides, no part of the bond, either principal or interest, was then payable. It is true, the debtor might have appropriated the sum of the instalments paid to the discharge of the debt, but he did not. On the contrary, when on the 8fch of Oct. 1859, he borrowed from the plaintiffs an additional sum of $400, and made another assignment of the same stock as collateral security for the repayment of the second loan, he elected not to treat the first assignment as a partial payment of the first bond, and pledged the stock as a living security for the payment of the second. It is true, that without the consent of the company he could not pledge it for the payment of a second debt, until that for which it was first pledged had been paid. But when the company assented, as they did, by receiving it as a collateral for the security of the second loan, he had no longer any right to insist that it should be applied to the discharge of the first. It is to be remembered that neither assignment amounted in itself to a payment of the debt for which it was pledged as security; 11 Casey 468. The same thing has been ruled this winter in Loan Association <em>v. </em>Saving Fund. The case, then, is this : the debtor made no application of the instalments paid on the stock when he assigned it .as a security for the first loan. He made none afterwards, and before the second loan was made. By the second assignment he disabled himself from insisting that the payment should be applied to the reduction of the first bond, and put in the power of the creditors to use the stock for the satisfaction of either debt at their option. It is not, therefore, to be treated as a payment made by a debtor owing two debts, of which neither he nor the creditor has made any application, and which the law will therefore apply. It was in reliance on the second assignment that the second loan was made. If the debtor may now destroy the value of the security by insisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>that the instalments paid shall go to the discharge of the first debt, he is enabled to work a fraud. Had he, on the 16th of October 1859, assigned the stock to any other than the plaintiffs, he could not claim a credit for its value upon the first debt. This was ruled in Shober <em>v. </em>The Accommodation Saving Fund and Building Association, 11 Casey 223, and the reason is that the assignment would have been another appropriation. The supposed case does not differ in principle from the present. It follows that the court erred in directing the jury to apply the payments made on the stock to the discharge of the first bond. Against the consent of the creditor such an application can be made only to the extent of what may remain after the second bond is paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-7\">Woodward, C.
