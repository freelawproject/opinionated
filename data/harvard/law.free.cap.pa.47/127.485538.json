Young, on a judgment against Abner Lewis and Orvis Lewis, which had been entered up against them on a judgment dated March 1st 1859, for $120, payable one year after date, without defalcation or stay of execution, in which the $300 exemption was waived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-15\">The attachment was duly served on Henry Conklin as garnishee of Abner Lewis, and as to defendant was returned \u201cnot found.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-16\">C.

In the case in hand, as in that, a stay of execution was expressly waived. Without the waiver the parties signing the note would have been entitled to a stay on the judgment entered on the note of six months. We held in the case cited that the <em>proviso </em>to the first section of the act allowing a stay in favour of a soldier, notwithstanding a waiver, was unconstitutional, as impairing the obligation of the contract. The case is directly in point, and rules this one. The stay ordered was wrong, and the order must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The order of the Court of Common Pleas of Wayne county, entered in the above-entitled suit, made on the 2d of February 1863, is reversed and set aside, at the costs of the defendant in error, with leave to the plaintiff to proceed with his execution attachment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-10\">Agnew, J., was absent at Nisi Prius when this case was argued.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
