His complaint, in the light of accompanying affidavits, comes only to this: The Director of Personnel notified appellant that unless he resigned within three days, the Department would bring certain charges against him proposing his dismissal, and these charges might lead to fine or imprisonment. The Director told appellant he could resign on any ground he chose and his resignation would be accepted. He was \u201cfrightened and upset\u201d. He therefore resigned \u201cTo enter private Industry.\u201d He tried, and was not allowed, to withdraw his resignation. He describes the Director\u2019s statement as \u201cthreats and duress\u201d and says he was \u201cfalsely accused\u201d. But he does not allege that the Director knew or believed that the proposed charges were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">The Director did not act illegally or improperly in telling appellant he could choose between facing charges and resigning. We agree with the District Court that the appellee was entitled to summary judgment. Competello v. Jones, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 412, 267 F.2d 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
